                         (The late Mr M A Maphalala)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I  move  without
notice.


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and profound  sadness  the  untimely  death  of  the
       honourable Magwaza Alfred Maphalala, who passed away  on  5  February
       2003;


  (2) recognises that Magwaza Maphalala was a South  African  patriot  who,
       throughout  his  life,  demonstrated  profound  commitment   to   the
       liberation of the people of our country and the continent of Africa;


  (3) remembers the honourable Maphalala as one of  the  stalwarts  of  our
       people's  struggle  for  a  nonracial,  nonsexist,  democratic  South
       Africa;


  (4) recalls that he played an active and leading role in the  development
       of trade unionism in South Africa, from the  days  of  Sactu  to  the
       formation of Cosatu and that he was also  an  active  member  of  the
       South African Communist Party;


  (5) acknowledges the dynamic contribution that the  honourable  Maphalala
       made to this House since his deployment to this Parliament  in  1999,
       during which time he served as the ANC Constituency Whip;


  (6) believes  that  he  leaves  a  legacy  that  epitomises  heroism  and
       dedicated service and that his untimely death has robbed South Africa
       of a great son who still had a tremendous contribution to make to the
       reconstruction and development of our nation; and


  (7) expresses its condolences to the entire Maphalala family.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Deputy Speaker, it is my sad duty, on behalf of the DP,  to
support the motion of condolence moved by the hon Chief Whip.  I  know  that
our late colleague, the hon Magwaza Maphalala, was a popular and  well-liked
member of the House.

My colleague and fellow Whip, the hon D K Maluleke, served with him  on  the
Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and Land Affairs. He speaks of  him  with
affection as someone  who  was  a  good  man,  a  good  friend  and  a  good
politician. We express our sincere condolences to his loved ones, to all  of
his friends, and to his party colleagues in the ANC. He will be missed.

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Deputy Speaker, I stand to support the motion  of  the
Chief Whip of the Majority  Party.  On  behalf  of  the  president  and  the
members of the IFP, I extend our sincere condolences  to  the  ANC,  family,
loved ones, friends and colleagues of the late hon Magwaza Maphalala.

Those of us fortunate to have got to know him  will  agree  that  he  was  a
gentleman of high intelligence, always friendly and with  a  keen  sense  of
humour. It was a privilege to  have  known  this  man.  He  was  recently  a
student in economics and proved to be one of the brightest students there.

His death has come as a shock to us all, although we knew last year that  he
was suffering and battling with  uncontrollable  diabetes.  The  family  and
loved ones are in our prayers. May God give them strength to bear  the  pain
and loss of their loved one. May his soul rest  in  peace.  We  will  always
remember him.
Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, on behalf  of  the  New  NP,  I  would  like  to
support the motion of condolence by the Chief Whip of the Majority Party  as
it appears on the Order Paper.

I had the good fortune of meeting the late Magwaza Maphalala  shortly  after
my arrival in Parliament. He came  across  as  a  very  warm,  friendly  and
humble person.

He was born on 6 April, the day Jan Van Riebeeck arrived at  the  Cape,  and
in 1948 - in the year that the old National Party came to power. It is  very
significant that he spent his entire life undoing the legacy of  colonialism
and apartheid. He sacrificed his life  at  the  altar  of  workers'  rights.
Selflessly, he fought for the freedom of all South Africans.  Never  did  he
utter a word of bitterness about  his  past  experiences  nor  did  he  ever
demand material  reward  for  his  contributions.  He  humbled  himself  and
fulfilled the mission for which he sacrificed the most productive  stage  of
his life.

We offer our heartfelt sympathy to his family, friends and the  organisation
he served so loyally, the ANC.

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, we in these benches wish to  associate  ourselves
with the motion before the House. An Eastern poet and mystic once  said:  It
is not important how long a person lives. It is not important what  material
wealth he has. It is not  important  how  many  children  he  has.  What  is
extremely important is how  the  person  lived.  That  is  how  we  want  to
remember our departed colleague. He was an amiable  and  jovial  person  who
made friends very easily. He was a person in whom one could confide. He  was
a good listener and he was a person who was prepared to advise.

During our service on  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs, he was one of those people that would come out in his  amiable  way
and settle whatever problems we had in that committee. We  will  truly  miss
him. We wish his family, his friends and all his associates Godspeed in  the
days that lie ahead, and may God Almighty make it easy  for  his  family  in
these trying times.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, the ACDP recognises the important  contribution
that the hon Mr Maphalala made to this House and to the aims and  objectives
of his party.

The death of a loved one always comes to us as a shock. It is  never  really
accepted. We in  this  House  will  always  and  forever  miss  the  hon  Mr
Maphalala. We recognise his worthy contribution towards our  Parliament  and
to the community at large.

The ACDP would like to offer its sincere condolences to the wife and  family
of the late ANC MP, the late  hon  Mr  Alfred  Maphalala,  who  passed  away
recently. May he rest in peace and may God be with his family.

Dr C P MULDER: Agb mev die Adjunkspeaker, dit is my taak om  namens  die  VF
ons opregte meelewing te betuig, en ons steun  te  gee  vir  die  mosie  van
roubeklag met die afsterwe van 'n kollega van ons in hierdie Raad,  die  agb
lid mnr Magwaza Maphalala. Ons het hom nie baie lank geken nie. Hy  was  nie
baie lank in hierdie Raad nie,  hoewel  hy  baie  jare  gedien  het  in  die
organisasie wat hom na hierdie plek toe gestuur het.

Ons wil ons graag ten volle assosieer met die mosie van roubeklag.  Ons  wil
graag ons simpatie en meelewing uitspreek  teenoor  sy  familie.  Mag  hulle
vertroosting en berusting vind in sy dood. Ook simpatie aan die ANC wat  een
van hulle staatmakers verloor het. Ons eer sy gedagtenis.Â   (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker, it is my duty, on  behalf  of  the
FF, to convey our sincere sympathy and to give our support to the motion  of
condolence upon the passing away of a colleague of ours  in  this  Assembly,
the hon member Mr Magwaza Maphalala. We did not know him for very  long.  He
had not been in this Assembly for too long, although he did serve  for  many
years in the organisation that sent him to this place.

We would like to identify ourselves fully with this  motion  of  condolence.
We would like to express our condolences and sympathy with his  family.  May
they find consolation and come to terms with his  death.  Sympathy  also  to
the ANC, who have lost one of their stalwarts. We honour his memory.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the UCDP I wish to  express
our sincere condolences to the family and close friends of the late  hon  MP
Maphalala. Our hearts and minds are with you at this moment of  bereavement.
It is in times like these, when we mourn the passing away  of  a  member  of
the parliamentary family, that we are challenged to pause  and  think  about
their contributions towards the  transformation  of  our  country,  and  the
difference that they have made to the lives of ordinary South Africans.

It is sad indeed to lose such a valuable member of the community at  a  time
when his wisdom and leadership skills are much needed, particularly  in  the
portfolio committee on which he served.

We are, therefore, challenged by his untimely departure  to  continue  where
he left off. This is a commitment that  we  can  only  match  by  dedicating
ourselves to a just programme of action to eradicate poverty  and  create  a
just environment for all South Africans to live in harmony, irrespective  of
colour or political orientation.

Robala ka kagiso morwa Maphalala. Golo o go ileng ke tsela ya botlhe.  [Rest
in peace, son of Maphalala. Where you gone to is the road for everybody.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The hon Mogoba. He is not here. Will  someone  from  the
PAC speak? No? All right.

Mr J P I BLANCHÃ: Madam Speaker, I am speaking on behalf of the FA.

Ek wil die Hoofsweep van die Meerderheidsparty se mosie van roubeklag  steun
namens die FA, en ons  innige  meegevoel  uitspreek  met  die  afsterwe  van
kollega Magwaza. Die FA wil ook aan sy familie en vriende, en veral  aan  sy
kollegas, ons meegevoel oordra.

Dit is jammer dat 'n  mens  dikwels  na  hierdie  podium  toe  moet  kom  om
meegevoel te betuig na die heengaan van 'n lid soos Mnr  Magwaza.  Ons  voel
saam met u, en ons dra u in ons gebede. Ons wil dan ook die  hoop  uitspreek
dat sy familie en sy vriende sal troos vind in sy  nagedagtenis.  Ons  steun
hulle daarin. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[On behalf of the FA, I would like  to  support  the  motion  of  condolence
moved by the Chief Whip of  the  Majority  Party  and  express  our  sincere
sympathy at the death of colleague Magwaza. We in the FA would also like  to
convey our condolences to his family and friends, and  particularly  to  his
colleagues.

It is a  pity  that  one  often  has  to  come  to  this  podium  to  convey
condolences after the passing of a member such as Mr Magwaza. We  sympathise
with you, you are in our prayers. We would also like  to  express  the  hope
that his family and friends will find comfort  in  his  memory.  We  support
them.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the  MF  also  associates  itself  with  the
motion moved by the Chief Whip. Each time I have to pay my respects  at  the
loss of a member or colleague, it brings tears to my eyes. Though hard  work
and contribution deserve praise, this House suffers  the  loss  of  a  great
contributor  to  its  success.  The  country  loses  a  representative   who
committed his days to the betterment of this nation, and  there  are  family
and friends that suffer an even greater loss.

I  knew  and  worked  with  the  late  hon  Magwaza  Alfred  Maphalala   for
approximately 25 years, dating back as early as my trade union days. It  has
always been a pleasure taking on the battlefield of the world by his side.

I pray that the late Maphalala rests in peace. I pray that we all may  learn
from his determination and dedication, so that his efforts may  continue  to
deliver through his spirit.

I take this opportunity on behalf of the MF to  convey  our  condolences  to
the family, friends and dear ones of the deceased. May God  fill  his  heart
with contentment. Hon Comrade Maphalala, you have been an  inspiration.  May
you rest in peace.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Adjunkspeaker, namens die AEB, ook  ons  innige  meegevoel
aan die naasbestaandes van die agb Maphalala wat ons ontslaap  het.  Dit  is
altyd hartseer dat 'n nuwe skof van die Parlement moet begin met mosies  van
meegevoel. 'n Mens is dankbaar dat 'n mens hier kan wees in  volle  krag  en
gesondheid, maar dan dink 'n mens aan hulle wat in hierdie tyd ons  ontslaap
het.

Ek het die agb Maphalala nie so goed geken nie, maar uit  navraag  blyk  dit
dat hy 'n geliefde kollega  was,  en  dat  hy  sy  lewe  gewy  het  aan  die
verbetering van die lot van sy eie mense.

Aan sy familie en sy nabye kollegas: ons innige meegevoel.  Mag  elkeen  van
ons deur 'n gebeurtenis soos hierdie ook weer opgeroep word om die  tyd  uit
te koop in die wete dat ons hier geleende  tyd  het  waaroor  ons  ook  moet
rekenskap gee.

Die AEB steun die mosie van meegevoel en dank. Sterkte aan die  familie  van
die agb Maphalala. Baie dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the AEB, we would  also  like
to express our deepest sympathy to the family of the hon Maphalala, who  has
departed this life. It is always sad that a new shift of  Parliament  should
start with motions of condolence. One is thankful that one can  be  here  in
full strength and health, but then one thinks of those who have passed  away
during this time.

I did not know the hon Maphalala that well, but from enquiry it  seems  that
he was a loved colleague and that he dedicated his life  to  the  betterment
of the destiny of his own people. To his family and his closest  colleagues:
our deepest sympathy. May this occurrence remind every one  of  us  to  make
the most of every opportunity  in  the  knowledge  that  our  time  here  is
borrowed, for which we will also be accountable.
The AEB supports the motion  of  condolence  and  thanks.  Strength  to  the
family of the hon Maphalala. Thank you very much.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, on behalf of Azapo  we  wish  to  convey
our deepest-felt condolences to the ANC and Comrade Maphalala's  family  and
relatives.

Azapo joins all those who knew Comrade Maphalala as a trade unionist  and  a
dedicated cadre in the liberation struggle, in  celebrating  his  life  that
was dedicated to our people's permanent development. It  is  at  times  like
this that we are able to remember the good work that  Comrade  Maphalala  is
leaving behind.

May his soul rest in peace.

[Mr R S NDOU: Madam Speaker, I would also  want  to  support  the  statement
made by the Chief Whip in connection with the death of the warrior,  Magwaza
Maphalala. Maphalala dedicated all his life to fighting for freedom in  this
country.

I knew him for 30 years. I worked with him in the unions and on other  tasks
of the ANC in this country while he was fighting  for  freedom.  Truly,  our
souls are hurt, but this will never be to such an extent that we would  fail
to pick up his spear and carry  on  fighting  for  freedom.  The  fight  for
freedom is not over yet. It is still going on because  the  damage  done  by
the  apartheid  government  is  still  there.  We  must  continue  with  the
struggle, following in Maphalala's footsteps.

Maphalala was a leader of the NFW Union while I was  a  leader  of  the  GAU
Union. In this country our unions  were  known  for  associating  themselves
with people in the struggle for liberation. I was listening  to  the  people
expressing their condolences. We are begging the family to try by all  means
to cope with what has happened.

We as the ANC, when something like this happens to warriors like  Maphalala,
the freedom fighter, take it as a way of influencing  us  to  progress  with
the task of making sure that everything we fought for  reaches  the  people.
Maphalala was a freedom fighter. Yesterday his wife  narrated  a  very  nice
story to those who went there. She spoke about what Maphalala had wanted  to
do, because he never turned his back on being a member of the South  African
Communist Party and started hiding behind the trees. He kept on saying  that
he was a member of the South African Communist Party and that he would  keep
on fighting in order to bring the Government to the  people.  This  is  what
Maphalala wanted.

We must be prepared to follow in his footsteps,  because  that  was  a  very
good thing to do. I am not saying that you must join  his  party,  but  that
his dedication, heart and soul were with the  people,  even  though  he  was
poor. He fought for freedom until his death. What I  am  trying  to  say  is
that we, as South Africans, must pick up his  spear  and  continue  fighting
for freedom in order to accomplish everything we  have  fought  for  because
the fight has just begun. We have not yet reached our destination.

Now is the time for us to follow on the path which Maphalala paved  for  us.
Let us walk on that path to  freedom,  because  if  we  don't,  we  will  be
shaming him. It is not a good thing for us to change because  of  our  money
to such an extent that we are no longer what we used to  be  in  the  1960s,
1980s or 1990s. Let us follow the same path as Maphalala did  while  he  was
still  alive.  He  was  a  dedicated  person.  To  him,  development   meant
developing the nation. Let us do the same and work with love and  dedication
in order to accomplish all Maphalala dedicated his life to.

The President of this country has indicated that we  should  fight  poverty,
hunger and everything that bothers our people. Now  is  the  time  to  fight
poverty in all possible ways and develop our country  in  a  more  dignified
manner. Poverty is our main enemy. As the ANC, we want development.

Young man, why are you interrupting me  while  I  am  still  talking?  [Time
expired.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired, hon member.

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to, all members standing.

                             PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy  President  and
hon members, the ANC continues to exercise its  passion  and  commitment  to
part the curtain, to shift and ultimately remove the invisible  shadow  that
has been created and sometimes falls between people. The  ANC  continues  to
fight the indifference that sometimes surfaces to create  an  attitude  that
ignores the presence of other people. The ANC seeks to bring amongst us  the
passion of caring about each other's plight.

It should therefore  not  be  surprising  that  the  ANC  has  been  in  the
frontline with those who have adopted the sober position cautioning  against
a war that would, in the  end,  destroy  families  and  men  and  produce  a
population of orphans and widows of those who survive the war. The  numerous
anti-war marches by peace-loving citizens in  the  world  have  demonstrated
that we have peace-loving  people  who  want  the  United  Nations  and  all
relevant players to explore all possible means  of  resolving  the  conflict
between the USA and Iraq. The marches that took place this  weekend  are  an
echo of a resounding ``No''  to  war  against  Iraq  and  an  insistence  on
dismantling whatever weapons of mass destruction Iraq may have.

It is to the benefit of humanity that we all  avoid  getting  caught  up  in
status and the desire to conquer the  vulnerable  amongst  us  and,  in  the
process, lose sight of everything else. We  must  begin  to  see  things  in
their totality and then, maybe, the priorities will change  for  the  better
because, in war, there are no unwounded soldiers, especially when  you  hear
the story of an American Vietnam veteran who witnessed  a  Vietnamese  woman
being forced to choose between her child and a piglet. She chose the  piglet
and dropped her child in the stream to be allowed  to  jump  onto  the  boat
that was ferrying escaping locals to safety across the stream. The  ANC  and
the rest of peace-loving citizens in the world have  joined  the  march  for
peace.

We are a new democracy confronted by the ravages of poverty  and  want  and,
as a committed Government led by the ANC, we have put  into  place  policies
and programmes guided by the determination and preparedness to  redress  the
inequalities of the past and bring about transformation and  change  in  our
country. This challenging demand requires peace and stability for us  to  be
able to proceed with the mandate of changing the  quality  of  life  of  our
people.

The  Government  has  made  strides  in  policies  such  as  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development  Strategy  and  the  Urban  Renewal  Programme
aimed at reducing and  eradicating  poverty  in  a  systematic  and  focused
manner  -  planned,  implemented,  co-ordinated  and  integrated  under  the
auspices of the cluster programmes. Therefore, I am happy to inform the  hon
members that progress has been made in this respect,  in  that  in  all  the
urban and rural nodes, implementation has taken off, even though it  may  be
in an  uneven  manner,  as  a  result  of  the  different  local  capacities
available.

Thirteen  planning  and  implementation  management  support  centres   with
professional and administrative staff and institutional capacity to  support
the work in the nodes are progressing. But I  must  hastily  add  that  this
does not mean that we have resolved our  problems  of  lack  of  appropriate
skills needed to carry out the programmes, as development expands and  grows
under the pressure of an economy which is  beginning  to  require  different
and advanced skills to cope  with  high  quality  productivity  that  is  so
essential in keeping us in the trade markets.

To address this complex problem, Government has intervened  by  promoting  a
Skills Development Programme in the nodes for  a  start,  to  also  help  us
consolidate  the  Independent   Development   Plans   and   the   Provincial
Development Strategies, to ensure that the  nodal  programmes  are  in  sync
with the regular provincial programmes. We are  learning  and  refining  our
approach  to  and  understanding  of  the  developmental  environment  which
continues to reveal to us the depth of underdevelopment  we  inherited  when
we moved into office.

Anchor projects in the nodes have  been  identified  and  developed  on  the
basis of the Independent Development  Plans,  formulated  to  structure  the
development patterns. The importance of organising our work in an  effective
way in the nodes requires that all role-players co-ordinate, co-operate  and
align their work in a manner that  enhances  the  alignment  of  budgets  to
achieve maximum benefit on both a short and long-term basis.

The infrastructure backlog in our society is enormous, and where it  exists,
it is at different levels of decay and dilapidation. To  change  this  state
of affairs,  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  are  crucial  because
Government on its own will not be able to carry the burden of reviving  this
infrastructure.  This  is  but  one  area  of  need   which   is   receiving
Government's attention, including the  need  to  produce  more  project  and
programme managers who will assist us in accelerating the delivery pace  and
ensuring  that  there  is  adequate  implementation  of  our  people-centred
programmes. It is therefore going to be critical that community  development
workers  are  mobilised  to  complement  the  work  of   municipal   council
structures. This will also help in extending the capacity  of  planning  and
implementation management support centres. The local  levels  of  Government
with the democratic participation of such  workers  becomes  a  prerequisite
for the effective management of development,  especially  of  infrastructure
management.

Many of our communities, through  the  Urban  Renewal  Programme  and  Rural
Development  Programme,  are  beginning  to  benefit  from   programmes   of
rehabilitation and revitalisation of our settlements. Alexandra provides  us
with an excellent example of a community that  has  started  to  engage  and
participate in its development  and  planning  programmes  for  an  improved
environment. A partnership has emerged between the residents and  the  local
authorities where community-based development processes are contributing  to
better co-operation in cleaning  the  area,  creating  centres  that  are  a
foundation for tourist attraction, archiving the  history  of  this  vibrant
place,  constructing  houses  for  rental  and   ownership   purposes,   and
depopulating the communities to create space and manageable infrastructure.

The debanking and cleaning of the Jukskei River has brought  back  a  breath
of clean, healthy air without the polluted stench that used to remind us  of
the negligence experienced by the community that has been there  for  years.
Our aim is to replicate the success  of  our  strategies  to  other  similar
nodes requiring similar approaches. An  amount  of  R2,1  billion  has  been
allocated for the provision of basic  services,  roads  and  transportation,
construction of dams, water connections, electrical substations and  network
upgrading to support the local economic programmes aimed  at  creating  jobs
in those localities.

Programmes funded and monitored by the Department of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs have initiated agriculture and food production  projects,  and  seed
packets have been distributed to empower the  poor  in  producing  food  for
themselves. Local business centres and commercial  outlets  will  assist  in
ensuring that people in those localities have access to goods and  services.
The Department of Local Government is  ensuring  that  the  distribution  of
powers  and  functions  between  the  different   spheres   of   government,
especially districts and  local  councils,  is  streamlined  to  effect  the
implementation of programmes. The comprehensive  health  care  package,  for
example, established by the Department of  Health  will  receive  sufficient
attention where the  relevant  structures,  including  local  councils,  are
capacitated to absorb and optimise delivery in this respect.

In our rural and urban nodes we are promoting  development  in  its  various
modes, including on issues of crime prevention, pension payout systems  that
are being upgraded and improved, and sport and culture,  as  well  as  small
and medium enterprise  ventures  and  small-scale  farming  that  is  taking
place. The Kgalagadi rural node - bordering the North West and the  Northern
Cape, is also  registering  advances  in  terms  of  projects  initiated  to
promote development. This node has in it potential hubs of growth  that  are
gradually being tapped through detailed assessment of by-products  that  can
be extracted from our  Dipudi  [Goat]  project.  Government  will  make  the
necessary  announcement  as  soon  as  plans  have  been  completed.  It  is
important  to  realise  that  each  node  will  prioritise  its   programmes
according to need.

Programmes in the nodes are also linked to  Government's  policies  of  land
redistribution and  land  restitution,  including  the  secure  land  rights
related to human settlements.

To date Government has awarded 1,8554 million land claims  through  the  two
programmes managed by the Department of Agriculture and  Land  Affairs.  The
restitution programme is also linked to economic projects  that  provide  an
opportunity for communities to engage  in  productive  agriculture,  with  a
potential not only to expand to economies of  scale,  but  also  to  enhance
food security.

Secure tenure for households is also implemented through  the  provision  of
housing to the poor. The UN Habitat agency identified South Africa, two  and
a half years ago, as host of the launch of the Global  Campaign  for  Secure
Tenure. This was recognition and support for the enormous progress  made  by
the country in this regard. A total of 8 million people  now  have  shelter,
legally confirmed through title deeds issued to recipients  of  our  housing
subsidies. This is an indication of  Government's  commitment  to  its  land
redistribution policy, which is progressing in an  orderly,  systematic  and
responsible manner.
Other forms of tenure are also being promoted through  the  various  housing
programmes to accommodate the varied  needs  of  different  households.  The
programme on agri-villages and co-operative housing is also  under  way.  To
date, Government has constructed 1,45 million homes using  affordable  forms
of tenure to house the poor.

Development in the North has not ignored the need  for  the  enhancement  of
municipal institutional capacity that can begin to increase the  ability  of
these institutions to generate  revenue-enhancement  programmes  that  would
extend the local revenue  base  critical  for  the  smooth  running  of  the
municipalities. Households are linked to their municipalities.  Development,
therefore,   rests   specifically   in   the   integrated    approach    and
synchronisation of Government's projects. Local  government  programmes  are
proceeding relatively well, and as local government continues to  stabilise,
prospects of sustaining work done in this area will also increase.

The Government's commitment to fighting HIV/Aids remains as  stated  in  the
Cabinet statement of 17 April and as elaborated in  the  National  Strategic
Plan for HIV/Aids, TB and Sexually Transmitted Diseases.  We  remain  firmly
committed to strengthening our prevention programmes,  treatment,  care  and
support as well as the elimination of stigmatisation of  both  the  affected
and the infected. There is also ongoing research  undertaken  by  Government
to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  all  aspects  of   the   cause   and
manifestation of HIV/Aids in the South African socioeconomic environment.

It is in this context that we continue to invest  significant  resources  in
our public prevention programmes and in strengthening and consolidating  the
treatment programmes for  sexually  transmitted  infections,  including  the
further enhancement of the life-skills  programme  as  a  component  of  the
school curriculum. All these efforts are made along with a variety of  other
initiatives that include the increase of Government's  contribution  to  the
South African Vaccine Initiative of R20Â million allocated per year, and  the
publishing of guidelines for the treatment of opportunistic  infections  for
immediate implementation.

This approach is firmly  anchored  on  a  clear  understanding  that  whilst
HIV/Aids  can  affect  everyone,  it  strikes  with  greater  ferocity   and
virulence among those with limited coping  capabilities  as  a  consequence,
particularly,  of  the  poverty  that  afflicts  so  many  in  our  country.
Consequently, we have continuously reiterated the  fact  that  the  epidemic
requires a comprehensive approach in order for us to  succeed.  It  is  with
this understanding that we also focus, amongst other things, on the role  of
good  nutrition,  and  we  therefore  support  the  research  that  includes
supplements and immune modulators as part of a comprehensive strategy.

There is no doubt that Government is committed to broadening  the  scope  of
interventions available to all  our  people  for  all  illnesses,  including
HIV/Aids. The reality,  however,  is  that  Government  is  limited  in  its
efforts by competing challenges and needs in the health  sector  itself  and
in other related areas of need, which have to be addressed to enable  us  to
achieve comprehensive success in our  endeavour  to  reduce  the  impact  of
illnesses and poverty in our midst.

Therefore, Government reaffirms its commitment to complying  with  the  High
Court decision and  is  currently  working  towards  ensuring  that  trained
personnel and  the  use  of  the  optimal  combination  of  drugs,  adequate
infrastructure for monitoring, good patient compliance and  the  ability  of
the public health system to limit the emergence of resistant strains of  the
virus  are  matters  that  are  given  attention  and  must  be  taken  into
consideration as we proceed and try to posture because we  are  looking  for
votes in the upcoming elections.

There is no doubt, therefore, that the people out there realise  that  there
has been a progressive improvement in their lives  since  the  inception  of
democracy 10 years ago.

I take this opportunity to thank this  House,  particularly  our  President,
who has led us  in  the  struggle  against  poverty  and  by  insisting  and
ensuring that we do focus on those issues that matter. But, for the  members
on the left hand side of the House, at this critical moment when  the  world
is faced with inconsistencies that threaten human lives,  it  is  time  that
they ... [Interjections] ... began to think, not about their benefits  as  a
small group in our society, but about what would happen in the  world  if  a
war erupted, which is  supported  by  members  of  this  House.  Ladies  and
gentlemen, I thank you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, Mr President, Mr  Deputy
President, members of Parliament, all of us in this  Chamber  are  witnesses
to mass death. We are watching one of the most extraordinary  calamities  in
human history - the wiping out of millions of people,  in  peacetime,  by  a
known cause that has a known treatment.

This is a crisis. And it  calls  for  drastic  action.  South  Africa  needs
radical and fundamental change.

The question has been put to us: What is the state of the nation?

The truth is that we must distinguish  between  two  nations.  Not  a  black
nation and a white nation - as has sometimes been said - but rather, we  are
faced with the South African dream on the one hand, and  the  South  African
reality on the other.

We described that South African dream nearly 10 years ago,  at  the  dawning
of democracy. We spoke of a new society, free of  racism  and  exploitation.
We declared that every human  being  had  the  same  equal  and  inalienable
rights, including the right to the basic necessities of life.

But the South African reality is that, for millions of our fellow  citizens,
life is no better now than it was in 1994. For  many  people,  in  spite  of
political freedom, life is actually worse.

I say this, not because I am negative. I am not. I believe fervently in  the
South African dream. I am optimistic about the South  Africa  that  we  can,
and must build together. [Interjections.]

But I cannot, in  good  conscience,  come  before  this  House  today  as  a
representative of the people of South Africa and turn my face away from  the
truth that I see and hear every day outside this Chamber, where  the  people
of our land actually live and die.

We must change things. And we can, if we act now.

We must begin with the obvious. Our response to  the  HIV/Aids  tragedy  has
been one long denial. Our war in this country has been fought in  the  wards
of the Chris Hani-Baragwanath, not on the streets of  Baghdad.  Hundreds  of
thousands of South Africans are dying of HIV/Aids every year  -  up  to  one
million by the end of 2003 - according to Government's own statistics.

But we are not defenceless. We  can  stop  mother-to-child  transmission  of
HIV. We can treat the people with free antiretroviral  medicines.  Only  one
thing holds us back: a paralysing lack of political courage. We must  change
our approach. And we can.

When we held our first democratic elections,  we  committed  our  nation  to
peace. But because of crime, we are still at war - with ourselves.  In  just
10 years, murder in South Africa has  claimed  close  to  200  000  victims.
These victims were not soldiers. They were civilians -  at  home,  on  their
way to work, or coming back from school.

In the last 10 years, 1 200 farmers have been murdered in our  rural  areas.
And, in the last three years, more than 18 000 active police  officers  have
actually left the SA Police  Service.  In  the  Northern  Cape,  where  Baby
Tshepang was raped, 90% of the  child  protection  officers  have  not  been
trained.

Hoe kan ons oor veiligheid op die plase en  platteland  ernstig  wees,  maar
dan  die  kommandos  wil  afskaf?  Dit  is   die   oudste   instelling   vir
gemeenskapveiligheid in Suid-Afrika, en miskien in die wÃªreld. [How  can  we
be serious about safety on farms and in the rural areas,  but  then  abolish
the commandos? This is the oldest  community  safety  institution  in  South
Africa, and perhaps the world.]

We are told that crime is high, but that it has ``stabilised.''

That is not good enough. South Africa cannot allow the  abnormal  to  become
normal.

We can do more to protect our children and to fight crime. We can declare  a
zero tolerance policy. We can devote  and  direct,  on  an  absolutely  pin-
pointed basis, far more resources to the police, to the justice  system  and
to the prisons. We can support community policing and put more  officers  on
the streets and on the farms.

We must change the fear and the danger. And we can.

On the surface, our economy is  climbing  gently.  But  underneath,  we  are
living through the South African equivalent of  the  Great  Depression.  One
out of every three South Africans is unemployed - seven million  people  are
out of work. Black unemployment has risen from 46% in 1995 to 55% in 2001.

South Africa does have sound economic fundamentals, but without the  economy
to go along with them.  Our  nation's  policies  are  pro-market  but  anti-
growth, pro-labour but anti-poor.

Armoede ken geen kleur nie. In Danville in Pretoria loop  jong  matrikulante
in die strate rond omdat hulle hoop verloor het. Party  van  hul  broers  en
susters gaan dae lank sonder 'n behoorlike maaltyd. Hulle het net 'n  ekstra
bord kos as vrywilligers soos Oom  Isak  Swart  dit  vir  hulle  organiseer.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Poverty knows no colour. In Danville in  Pretoria  young  matriculants  are
walking the streets because they have lost hope. Some of their brothers  and
sisters go without a proper meal for days. They only have an extra plate  of
food when it is organised for them by volunteers like Uncle Isak Swart.]

There is talk of increased welfare spending. Of  course,  that  is  welcome.
But millions of poor people are living in misery  while  billions  of  rands
roll over unspent. Already, two-thirds of the existing child support  grants
go unclaimed.

The new ones that have been announced are age-restricted, and so they  treat
poor people over the age of fourteen as if they do not exist.  The  fact  is
that our 10 million fellow citizens who fall into  the  poverty  gap  cannot
lift themselves up without the introduction of a basic income grant.

The state has an important  role  to  play  in  the  economy  -  but  not  a
smothering role. It is not an overwhelming role. It is an  indicative  role.
And growth summits generate paper,  but  not  jobs.  And  new  bureaucracies
don't add up to better delivery. The state can't deliver as well  if  it  is
busy retrenching experienced civil servants just  because  they  are  white.
And it is true, on the subject of white and black, that  the  South  African
economy is no longer whites-only. But it is still members-only.  Instead  of
giving new opportunities to the poor, empowerment as we have experienced  it
so far merely shuffles wealth from one small group  of  privileged  insiders
to another.

Yet we can boost our economic growth. We can  roll  back  the  stiff  labour
laws that this Parliament alone has passed in the last 10 years,  and  which
discourage investment. We can relax exchange controls and we  can  far  more
rapidly privatise state industries. We can reverse the ``brain  drain''  and
encourage skilled workers to come to South Africa and keep our skills  where
they belong, which is at home. We  can  fight  for  market  access  in  rich
countries. We can expand the winner's circle so that empowerment  works  for
the many, not the few. We must change our economy. And we can.

When apartheid fell, we declared that our new foreign policy would be  based
on a commitment to human rights and democracy around the world. But we  have
allowed human rights abuses to continue for three long  years  in  Zimbabwe.
In Iraq, we have criticised the warlike stance of the United States, but  we
have said nothing about the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein.
The irony is that where we have the least reach, in places  like  Iraq,  our
voice is the loudest. And where we  have  direct  leverage  and  access,  in
places like Zimbabwe, we are silent. We like to think that we are  champions
of multilateralism. We had a lecture a few minutes ago  on  the  virtues  of
consistency. But our position is inconsistent. We did not  object  when  the
United States acted unilaterally to save the Muslims of Kosovo - nor  should
we have objected. We invaded Lesotho in 1997  without  a  mandate  from  the
United Nations or its Security Council. [Interjections.]

Today we are destroying multilateralism by embracing Robert Mugabe  and  his
henchmen,  even  as  he  threatens  to  divide  that  most  multilateral  of
institutions, the Commonwealth, and  remove  it  from  its  values.  We  are
destroying  multilateralism  by  closing  ranks   around   Saddam   Hussein,
clutching his bloodied hand even as he defies the  United  Nations.  Because
when you strip away all  the  rhetoric  and  all  the  trips,  the  onus  is
actually on Iraq to comply with the will of the world, not on the  world  to
send more weapon inspectors.

Robert Mugabe and Saddam  Hussein  hate  democracy  and  love  power.  South
Africans, on the other hand, believe in freedom and  cherish  human  rights.
If we compromise our principles, we are throwing  away  the  very  dream  we
established 10 or nine years ago.

But we can once again make our ideals and our interests the bedrock  of  our
foreign policy. We can make human rights and democracy  our  focus.  We  can
help our African neighbours practise good governance.  We  can  protect  our
national interests by standing with the paragons of the world, not with  the
pariahs.

We must change our role in the world, and we can. It is time South  Africans
made a radical change. What we as  a  nation  must  do  is  something  South
Africa has not done - not before  1994  or  since.  We  must  focus  on  the
welfare of the individual human Â  being - not a  particular  race  of  human
beings or a class of human beings or even the masses in whose name  some  of
us purport to speak. No, we must focus on the woman,  the  man,  the  child,
each created uniquely in  the  image  of  God.  Of  course,  we  are  social
creatures. Each of us lives in a community.

Ons moet dus aandring op gemeenskappe se reg op 'n munisipale polisie en  om
die kommandostelsel te behou, om hul eie skole te bestuur en beskerming  van
hul eie tale. [Therefore we must insist upon the  right  of  communities  to
have municipal police and to retain the commando  system,  to  manage  their
own schools and to protect their own languages.]

But, we cannot thrive  as  a  whole  until  each  of  us  is  strong  as  an
individual. We cannot move ahead as a nation if we leave one person  behind.
Warriors do not abandon their wounded. The Samaritan did not pass by on  the
other  side  of  the  suffering.  ``Remember  the  individual'',  said   the
Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, ``and then  the  larger
aims will seem neither distant nor impossible''. And so we  must  make  sure
each and every day that every South African will  have  access  to  a  basic
income grant; each will have  access  to  life-saving  medicines;  each  and
every woman and child will be saved  from  abuse;  each  and  every  learner
should be at a registered school with books and a desk; and each  and  every
individual must have a chance to be the best  they  will  be  and  they  can
become, regardless of race. We must provide opportunity for each  and  every
South African, and we can.
We must spend less on arms to fight imaginary wars and much more  on  police
to fight violent crime. We need to spend less on private jets and much  more
on public transport so that fathers and mothers can go to work and  back  in
safety. [Applause.] We need to invest less in programmes and more in  people
like Mrs Vicky Ntozini who is in the gallery today. Mrs Ntozini lives  in  a
shack in a squatter camp  in  Khayelitsha.  [Interjections.]  She  saw  that
tourism had began to boom in Cape Town, and  decided  to  start  a  bed  and
breakfast right there in the midst of  Khayelitsha.  What  she  did  was  to
teach herself the computer, get access to the Internet and start a  business
without any assistance, and without  a  single  cent  from  the  Government.
[Applause.]

We have to encourage others to follow Mrs Ntozini's example  and  to  become
entrepreneurs. We need to structure our laws and our economy  to  help  them
and, when individuals take initiatives, we need to reward  them  with  extra
training and with financial support where it is indicated at the  individual
level, not in the bureaucracy.

And so, we return to the question: What is the  state  of  the  nation?  The
nation is strong. The state is the problem. [Applause.] To fix it,  we  must
do whatever it takes. It is not a question of a  bit  of  deregulation  over
here and a dash of redeployment over there and  a  wad  of  money  somewhere
else. We cannot talk of the B to Y of our country if we leave out the  A  to
Z of Aids and  Zimbabwe,  because  what  we  require  is  to  embrace  bold,
fundamental, and transcending changes, and we can.

We are a rainbow nation, not a monochrome  nation.  We  all  belong  here  -
every culture, every community, every individual. Our  new  Constitution  is
our nation's covenant. It must remain our foundation and our  guiding  star,
and any attempt to unravel that covenant must be opposed.  And  so  we  will
continue to reach out to our partners in the ranks of  the  real  opposition
so that we can strengthen the  democratic  alternative  and  the  democratic
centre in South Africa. Hence, our partnership for good governance with  the
Inkatha Freedom Party, locally and provincially, in KwaZulu-Natal.  On  that
foundation we must and we will build.

Opposition parties were recently  described  as  historic  relics,  but,  in
truth, opposition is the future of South Africa. [Interjections.]  Once  the
winds  of  change  brought  freedom  from  colonialism  across   our   great
continent. Today, the winds of change in Africa are  bringing  freedom  from
corrupt one-party states. In Senegal, in  Ghana  and  in  Kenya,  opposition
parties have come to power through the ballot box. It  would  have  happened
in Zambia, in Zimbabwe too, if the elections there had been free  and  fair.
[Interjections.] And one day the winds of change will  sweep  through  South
Africa again ... [Interjections] ... and  the  Democratic  Alliance  insists
and believes that the future of South Africa depends on  the  fate  of  each
and every South African. That is the true expression of  the  South  African
dream, and each of us working together from where we are with what we  have,
and with what we can contribute, can make that  dream  a  reality.  We  must
change South Africa, and we can. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the
President,  His  Excellency  the  Deputy  President,  hon  leaders  of   all
political parties present in this Assembly, hon members,  in  his  state  of
the nation address, the President has portrayed a picture  of  South  Africa
which is promising and reassuring. Undoubtedly, enormous progress  has  been
achieved in a multiplicity  of  fields  and  endeavours  undertaken  by  our
Government.

Our Government has performed well across the board on many  line  functions.
Delivery has increased. This year, we are doing better than  last  year  and
are set to see next year improving on today's results.  Therefore  there  is
much call for satisfaction and comfort.

However, at times such as  this,  one  has  to  step  back  from  one's  own
achievements and focus  on  the  home  conflicts  and  difficulties  in  our
immediate backyard, rather than reaching out for distant  places,  and  take
stock of where the country is and where it is going in the medium  and  long
term.

We have been working hard to produce positive results. Focused as we are  on
our job of governing the country, we can take pride in the  outcome  of  our
endeavours. Yet, we must question whether what has  been  achieved  is  good
enough, meets our own people's needs and demands, and those arising  out  of
our country's long-term interests.

I have a number of concerns which I voice to focus  attention  on  the  work
ahead which must now reach out for that proverbial extra mile. I am not  the
type of person who recriminates or gratuitously criticises  but  rather  the
type who seeks to motivate and stimulate progress in the right direction.  I
am concerned, and it is my duty to share my concerns with my colleagues  and
the South African nation.

My greatest concern is about employment generation.  Employment  levels  are
not rising even though our economy is doing better. This means  that  it  is
necessary for our economy to do even better and we should not  be  satisfied
with what has been achieved. For  many  years,  you  have  heard  me  making
drastic proposals in this Parliament, at this  podium,  to  foster  economic
growth beyond its present limits. Today, I do not wish to reiterate  what  I
have stated over and over again but merely to stress the need to muster  the
political  will  to  tackle  the  economy  with  much  greater  courage  and
determination.

Our Government has adopted stringent fiscal discipline which means that  the
state is  run  properly,  from  a  financial  viewpoint,  and  conducts  its
finances responsibly. However, that by itself has  not  been  sufficient  to
attract foreign investments and broaden  our  country's  economic  bases.  I
also expressed this concern last year, particularly as I said then  that  we
are lucky to have the best Minister of Finance  ever  whose  performance  is
internationally recognised. [Applause.]

We need to privatise, not  to  serve  political  agendas,  but  to  increase
market  efficiency.  We  need  to  ensure  that   deregulation   accompanies
privatisation and that all existing  monopolies  and  cartels  which  reduce
economic efficiency and create barriers to market entrance are  removed.  We
need to  make  massive  investments  in  emerging  technologies,  especially
biotechnology, to ensure that we have a  vision  of  what  ``Made  in  South
Africa'' may mean 5, 15 and 25 years down the road.

We need to decide now what our country will  be  known  to  produce  in  the
global village for the  next  decade,  make  investments  to  stimulate  and
support  relevant  industries  and  attract  foreign  investments  in  those
fields. We must also have the courage to introduce  maximum  flexibility  in
the  labour  market,  reduce  tax  burdens  and   increase   the   available
infrastructure. The formula is simple to spell out but how do  we  implement
it? I think that we must muster the political will to do it.

The President's speech dealt  at  great  length  with  the  major  issue  of
poverty and with the various ways  which  the  Government  is  employing  to
reduce the levels of poverty. I am also concerned about  the  rising  levels
of poverty. I have no doubt that there is much greater  poverty  today  than
there was in 1994. One of the elements which is not sufficiently  considered
in the equation employed to measure poverty is the rapid  disintegration  of
the subsistence economy which existed then. I see  this  problem  throughout
the rural areas of our country whether I am travelling in the Eastern  Cape,
Limpopo or KwaZulu-Natal.

I come from a rural area and I pride  myself  on  representing  the  unheard
voice of the rural people who are now becoming  the  poorest  of  the  poor.
Before 1994, people in our rural areas in South Africa  were  able  to  feed
themselves and their families every  day  because  of  the  existence  of  a
culture which prompted them to produce their own  food.  Before  1994,  many
were keen to promote subsistence agriculture. I, as Chief  Minister  of  the
erstwhile KwaZulu government, ensured that my government  did  its  best  to
allow every family to have food on the table every day.

We applaud the decision of the Government to extend the child support  grant
to the age of 14 years and the decision with regard to other social  grants.
But, as long as we are unable to feed ourselves, these,  plausible  as  they
are, will be no more than just palliatives. Malnutrition is  now  increasing
in rural areas. The progressive disintegration of  rural  areas  spells  the
downfall of urban areas and  economies  as  people  are  forced  to  migrate
towards cities where the local economies cannot accommodate them.  They  are
bound to join an ever-increasing army of the  urban  proletariat.  This  can
cause unforeseeable social evils and instability in our country.

We must focus greater attention on rural areas and make  it  a  priority  of
our Government to ensure that anyone can grow enough food  and  have  enough
livestock to be able to eat, at least twice a day, and to have the  benefits
of a balanced and healthy diet. Especially in the dark age  of  HIV/Aids,  a
healthy  diet  is  essential  to  support  our  ailing  population.  I   was
disappointed that our President did not mention  HIV/Aids  by  name  in  his
state  of  the  nation  address,  which  ought  to  be  our  main   concern.
[Interjections.] Every day, I cannot think of anything but HIV/Aids, and  my
conscience is torn to pieces because I know that we are not doing enough  to
deal with this issue. Our people are dying, not by  hundreds  or  thousands,
but by  tens  of  thousands.  Soon,  they  will  be  dying  by  hundreds  of
thousands.

As a Minister in Government, I know how much  our  Government  is  doing  to
face up to this pandemic. But, I think that we need to see it as one of  the
major challenges that we face. We need  to  go  that  extra  mile.  We  must
provide treatment for  our  HIV-infected  population  and  ensure  that  our
Government has the capacity to  utilise  international  donor  funding  made
available for this purpose. I do not know how to express  to  my  colleagues
my sense of horror and frustration in learning that  we,  as  a  Government,
might not have the capacity to spend money which is available  for  the  war
against Aids.

We must thank all international donors for  what  they  are  doing  to  help
South Africa and Africa, in fact, in its war  against  HIV/Aids.  A  special
word of gratitude should go to the President of the United States,  the  hon
George W Bush, who committed $1,5 billion to fight  HIV/Aids  in  Africa.  I
find it remarkable that while the United States is involved in the  type  of
conflicts and concerns now troubling it, it still finds time and takes  care
to make such an enormous amount of money available to the ailing  people  of
Africa. [Interjections.]

It is saddening for me that foreign countries may be  more  concerned  about
the war on HIV/Aids than  some  of  our  local  representatives,  especially
those who are murmuring as I am saying  these  things.  [Interjections.]  We
need to make more of our own money available for the  war  on  HIV/Aids  and
develop the capacity to spend it. It is beyond  my  comprehension  that  the
citizens of South Africa, including allies of the ruling party, should  have
to march against their own Government to request and  obtain  treatment  for
HIV/Aids, which is something that should be provided, in due  course,  as  a
function of governing and caring for people.

I am also concerned about another scourge which is killing  our  people  and
depriving them of their property, freedom and security across  the  country.
This is another enemy which is present and real and towards  which  we  need
to direct the necessary resources. The scourge of crime has not  been  cured
in spite of major improvements in the overall  system  of  policing  in  our
country. Improvement on the  side  of  safety  and  security  has  not  been
accompanied by equal and sufficient  improvement  in  the  criminal  justice
system. Too often, suspected perpetrators of crime are apprehended  but  not
tried and convicted. The criminal justice system has become  the  bottleneck
of our fight against crime. It becomes increasingly  necessary  for  one  to
look at radical reforms to give it a complete overhaul in  order  to  ensure
that it can rise up to the challenges confronting it.

I am not underestimating,  at  all,  the  efforts  that  we  are  making  as
Government. I speak  as  a  member  of  the  interministerial  committee  on
security which meets weekly and looks at the ways and means of measuring  up
to the scourge of crime in our country. However, also in  this  respect,  we
should make the political commitment to divert  more  resources  and  direct
them towards the police and judiciary.

We also need the resources to fight both sides of the equation of  crime  so
that we do not deal only with law enforcement but also  with  education.  We
need greater civic education in our schools and communities to  make  people
understand the importance of the rule of law and begin giving  substance  to
the notion of moral regeneration. The first values that  we  need  to  teach
and propagate are civic values and the importance of abiding by the rule  of
law. This requires the  communities  to  become  agents  of  propagation  of
legality and isolate those who become criminals. A culture  of  respect  for
human rights  and  dignity  must  finally  permeate  all  our  families  and
communities, and eradicate the scourges of child abuse and violence  against
women.

I am also concerned that too little has been done for  traditional  leaders.
The  President's  indication  that  matters  relating  to  the   traditional
leadership will be dealt with by means of provincial legislation  this  year
may be a grim omen, as it may exclude any  resolution  of  the  two  crucial
issues relating to traditional leadership, namely  local  government  powers
and the land administration powers of traditional authorities which are  not
provincial competencies.

One hopes that the President's words can be interpreted  as  a  promise,  at
least, that the national legislation will enable  provincial  laws  also  to
deal with these two fundamental aspects of traditional leadership which  are
the core of this issue. Otherwise, the entire exercise would be  futile  and
a further measure to avoid rather than solve the problem.

I am also concerned about how we understand  and  fulfil  our  international
responsibility. We cannot separate our commitment to freedom  and  democracy
at home from how we  conduct  ourselves  abroad.  We  should  also  be  more
concerned about our own backyard before assisting tyrants who blackmail  the
world with weapons of mass destruction to find a way  out  of  a  corner  in
which they have painted themselves. Within our continent, people  are  dying
of malnutrition and suffering under tyrannic regimes  which  have  destroyed
what should have been Africa's most prosperous  countries.  Across  our  own
borders, some people are cursing the name of South  Africa  because  of  our
failure to respond to their suffering and the systematic violation of  their
rights.

We must make it our responsibility  to  promote  and,  if  necessary,  force
democracy and freedom in our region, condemn without reservation  any  human
rights abuse and the breakdown of the rule of law and tyranny  taking  place
within our own boundaries. Silence and  inaction  are  complicity.  We  have
this obligation facing us even more at this time when our President  is  the
Chairman of the African Union. Expectations by Africa of  us  as  a  country
that is perceived to be leading  Africa  are  enormous.  Our  President  has
often  shared  many  times  with  us  in  the  Cabinet  how   enormous   the
expectations by Africa are of us.

The final concern that I want to raise, to  the  relief  of  those  who  are
murmuring, is that of corruption. There are different levels  of  corruption
and we must have the courage to look at all of them.  I  think  that  it  is
necessary that this year, in this House, we have a long, full  and  detailed
debate to discuss and understand what we all mean by black  empowerment.  We
must show the difference between black  empowerment  and  black  enrichment.
[Interjections.] We must ensure that black empowerment  does  not  become  a
generalised licence to skim off the top of the economic productive cycle  to
benefit a new class of parasitic rich people. Black  empowerment  should  be
about broadening the economic bases in order to bring into their fold  those
who were previously disadvantaged and marginalised.

Black  empowerment  should  be  about  strengthening  and  rewarding   black
entrepreneurship and should aim at enabling the  great  economic  potential,
ingenuity and industriousness of black people. Black empowerment should  not
be about funding political parties in a covert fashion, nor  about  creating
a new coalition of fat cats which feeds  off  existing  economic  structures
without producing new ones.

I  am  concerned  that  our  country  is  confronted  with  allegations   of
corruption and scandals which would rock any established democracy and  that
we are perceived as facing them with  indifference  and  complacency  as  if
corruption was to be expected from those in power.  Unless  corrected,  this
perceived complacency in the face of corruption will cause the  downfall  of
our new republic. We must ensure that each allegation  is  investigated  and
that a culture of bringing corruptor  and  corrupted  to  book  becomes  the
trademark of South Africa.

I have these and many other concerns. Over and  above  all  of  them,  I  am
concerned about the capacity and willingness of  this  House  to  deal  with
such concerns. I am now talking to  all  my  colleagues  and  all  political
leaders. We need to come together as people of goodwill and  representatives
of our people, irrespective of political divisions or allegiances.  We  need
to enhance our critical thinking and question ourselves. As we sit  in  this
House, not only as different parties but also as different members, we  need
to think as individuals and not as  herds  who  passively  follow  a  leader
unquestioningly. We need to continue  the  process  of  our  individual  and
collective liberation in that direction. We need to  ask  ourselves  whether
what has been achieved is indeed good enough. We need  to  question  whether
what we are doing is indeed good for South  Africa  and  for  the  long-term
interests of our children and grandchildren.

Some decisions might be emotionally rewarding and may  aptly  translate  the
way we feel about domestic problems or international issues  but  might  not
necessarily be what is in the best long-term interest  of  our  country  and
prosperity. They may also not be the real product of the  democratic  values
we have embraced. We need to  develop  the  type  of  leadership  which  can
tackle concerns with a long-term perspective  and  in  accordance  with  our
democratic values.

We fully support the leadership of  our  President  as  head  of  state  and
Government. I am, however, deeply convinced  that  collegially,  colleagues,
we can exercise this type of leadership. For this to be  achieved,  we  need
to have a greater measure of respect for one another and rely  more  on  our
collegial capacity to lead than on the leadership which any  individual  may
provide. I  say  this  with  all  due  respect  to  the  leadership  of  our
President.

I somehow feel that suspicions of the past amongst ourselves have not  quite
vanished, as you can see from the murmurs. To me, as long as our  steps  are
still dogged by vestiges  of  past  suspicions,  we  will  not  be  able  to
exercise the collegial capacity which is so crucial to  us  to  successfully
tackle the intractable problems that our country faces.

I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Speaker, it  is  indeed  an  honour  to  follow  the  hon
Minister of Home Affairs. He is a seasoned politician and he  too  made  his
mark on the long road to African unity.

The hon President reminds me of the prophet Jonah, in the good sense of  the
word. During a terrible storm at sea, he slept soundly below deck as  if  he
was in full control of what was happening  around  him.  And,  according  to
press reports, the hon President also slept soundly  when  his  private  jet
encountered technical problems on its maiden flight to Paris and thereby  he
also sent out the message that he was in full control of what was  happening
around him.

The perception of a president being in control was also  borne  out  in  the
state of the nation address, which augurs well  for  South  Africa.  By  the
way, unlike the official  opposition  on  my  left,  the  New  NP  does  not
begrudge the hon  President  the  use  of  a  private  jet.  In  times  when
terrorists fly passenger  planes  into  high-rise  buildings,  it  could  be
unwise for any head of state to use public transport. [Applause.]

The latest ANC conference was held, believe it  or  not,  in  the  DF  Malan
Memorial Hall at the University  of  Stellenbosch,  where  I  also  had  the
privilege of spending eight of the best years of my life.

Natuurlik het die mense skeef opgekyk toe die ANC  kongres  hou  in  die  DF
Malan-gedenksaal.  Malan  was  immers   die   argitek   van   apartheid   by
uitnemendheid.

Tog was dit ironies genoeg juis Dr Malan wat so vroeg  soos  1921  die  deur
oopgemaak het vir die soort van samewerking wat vandag  tussen  die  ANC  en
die Nuwe NP bestaan. Volgens die historikus Herman Giliomee  het  Dr  Malan,
in 'n poging om swart stemme te werf- glo jy dit -  in  sy  stryd  teen  die
Suid-Afrikaanse Party van genl. Smuts, 'n brief geskryf aan 'n  waarskynlike
tak van die ANC in die Oos-Kaap waarin hy sÃª: ``Swartmense is  'n  toonbeeld
van ware  patriotisme  en  is  daarom  geregtig  om  hulle  plek  langs  die
nasionalis in die nasionale politieke arena in te neem''.

Hoewel paternalisties gestel, en hoewel Dr Malan 27 jaar later self  daarvan
vergeet het, is dit nou presies wat gebeur 83 jaar later.  Die  ANC  en  die
Nuwe NP, politieke vyande van die verlede, het  besluit  om  in  belang  van
versoening en nasiebou, langs mekaar stelling in te neem  in  die  politieke
arena en nie teenoor mekaar nie. Terloops, nasiebou het 'n verdere  hupstoot
gekry  toe  die  foto-uitstalling  tydens  die  parlementsopening  ook   die
vryheidstryd  van  die  boererepublieke  weerspieÃ«l  het.   (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Of course the people looked askance when the ANC held a congress in the  DF
Malan Memorial Hall. After all, Malan had been the  architect  of  apartheid
par excellence.

Yet ironically enough, it was precisely Dr Malan who, as early as  in  1921,
had opened the door for the kind of co-operation which  exists  between  the
ANC and the New NP  today.  According  to  the  historian  Herman  Giliomee,
Malan, in an endeavour to canvass black votes - would you believe it?  -  in
his struggle against the South African Party of Gen Smuts,  wrote  a  letter
to an apparent branch of the ANC in the Eastern Cape in which he  said  that
blacks were  a  shining  example  of  true  patriotism  and  were  therefore
entitled to take their place  next  to  the  nationalists  in  the  national
political arena.

Although  paternalistically  stated,  and  although  Dr  Malan  himself  had
forgotten about it 27 years later, this is  exactly  what  has  happened  83
years later. The ANC and the New NP, political enemies  of  the  past,  have
decided, in the interests of reconciliation  and  nation-building,  to  take
their place next to each other in the political arena, and not against  each
other. Incidentally, nation-building  received  a  further  boost  when  the
photo exhibition  during  the  opening  of  Parliament  also  portrayed  the
struggle for freedom of the Boer republics.]

Challenging issues like poverty, unemployment and  HIV/Aids  could,  in  our
view, best be addressed through joint political ventures rather than  trying
to score political points. The New NP wants to  contribute  positively  from
the inside rather than shouting from the outside.

Allow me to share with you a New NP perspective  on  some  of  the  relevant
issues of the day. Regarding the Zimbabwean issue, I first want  to  clarify
a misunderstanding. We  don't  raise  the  Zimbabwean  issue  constantly  in
Parliament out of fear that that what  happened  to  commercial  farmers  in
Zimbabwe will also happen here. We are convinced that the Zimbabwean  events
won't spill over to South Africa. Why not? We have  a  government  committed
to  the  rule  of  law.  The  Land  Reform  Programme,  which   enjoys   the
wholehearted support of the New  NP,  is  well  on  track.  By  the  end  of
December last year, out of 67 300  claims,  36  279  had  been  settled.  We
concern  ourselves  with  Zimbabwe  because  the  people  of  Zimbabwe   are
increasingly becoming the victims of bad governance.  We  concern  ourselves
with Zimbabwe  because  the  huge  mismanagement  of  the  economy  has  the
potential to damage the development of the whole region to the detriment  of
the objectives of Nepad.

I have a special request for the  hon  President  regarding  South  African-
owned properties and investments in Zimbabwe. In a letter  to  the  New  NP,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs  indicated  that  the  protection  of  South
African-owned properties and investments in Zimbabwe could best be  achieved
within  the  context  of  a  bilateral  agreement  on  the   protection   of
investments between the governments of South Africa and Zimbabwe.

An HON MEMBER: Ek verstaan nie! [I do not understand!]

And  if  the  hon  President  could  use  his  influence  to  expedite   the
establishment of such an agreement, it will be highly appreciated.

The New NP shares the view of the hon President  that  the  USA  should  not
unilaterally attack Iraq. We believe that the weapon  inspectors  should  be
given more time to complete their work. [Applause.] According to Hans  Blix,
more weapons of mass destruction were destroyed  by  the  weapon  inspectors
under Resolution 687 of 1991 than were destroyed during  the  Gulf  War.  We
furthermore believe that a  unilateral  attack  on  Iraq  could  derail  the
Global Coalition on the War against Terrorism with devastating  consequences
for the free world. A unilateral attack on Iraq will  also  turn  a  villain
into a martyr, and we don't want that. We fully support the mission  of  our
technical team to Iraq as a committed effort by the  Government  to  prevent
war in the Middle East.

However, should the USA attack Iraq unilaterally, South Africa at all  costs
must not come out on the side of Iraq against the USA. South  Africa  should
rather follow the example of the guy on his deathbed. A priest told  him  to
repent and denounce the devil. The guy shook his head  and  said,  ``Father,
this is not an appropriate time to make enemies.'' [Laughter.] No,  this  is
not an appropriate time to make an enemy  of  the  only  superpower  in  the
world, because it could cost  us  dearly.  The  USA  is  the  third  largest
investor in South Africa. In terms of the USA Africa Growth and  Opportunity
Act, South Africa has already earned more than 1,7 billion  US  dollars  and
thousands of new jobs were created. All that I am saying  is  that  we  must
say ``hamba kahle'' [go well] when it comes to a  unilateral  US  attack  on
Iraq.
The theme of this year's opening  of  Parliament  was  ``The  long  road  to
African Unity''. As first Chair of the  African  Union,  the  hon  President
made his mark and played an enormous role in facilitating a peace  agreement
in the DRC. The envisaged Safety and Security Council of the AU will play  a
crucial  role  in  future  conflict  resolution  on  the   continent.   But,
regrettably, not a  single  member  state  has  yet  ratified  the  security
council's protocol. Hopefully, the hon President will use the  rest  of  his
term as chairperson to expedite the ratification process. The New  NP  fully
supports Nepad as Africa's own long-term agenda for economic growth.

The UN Millenium Summit resolved to have halved the number  of  the  world's
poor by 2015. Africa south  of  the  Sahara,  including,  of  course,  South
Africa, needs growth of about 7% annually  to  achieve  this  objective.  In
other words, if South Africa really wants to  address  poverty  effectively,
the economy will have to generate a growth of 7% instead of the current  2%-
3%. Improved access to world markets  in  terms  of  Nepad  is  one  way  of
enhancing economic growth. The free trade  agreement  with  the  EU  was  an
important milestone in this  regard.  The  envisaged  free  trade  agreement
between the USA and the Customs Union is also a welcome sign.
But the developed world must put their money  where  their  mouth  is.  They
lecture  Africa  about  the  principle  of  free  trade,  and  yet  European
restrictions on the import of  food  from  Africa  annually  block  products
worth $700 million from entering their countries. Hopefully, there  will  be
a change of heart in this regard.

Foreign direct investments are also essential for  bigger  economic  growth,
and making it happen will have to be a priority for the  Government  in  the
forthcoming financial year. To a certain extent, foreign direct  investments
have everything  to  do  with  perceptions.  Negative  perceptions  about  a
country do not  attract  investments.  And,  in  many  instances,  we  South
Africans are  ourselves  responsible  for  negative  perceptions  about  our
country.

Unfortunately, based on perceptions, countries like  Britain  and  Australia
warned their citizens to avoid South  Africa  due  to  the  high  levels  of
violence. Yes, the levels of violence  are  too  high  and  yes,  much  more
should be done to address them. But guess who tops the  list  in  the  world
when it comes to violent assault? According to the  Economist  Pocket  World
in Figures it is none other than Australia!

We as South Africans have a duty and a  responsibility  to  create  positive
perceptions about our country wherever  we  go  in  order  to  attract  more
investments with a view to enhancing economic growth so that poverty in  our
country could at least be halved.

Ten spyte van die fiasko gister op die  Wanderers  glo  ek  nog  steeds  die
proteas gaan die wÃªreldbeker wen, met die voorbehoud dat Klusener en  Donald
nie die wenlopies moet aanteken nie. Dankie. [Applous.] [Despite the  fiasco
at the Wanderers yesterday, I still believe the Proteas will win  the  world
cup, with the reservation that Klusener and  Donald  should  not  score  the
winning runs. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mrs W S NEWHOUDT-DRUCHEN: Madam Speaker,  hon  President,  Deputy  President
and hon members, the disability  sector  has  recently  lost  two  important
activists in the disability movement - Comrade Maria Rantho,  former  member
of Parliament, and Comrade Boyce Willem, an NCOP member.  I  would  like  to
pay tribute to them.

We would like to thank our  President  for,  time  and  again,  bringing  up
disability issues. We need to continue bringing up these issues, not  merely
sweep them under the carpet, as so many  people  like  to  do.  I  say  this
because people with disabilities still face  discrimination  at  all  levels
and it is our responsibility to make others aware of disability issues.

I would like to inform you that, wherever I go, people ask me  what  work  I
do. I tell them I'm a member of Parliament, a deaf member. They then ask  me
what party I belong to. I say the ANC, and I also inform them that only  the
ANC would put someone who is deaf in Parliament.  [Applause.]  I've  yet  to
see another political party follow the ANC's lead. This is  a  challenge  to
you. [Applause.]

The ANC believes that addressing the specific needs of those in  the  target
groups, namely women, children, the elderly and the disabled, stands at  the
centre of our efforts to build a better life for all. To establish  the  new
South Africa as a caring society, the empowerment and affirmation  of  these
groups  is  critical  to  ensuring  a   people-centred   and   people-driven
transformation. A massive education campaign is necessary for  the  targeted
groups and broader society to make them aware of the fundamental  rights  as
enshrined in the Constitution of South Africa.
In his speech on Friday, Comrade President  mentioned  that  there  will  be
another increase in social grants this year. The expansion  of  services  to
the people will also include disability  grants.  Last  year,  the  ANC  set
things rolling by calling  people  to  register  for  social  grants,  which
include disability grants. There are still  many  people  with  disabilities
who are not registered to receive grants  for  different  reasons,  such  as
having no means or access to go to departments and fill in forms to  receive
these grants.

Disabled people have a right to receive disability grants, and that  message
must go out. I hope that people with disabilities or people  who  understand
and work closely with people with disabilities will be  included  to  become
multiskilled community development workers. They can also go out  to  people
with disabilities to assist them in the communities.

We welcome the provision of free health care to persons  with  disabilities.
Hearing aids alone can cost from R4 000 to R7 000, and parents  just  cannot
afford that kind of cost.

There  are  also  other  health-related  issues   faced   by   people   with
disabilities that are lifelong and ongoing. I wonder if some of you  realise
that if a child has to sit in a wheelchair unsuitable to a child's  posture,
this can cause other deformities as the child is  growing  up.  A  specially
modified wheelchair can cost thousands.

We can make the best laws in Parliament to better the lives of  our  people,
but we need members of the public to be aware of these  laws.  We  need  the
public to act or work together  with  Government  to  better  the  lives  of
people with disabilities.

Just at the end of last year, during my constituency  work,  I  met  a  deaf
teacher in Umtata, who said that  she  was  once  arrested  for  using  sign
language. Would you arrest someone  for  speaking  IsiXhosa  or  IsiZulu?  A
mother informed me that Telkom doesn't want  her  deaf  son  to  be  made  a
permanent employee because he cannot talk properly.  He  must  first  attend
speech therapy. This is discrimination.

Public  awareness,  sensitivity  about  disabilities  and  knowledge   about
disability rights need to go out to the people. Research shows  that  to  be
able  to  integrate  disability   issues   into   policies   of   government
departments, it requires  the  commitment  of  senior  managers  to  address
disability issues.

We find that disability issues are placed at  the  bottom  of  the  list  of
priorities in departments. Different government departments and their  staff
will also have to be educated about the right use of terminology. During  my
constituency work, once again last year,  I  was  informed  that  there  are
still people in high positions in courts who still refer to deaf  people  as
being deaf and dumb. If attitudes in places like the courts do  not  change,
we can imagine how slow is the change of attitudes of the general public.  I
would encourage the hon members  of  Parliament,  if  they  do  not  have  a
booklet like this, to contact DPSA and obtain this little booklet, which  is
an empowerment tool and a pocket guide on disability equity.

Apart from the Acts we already have, such as the Promotion of  Equality  and
Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, the Employment Equity Act  and  the
South African Schools Act, we have seen additional  Acts  passed  to  better
the lives of people with disabilities, such as the Mental Health Care  Bill,
adopted on 30 May 2002, which  has  a  particular  bearing  on  people  with
intellectual disabilities.

The Broadcasting Amendment Act, passed in 2002, is looked at in  a  positive
light as it states that the South African Broadcasting  Corporation  has  to
make television programmes accessible to those who are deaf  and  those  who
are blind. Yes, we are, indeed, working to better the lives of  people  with
disabilities in South Africa.

On 7 February, last week, a march took place in all provinces where MECs  in
the various departments of education received a memorandum. The  purpose  of
the march was to advocate for and create awareness  of  South  African  sign
language, as the cornerstone of deaf education, and as a basic  human  right
of all deaf people. We thank Deaf People South Africa  for  supporting  this
march. We thank the Department of Education for the attention given  to  the
memorandum and we are hoping to have a response soon.

The African Decade of Disabled People has been declared for the  years  1999
to 2009. The Office on the Status of Disabled People will  hold  an  African
regional consultative conference to develop  ways  in  which  people  living
with disabilities  can  interact  with  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development and to come to an African position on the UN Convention  on  the
Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Disabled Persons.

South Africa is becoming more and more of  a  popular  tourist  destination,
and that would include more and  more  international  conferences  happening
here. Deaf Federation of South Africa is hoping to win the bid  to  be  able
to host the Fifteenth World Congress for the World Federation  of  the  Deaf
in 2007.

The World Federation of  the  Deaf  is  an  international  NGO  in  official
liaison with ECOSOC, UNESCO, ILO, and WHO. South Africa is on the  shortlist
to present our bid in Canada later this year. If we  win  the  bid  to  host
this congress, I think it will be the first time that the  World  Federation
of the Deaf Congress meets in Africa, and the first time there will ever  be
an international  congress  for  people  with  disabilities  here  in  South
Africa. [Applause.]

Let us also use this event to make this century an African century, and  put
the world's focus on Africa. We will continue to work to  better  the  lives
of South African citizens with disabilities. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, Mr President, hon Deputy President  and  hon
members, we appreciate the statement of intent  made  by  the  President  to
shift Government spending towards greater investment in social and  economic
infrastructure. We thank Government for acknowledging the  UDM's  calls  for
this type of investment. [Interjections.]

We hope that Government will improve its implementation in order  to  ensure
that these good intentions bear fruit.  Implementation,  as  you  know,  has
been this Government's weakness.  We  therefore  hope  that,  starting  with
Minister Manuel's Budget, we will see these intentions  reflected  as  clear
objectives with definite targets and deadlines.

Allow me also to say that the UDM fully agrees  with  Government's  approach
on the issue of Iraq. In 1993, we as a country took a  decision  that  never
again would we solve our problems  through  violent  means.  We  wish  South
Africa's disarmament experts success  in  Iraq.  We  wish  them  success  in
convincing Iraq on  proper  and  responsible  disarmament,  and  success  in
convincing others of the error of military action.

As far as the issue of Zimbabwe is concerned, it is high time that both  the
President of Zimbabwe and the Prime  Minister  of  Britain  swallowed  their
pride and returned to the negotiation  table  and  resolved  the  unfinished
business of Lancaster House. The immediate role of South  Africa  should  be
to facilitate such a dialogue.

Regarding the alleged human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, that is a matter  for
the UN to address. It is neither  South  Africa's  place  nor  its  duty  to
unilaterally intervene with regard to the abuse  of  human  rights  in  that
country.

We have noted that Government has been holding imbizos. I  have  been  to  a
number of the places where imbizos have been  held.  The  people  there  are
still waiting for the promises and  commitments  that  were  made  at  these
imbizos to materialise. In the areas I have visited, the  common  thread  of
people's complaints has been unemployment, hunger, poverty,  as  well  as  a
severe lack of doctors and medicine, and  the  general  failure  of  service
delivery.

Some of these areas are Mount Fletcher and Matatiele in  the  Eastern  Cape,
where  the  people  are  complaining  that  there  is  no  cellular  network
reception. Since 1994 they have been  assured  that  this  matter  would  be
addressed. The cellular networks have also said that all  communities  would
be covered. There are also complaints about lack of  Telkom  lines  in  some
rural parts of these areas. Similarly, they  complain  of  not  receiving  a
signal for SABC-TV. It would be appreciated if  the  complaints  which  were
raised at imbizos were addressed.

The state of the nation is one of a people suffering unduly. This is a  view
that is shared by social commentators from  every  sector  of  society.  The
root of this suffering is  unemployment  and  poverty.  The  President  also
acknowledged  this.  However,  he  fails  to  acknowledge  the  direct   and
undeniable role of his Government in perpetuating unemployment and poverty.

Nearly 10 years of freedom  have  been  characterised  by  the  Government's
complete and  utter  failure  to  create  the  jobs  that  this  country  so
desperately needs.  Instead,  the  Government's  economic  policy  has  been
characterised by words such as  ``downsizing'',  ``rightsizing'',  ``take  a
package'',  ``redundancy'',  ``supernumeraries''  and  ``retrenchment''.  To
make matters worse, many qualified people have been replaced by  incompetent
comrades of the ruling party. [Interjections.]

An analysis of the Future Facts survey of 2002 found that the South  African
population could be divided into five broad categories.  One  third  of  the
population falls into the ``still disadvantaged'' group.  They  are  trapped
in desperate poverty. Nearly  another  third  falls  into  the  ``emerging''
group. This group lives in survival mode, but  is  aspiring  to  escape  its
poverty.

Statistics SA recently revealed that, under  the  ANC  Government,  the  gap
between the haves and have-nots has widened. We cannot  deny  this  reality.
The UDM observes this reality throughout the country. It is what  Government
should have noticed at those extravagant pageants masquerading as imbizos.

This is the true state of the nation. Most people suffer as a result of  the
current Government's policy, in particular the economic policy.

This  year,  again,  President  Mbeki  strung  together  a  long   list   of
platitudes.  South  Africans  want  to  hear  more  than   that   Government
recognises their suffering. They want to hear that Government  will  abandon
policies that have failed and choose concrete new strategies. Last  year  we
also heard that, and I quote:


  Government will ... increase its  focus  on  achieving  higher  rates  of
  economic growth and development. This will include ... the convening of a
  growth summit.

However, by the end of last year, formal sector employment rose  by  a  mere
0,5%, creating new employment for only 21Â 000 people. In  other  words,  the
economy did not create nearly enough job opportunities  for  the  more  than
400Â 000 matriculants who  entered  the  job  market  this  year,  let  alone
address the nine-year backlog.

Average monthly real earnings in the formal  sector  dropped  by  0,5%  when
comparing August 2002 with August 2001. It  means  that  even  the  employed
became poorer. Statistics SA puts unemployment, according  to  the  expanded
definition, at 41%. Turning the tide, indeed! But in what direction?

It is a pity that the President is not willing to concede that  the  current
economic policy was implemented at  the  expense  of  the  masses.  The  ANC
Government's first priority should not have been to please the rest  of  the
world, but rather to take care of our unique domestic challenges.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Like you ran the Transkei! [Laughter.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: The  decision  taken  in  1994  to  hastily  implement  the
General  Agreement  on  Trade  and  Tariffs  without   negotiating   for   a
responsible phasing-in approach was wrong. As  a  result,  proper  attention
was not paid to skills development and job  creation.  Ironically,  much  of
the clothing in South African shops, which is also worn in  this  House,  is
manufactured  in  countries  where  governments  subsidise   their   textile
industry.

I hope you understand that, Mr Manuel, because  you  are  a  member  of  the
World Trade Organisation. [Interjections.] Mainland China is also  a  member
of that organisation, but they are flooding your market with products  which
have been manufactured by state-sponsored  factories.  [Interjections.]  You
should know that. Don't mislead us.
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: You don't know what you're talking about!

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Those decisions ignored the reality ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, would you address each  other  through  the
Chair, and preferably not interrupt! Please continue, hon member.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Those decisions ignored the  reality  that  South  Africa's
economy was managed for many decades with direct government involvement  and
protection, albeit under separate development, hon Manuel.

Since 1994, more than 1 million jobs have been made redundant at the  stroke
of a pen, hon Minister, without any alternative arrangement being made.  Ask
Cosatu who has lost nearly two thirds of its members in nine years,  because
those workers are now unemployed.  The  bottom  line  of  the  ANC  economic
policy is that not only does it fail to create new jobs, but it  also  fails
to protect the existing jobs.

A year ago Tradek economist Mr Mike Schussler said, and I quote:
  No developing country has made so many jobs redundant over any seven-year
  period since the Great Depression. On a per-job ratio, South  Africa  has
  destroyed more jobs than any other developing country in modern history.

He went further to pinpoint the lack of  skills  in  our  workforce  as  the
biggest disincentive for investment in South Africa.

The UDM's economic policy endorsed at our 2001 national  congress  calls  on
the Government to do more. [Interjections.] It is better  to  introduce  the
Lotto rather than subjecting this country to  the  World  Bank's  and  IMF's
structural adjustments, which you have done.  What  we  have  here  is  much
better.

Last year in this House, I presented the  UDM's  policy  and  explained  the
responsibility of Government  to  do  more.  [Interjections.]  Senior  Unisa
economic development lecturer Hugo Noble and Stellenbosch  Professor  Sampie
Terreblanche concur that Government must do more.

Last year we were promised greater attention to, and I quote:
  ... education and training and the National Youth Service.

President Mbeki also promised an ICT university. Sadly, the  new  university
never materialised, and existing ones are being regulated into extinction.

Why hold a  summit  when  the  Jobs  Summit  promises  were  not  kept?  The
necessary solutions have been presented by all sectors of society  countless
times before. Frankly, this  is  a  mere  exercise  in  browbeating  labour,
business  and  civil  society.  Government  wants  them   to   accept   more
responsibility  for  job  creation,   whilst   absolving   itself   of   its
responsibilities.

As far as black economic empowerment is concerned, no one can argue  against
the fact that there is a need for such a strategy.  However,  the  truth  is
that, to date, it has been a strategy benefiting a small elite  of  the  ANC
who have been redeployed from this  House.  An  often  forgotten  aspect  of
black economic empowerment has been that a lot of those who  have  benefited
have used the money of the workers.

Last year, we were promised moral renewal and a new commitment  to  fighting
corruption. The Moral Regeneration Summit has come and  gone.  The  list  of
corruption cases is growing. It now includes hon Yengeni, the chief  of  the
Civil  Aviation  Authority,  Spoornet's  chief  executive  officer,  the  SA
Express chief executive officer and the forestry  deal.  [Interjections.]  I
hope the comrades who are mumbling still remember the R55Â 000 wedding  gift.
[Interjections.]

We further witnessed the DA funding scandal, the New NP funding scandal  and
the Transnet pro-ANC tender decision that is going  to  cost  taxpayers  R57
million. Now we see new reports of corruption involving the former  Minister
of Transport, Mr Maharaj. The media continue to raise  questions  about  the
Deputy President's involvement in the arms deal.

In the case of the hon Yengeni, the President must  explain  to  the  nation
the application of the plea bargain mechanism. We were under the  impression
that pleas would be offered to the small fish in  order  to  catch  the  big
fish. Can we expect that hon Yengeni's  plea  will  lead  to  his  testimony
against  more  senior  people?  Otherwise,  what  is  the  benefit  of  this
mechanism to society and the commission of justice? Or was the plea  offered
to silence the hon Yengeni and prevent the naming of more senior  people  in
open court? [Interjections.]

Was Government more concerned that a comprehensive court case  would  expose
the arms deal? What happened to the more than 30  luxury  vehicles  you  got
from that company, which some of you received? Why are you prosecuting  Tony
Yengeni only? [Interjections.]

Kutheni nileqa uTony Yengeni yedwa? [Uwele-wele.]  [Why  do  you  pressurise
Tony Yengeni alone?] [Interjections.]]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Kutheni nileqa uTony Yengeni yedwa? [Uwele-wele.]  [Why  do
you pressurise Tony Yengeni alone?] [Interjections.]]

What about others?

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members!

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Baphi abanye? [Where are the others?]

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Holomisa! Hon members, please bear in  mind  you  are
referring to a serving member of Parliament at the moment.  [Interjections.]
This is a general comment to all of you. Please proceed.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: In the meantime, nauseating reports  about  the  arms  deal
continue to appear. Senior people are being accused. Will they, too,  follow
the example of said hon member and waste our time and the  taxpayer's  money
for years with denials?

I humbly submit that these embarrassments could have  been  avoided  with  a
proper investigation of the arms deal. It is not too  late  to  institute  a
judicial commission of inquiry. Such an inquiry should also investigate  the
African National Congress Fundraising Trust,  and  whether  other  companies
headed by ANC cadres - as per  your  deployment  policies  -  have  received
government tenders and have, in turn,  donated  funds  or  shares  into  ANC
coffers. This means that you are using all these  business  transactions  as
cash cows in order to beef up your party coffers. [Interjections.]
For instance, in the Eastern  Cape,  a  company  tasked  to  pay  grants  to
pensioners is manned by ANC cadres. The service they provide is  shoddy  and
their incompetence increases the suffering of one of the  poorest  provinces
in the country. This looting spree must come to an end.

Mr President, I advise, in a spirit of noninterference ...  [Laughter.]  ...
that you should hold one-on-one meetings with all members of  your  Cabinet.
You should get personal assurances from each of  them  that  they  have  not
abused, and are  not  abusing,  their  positions  to  enrich  themselves  or
members of their families, as  we  usually  read  about  in  the  newspapers
almost every day. [Interjections.]

Every  time  a   senior   member   of   Government   ...   [Time   expired.]
[Interjections.]

Die MINISTER VIR DIE STAATSDIENS EN ADMINISTRASIE: Mevrou die  Speaker,  agb
President, agb Adjunkpresident, kollegas, dis  byna  nege  jaar  sedert  die
begin van ons demokratiese Parlement. Ons het baie bereik as regering Ã©n  as
'n samelewing. Ek en vele andere is dus trots op ons nasie  en  op  wat  ons
bereik het, enkele voorbeelde waarna die President Vrydag verwys het.
Ja, ek is trots om lid van die ANC te  wees.  Inderdaad,  ek  is  'n  trotse
patriot. Trots om met hernieude ywer die visie van die ANC na te  jaag  soos
dit met herhaling geformuleer is tydens die 51ste nasionale  konferensie  in
Desember in  Stellenbosch.  Dit  is  daardie  ANC  in  wie  se  tradisie  ek
bevoorreg was om geskool te word.  Daardie  waardes  wat  my  rig,  my  lei,
duidelik koers gee in hierdie pad wat ons loop  om  die  mense  van  hierdie
geliefde nasie behoorlik  te  dien.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker,  hon
President, hon Deputy President, colleagues, it is almost nine  years  since
our democratic Parliament began. We have achieved much as a nation and as  a
society. I and many others are therefore very proud of  our  nation  and  of
what we have achieved; some examples the President referred to on Friday.

Yes, I am proud to be a member of the ANC. Indeed, I  am  a  proud  patriot.
Proud to pursue with renewed fervour the vision of the ANC as  it  was  once
again formulated during the 51st national conference in Stellenbosch  during
December. It is that ANC whose tradition I was  privileged  to  be  schooled
in. Those values which direct me, guide me, give me a clear course  on  this
path on which we are walking to serve the  people  of  this  beloved  nation
properly.]

Earlier today, we had a reference to the South African dream, and the  South
African reality. Fortunately, Mr Leon has no hope of  leading  this  country
and therefore that saves us from a South African nightmare.

In terms of governance, the ANC stands for a range of values.  These  values
influence our behaviour as an organisation, as  individuals,  and  are  also
carried into the institutions where we lead and  in  which  we  participate.
[Interjections.] Since our movement assumed  its  role  as  Government,  our
understanding of the challenges that we face  has  deepened.  This  deepened
understanding has relevance not only for our internal situation but  in  the
global context - a situation that is changing at  an  incredible  pace,  and
one from which we are not isolated. It is in the tradition of  our  movement
that we reflect, honestly and unemotionally, on  our  achievements  and  our
challenges.

As Palo Freire, the progressive educationist  who  influenced  many  of  our
cadre, said:
  A society beginning to move  from  one  epoch  to  another  requires  the
  development of an especially flexible and critical spirit. Lacking such a
  spirit, people cannot perceive the marked contradictions  that  occur  in
  society as emerging values in search of affirmation and fulfilment  clash
  with earlier values in seeking self-preservation.

This brings us directly to the question of what kind of public  servants  we
are trying to nurture. Is it one who, when the  door  of  his  office  comes
loose or is missing a hinge, complains that he is working under  intolerable
conditions, as happened recently, or one who simply gets a  screwdriver  and
tightens two screws? Is it the kind of public servant who  finds  solutions,
will  see  obstacles  as  challenges  to  be   eliminated   while   deriving
satisfaction in beating the odds,  and  will  see  delivery  as  an  end  in
itself?

We can follow Freire's  approach  of  flexibility  and  critical  reflection
because we are guided by a set of very strong principles that  show  us  the
way, however complex the issue becomes. We do not waver  in  the  principles
on which our movement is based - the principles of democracy, nonracism,  of
bestowing equal  rights  and  dignity  on  all  humans,  our  commitment  to
improving the  quality  of  life  of  the  poor,  the  disenfranchised,  the
disempowered and the downtrodden, whether here or outside our borders.

The challenges that we face as we strive for  transformation  of  the  South
African society, of the South  African  state  and  of  our  Government  are
parallel. We cannot isolate one site of struggle from another, or  even  say
that one aspect must lead the other.  The  most  important  vehicle  in  the
arsenal of any government to achieve the best for a country is that  of  the
institutions of state. It is hence critical that  we  look  closely  at  the
Public Service, and especially at the managers who are responsible  for  the
process of transformation. And this is what we are doing, and the  President
has referred to it.

I can state here today, as has been stated previously, that as  we  look  at
representivity within the ranks of the Public Service,  we  are  doing  very
well in terms of racial transformation, but we are not doing  so  well  with
women at management level and certainly not with regard to the disabled.  In
future, the performance of senior managers will  include  an  assessment  of
how they are doing when it comes to ensuring gender diversity in  managerial
ranks, and we will also include disability. So we  must  look,  and  we  are
looking, closely at the challenges in the Public  Service.  On  Friday,  our
President pointed to the critical position that  the  Public  Service  holds
for our transformation, and I quote:


  The effective delivery of the expanded services to  the  people  requires
  that we  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  Public  Service.  Without  an
  efficient and effective Public Service it will be impossible  for  us  to
  register the advances we are capable of.

The President has previously gone further where, in his opening  address  at
the opening of the ANC conference in December 2002, he made mention  of  the
failure of administration to implement some of our policies,  including  the
distribution  of  social  grants,  and  failure   to   ensure   that   state
institutions and civil servants render the necessary service to the  public.
The criticism of the President in terms  of  the  inability  of  the  Public
Service to democratise at the required speed is to ensure  that  it  fulfils
its function of actually serving the people, of experiencing and  responding
to the urgency of need and discomfort, of feeling themselves accountable  to
people, and of giving effect to our  policy  of  transformation  of  service
delivery. Batho Pele must encompass the whole of the Public Service  and  be
infused in our society as a whole.

We must get the basics right. And here, as  the  executive,  as  politicians
and managers, we must ensure the basics  of  accountability,  of  democratic
values, of ethical and  efficient  utilisation  of  resources,  and  of  the
building of an administrative culture that unlocks and mobilises the  energy
of the largest institutions in our country to deliver a better life for  the
people of South Africa. Since last year, in particular, this Government  has
introduced and pursued strong initiatives in terms of democratising  service
delivery and administration.

Let's briefly focus on the Eastern Cape, and let's not talk  about  what  is
to be done, but what is  being  done.  Let  some  of  those  who  have  been
responsible for the mess there  listen  and  not  allow  themselves  to  get
diverted easily so that they can engage appropriately. We  acknowledge  that
there are challenges and what I want to call  today  cultural,  ethical  and
conduct issues. A general  poor  work  ethic  and  lack  of  performance  is
displayed, coupled with  a  lack  of  decisive  action  by  supervisors  and
managers. Departments are extremely vulnerable to corruption as a result  of
poor leadership, internal controls and inadequate systems, and a culture  of
nonaccountability is  widely  evident.  In  education,  human  resource  and
administrative breaches are most prevalent, as well as a high  incidence  of
relationship transgression, and I just mention a few.

So what are we doing? The interim management team that was appointed by  the
President and the Premier of the Eastern Cape is  looking  at  handling  our
primary concerns - concerns where we have acknowledged that the unions  have
had undue influence over managers and their decisions, and we have  narrowed
it down to the departments  that  are  involved.  In  terms  of  the  change
management strategy, right now, we are dealing with  how  we  are  balancing
the short-term crisis issues, as  well  as  addressing  underlying  systemic
problems: How to restore the culture of  responsibility  and  accountability
and how to focus on massive administrative and financial  challenges  whilst
attending to critical service delivery needs.  In  terms  of  the  immediate
interventions on the human resource backlogs, the objective of  the  interim
management team is to break the cycle of continuous human  resource  backlog
claims and to settle the matter once and for all. There is a plan for  that,
and you will see it rolled out.

Furthermore, we are  also  looking  at  the  implementation  of  the  Public
Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council or the PSCBC Resolution 7 of  2001.
This is going to be fast-tracked through the following steps: By the end  of
this month, February, departments are required to have their  establishments
finalised and the person-to-post matching completed. On completion of  these
steps, a provincial  circular  will  be  issued  advertising  vacancies  for
internal recruitment. While this process is ongoing the  interim  management
team or IMT will develop alternatives  to  retrenchment  and  proposals  for
enhanced incentives to  terminate  the  service  of  excess  employees.  The
advertising and filling of critical posts will be fast-tracked and  unfunded
vacancies will  be  abolished  as  and  when  the  establishment  needs  are
finalised.

In terms of  the  leadership  requirement,  the  performance  agreement  for
senior management service members for the year 2003-2004 will  be  finalised
by the end of March, and will  include  the  turnaround  plans  as  a  major
element of this agreement. Financial disclosure statements will be  required
from all senior management service  members,  and  all  the  current  senior
management service members, as well as new appointments, will  be  subjected
to competency assessments. The process of evaluation of heads of  department
will commence. We will also look at this in terms  of  financial  management
and procurement. The team has started a process  to  decentralise  financial
management to departments in line with the PMFA requirement. It's  necessary
to state as well that currently there are forensic audits under way and  the
team  has  completed  assessment  of  the  relevant  audit  reports  and  is
commissioning  further  forensic  audits  on  human  resource  backlogs   in
departments, the use of petrol cards, social grant payments  and  so  forth.
And you have seen the work that's been done with the  rest  that  has  taken
place in the Eastern Cape in recent weeks.

This is a sign that we clearly want to take forward and,  as  the  President
has stated, this will be the kind of model that will  be  used  in  ensuring
that we put in place the required governance across the country  and  within
the Public  Service  as  a  whole.  As  the  ANC,  as  we  resolved  at  our
conference, we will be monitoring those from our  ranks  who  serve  in  the
Public Service. Not only will they be  accountable  in  the  workplace,  but
also within our organisation.

Our President, the President of the country, has charged the members of  the
executive with the responsibility  of  ensuring  that  the  state  machinery
functions  optimally  in  the  interests  of  poverty  eradication  and  the
creation of a democratic society. This does not exclude any one  of  us  who
serves on the executive. We must all make  this  happen.  We  can't  whistle
from the outside the gates at ourselves. It is the people who  shall  govern
through their elected representatives, and the  executive  will  account  to
Parliament, in an honest and critically  reflective  fashion,  true  to  the
ways of the ANC in which we celebrate successes, but do not  shy  away  from
dealing with the problems that may emerge along the way. The Public  Service
therefore can expect that, in the year to come, we will cut them less  slack
in terms of setting their own pace, and of asserting  their  own  managerial
independence. They, as stated by the  President,  will  be  accountable;  we
will be accountable, we serve the people.

I thank you. [Applause.]
Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  hon  members,  most  South
Africans wanted to hear from the President,  in  his  state  of  the  nation
address, whether Government has succeeded in closing  the  gap  between  the
promises made since 1994 and what has actually been delivered, and that  was
unfortunately not done.

The majority of our people agree that the post-1994 period  has  had  little
impact on the poorest of the poor. Political empowerment has not  translated
into economic empowerment, and the distribution of socioeconomic  power  has
mainly benefited blacks and Indians in the bourgeoisie classes,  and  hardly
had any effect on the majority of South Africans in  the  middle  and  lower
classes.  The  gap  between  the  haves  and  the  have-nots  is  definitely
increasing by the day.

The  economic  growth  the  President  spoke  about  has  unfortunately  not
translated into more jobs and the eradication of poverty. Men and women  who
open rubbish bags every week, those who scratch for food on  rubbish  dumps,
and many thousands of our people who go to bed hungry will not  believe  the
President when he says that the economy has turned the corner. What kind  of
growth is it that sheds jobs  instead  of  sustaining  them?  What  kind  of
economic growth is it that worsens the lives of South Africans and does  not
better them? An economic growth that widens the gap  between  the  rich  and
the poor. Mr President, if there  is  real  economic  growth,  the  ordinary
people on the ground want to see the fruit.

While some ray of hope came from the many promises that the President  made,
the question that remains to be answered is whether, this  time  round,  the
promises that were made will ever be  fulfilled?  What  really  disappointed
many of our people is that crucial issues that they are facing  on  a  daily
basis were not given the necessary attention they deserve.

While the President was giving his state of the  nation  address,  thousands
of South Africans were participating in a march to Parliament  organised  by
the Treatment Action Campaign to campaign  for  a  national  Aids  treatment
programme. We expected the President to assure the marchers,  consisting  of
the  Treatment  Action  Campaign,  the  clergy,  unions,  and   NGOs,   that
Government will do more to help  Aids  sufferers  or  sign  a  comprehensive
national Aids blueprint. Instead, he chose to ignore them  and  to  continue
with  his  usual  rhetoric  that   Government   will   continue   with   its
comprehensive Aids campaign. A question many  want  answered  is:  Why  does
Government  want  to  continue  with  something  that  has  failed?  If  the
Government's Aids programme did not fail, then there would not have  been  a
demonstration outside Parliament  when  the  President  was  addressing  the
nation.

Government's refusal to take decisive action is appalling  and  the  refusal
to provide antiretrovirals is  tantamount  to  condemning  scores  of  South
Africans to a horrible death. The lifespan  of  economically  active  people
living  with  Aids  is  significantly   shortened   without   the   use   of
antiretrovirals. Government's refusal to  provide  antiretrovirals  free  of
charge to all citizens is  antithetical  to  the  President's  objective  of
sustaining economic growth. We are not only judged by what  we  do,  but  we
are also judged by that which we fail to do. Government is failing  to  come
to the assistance of Aids patients, Aids orphans  and  their  families.  The
people are demanding effective action now to be  convinced  that  Government
cares.

On the issue of crime, the President told us how  international  guests  are
happy with the protection they were provided with and  with  what  they  are
provided with at the Cricket World Cup, and received at the World Summit  on
Sustainable Development and the launch of  the  African  Union.  Yet,  South
Africans continue to live in fear for their lives on a daily basis.  Why  is
the President concerned  with  pleasing  foreigners  and  ignoring  his  own
people? President Mbeki said  that  crime  is  stabilising.  However,  crime
levels should not just remain the same, they need to  be  brought  down  and
finally eradicated. If Government cannot reduce crime, they must admit  that
they have failed to  do  so  and  then  tell  the  electorate  so  that  the
electorate can choose another leadership that will eradicate crime.

The  President's  comments  on   Zimbabwe   continue   to   underscore   the
Government's failure to deal harshly with the death  of  democracy  in  that
country. It is beyond belief that the  President  continues  his  policy  of
quiet diplomacy despite the negative impact this has had on our economy.  It
is internationally recognised  that  South  Africa,  as  the  Chair  of  the
African Union and the Non-Aligned Movement, needs to do more to address  the
crisis on her border. It is not enough for the President to tell the  nation
that they will continue to work with the people of  Zimbabwe  as  they  seek
solutions to their problems.
The nation does not know what help  the  President  and  the  Government  is
giving the people of Zimbabwe, except the perceived protection  and  defence
of dictatorship, tyranny and the abuse of human rights in that country.  The
world sees what the President is doing for Iraq, Burundi, the DRC and  other
countries in need,  but  they  do  not  see  what  our  Government  and  the
President is doing for his closest neighbour, Zimbabwe. Is it because  there
are no oil or diamonds in Zimbabwe? What is the reason for the silence?

On the possible war on Iraq, we want to appeal to both  President  Bush  and
Prime Minister Blair to rethink  their  threat  of  war  after  millions  of
concerned people in most parts of the world  demonstrated  against  war.  We
want peace and not war. The ACDP agrees that more time should  be  given  to
the UN inspectors to do their job unhindered and that the  Iraqi  government
should co-operate  fully  as  promised.  The  search  for  weapons  of  mass
destruction must continue until they are found and destroyed.

We, the ACDP, are always surprised to  hear  the  President  calling  for  a
moral renewal in South Africa. By  such  a  call,  he  fails  to  take  into
account  the  fact  that  it  is  his  Government's  policies  on  abortion,
pornography, prostitution and homosexuality that have  eroded  the  morality
and soul of our nation. The ACDP maintains that without a biblical  standard
of morality, no programme for moral  regeneration  will  ever  succeed.  You
must admit, Mr President, that you need God's help.  Without  Him,  you  and
the nation will not have any moral regeneration. If you want His help,  then
my advice is: Please stop legislating against Him. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF  EDUCATION:  Madam  Speaker,  President,  Deputy  President,
leaders of political parties - I see all the leaders are now here;  we  have
been rejoined by the Leader of the Official Opposition  -  hon  members  and
comrades. Those who are destined to  remain  permanently  in  opposition  in
this House and this country  will  do  so  because  they  are  not  able  or
prepared to recognise the difficulty, the challenges, and  the  complexities
concerning governance. They simplify  where  they  ought  to  recognise  the
magnitude of the task before them. They  are  strident  and  populist.  They
want instant solutions. The Leader of the Opposition is like a drummer in  a
kwaito band. It is computer simulated, I understand, in a  kwaito  band.  He
beats a drum: ``boom, boom,  boom!''  Then  he  expects  immediate  results.
[Laughter.] They oppose where they ought,  for  the  public  good,  to  work
together to deal with the enormity of the challenges we face.

The hon Leader of the Opposition has complained publicly  that  he  has  not
been give the recognition he deserves  as  the  leader  of  the  opposition.
Well, of course, it is his ``in your face''  approach  for  nearly  half  an
hour. If a leader of the opposition can say in a  free  South  Africa,  with
all the violence and the putridness of apartheid, that  life  is  no  better
than ever before; in fact, life is worse, nogal [rather], he  should  go  to
every little village where there is now  a  telephone,  a  great  liberating
factor for our country. Go to every little town and you  will  see  that  in
fact he is babbling away. [Interjections.] Life is worse  in  South  Africa.
Life is worse when you go and see that children up to the  age  of  six  get
free medical attention. Life is worse when pregnant women are  now  in  fact
getting free medical attention. Life is worse when we had  to  overcome  the
legacy of homelessness and apartheid rule and build houses. Life  is  worse;
much worse, nogal [rather]. [Applause.]

So what do you do? What do you do with these mean-spirited  men  who  refuse
to recognise the  enormity  of  the  changes  taking  place?  The  President
celebrated the lives of two giants - of Oliver Tambo and  Chris  Hani  -  on
Friday. Let me also mark - and, of course, this is a historic thing  to  say
on behalf of the ANC - the extraordinary  contribution  of  Robert  Sobukwe,
who died on 27 February 1978, 25 years ago.  He  showed  his  self-reliance,
independence, his compassion and understanding, but while he relied  on  the
emancipation of  black  people  by  asserting  themselves,  he  in  the  end
realised that this is a country of many races. These are  the  real  heroes,
and we miss those heroes. I hope in fact that, on  the  opposition  benches,
there was that kind of understanding of what kind  of  country  we  want  to
build and how we will do so.

The Leader of the Opposition is reported to have said over the weekend  that
the President ``slighted into insignificance'' the  issue  of  HIV/Aids.  In
his speech, the President indicated that we will continue  implementing  the
Government's comprehensive strategy on HIV/Aids.

An HON MEMBER: What is it?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: If Mr Leon ...

Ah, the schoolboys here! [Laughter.]

If Mr Leon still does not know about the strategy - which I  find  difficult
to believe, even for Mr Leon -  I  will  happily  give  him  the  Government
website details where he can read up the Government ... [Interjections.]

That's why I said ``schoolboys.''

... policy. And while he is doing so, he should now look at  how  often  the
Government, the Cabinet Ministers and the  provinces  have  dealt  with  the
issue during the past year. And if you  get  the  hits  from  the  websites,
hundreds, if not thousands of times, there are references.

Perhaps the hon Minister of Home Affairs should read the President's  speech
also at the same time, because he did refer to HIV/Aids,  contrary  to  what
you said, that he never referred to HIV.

You see, they seek to politicise  matters  that  go  to  the  heart  of  our
existence, such as HIV/Aids. They succumb to the temptation  to  hijack  the
legitimate sense of anxiety, concern, and impatience that millions of  South
Africans feel in the face of this terrible tragedy.

We will continue implementing, as the President said, the decisions  of  the
Constitutional  Court.  We  will  implement  the   Court's   decision,   not
begrudgingly, or defensively, not simply because we have  to,  but  for  two
reasons. It was the ANC that set up the Constitutional Court  and  supported
it in 1991, long before these mandarins, these lawyers, got  to  grips  with
it. [Laughter.] [Applause.] It was long before that, in 1991,  and  we  will
follow the thrust of their judgments  scrupulously.  The  second  reason  is
that we are committed to fighting the HIV pandemic to the fullest  that  our
resources allow.

For the record, let me reiterate that Government dealt with its position  in
April last year, as mentioned by the Minister of Housing. Let  me  elaborate
further. Government unequivocally accepted the causal link between  HIV  and
Aids, and promoting awareness and life-skills and HIV  education  forms  the
core of our approach. The HSRC report - if they read  anything,  except  The
Spectator magazine, from which he picks up most of  his  ideas  about  South
Africa ... [Interjections.]
No, no, of course I read The Spectator, but not to pick up the bile and  the
offence that your friends write in The Spectator. If, in fact, you read  the
HSRC report and the Nelson Mandela Foundation  report,  you  will  see  that
more than 80% of our people learnt about HIV/Aids  -  that's  understanding,
and then, of course, acting  -  through  schools.  And  this  is  the  great
success of the Government's policy of putting  millions  and  millions  into
education. And a correlation between sexual behaviour and knowledge  now  is
clearly established in the HSRC report.

The Government remains committed to creating conditions that  make  it  make
feasible and effective to use antiretrovirals in the  public  sector.  There
have been discussions between the Treasury  and  the  Health  department  on
this issue and we should hear further on this  matter,  about  the  costing,
very soon.

But we cannot make commitments that we can't keep  -  in  this  respect,  we
have a constitutional responsibility  to  the  people  of  this  country  to
ensure that we do not create expectations around such crucial issues  unless
we are sure we can fulfil these expectations. For our part,  as  Government,
we must certainly act with vigour and commitment and will  in  the  face  of
the HIV/Aids challenge, but we must also act with responsibility. It is  for
this reason, and no other, that we have not been able to  sign  off  yet  on
this comprehensive  and  extensive  treatment  agreement  at  Nedlac  -  not
because we are dragging  our  heels,  but  because  we  must  approach  such
agreements seriously and responsibly. It's the schoolboys who can  make  all
kinds of promises and have no hope of fulfilling them.  [Interjections.]  If
we commit ourselves to something, we must be sure we can deliver.

The   Government's   poverty   alleviation   programmes   and    nutritional
interventions are also  essential  parts  of  the  fight  against  HIV/Aids,
including in education, where the Government has  agreed  that  funding  for
the school nutrition programme must be increased, to  benefit  all  children
in primary school. But you see - I'll come to this in  a  moment  -  we  are
implementing it, because the programme now will run  within  the  Department
of Education from 2004.

Likewise,  clean  water,  decent  housing,  assisting  in  the  creation  of
employment and access to social infrastructure and  education  all  decrease
the vulnerability of individuals  and  communities  to  infections  and  ill
health.
You see, the hon Rev Meshoe thinks the apostolic succession firmly rests  on
his head. [Laughter.] Let me say that he is wrong about this.

The  Minister  of  Social  Development  has  announced  two  very  important
additional initiatives. First, the  development  of  a  uniform  policy  and
standard of service for  those  infected  with  HIV/Aids,  especially  those
disabled  by  HIV/Aids;  and  secondly,  a  campaign  to  identify  children
affected by HIV/Aids, including child-headed households, so  as  to  improve
service delivery and make services more accessible. And, as  you  know,  the
Minister of Social Development has a fire in his  belly  and,  in  fact,  he
will implement this.

Such campaigns cost money and form part and parcel  of  our  annual  budget.
Even the opposition, today  and  elsewhere,  has  praised  the  Government's
macroeconomic policy, a  forward-looking  policy.  However,  our  policy  is
based on the fact - which they don't mention - that you cannot leave  it  to
market  forces  to  effectively  deal   with   social   issues.   You   see?
[Interjections.]

No, and Mr Holomisa, I've read your economic policy. It's voodoo  economics,
really, of the first kind. [Laughter.] It's  really  voodoo  economics.  You
see, they  forget  this  in  their  attachment  to  the  Chicago  School  of
Economics, where the rich become richer and the devil  takes  the  hindmost.
[Laughter.]

In relation to Mr Holomisa, we are now implementing the  advanced  institute
for  information  technology.   But   you   see,   you   left   behind   ...
[Interjections.]

You say ``when?''. You left behind wrack and ruin  in  the  Transkei  and  I
knew it when I was the Minister of Water Affairs and  Forestry.  [Laughter.]
And you have the nerve to ask ``When?'' because we are basing  ourselves  on
international expert opinion and we are now in  the  process  of  organising
the  establishment.  But,  you  see,  he  believes,  never  having  believed
anything in the Transkei, that you can do this overnight, in one  year.  You
can't set up an information technology institute within a year.  No  country
has succeeded in that, but we will be the first country in  the  south  that
will have this institute when we have processed setting it up. Next year  we
will celebrate; I hope you'll attend this.

Last year's Budget therefore  effected  a  pattern  of  increases,  in  real
terms,  in  Government  spending  on  health  and  on  social   development,
particularly child support. The opposition begrudges us that. We  raise  the
child support scheme to 14 years  and  he  says,  with  this  extraordinary,
brilliant insight, like at the Oxford Union; he's  debating  -  he  suddenly
has this extraordinary insight - ``What about  those  that  exist  after  14
years?'' [Laughter.] You see? What sense  do  you  make  out  of  this?  You
increase this as, in fact, the resources and the  administration  allow  you
to do. This applies in relation to education too.

This is a bold, interventionist position  against  a  backdrop  where  other
governments are regrettably cutting back on social expenditure.

Mr M J  ELLIS:  Why  don't  you  concentrate  on  education?  At  least  ...
[Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: So ...  No,  no,  no,  you  concentrate  on  some
farming or looking after your church.

In his state of the nation  speech,  the  President  declared  we  have  ``a
continuing task to push back the frontiers of poverty''. In the  context  of
education and training, we have done so much to ensure  that  resources  are
targeted at the poor. I think it is a matter of  record.  For  example,  the
equitable share formula,  which  determines  the  allocation  to  provinces,
favours the poorer rural provinces such as the Eastern  Cape,  KwaZulu-Natal
and Limpopo. The norms and standards for school funding, which we began,  in
respect  of  nonpersonnel  expenditure  are  also  strongly  biased  towards
redress, with seven times more money going to the poorer schools.

A major concern that we've had to address  -  and  only  an  ANC  Government
could address these fundamental issues - over the last four  or  five  years
relates to the cost and  financing  of  education,  particularly  at  school
level. I have this week received a draft report - a massive report  -  which
goes into the cost of  education  in  great  detail.  As  a  result  of  the
findings contained in the report and the recommendations  made,  I  will  in
the very near future be  proposing  far-reaching  changes  in  the  area  of
financing of education. These will be for the benefit of  all  stakeholders,
including parents, and will deal  with  further  alleviating  the  disparity
that exists in certain areas.

I hope that we will be able  to  provide  relief  in  the  form  of  further
conditional grants to the provinces with poorer schools  and  to  deal  with
expenditures relating to, amongst  others,  the  cost  of  school  uniforms,
transport and the payment of fees. I will deal with my proposals in  greater
detail in my budget speech during the current session of Parliament.

One  area  where  there  are  still  enormous   disparities   is   that   of
infrastructure. With our comprehensive school register  of  needs,  we  have
accurate information on where the most pressing needs are. As a result,  and
through   targeted   interventions,   overseas    development    assistance,
interventions in  infrastructure  -  we  have  doubled  the  amount  we  are
spending on infrastructure in the last two years -  we  have  been  able  to
channel  resources  to  those  areas  that  need  them  most.  Hundreds   of
classrooms and schools have been built across the country  -  and  I  should
say not just by Mr  Nelson  Mandela  -  using  increased  direct  Government
funding as well as development assistance.

The Treasury also, regarding  this  discussion,  will  allocate  ring-fenced
amounts of funding for infrastructure development, and  has  made  provision
in the MTEF for  sufficient  amounts  so  that  we  can  eliminate,  as  the
President promised, the backlogs in order that children  will  not  have  to
study under trees or in unsafe conditions.

Let me announce therefore - and it's a very important political statement  -
that although conditional grants are made to the provinces for  specifically
designated purposes for use in those provinces, and although  the  provinces
are responsible for the expenditure of  these  funds,  I  will  hold  myself
accountable for those funds, both the manner in which  they  are  spent  and
any funds that  remain  unspent.  I  can  assure  you  that  this  year  the
expenditure patterns will be very different from  the  previous  few  years.
These funds are simply  meant  to  provide  for  infrastructural  and  other
schooling needs, most often as a form of relief for provinces for  poor  and
struggling areas, and as a rule, there should be no  excuse  for  funds  not
being spent. I will hold myself politically responsible to  this  House  for
the expenditure of these funds.

Also, of course, we have made our commitment, which has been raised  before,
to 10 years of compulsory education. This is  a  promise  the  ANC  made  in
1994, with the phasing-in of Grade R, the reception year. In  some  schools,
such as the one I visited last week in Manenberg, a poor  area,  the  school
has already introduced preschool facilities for children not old  enough  to
enter Grade R.

Again, these are antipoverty interventions. We are making enormous  changes,
that have been highly welcomed, in the curriculum for  Grades  R  to  9  and
Grades 10 to 12. These particularly will be very  important,  and  I  should
say I will not allow the introduction of these changes unless  teachers  are
trained  and  learning  materials  are  available.  This  strategy  is  very
important because it will help the poorer schools to have  collectives.  The
hon opposition leader speaks of the individual as  the  incarnation  of  all
that's good. The President replied to this, in fact, two years ago. And,  of
course, there is the collective tradition; the  communitarian  tradition  we
forget also. And outcomes-based education is based not  on  selfish,  narrow
individualism, but on collective work also. And we are proud,  as  the  ANC,
that we should do so.

The next matter, I think, is of enormous importance because  it  deals  with
the most marginalised. Under apartheid,  schools  for  black  children  with
special needs and disabilities  were  virtually  nonexistent.  If  they  did
exist, they were run like asylums. Of  course,  this  particularly  affected
the poorest of the poor. This year  sees  the  establishment  of  30  ``full
service schools'', schools where all the  barriers  to  learning  have  been
removed and where children with special needs  and  disabilities  can  learn
together with  other  children  as  full  members  of  our  diverse  nation.
[Applause.]

Also,  the  number  of  poorly  performing  schools  -  and  they  are   not
responsible for that; these are on  the  peripheries  of  our  society,  but
these were the poorest  schools  serving  the  poorest  communities  in  our
nation - declined dramatically from over 1 000  three  years  ago  to  fewer
than 200 in the last year. Here the state was not benign or  neutral;  there
was enormous intervention by the state and we have quadrupled the amount  we
spent on textbooks and other learning materials over the  last  three  years
and ensured that the materials, in the main, go to schools at the  beginning
of the year. In fact, one of the women members of the  DP  said  to  me  how
impressed she was in the East Rand, where all the schools she  went  to  had
their books there and learning started the same day. Well,  mirabile  dictu;
they are learning things that have been happening on  the  ground  for  some
time.
In addition, let me say that the reorganisation of higher education is  part
of our development towards having more students  of  higher  education  this
year. Do you see? This is supposed to be an indifferent government!

Ninety-four thousand youngsters from the poorest families went on to  higher
education this year. We spent R834 million. No other country has  been  able
to do that. Eight hundred and thirty-four  million;  94  000  students  went
there.

So let me end by saying that, of course, we  celebrate  everything  we  have
done. The tide is beginning to turn. But change will be  incremental  rather
than rapid. So I end by quoting the Nigerian writer Ben Okri:


  They are only exhausted who think
  That they have arrived
  At the final destination,
  The end of their road,
  With all their dreams achieved,
  And no new dreams to hold.

In celebrating our achievements we are therefore also mindful  of  the  fact
that we have not, in Okri's words  ``arrived  at  the  final  destination''.
While much has been achieved, we cannot afford to abandon our dreams as  set
out in the Freedom Charter, and we will continue on our chosen path.

Then, the opposition leader referred to the winds of change.  We  will  make
sure that the winds of change  will  blast  them  into  oblivion  when  they
decide to change. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Thank you.

Business suspended at 12:38 and resumed at 14:01.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam  Speaker,  Mr
President,  Mr  Deputy  President,  colleagues,  hon  members,  ladies   and
gentlemen, this morning we listened to very interesting speeches in some  of
which the criminal justice system was alluded to.

In certain instances,  one  could  not  avoid  asking  oneself  whether  the
relevant speakers did not say whatever they said  purely  for  the  sake  of
being heard without due regard being paid  to  what  we  as  the  government
cluster dealing with the criminal justice system are  doing  and  achieving.
For example, Rev Meshoe, who should certainly know what  happens  in  cities
such as Seattle and Genoa, even suggested that the President is  preoccupied
with ensuring the safety of foreigners visiting our country  while  his  own
people live in fear.

I want to believe that the hon member did not  mean  that,  therefore,  when
foreigners who happen to be in our country for  whatever  duration  and  for
whatever reason are exposed to crime, we should not act. Again,  I  am  sure
that the Reverend knows better than  anybody  else  outside  here  that  the
jails are bursting at the seams. They  are  full  of  people  who  have  not
necessarily been found guilty  of  crimes  affecting  foreigners.  Actually,
they have been arrested, investigated, jailed, etc, for crimes  relating  to
the people of the Republic of South Africa themselves.

The hon Holomisa speaks about plea bargaining as not being meant for  people
such as Tony Yengeni. I know of no element in the law which says  that  this
law is meant for certain persons only. As this House,  we  never  make  laws
around individuals, we make laws for good governance  in  the  Republic.  It
might have happened in the past, in the Bantustans, but we do not  do  that.
[Interjections.]

The members wanted floor  crossing,  and  they  got  it,  and  they  crossed
indeed. The members became cross after that. [Laughter.]

There is indeed, in  certain  circles,  a  perception  that  this  beautiful
country of ours has been overwhelmed  by  the  criminal  element,  that  the
criminal justice system just cannot  cope  with  the  load  of  work  it  is
carrying and that the system is managed by incompetent men and women.  There
is also a perception that South Africa is the most violent  country  in  the
world. Some even proclaim that South Africa is  the  crime  capital  of  the
world. People who espouse these notions, needless  to  say,  ought  to  know
better, that the facts cannot bear them out.

While it is true that our crime and violence levels  are  unacceptably  high
for a country in peacetime  and  that  the  criminal  justice  system  faces
numerous variegated problems, it is  also  true  that  Government  has  made
critical interventions which are already bearing  fruit.  It  is  also  true
that if you look at the picture  that  we  had  prior  to  our  coming  into
office, levels of crime were much higher. That might not have  been  visible
to  people  who  lived  in  the  comfort  of  Lower  Houghton,  Northcliffe,
Bryanston, and places such as those. But, those of us who were  confined  by
apartheid to the Bantu townships can tell stories of our exposure  to  crime
which the hon member, the Leader of the Official Opposition, may never  have
known in his life.

When he then says that it is not good enough to  have  stabilised  crime  at
particular levels, the hon member is simply positing an ideal  situation  in
an unideal condition. In other words, he  is  saying  that,  from  1994,  we
should have achieved something that this world has not achieved  as  yet,  a
totally crime-free country. I want to say that none exists,  and  the  world
is not even claiming that.

If you look at our statistics, for instance, and you look at the picture  in
1999, it is true that the incidence  of  murder  has  already  decreased  by
almost 17%. You can look  at  these,  do  your  sums,  etc,  but  these  are
actually ascribable, not solely to the interventions that have been made  by
my cluster, but to the interventions that have been made  by  Government  in
its entirety.
The situation of ordinary people who live in conditions  such  as  the  ones
that you would find in Nyanga, Gugulethu, Soweto and  Khayelitsha  improves.
Indeed we benefit because more and more people  steer  clear  of  the  crime
route because they suddenly have  better  things  to  use  and  apply  their
energy to. We are reaping success.

Again, the confidence that ordinary people are showing  in  this  system  is
such that they now begin to give us intelligence and information so that  we
can deal with the criminals element, something  the  law-enforcement  forces
of apartheid never experienced because in truth they  were  not  ours,  they
were theirs. Now ours are supported by  the  people.  It  would  be  grossly
erroneous for  anyone  to  say  that  the  system  is  actually  managed  by
incompetent people.

You must remember when making these reckless and unhelpful  statements  that
you are talking about people who, for the members'  sake  and  mine,  tackle
the bullets of criminals, and bombs that  are  placed  by  terrorists.  They
confront them and defuse these elements. They do so with minimal  resources,
at great risk to themselves. You cannot say that these are  the  incompetent
people that the members are talking about.
If you look at some of the interventions that we  have  actually  made,  you
will agree with us that the dividend is obvious. Anybody  who  has  actually
been visited by specialised units  such  as  the  Scorpions  will  tell  the
members that the success rate is already counted as being  above  90%.  That
is success. If one looks at the  success  of  the  Assets  Forfeiture  Unit,
which makes sure that crime does not pay and seizes assets  and  makes  sure
that those assets are eventually forfeited to  the  state,  you  will  agree
that there is a lot of success there.

If you look at the Thuthuzela projects which we  have  established  in  many
parts of the country, which look after women who have been exposed to  gross
violence, rape, etc, you will agree again that these joint projects that  we
have mounted as this Government are paying dividends. If  you  look  at  the
special courts dealing with crimes and violence against women and  children,
you will tell a similar story if you do that dispassionately  and  honestly.
If you look at the facilities at police stations and  in  the  courts  which
are meant to assist women and children in  those  circumstances,  you  would
again tell the same story.

If you look at the special courts dealing with serious economic  offences  -
I would like to say that we want to roll out more this year because  of  the
example that we see in Pretoria - you would come  to  the  same  conclusion.
This is one court where, because people work  differently,  the  prosecutor,
the police officer and the court are working together much more  efficiently
and effectively today. This is a kind of court where out of every 100  cases
that have appeared before them already since they were established in  2001,
94% convictions have been notched.

If you look again at special courts  dealing  with  tax-related  crime,  you
will tell the same story. If you look at the working  hours  at  the  courts
and the Saturday courts that the President alluded to,  you  would  come  to
the same conclusion. You surely cannot come to the conclusion  that  we  are
sitting on our hands, doing absolutely nothing. If you look at the  rate  of
convictions in the courts, they tell the same story.

We have alluded to the issue of  prison  conditions.  Those  conditions  are
receiving attention. It is going to  take  a  lot  of  resources,  time  and
energy to address them to the satisfaction of all of us. But we  are  paying
attention to that.

We have now in place a rehabilitation programme whereas, in the past,  there
was not any. Once a person went to jail, he would go and serve his  sentence
or a portion  thereof,  and  then  be  released  without  ever  having  been
assisted so that he is properly inducted back  into  the  society  where  he
came from. Now we are actually working on these ourselves to ensure that  we
produce a better human being out of the person that we have  had  to  arrest
because he has fallen foul of the law. [Applause.]

We have in place the restorative justice programme which  ensures  that  the
convicts that we have behind bars interact with the  communities  where  the
victims come from so that when they go back, they are  actually  well-suited
to being released back into their communities, unlike before where a  person
would be released when the community was ill-prepared  to  receive  him.  We
have these programmes.

We have programmes that ensure, to the extent that this  is  possible,  that
we deviate youth away from the path of crime, drugs, etc,  and  ensure  that
they can be helped before they go to jail, the university  of  crime.  Those
who are indeed participating in  these  programmes  are  actually  assisted.
They do not even have conviction records behind them. They are  told  to  go
away and sin no more. This particularly helps a lot of our young persons.

We have embarked on training and retraining  of  prison  officials  so  that
they  are  able  to  do  their  work  effectively  as  people   who   should
rehabilitate people there. They were not prepared for  that  kind  of  role.
Theirs was to carry what they used to call the  donkey  piel  -  the  rubber
truncheon - and sjambok whoever crossed their  path.  [Laughter.]  That  was
how they understood their work. They were never schooled  in  rehabilitation
of people at all. That is changing. They are getting reorientated.

We are actually dealing with the problem of corruption. Honest  people  will
tell you that you know about corruption because of, by and large, what  this
Government has done - it has exposed and tackled it because we have  created
conditions in which ordinary people who are exposed  to  corruption  or  who
know that corrupt acts are taking place can now  come  forward  as  whistle-
blowers and tell us what is happening,  and  indeed  appropriate  action  is
taken. I want to say that those who say that we act  selectively  will  have
to produce the necessary evidence. So far, whenever there  has  been  enough
evidence that crime of all sorts, including corruption, has been  committed,
appropriate action has been taken by forces of law enforcement  without  any
political intervention or intercession. We have never  pleaded  with  forces
of law enforcement to spare anyone, and we do not intend to do it at all.

The philosophy of my Government is that the law must take  its  own  course,
regardless of whoever is involved. But, again, we should  act  solely  under
and subject to the laws of the Republic, not in accordance  with  the  whims
of some of us gathering here. This is a law-governed country. It  is  not  a
jungle consisting of feral weasels that scream at people all  the  time.  It
consists of people who want to ensure that indeed  we  succeed  against  the
criminal element and that we succeed in our larger endeavours so that  those
conditions in kwaMashu, Soweto, Nyanga, Gugulethu, which  are  difficult  to
police  today,  can  be  policed  so  that  when  there  is,  for  instance,
improvement in the provision of housing, provision of electricity,  etc,  we
benefit because we can go into those areas.

I must say that we have heard about the visits by some people  from  the  DA
to some of the police stations. Obviously, they have no regard for us.  They
would have given us their report. [Interjections.] I have not seen it. I  do
not know how they think this so-called report  of  theirs  is  going  to  be
implemented because whether they like us or not, it is only through  and  by
Government that it can be implemented. It would not  implement  itself,  and
it would not be implemented by  the  small  office  of  the  Leader  of  the
Official Opposition. Eventually, they will have to give it to  us  and  work
with us in order to ensure that those problems  that  they  have  identified
are resolved. We do want to work with everybody.

This morning, we said that if you were to go out  looking  for  faults,  you
would find them all over. But, if you go out with a view to saying that  you
want to participate in finding solutions so that we strengthen this  country
and build on the ruins of the previous society, you will achieve  a  totally
different result. [Applause.] If their  intention  is  that  one,  we  would
welcome working with them, but I doubt that. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Madam Speaker, what about the basic income grant?

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam  Speaker,
maybe you want it, but I do not think  that  you  are  a  deserving  person!
[Applause.] [Laughter.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, hon President  and  hon  members,  in  1996,
President Mbeki memorably declared, ``I am an African,'' in  a  speech  here
in this House. As the ditty in the townships goes:


  I am an African watsho uThabo Mbeki.  I  am  an  African,  walandela  uDe
  klerk, walandela uLeon, walandela uMakwetu

History was made, and so was the commitment to a  social  contract  made  in
continuance and affirmation of the  Kempton  Park  Codesa  miracle.  It  was
shared by leaders of all  parties  and  enthusiastically  supported  by  our
people.

At the recent ANC conference, the President again declared that:


  People of South Africa made  a  common  determination  that  our  country
  belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that they  refuse  to
  be enslaved by the divisions and antagonisms of the past.

But, if I were to say it  in  Afrikaans,  ``Meer  daad  as  woord,''  [Deeds
rather than words] is what is needed. Paying lip service  and  nothing  more
to nonracial and democratic ideas is  the  highest  form  of  deception  and
hypocrisy. Once such pronouncements have been  made  and  enshrined  in  our
Constitution, then they must be upheld  and  defended  in  both  letter  and
spirit. Playing the race card or resorting to subtle  and  covert  tribalism
or ethnicity is total dishonesty and a betrayal of the sacred bond  we  made
with one another in 1994. [Interjections.]

I guess there is still this malady of slaying the bearer of  the  bad  news.
We must eradicate racism and its crafty evil twin, tribalism  or  ethnicity.
It is only through adherence to the Constitution that  perceptions  such  as
the Rex factor, Xhosa nostra, Makwenyapone diatribe  and  racist  tendencies
bedevilling nonracialism will be dispelled.

The ANC Government should desist from breathing life into the  morbid  organ
of racism and tribalism as a means of achieving sectarian goals.  Yet,  when
the President is in a corner - he seems most likely to be in a corner  these
days - he plays the race card. I quote:


  The white Commonwealth

is  how  he  demonises  South  African  allies,  Britain,   Australia,   not
forgetting the hated ultraleft, neoliberals etc.  The  ANC  marches  on  the
American consulate in South Africa in the very country that passes the  AGOA
and brought 40 000 new jobs into  our  textile  industry.  Judge  people  by
their actions and not by their skin  pigmentation  or  cultural  background.
[Interjections.]

Mr President, we all  agree  that  poverty  is  one  of  the  country's  top
priority items amongst other sociopolitical and  economic  ills  that  beset
our beloved country. It takes more than rhetoric and  slogans  to  push  the
frontiers of poverty back. Black economic empowerment is  important  but  it
must not mean the enrichment of a tiny elite amid a sea of poverty.

All our people need to start tasting the fruits of empowerment. No  one  can
make them rich overnight, but we must start making a dent in the  levels  of
deprivation and poverty. People should  not  rely  on  party  membership  or
membership cards to have access to opportunities of  self-development.  Take
heed of our proposal for the basic income grant  and  of  our  proposal  for
opportunity vouchers for the young unemployed. Let us use these policies  to
protect our people from indignity and fear, and  alleviate  the  frustration
of school-leavers forced to roam the streets for lack of employment.

The real constructive way for empowerment and transformation  is  to  create
new opportunities for everyone who is willing to uplift him or  herself.  No
one, not a single person, committed to  working  hard  and  playing  by  the
rules should be left behind. Our position must  be  clear:  Empowerment  and
opportunity for all the people, not simply for  a  select  few.  Empowerment
must know no colour and must be for the benefit of  people  without  looking
at the specific pigmentation.

To compete successfully in the competitive global village, merit  should  be
the norm, and not race, colour or gender.  Mediocrity  has  no  place  in  a
nation that seeks to be a winning nation and a  better  place  for  all.  In
rectifying injustices and imbalances, we must not fall victim  to  the  very
trap of the sins of apartheid or  racism  that  rendered  the  powerless  as
hewers of wood and drawers of water, objects of marginalisation  and  social
degradation. The abuse of power in Zimbabwe and elsewhere  attests  to  this
danger.

I think it was the sage, hon Rolihlahla Mandela, who said: ``When you  fight
evil, be careful that you do not end up  being  tainted  by  the  very  evil
yourself ... '' or words to some such effect.

Let us pay tribute to all South Africans who have contributed positively  in
their own various ways to this most valuable democracy that we all  cherish.
We remember, too, the heroes and heroines who do  not  necessarily  have  to
belong to the ANC. It is also very true that  they  also  served  those  who
waited. We also remember those  liberation  fighters  across  the  political
spectrum who lay languishing in remote areas and the ghettos,  forgotten  by
privileged people like you. Forget them not, for they are our  brothers  and
sisters. [Applause.]
Mr M R BALOYI: Madam Speaker, Comrade President and the hon House,  Ndza  mi
losa [I greet you]. As people of this country, we understand  the  cause  of
the current political dispensation - the fact that all enabling  legislation
and policies are there to give effect to the directives of the  highest  law
of  the  land,  our  Constitution,  and  the  fact  that  our   actions   as
implementers are guided to realise the constitutional objectives.

It is on the basis of this understanding that we are ready, as a nation,  to
say that our President could not have been  more  correct  and  timely  than
when he stated in his address that the tide has turned. Unlike in the  past,
today we have a wall-to-wall structure of our municipalities  with  distinct
powers and competencies and strategically located where service delivery  is
taking place.

The co-operative government clause of our Constitution prescribes  that  the
provincial and national spheres of government should work closely  with  the
local sphere. The practical situation reflects a reality that whereas  there
is compliance with broad principles of co-operative governance,  some  local
municipalities do not always have a say on the  timing,  the  pace  and  the
scope of service delivery programmes by the  other  spheres  of  government,
let alone the parastatals. In this regard, it will be proper if we  were  to
consider prescribing a compulsory service delivery agreement to  be  entered
into between municipalities and any other party  that  has  a  programme  of
service delivery. I say so because the service delivery  agreement  referred
to in the Local Government: Municipal  Systems  Act  deals  only  with  such
service delivery issues that are the competencies of municipalities.

We acknowledge that whereas  most,  if  not  all,  our  municipalities  have
finalised their integrated development plans, there  is  still  a  challenge
for some of them to get  them  implemented,  owing  either  to  capacity  or
resource constraints, and we hope that the central  and  provincial  spheres
of government will lend a helping hand to  this  sphere  of  our  system  of
governance.

The other challenge facing some of  our  municipalities  is  the  fact  that
there are still demarcation disputes that  have  to  be  resolved,  some  of
which need to be prioritised. Another reality is that with all  the  limited
resources and challenges, the majority of our municipalities are  delivering
a qualitative service. The Rustenburg local municipality in the  North  West
province signed a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Royal  Bafokeng
administration, thereby providing a model that confirms that it is  possible
for a local government to co-exist and function  in  co-operation  with  the
institution of a traditional nature, and that the existence of one does  not
necessarily lead to the disappearance of the other.

Allow me to spend some time focusing  on  the  White  Paper  on  Traditional
Leadership and Governance. This is a policy document, the drawing  of  which
is meant to deal  with  the  complexities  associated  with  the  historical
distortions on the role and place of this institution,  as  a  precursor  to
enable Parliament to enact national framework legislation and  provinces  to
enact provincial legislation to deal with their specific needs. We  want  to
put it on  record  that  the  draft  White  Paper  is  a  product  of  wider
consultation as follows:  All  interested  stakeholders  were  requested  to
comment on the discussion paper. Traditional leaders were consulted, to  the
extent of holding bilateral meetings with them: A conference  was  organised
and traditional leaders attended. A task team was appointed to evaluate  the
submissions to the draft White Paper and traditional leaders  were  part  of
it. Public hearings were held. The final submission to  Cabinet  is  thus  a
synthesis of submissions and the original proposal in which  the  task  team
participated.

Those South Africans, and possibly some members of  this  House,  who  argue
that traditional leaders were not consulted have their facts  wrong,  either
due to party-political agendas or patronage. Once more, we want  to  put  it
on record that it is simply not true that Government's  intention  with  the
White  Paper  process  is  to  diminish  the  institution   of   traditional
leadership and governance and the following serve to prove this point:

The institution is recognised by the Constitution; there are provincial  and
national houses of traditional leaders; there is provision  for  traditional
leaders to participate in the activities  of  local  government  structures;
the White Paper proposes that committees  be  established  at  the  district
municipality level so as to get them participating; the Government  retained
the policy of paying  traditional  leaders;  the  White  Paper  commits  the
Government to ensure  that  their  involvement  in  government  policies  is
actually guaranteed; the White Paper commits the  Government  to  build  the
capacity of traditional leaders.
We want to remind some people that if they  understand  the  institution  of
traditional governance to be an embodiment of  our  diverse  cultures,  then
they should also understand that culture itself is dynamic and adaptive.  We
also want to make a call to the people of South Africa  to  understand  that
issues of traditional  leadership  and  governance  are  not  the  exclusive
responsibilities of traditional  leaders  and  members  of  royal  families.
These are issues of the community and we need  to  actually  participate  in
them.

[I wish to conclude my debate by referring you to the Bill on  the  transfer
of ownership of land to the people. This Bill is currently  the  subject  of
discussions that are being led by the Department of Land Affairs.

The aim of this Bill is to return the ownership of land to  the  people.  At
present the ownership of  land  rests  with  the  Government.  This  is  the
ownership of places which were controlled by the trust in  rural  areas  and
at the same time these areas were controlled by traditional chiefs.

In terms of this Bill the Government will transfer ownership of land to  the
people or to a group of people or to individual people  in  accordance  with
who is making use of which portion of the land. If you perhaps have a  field
of your own, that field will be given to  you  so  that  you  may  be  in  a
position to register it with the Deeds Registrar. In so doing, one would  be
in a position to use it productively in a commercial way.

If there is some land that is used for  grazing  purposes,  people  will  be
allowed to take over ownership of the land in that particular area  so  that
such ownership of land could be registered officially. If  a  person  has  a
residential site where he or she is  residing,  he  or  she  will  be  given
ownership of that residential site, like people staying in urban areas.

Let us support  this  Bill.  I  would  like  to  encourage  hon  members  of
Parliament to make use of our offices in  our  constituencies  at  home  for
explaining to our people the truth in regard to this matter. If  we  do  not
do that, we are going to be left behind by people  who  go  round  spreading
false information, saying that this Bill is a  monster  that  is  coming  to
take away ownership of land from  our  traditional  chiefs,  yet  forgetting
that all along the ownership of land was with the Government and up  to  the
present moment is still with the Government. Furthermore, chiefs were  given
the powers to control the land and not the rights of ownership of land.

What the Government is  doing  with  this  Bill  is  to  ensure  that  every
individual will personally own what belongs to him or her. Chieftainship  is
here to stay forever, and is going to  rule  us  while  holding  that  which
belongs to us. People should not be cheated; it is their land.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, every day on my way to Parliament,  I
drive past people sitting on street corners, asking me with their  eyes  for
a job - strong, healthy men and women. If you look closely, you can see  the
despair and the hopelessness in their eyes. They  are  fathers  and  mothers
that must support their families. In their own eyes, they are failing  their
families. If we can solve this problem and create jobs, most other  problems
in this country will be easy to solve.

Dignity will return to these men and women, and crime statistics  will  come
down. Therefore, the FF supports the measures announced by the President  to
stimulate economic growth. I counted  more  than  10  different  initiatives
mentioned in his speech in this  regard,  and  we  hope  that  they  can  be
successfully implemented to solve this problem.

Dubbele standaarde maak mense kwaad. Kom ek gee vir u 'n voorbeeld:  volgens
Amerika se media is Pakistan se militÃªre diktator, met atoomwapens, goed  en
aanvaarbaar, omdat Amerika Pakistan nodig gehad  het  om  Afganistan  in  te
val. Die diktator Sadam Hoessein is  om  baie  redes  nie  aanvaarbaar  nie.
Natuurlik is dit dubbele standaarde. Osama bin Laden was  'n  vryheidsvegter
volgens die Amerikaanse media toe Amerika hom  gebruik  en  bewapen  het  om
teen die Sowjetmagte in Afganistan  te  veg.  Osama  bin  Laden  is  nou  'n
terroris, omdat hy teen Amerika veg, volgens dieselfde media.

Die internasionale politiek is vol dubbele standaarde. Die enigste  reÃ«l  in
die internasional politiek is dat lande vir hulle eie belange  kies.  Daarom
is die VF se standpunt in alle internasionale sake, maar  ook  spesifiek  in
die Irak krisis: Suid-Afrika moet kies wat in die  beste  belang  van  Suid-
Afrika is. Daarom sal ons 'n fout maak as ons kant kies vir Sadam  Hoessein.
Dit beteken nie dat Suid-Afrika nou vir die VSA moet kant  kies  nie.  Suid-
Afrika behoort vir Suid-Afrika se beste belange te kies. Daardie  belang  is
tans dat ons nie betrokke raak in 'n oorlog duisende kilometer  van  ons  af
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Waar Irak vÃªr is, is Zimbabwe naby.  As  ons  dieselfde  toets  gebruik  ten
opsigte van Zimbabwe, moet ons hier wel kies. [Tussenwerpsels.] Waar dit  in
Suid-Afrika se belang is om nie kant te kies in Irak nie, is  dit  in  Suid-
Afrika se belang om kant te kies in Zimbabwe. [Tussenwerpsels.] In  Zimbabwe
moet ons kies vir demokrasie, ons moet kies vir menseregte en ons moet  kies
vir die ``rule of law''. Dan  kan  Nepad  slaag,  dan  sal  Suid-Afrika  die
nodige internasionale vertroue opbou en die nodige beleggings  kry  om  meer
werk te kan skep, want dit is hoekom dit in ons belang is om  reg  te  kies.
Maar dit beteken om teen president Mugabe te kies. Deur nie ten opsigte  van
Zimbabwe te kies nie, verloor ons elke dag 'n verdere  deel  van  die  beeld
wat Suid-Afrika sedert 1994 opgebou het as 'n demokratiese land.

President Mbeki het gesÃª:


  It is for the people of Zimbabwe to decide who will govern them, not  for
  us to prescribe.

Ek stem daarmee saam, maar dan moet  dit  'n  demokratiese,  billike  manier
wees waarop gekies word. Daarom stem ek nie saam met president  Obasanjo  as
hy in sy brief die indruk  skep  dat  alles  normaal  is  in  Zimbabwe  nie.
President Obasanjo aanvaar president Mugabe se beloftes van hervorming.  Dit
is nie goed genoeg nie. President Mugabe kan net aan  werklike  dade  gemeet
word, en daarvan sien ek niks nie.

Ek is ook moeg daarvoor dat die  Zimbabwe-krisis  altyd  deur  'n  rassebril
bekyk word. Kom ons haal die blanke boere en die grondhervormings  uit,  ter
wille van die argument. Wat bly dan oor? Die oorblywende probleem  het  niks
met  ras  te  doen  nie.  Dit  is  eenvoudige  probleme   van   demokratiese
oneerlikheid en van menseregteskendings.

Die nuutste sensus in Zimbabwe wys dat in die  vorige  verkiesing  daar  1,8
miljoen kiesers gestem het wat nie bestaan het nie. Spookkiesers.  Hulle  is
nie daar nie. Dit is oneerlike demokrasie.  Elke  hofsaak  in  Zimbabwe  oor
ongerymdhede in die verkiesing, is deur die opposisie gewen. Gaan kyk.  Sewe
van president Mugabe se parlementslede het reeds so  hulle  setels  verloor,
en nog 23 hofsake  kom.  Dit  is  alles  bewyse  van  oneerlike  demokrasie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Double standards make people angry. Let me give you an  example:  According
to the American media, Pakistan's military dictator,  with  atomic  weapons,
is  good  and  acceptable,  because  America  needed  Pakistan   to   invade
Afghanistan. The dictator Saddam Hussein is unacceptable for  many  reasons.
Naturally, this implies double standards. Osama  bin  Laden  was  a  freedom
fighter according to the American media when America used and armed  him  to
fight against the Soviet  forces  in  Afghanistan.  According  to  the  same
media, Osama bin Laden is now a terrorist because  he  is  fighting  against
America.

International politics is  full  of  double  standards.  The  only  rule  in
international  politics  is  that  countries  make  choices  for  their  own
interests. Therefore the FF's position in  all  international  matters,  but
also specifically in the Iraqi crisis is  this:  South  Africa  must  choose
what is in the best interests of South Africa. We would therefore be  making
a mistake if we chose Saddam Hussein's side. This does not mean  that  South
Africa must take the USA's side. South Africa should  decide  in  favour  of
South Africa's best interests.  That  interest  is  currently  that  we  not
become involved in a war thousands of kilometres away. [Interjections.]

While Iraq is far away, Zimbabwe is nearby. If we apply the same  test  with
regard to Zimbabwe, in this case we must choose. [Interjections.]  While  it
is in South Africa's interests not to take sides in Iraq,  it  is  in  South
Africa's interests to take sides in Zimbabwe. [Interjections.]  In  Zimbabwe
we must take the side of democracy, we must choose human rights and we  must
choose the rule of law. Nepad can then succeed, and then South  Africa  will
build the  necessary  international  confidence  and  obtain  the  necessary
investments to be able to create more jobs, because that is  why  it  is  in
our  interests  to  choose  correctly.  But  this  means  choosing   against
President Mugabe. By not choosing with regard to Zimbabwe, each day we  lose
another piece of the image which South Africa has built up as  a  democratic
country since 1994.

President Mbeki has said:


  It is for the people of Zimbabwe to decide who will govern them, not  for
  us to prescribe.

I agree with that,  but  then  a  choice  must  be  made  in  a  democratic,
reasonable manner. For this reason I do not agree  with  President  Obasanjo
when he creates the impression in his letter that everything  is  normal  in
Zimbabwe. President Obasanjo accepts President Mugabe's promises of  reform.
That is not good enough. President Mugabe  can  only  be  measured  by  real
deeds, and I have seen none of those.

I am also tired of the Zimbabwean crisis  always  being  looked  at  from  a
racial perspective. For the sake of the argument, let us take white  farmers
and the land reforms out. What remains? The remaining question  has  nothing
to do with race. It involves simple problems of  democratic  dishonesty  and
of human rights violations.

The latest census in Zimbabwe indicates that in the  previous  election  1,8
million voters who did not exist voted. Ghost voters. They  are  not  there.
That  is  dishonest  democracy.  Every  court   case   in   Zimbabwe   about
irregularities in the election was won  by  the  opposition.  Have  a  look.
Seven of President Mugabe's members of parliament have  already  lost  their
seats in this way, and another 23 court cases will still be heard.  This  is
all evidence of dishonest democracy.]

Virtually every member of  the  national  executive  of  the  MDC  has  been
brought to court on one charge or  another.  This  is  harassment.  Fletcher
Dulini-Ncube, the Treasurer  General  of  the  MDC,  was  held  in  solitary
confinement for five months. He lost an eye, his diabetes was  not  treated,
and he lost part of his hearing. In  2002,  not  a  single  prosecution  has
taken place in respect of the 300 or so political killings. Even more  cases
of torture have occurred since the start of  this  campaign.  All  of  these
were not cases of black on white, or white on black, but black on black.

Mnr Malusi Gigaba van die ANC-jeugliga beweer  die  MDC  is  'n  rassistiese
skepping. Volgens hierdie logika beheer  'n  paar  duisend  wittes  miljoene
swartes, want al die probleme het begin toe president Mugabe die  referendum
verloor het in 2000. Ons weet mos dit is nie so eenvoudig nie. Deur  hierdie
referendum wou hy baie ekstra magte kry, maar hy kon nie  wen  nie.  Dink  u
dit is moontlik dat minder as 1% mense die res so kon manipuleer?

Mnr Gigaba sÃª omdat ek wit is, mag ek nie  kritiek  oor  Zimbabwe  uitspreek
nie. Dit is rassisme! Omdat ek van Afrika is, en  omdat  ek  op  Afrika  wil
trots wees, is Zimbabwe vir my 'n verleentheid wat ek nie in  die  buiteland
kan verdedig nie. U moet gaan probeer, nie omdat dit 'n  swart-wit  probleem
is  nie,  maar  omdat  dit  'n  menseregte-  en  demokrasie   probleem   is.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Mr Malusi Gigaba of the ANC Youth League alleges that the MDC is  a  racist
creation. According to this logic a few thousand whites control millions  of
blacks, because all the  problems  began  when  President  Mugabe  lost  the
referendum in 2000. Surely we know that it is not so simple.  He  wanted  to
obtain many extra powers by way of this referendum, but he  could  not  win.
Do you think  it  is  possible  that  less  than  1%  of  the  people  could
manipulate the rest in this way?

Mr Gigaba says that because I am white I may  not  express  criticism  about
Zimbabwe. That is racism! Because I am from Africa, and because  I  want  to
be proud of Africa, Zimbabwe is  an  embarrassment  to  me  which  I  cannot
defend abroad. You should go and  try,  not  because  it  is  a  black-white
problem, but because it is a human rights and democracy problem.]

With the launch of the African Union in Durban, July  last  year,  president
Mbeki said:


  Through our actions let us proclaim to the world that this is a continent
  of democracy, a continent of democratic institutions and culture, indeed,
  a continent of good governance, where the people participate and the rule
  of law is upheld.
The FF supports this statement wholeheartedly, but  we  will  fight  against
those that oppose this, and therefore the comments that I made.

Tot op datum het ek in my toesprake nie onnodig opposisiepartye  in  hierdie
Raad aangeval nie. Tog het die leier van die  Nuwe  NP,  mnr  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk, dit nodig geag om verlede jaar 'n aanval op my,  en  die  VF,  te
loods. Hy het verskeie valse stellings die wÃªreld ingestuur.  Ek  is  jammer
dat hy nie hier kan wees dat ons  van  aangesig  tot  aangesig  daaroor  kan
praat nie.

Die vraag is: waarom is die kiesers klaar  met  die  Nuwe  NP?  Dit  is  nie
noodwendig omdat hulle met die ANC saamwerk nie. Mnr F W de  Klerk  het  dit
reeds in 1994 gedoen. Hulle is klaar met die Nuwe NP omdat  hulle  deur  die
Nuwe NP verkul voel as gevolg van hul dubbele standaarde. Ek gee  vir  u  'n
voorbeeld: in 2000 spreek mnr Stofile die Oos-Kaapse Nuwe  NP  kongres  toe,
mnr Manie Schoeman  sal  daarvan  onthou.  Dit  veroorsaak  'n  krisis.  Die
joernalis Theuns van der Westhuizen van Die Burger  voer  'n  onderhoud  met
mnr Van Schalkwyk om die saak te probeer regstel. U kan gaan kyk,  18  Maart
2000.

Ek haal uit die onderhoud aan:


  Oor gerugte en beskuldigings dat die Nuwe  NP  leierskap  ter  wille  van
  persoonlike ambisies en posisies 'n samewerkingsooreenkoms  met  die  ANC
  sal aanknoop ten koste  van  die  party  en  sy  ondersteuners,  het  Van
  Schalkwyk skerp veroordelend gereageer:


  Dit is 'n storie wat uit die DP geledere aangedra word. Daar is  'n  mooi
  manier om daarop te reageer, en die Afrikaanse manier is om sommer te sÃª:
  dit is absolute twak!

Dan verwys hy na die VF. Hy sÃª:


  Die Vryheidsfront was vir ons 'n illustrasie en 'n aanskouingsles van  'n
  strategie wat dikwels van die ANC se kant af isÃ¿.Ã¿.Ã¿. om jou te  koÃ¶pteer
  en stil te maak deur jou te betrek in strukture.

Dit is die probleem wat die kiesers ervaar: na watter kant toe?

Ek het hier 'n knipsel van 12 dae voor die verkiesing in Desember 2000.  Die
opskrif sÃª:


  Hou die Wes-Kaap uit die ANC se hande.

Hierdie stelling word toegedig aan mnr Van Schalkwyk. Dan gee hy  vyf  redes
waarom Wes-Kaapse kiesers op 5 Desember moet stem om die  ANC  weg  te  hou.
Die eerste rede, byvoorbeeld, lui:


  Stede  soos  Johannesburg,  waar  die  ANC  regeer,  verval  vinnig   tot
  krotbuurte.

Wat maak die kiesers? Die kiesers luister na mnr Van Schalkwyk se oproep  en
hulle stem in 2000 sodat die ANC uit die Wes-Kaap gehou word. Dan skryf  Die
Burger hoe daar vonkelwyn geskink word  nÃ¡  die  oorwinning,  en  twee  jaar
later skryf Die Burger weer hoe daar vonkelwyn  geskink  word  toe  die  ANC
oorneem. Dit is die probleem. Moenie met my baklei daaroor nie. U moet  gaan
verduidelik na buite. Dit is die probleem en dit is wat die kiesers  aan  my
sÃª. Hulle sÃª  dat  hulle  verkul  voel.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Dit  is  dubbele
standaarde.

In sy toespraak het president Mbeki 'n oorsig  gegee  oor  die  afgelope  10
jaar. Volgens hom was dit 'n dekade van vryheid, van  transformasie  en  van
regstellende aksie.

Die vraag wat jong Afrikaners aan my stel is: hoe lyk die volgende  10  jaar
vorentoe? Hulle ervaar regstellende aksie ook as dubbele standaarde,  ongeag
u argumente. ``Gaan regstellende aksie nog 10 jaar aanhou?'' vra  hulle  my.
Hulle wil ook weet hoekom regstellende aksie slegs op hulle  van  toepassing
is. Meeste van hulle weet nie wie P W Botha of F W de  Klerk  is  nie.  Gaan
toets hulle. Vanjaar se matrikulante is skool toe in 1992. Toe was  die  ANC
reeds twee jaar ontban. Wanneer word Suid-Afrika 'n normale land  waar  daar
geen diskriminasie op grond van ras is nie -  soos  die  Grondwet  teoreties
sÃª. Tans is dit  nie  waar  nie.  Tans  ervaar  jong  Afrikaners  omgekeerde
diskriminasie, en ek kan u voorbeeld na voorbeeld bring.

Ek hoor al die mooi argumente in hierdie Raad van hoe dit behoort  te  werk.
In die praktyk werk dit nie so nie. Ek kry skokkende briewe  -  een  na  die
ander. Onlangs was daar 'n brief in die koerant van 'n jong dame wat met  'n
gemiddelde-A matriek geslaag het. Nieteenstaande haar prestasies kan sy  nie
studiebeurse kry nie, en kon sy nie toelating kry tot sekere  studierigtings
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] 'n Vriendin van haar, wat saam met haar in  dieselfde
skool was, wat swart is, en wie se ouers ryker is as haar ouers, het al  die
moontlike geleenthede gekry, en sy vra vir my hoe 'n mens dit verduidelik.

Kom ons stel hierdie jongmense vry van regstellende aksie  in  die  volgende
dekade. Kom ons stel 'n doeldatum en  ons  sÃª:  nou  is  alles  oop.  U  sal
verbaas wees hoe die jongmense sal reageer daarop. Maak dit vir my  moontlik
om drome oor Suid-Afrika te  droom.  Maak  dit  vir  jongmense  moontlik  om
opgewonde oor die toekoms te wees. Maak dit moontlik dat ons  vir  almal  'n
plek in die son kan skep. Tans ervaar ons dit nie so nie,  en  ervaar  hulle
dit nie so nie. Ons het al die potensiaal om dit wel te  kan  doen.  Dit  is
binne  ons  vermoÃ«.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[To date I have  not  attacked  opposition  parties  unnecessarily  in  this
Chamber. Yet  the  leader  of  the  New  NP,  Mr  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk,
considered it necessary to launch an attack on me and the FF last  year.  He
conveyed to the world various false statements. I am  sorry  that  he  could
not be here so that we could talk about it face to face.

The question is: Why are the voters finished with the  New  NP?  It  is  not
necessarily because they are working with the ANC. Mr F W de Klerk did  that
in 1994 already. They are  finished  with  the  New  NP  because  they  feel
cheated by the New NP as a result of their double  standards.  I  will  give
you an example: In 2000  Mr  Stofile  addressed  the  Eastern  Cape  New  NP
congress, and Mr Manie Schoeman will remember that. This  caused  a  crisis.
The journalist Theuns van der Westhuizen from Die Burger held  an  interview
with Mr Van Schalkwyk to try to put the matter right. You can have  a  look,
it was on 18 March 2000.

I quote from the interview:


  Oor gerugte en beskuldigings dat die Nuwe  NP  leierskap  ter  wille  van
  persoonlike ambisies en posisies 'n samewerkingsooreenkoms  met  die  ANC
  sal aanknoop ten koste  van  die  party  en  sy  ondersteuners,  het  Van
  Schalkwyk skerp veroordelend gereageer:


  Dit is 'n storie wat uit die DP geledere aangedra word. Daar is  'n  mooi
  manier om daarop te reageer, en die Afrikaanse manier is om sommer te sÃª:
  dit is absolute twak!

He then refers to the FF. He says:


  Die Vryheidsfront was vir ons 'n illustrasie en 'n aanskouingsles van  'n
  strategie wat dikwels van die ANC se kant af is ... om jou te koÃ¶pteer en
  stil te maak deur jou te betrek in strukture.

That is the problem which the voters are experiencing: Which way now?

I have here a cutting from 12 days before the  election  in  December  2000.
The headline reads:


  Hou die Wes-Kaap uit die ANC se hande.

This statement is attributed  to  Mr  Van  Schalkwyk.  He  then  gives  five
reasons why Western Cape voters should vote  to  keep  the  ANC  away  on  5
December. The first reason, for example, reads:
  Stede  soos  Johannesburg,  waar  die  ANC  regeer,  verval  vinnig   tot
  krotbuurte.

What did the voters do? The voters listened to Mr Van Schalkwyk's  call  and
voted in 2000 so that the ANC was kept out of the Western Cape.  Die  Burger
then wrote about how champagne was poured after the victory, and  two  years
later Die Burger once again wrote about how champagne was  poured  when  the
ANC took over. That is the problem. Do not argue with me about it. You  must
go and explain outside. That is the problem and that is what the voters  are
telling me. They are telling me that  they  feel  cheated.  [Interjections.]
That is double standards.

In his speech President Mbeki  gave  an  overview  of  the  past  10  years.
According to him it was a  decade  of  freedom,  of  transformation  and  of
affirmative action.

The question that young Afrikaners put to me is: How will the next 10  years
look?  They  also  experience  affirmative  action  as   double   standards,
irrespective of your arguments. They ask me: ``Is affirmative  action  going
to continue for another 10 years?'' They also want to know  why  affirmative
action is only applicable to them. Most of them do not know who  P  W  Botha
or F W de Klerk are. Go and test them.  This  year's  matriculants  went  to
school in 1992. The ANC had then already been unbanned for two  years.  When
will South Africa become a normal country where there is  no  discrimination
on the basis of race - as the  Constitution  theoretically  says?  Currently
this  is  not  true.   Currently   young   Afrikaners   experience   reverse
discrimination, and I can bring you example after example.

I have heard all the lovely arguments in this Chamber about  how  it  should
work. In practice it does not work that way. I receive  shocking  letters  -
one after the other. Recently there was a letter in the  newspaper  about  a
young lady who passed  Matric  with  an  A  aggregate.  Notwithstanding  her
achievements she cannot get bursaries to study, and  she  could  not  obtain
entrance to certain directions of study. [Interjections.] A friend of  hers,
who was in the same school as her, who  is  black,  and  whose  parents  are
richer than her parents, has had all the  possible  opportunities,  and  she
asks me how one explains that.

Let us liberate these young people from affirmative  action  in  the  coming
decade. Let us set a target date and say: Now everything is open.  You  will
be amazed at how the young people will react to that. Make it  possible  for
me to dream dreams about South Africa. Make it possible for young people  to
be excited about the future. Make it possible for us to create  a  place  in
the sun for everyone. Currently we are not experiencing it in this way,  and
they are not experiencing it in this way. We have all the  potential  to  be
able to do it. It is within our ability. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms J MOLOI: Madam Speaker, the President of the Republic, Deputy  President,
members, ladies and gentlemen, as  we  move  towards  the  first  decade  to
celebrate our  country's  freedom  in  April  next  year,  the  struggle  to
eradicate poverty and  underdevelopment  remains  fundamental.  This  is  in
order to achieve our national goal of building a caring  and  people-centred
society. Our legislative institutions are mandated to deliver a quality  set
of laws for the people of South Africa, and to ensure that  these  laws  are
implemented efficiently and effectively in a way that is responsive  to  the
needs of the citizens.

The President emphasised in his previous address that:


  We have  to  help  to  lift,  from  the  shoulders  of  our  people,  the
  intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment, and  the  eradication
  of a centuries-old legacy of colonialism, of racism and of apartheid.

In  order  to  actualise  this  reality,  we  are  engaged   in   a   social
transformation  process,  actively  aimed  at  broadening  the   front   for
reconstruction and development.

We engage with various communities in our constituencies. I interacted  with
a group of  youth  activists  in  a  place  called  Orange  Farm.  It  is  a
developing  settlement  in  Gauteng.  This  youth  group   indicated   their
eagerness to engage  with  practical  programmes  to  bring  about  positive
change in the lives of people living in that area. They had teamed  up  with
all existing youth formations and NGOs to form a  youth  development  forum,
with the aim to eradicate poverty and further develop the place in order  to
improve the lives of people in that locality.

They have identified amongst themselves what  they  need,  the  skills  they
have, and the skills they require to live up  to  the  challenges  they  are
faced with. They have volunteered to take up other programmes and  campaigns
in the past. For instance, they were part of the Letsema campaign. This  was
in order to test their ability to deliver on projects.  For  instance,  they
have been part of the basic income grant campaign, and  they  have  realised
that many people who  qualify  for  the  grant  are  not  in  possession  of
identity documents.

They took this up  as  a  challenge  to  pursue  the  second  phase  of  the
campaign. The introduction  of  the  community  development  worker  by  the
President  and  the  establishment  of  multipurpose  centres   will   match
correctly to reduce costs in travelling and related costs to obtain IDs  for
communities such as those, because the belief is that, as citizens of  South
Africa, they have a right to their identity. In their attempt to  push  back
the frontiers of poverty in Orange Farm, they  want  to  build  SMMEs,  they
want  to  form  co-operatives,  and  they  want  to  have   their   business
initiatives rated amongst the highly successful within the  arena  of  black
economic enterprises. These young men and women want to  develop  their  own
communities by creating jobs right where they live. They  are  not  prepared
to go around scouting for jobs.

On the idea of the growth and development summit, their opinion is that  the
same process should filter through to the local level, in order for them  to
create partnerships with Government and  business.  They  remain  ready  and
positive of a fruitful outcome of this exercise. Like the youth on  16  June
1976 who said, ``We do not want  Afrikaans  under  those  conditions'',  the
youth in Orange Farm say, ``We do not want poverty any more'', and they  are
willing to fight it themselves.

It is therefore evident and it is clear that our economic vision  should  be
aimed   at   fundamentally   transforming   our   society.   This   includes
strengthening state power and transforming the state machinery to serve  the
cause  of  social  change,  to  pursue  economic  growth,  development   and
redistribution and to improve the quality of lives.

This is evident from the three  phases  of  our  economic  development.  The
first phase was the RDP, which was tasked  with  promoting  economic  growth
and improving human conditions through  comprehensive  measures  to  deliver
services.  The  second  one  was  growth,  employment,  and  redistribution,
emphasising a shift towards achieving microeconomic  stability  by  striving
to achieve a budget deficit of 6% or less and  single-digit  inflation.  The
third was introduced in 2001 by the President and emphasised further in  his
speech,  which  indicates   emphasis   from   macroeconomic   stability   to
microeconomic reform, the thrust being unemployment and poverty.

The reality of our country's outlook requires  us  to  understand  our  dual
economy that has both a formal and an informal sector.  Job  losses  in  the
informal sector have a devastating effect on the informal sector, and we  do
not have to lament about that. But we can actually say what  initiatives  we
have. Co-operatives are now being emphasised  as  an  urgent  necessity  for
active,  equitable  participation  of  both  men  and  women.  We  need   to
understand that co-operatives are based on values of  self-help,  of  mutual
understanding, of equity and equality. These democratic establishments  have
the  potential  to  accelerate  the  socioeconomic  process  and  create  an
enabling environment for the alleviation of poverty. Legislation on the  co-
ops is due to be passed later this year by this  House.  The  importance  of
the SMMEs, the small, medium and micro-enterprises, as a vehicle  to  create
jobs and provide access to business, cannot be ignored.

It has been reported that only a small percentage of  Government  programmes
has reached the SMMEs since inception. Part of the problem lies in the  fact
that programmes are not aimed at very small or micro business. For  example,
Khula's main focus is on medium and small businesses. A new  institution  to
deal with micro and very small businesses is needed.  We  therefore  welcome
the President's announcement  on  the  introduction  of  the  Apex  Fund  to
finance micro-enterprises, and  the  impending  legislation  to  change  the
Small Business Act.

It is important again to mention that  the  current  plans,  programmes  and
initiatives have taken a cluster approach in which  an  integrated  strategy
for the informal sector, for  the  co-operatives  and  small  business,  are
spelled out clearly. In this regard, it is also important to note  that  the
success of the implementation of this  strategy  would  be  complemented  by
active  engagements  of  MPs  in  their  constituencies   to   benefit   the
communities involved.

We should have a common vision and clear objectives on  support  mechanisms,
and strive to enhance the spirit of entrepreneurship as  well  as  introduce
civil  service/community  development  workers  that  would  reinforce   the
programmes of Government. As a challenge,  when  we  talk  about  industrial
policy, the conceptual debate should be to capture whether  a  manufacturing
or industrial strategy is addressing the existing industrial  structure.  If
so, we have to help to find answers on the  implications  for  the  possible
future development paths of the economy.

The DTI has introduced an integrated manufacturing strategy as part  of  the
action plan announced by the President in 2001. They outlined the  need  for
co-ordinated government interventions. The key  performance  areas  of  this
plan  include  black  economic  empowerment,  small  business   development,
employment  and  the  geographic  spread  of  the  economy.  Through   these
guidelines, the DTI places manufacturing at the centre of  the  economy  and
emphasises the need to increase value-adding.

Clearly,  a  coherent  plan  to   take   collective   action   forward   for
implementation is a core element of this strategy.  The  IMS  is  a  crucial
platform on which to build a collective approach to  achieve  the  goals  of
employment generation, and broad-based, more equitable growth. The  strategy
identifies the challenge in terms of the dualistic nature of South  Africa's
economy. There is a need that the visible and  concrete  benefits  from  the
industrial strategy should be realised in underdeveloped and rural areas  of
the economy.

Seo re se hlalosang mona ke hore ha re tla kena ho  Industrial  Development,
ho tla ba bohlokwa hore e sebetsa haholo  ho  dinaha  mahae.  [What  we  are
explaining here is that when we get into Industrial  Development,  it  could
be of great importance to make use of rural areas.]

The industrial strategy should seek to improve the cost  competitiveness  in
the  developed  economy,  and  the   realisation   of   potential   in   the
underdeveloped parts of the economy, which represents the  experience  of  a
large portion of  South  Africans.  In  addition,  this  strategy  needs  to
address the absence of a  substantive  treatment  of  gender.  For  example,
there is a need to customise support programmes to take account  of  current
gender profiles and problems  in  promoting  gender  equality,  specific  to
industries or sectors to which they are applied.

We  will  continue  to  engage  constructively  with  all  stakeholders   to
strengthen  the  industrial  policy  framework  to  help  achieve  the  full
potential of  South  Africa's  economy.  On  the  issue  of  black  economic
empowerment, the envisaged strategy document  and  policy  guidelines  would
provide the broad parameters of empowerment. We  are  of  the  opinion  that
this integrated approach to empowerment would be in the  best  interests  of
our modern and global competitive economy. However, to make this a  reality,
certain key issues must be clearly addressed.

The first issue, the opportunities for  greater  economic  participation  in
all sectors by BEE participants, must be outlined  by  all  sectors  at  all
levels, from central Government, parastatals, state-owned  enterprises,  and
major  corporations.  Secondly,  the  concept  of   scorecards,   meaningful
measurement  and  control  of  participation  must  be  clearly   monitored,
evaluated and controlled. To this  end,  credible  black  organisations  and
black professional bodies must play an  important  role  in  exposing  BEE's
engaged in fronting and window-dressing.

Thirdly,  a  mechanism  must  be  created  whereby  the  lethargy  and   the
indifference of bureaucracy is speeded up. A fair  amount  of  BEE  business
appears to have problems on  Government  BEE  initiatives  because,  in  the
past, when problems developed, there was a little bit of  a  problem  around
bureaucracy when they were actually approached. Solutions  were  not  really
forthcoming. In numerous cases that are  encountered  presently,  old  white
firms are still being awarded large contracts  at  the  expense  of  blacks,
under the same pretext that I have indicated.

Parliament must play  a  vital  role  in  protecting  people's  rights  and,
furthermore, ensuring visible and meaningful transfer of economic  power.  A
mechanism must be created whereby BEE  participants  themselves  can  report
any hindrances, and ensure that corrective actions  are  taken  to  expedite
the BEE process.  We  anticipate  that  the  proposed  legislation  will  be
promulgated very soon.

The building of a truly nonracial, nonsexist and  prosperous  South  Africa,
and the genuine emancipation of our people, depend on how we  implement  our
tasks.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! May I please request hon members to  lower
their voices. There is a speaker in front of us.

Ms J MOLOI: We need to improve  the  capacity  of  the  state  to  meet  its
obligations to citizens, giving a spur to drivers  on  economic  growth  and
job creation, broadening the access to social services and  improving  their
quality, improving international solidarity and contributing to  building  a
better life for all.

The  New  Partnership  for   Africa's   Development   is   a   comprehensive
developmental programme for Africa and it  strives  to  promote  accelerated
growth, to eradicate widespread severe poverty, and to bring to a  halt  the
marginalisation of Africa in the globalisation process.  The  South  African
legislative institutions have established themselves in a very  short  space
of time, and many challenges still confront us in this regard.

It is therefore imperative to mention some of  these  challenges  facing  us
and outline them as follows: The restructuring of the financial  sector  and
effective  use  of  savings  in  the  Government  budget;  the  unemployment
problems, especially the creation of sufficient jobs; our definition of  the
informal sector; constructive interventions at  all  levels  of  government;
the land issue, and the skills audit.

In conclusion, I would like to mention that development in this  country  is
a must, and we are ready to implement legislation and decisions  around  the
eradication of poverty. We do not want to play on  the  emotions  of  people
and pretend that we are the best sympathisers to  their  cause.  The  people
down there know that they are  custodians  of  the  policies  that  we  have
developed and, together  with  them,  we  will  make  sure  that  we  remain
steadfast  in  the  quest  to  eradicate  poverty  and  underdevelopment  in
ensuring a better life for all. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy  President,
and hon members, the state of the nation address in any part  of  the  world
usually prompts people to intense debate. There are always issues  that  the
nation feels should have been  emphasised  more  than  they  have  been,  or
should have been mentioned and have been left out. Last  week's  address  is
no exception.

Poverty is gnawing at the nation, and concomitant with it  are  social  ills
such as crime and prostitution. Perpetrators claim they are driven to  these
to make a living. We propose that to push back  the  frontiers  of  poverty,
the country should not  be  turned  into  a  welfare  state  by  doling  out
parcels. Our dictum is that people should live by the sweat of their  brows.
Labour-intensive projects and programmes should be  put  in  place  so  that
people earn a living. We propose that mechanisation in digging trenches  for
laying down pipes for reticulation  of  water  should  be  done  away  with.
Instead, people should be employed. Roads and streets in villages  and  some
townships have turned into ravines after the rains. Manual labour  could  be
put to use to repair them.

We in the UCDP maintain that Government is always at war in  its  quest  for
solutions to problems besetting the nation. To win the war,  the  Government
has to be clean, lean and mean. To keep the Government  clean,  we  maintain
that it has to be detoxicated  of  any  impurities  among  its  ranks.  When
members of the executive at national and provincial  levels  are  implicated
in impropriety, whatever trust people have in such government wanes.

We have this situation in our government setting.  Only  time  will  unravel
this knot. The  issue  of  high-ranking  employees  who  continue  to  waste
government resources to almost complete collapse, as in the case of  medical
services in Mpumalanga, surely calls for a clean-up.

Since the advent  of  democracy  in  1994,  we  have  heard  words  such  as
restructuring, rationalisation,  redeployment,  demobilisation,  downsizing,
affirmative action and what-have-you.

All these were, and still are, meant to cut down on the size  of  government
employees. Yet, day after day, in most newspapers, there are  advertisements
aimed at new recruits. Even last week,  the  hon  President,  among  others,
alluded to the setting up of a National  Social  Security  Agency,  and  the
creation of a public service echelon of multiskilled  community  development
workers, which,  in  themselves,  mean  the  creation  of  more  posts  with
additional executives, obviously with impressive packages for  remuneration.
Staff reduction will remain as elusive as the will-o'-the-wisp.

We call on those tasked with the process  of  auditing  the  Public  Service
personnel, and due to report by the middle of the year, to ensure  that  the
Public Service is overhauled to ensure that the number of  chiefs  does  not
exceed Indians in each department. The problem is  in  the  many  layers  of
managers who are office-bound,  yet  are  remunerated  heavily  while  their
income is not commensurate with their output. The  leaner  the  system,  the
better it will perform.

The good intentions of Government are defied and scuttled by those who  have
to implement them. They misconstrue statements such  as  ``Batho  Pele''  to
mean ANC members first. They argue  that  the  Freedom  Charter  says  ``The
people shall govern'', therefore it is only those who are in  the  governing
party who qualify as ``people''  or  ``batho'',  and  should  therefore  get
first preference. It is such nefarious conduct that has  to  be  set  right.
[Interjections.] Listen to those schoolboys there!

In keeping with the Christian dictum, we say, ``A kgotso e ate'' [May  peace
prevail]. We embrace all efforts  made  to  ensure  that  the  world  enjoys
perfect peace. We gloat in seeing that South Africa is  the  torchbearer  in
the quest for peace. We shall not cease to pray  for  those  being  sent  to
Iraq to seek ways and means of giving peace a chance.

There is ongoing  debate  around  the  role  of  traditional  leaders  in  a
democracy, and while this is continuing, the matter of  rights  in  communal
land has also come to the fore. We hope all these will be handled  with  the
greatest  responsibility,  circumspection  and  sensitivity,  while   paying
attention to communal  land  whose  owners  have  title  deeds  thereto,  as
opposed to those who occupy state, or what used to be  called  trust,  land.
Surely, individual titles to these will differ.

We note, however, that, in  keeping  with  our  policy  of  federalism,  the
houses of traditional leaders in the various provinces will pass  their  own
pieces of legislation. We support this initiative and look  forward  to  the
process being applied in other areas of customary  life  since  the  central
point of control is, more often  than  not,  unable  to  keep  heterogeneous
communities together.

That serious crime has been reduced  or  stabilised  is  a  moot  point.  It
depends from which angle  one  views  the  issue.  We  take  note  that  the
Government concedes, however, that the  considerable  proportion  of  crimes
against the person, including murder,  the  abuse  of  women  and  children,
assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and common  assault,  take
place among the most marginalised sections of our population.

This, we propose, can be curbed by having a police presence in their  midst.
Such people, from their position of poverty and remote  situation,  find  it
difficult to access police assistance,  and  we  therefore  agree  with  the
President when he says that the Government has to go to the people.  Let  us
have policing services taken to those people.

In his address,  the  President  referred  to  the  Government's  intent  to
respond to poverty, malnutrition, and poor health generally.  We  note  that
better health can mainly be attained by eating nutritious  food.  Such  food
is produced by farmers who unfortunately are not being assisted  by  way  of
subsidies  by  this  Government.  Most  developed  countries   continue   to
subsidise their farmers. Failure to subsidise farmers affects  the  emerging
farmers negatively, and the historically established white farmers  continue
to thrive. There is surely a way to relook at this matter.

People in the rural areas, or the rural parts of the country, are  the  most
vulnerable when it comes to the provision of water. I have been to  eMpulusi
in Mpumalanga, and the outskirts of Mahwelereng  in  the  Limpopo  province.
Potable water to these people is unknown. All they know is  that  the  water
has to be withdrawn from some point down the road. Surely, the provision  of
resources like water has to be speeded up. The sporadic outbreak of  cholera
in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu Natal is an indication that much has  to  be
done in this respect.

Hopefully, people will respond to the advertisement  of  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry, calling for comments on the provision of water.

We hope, finally, that the best still has to  be  done  for  the  people  of
South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M M SOTYU: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President of the Republic  of  South
Africa and hon members, the President, in his January  8  statement  and  in
his state of  the  nation  address,  made  a  particular  reference  to  the
suffering of women and children and called upon all South Africans to  focus
on the safety of our communities. He stressed the need to pay  attention  to
the close relationship between  poverty  and  some  crimes.  The  SA  Police
Service has committed itself  to  preventing  and  combating  crime  against
children and women, and regards this kind of crime as one  of  the  police's
priorities. They focus on increasing the number of  family  violence,  child
protection and sexual offences units of the SA Police Service,  as  well  as
victim  support  programmes,  prevention  programmes  and  public  education
programmes. The ANC is committed to strengthening the implementation of  all
the good laws that are in place to deal  with  violence  against  women  and
children.

The ANC's vision derives from the  Freedom  Charter,  which  proclaimed,  in
1955, that `` there shall be peace and friendship'',  and  went  further  to
say,  ``peace  and  friendship  amongst  all  people  shall  be  secured  by
upholding the equal rights, equal opportunities and status of all''.

We commend those SA Police Service members who try their best  to  translate
and implement, in particular, the  Domestic  Violence  Act  under  difficult
circumstances, for instance, when it comes to the  withdrawal  of  cases  by
abused women, i e the victims. Police need to understand the laws  in  order
for them to discourage the victim from  dropping  these  kinds  of  charges.
Some of these victims are forced by the  perpetrators  to  drop  such  cases
against them. A review of the operation of the community policing forums  is
being done, thanks to Comrade  Nqakula,  the  Minister.  This  will  include
their funding as per the ANC national conference resolution.
The major focus of this is to consider  the  feasibility  of  the  community
safety forums. We are aware that most of  these  kinds  of  crimes  are  not
reported in some instances, because  they  are  referred  to  as  social  or
family problems. In some cases, it is when  some  SAPS  members  don't  take
these seriously. You will get  some  instances  in  which  these  cases  are
reported and the police officer will say:  ``O  ne  o  batla  eng  wena  mme
bosiu, hore o tle o betwe?''[What did you want at  night,  lady,  until  you
were beaten?] So, this is  where  our  role  as  public  representatives  is
needed mostly. We need to educate the community in respect of  their  rights
and translate those laws which are there to protect them;  especially  those
communities which are in rural areas.

The President in his state of the nation  address  emphasised  the  need  to
utilise amavolontiya  [volunteers]  and  the  need  to  establish  community
development workers within the Public Service in order to assist the  people
in  tackling  the  immediate  problems  they  face.  We  acknowledge   those
volunteers who rendered their services to  communities  and  in  our  police
stations. Trained volunteers and social workers counsel victims of  rape  at
the relevant institutions.  There  are  community-based  victim  empowerment
projects in most of the provinces, and  trauma  facilities  at  some  police
stations that  provide  counselling  services  by  trained  volunteers.  The
Department of Justice is utilised for training  for  criminal  prosecutions,
in order for the perpetrators to be convicted.  NGOs  like  the  Network  of
Violence Against Women are also used in reference to this. The ANC will  not
tolerate the abuse of children in any form. Brutal attacks  on  children  by
their own parents and guardians is a serious criminal  offence.  I  want  to
take this opportunity and commend police stations like the one in  Barberton
in Mpumalanga, which, together with the community, went  on  a  campaign  of
schools adopting a cop and held workshops on  how  to  deal  with  crime  at
schools, including the eradication of the abuse  of  drugs  and  alcohol  at
schools. This  has  helped  to  build  a  better  relationship  between  the
communities and the police.

Elderly persons are abused daily in different ways. We acknowledge the  step
taken by the Department of Social Development by drafting a policy  document
to address issues affecting our elderly persons. Abuse and  neglect  of  the
elderly are common in residential  homes,  hospitals,  within  families,  in
communities  and  at  pension  paypoints.  This  drafted  legislation   will
address,  among  others,  the   poorly   managed,   racially   divided   and
underresourced communities. Before we can truly say  that  our  elderly  get
the respect and dignity they deserve, many challenges remain unsolved.

Ya okametseng Ntlo, re na  le  bothata  bo  ntseng  bo  ata  moo  maqheku  a
amohelang teng. Ho  na  le  batho  moo  bao  ho  thweng  ke  bo  matjhonesa.
Dinokwane tsena di amoha maqheku  tjhelete  ya  ona  ka  tsela  e  utlwisang

[Chairperson, we have increasing  problems  where  our  elderly  people  are
receiving their pension money. There are people at those places  called  bo-
Matjhonesa [illegal money lenders]. These criminals  are  cruelly  snatching
from our pensioners.]

We say to those unlicensed  moneylenders  who  steal  the  pensions  of  the
elderly by unlawfully lending money to these poor senior  citizens:  We  are
watching you and you will be arrested very  soon.  We  would  also  like  to
commend the ANC  Women's  League  in  the  Free  State,  together  with  the
community and the volunteers, who have embarked  on  a  campaign  to  combat
this kind of crime which is escalating through all these other provinces.
They visit most paypoints on the days of the pension payouts and,  with  the
help  of  some  police,  they  managed  to  stop  these  moneymongers.   The
President, in his state of the nation address, indicated  that  our  success
depends on strengthening  the  partnership  of  the  Letsema  campaign  with
communities volunteering to assist the  security  agencies  in  their  work.
Comrade President, the constituency that I am servicing in  the  rural  area
called Naledi in the Free State province on the borders of Lesotho ...

Igama ebizwa ngalo le ndawo yiKanana. Kambe, eli gama lithi
Kanana siya kulisondeza kuleya yobisi nobusi. Le  yona  ke  kodwa  ayinjalo,
yechaseneyo naleyo. Apha kule iKanana ikati ilele  eziko.  Bathi  bayabulela
ngamanzi acocekileyo abawafumene ukufika kwalo  Rhulumente  we-ANC.  Kunjalo
nje, abantu baseKanana bathi  kwixesha  lamandulo,  ukuze  bafumane  amanzi,
kwakufuneka baye kuwafuna kumlambo iGqili.  Kungokunje  amanzi  akhona,  eze
kubo.

Bathi, babebanexesha lokuba bahambe  ebusuku  baye  kufuna  amalongwe  ukuze
baze  kupheka.  Babesithi  xa  befuna  amalongwe  baye  kumda   weli   lizwe
neLusuthu,  apho  kukho  khona  iinkomo  ukuze  bakwazi   ukufumana   izinto
zokubasa.  Kuthe  kusakube  kufike  lo  Rhulumente  wakhe  abasazi   nalapho
babewachola khona loo malongwe, kuba sele kukho ugesi ngoku.

Bathi abantu baseKanana bayamvisisa uVukuzenzele. Kunjalo nje bayamxhasa  lo
Rhulumente we-ANC kuba kaloku banale ntetho  ithi,  ``Kungcono  ukusenga  le
seyizele kunokulinda le imithiyo ongayaziyo ukuba yozala  thole  lini  na.''
Ngelinye ixesha kothi kanti imithi ithole eliza kuzalwa selifile.

Bathi abasayi  kuzithembisa  ngale  mibuthwana  ithi  siza  kunipha  amanzi.
Amanzi sele ekhona.  Bayabulela,  kodwa  eyona  nto  ingamandla  kukujongana
nokuthi impilo yabo bayibhekisa phambili  ngokwabo.  (Translation  of  Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms M M SOTYU: This place is called Canaan. One may think that this  is  the
Canaan that is talked about in the Bible, where the Jews were promised  that
they would get milk and honey. The one I am talking about is different  from
that one. In this one people are poor. People are, however, grateful to  the
ANC-led Government for providing them with clean  water.  People  from  this
place say that in the past they fetched water from the  Vaal  River.  Today,
water has been brought to them. They say that they used to go out  at  night
to look for dried cowdung so that they could make fire.  They  would  go  as
far as the boundary between South Africa and Lesotho, where there  are  many
cattle, looking for dried cowdung. However, since this Government came  into
power, they do not even know where  they  used  to  go  to  look  for  dried
cowdung because there is electricity  now.  People  from  Canaan  understand
what is meant  by  Vukuzenzele  and  they  very  well  support  the  ANC-led
Government because they say that it is better to milk a cow that  has  given
birth already than to have to wait for the one  that  is  still  carrying  a
calf in case it gives birth to a stillborn calf. They  say  that  they  will
not be influenced by these newly established parties who  promise  to  bring
them water. They have access to water already. They are  very  grateful  and
want to improve their living conditions themselves.]

In conclusion, the Leader of the Opposition said a lot about the killing  of
farmers, but nothing about those farmworkers who  are  being  exploited  and
killed by farmers. Is it because they  are  black?  He  said  nothing  about
those who  are  killed  and  about  those  police  officers  who  are  being
corrupted by these very farmers who give the police  bribes  to  keep  quiet
about people they have killed. Is it because those  people  who  are  killed
were black?
He doesn't say anything about tax defaulters. He is quiet about them. Is  it
because the majority of those tax defaulters are white? One just wonders.

In conclusion, we say ``No women abuse, no to child abuse and  elder  abuse,
and we say no older  person  deserves  to  suffer  emotionally,  physically,
sexually or financially. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Deputy Speaker, I see the leader of the Freedom Front  is
here. He accused the leader of my party in his absence, and I  think  it  is
my responsibility on his behalf to set the case straight.

Voor 1994 toe die leier van die destydse NP, mnr F W de Klerk, en die  leier
van die  ANC,  mnr  Mandela,  bymekaar  gekom  en  onderhandel  het  vir  'n
demokratiese Suid-Afrika waaraan almal in  vryheid  kan  deelneem  aan  alle
prosesse van die land, het mense soos dr Mulder dit beskou as verraad.  Daar
is gesÃª dat die land uitverkoop word. Aan die einde van hierdie  proses  het
ons vrede in hierdie land, Suid-Afrikaners is  nie  meer  in  ons  buurstate
vermoor nie. Jong, wit seuns het nie meer teruggekeer van die  grens  af  in
swart sakke nie. Dr Mulder en sy party was die party wat in die aanloop  tot
die 1994-verkiesing probeer het om die  WÃªreldhandelsentrum  te  bestorm  om
hierdie demokratiese proses te stop. Toe hulle sien hulle kan dit  nie  doen
nie, het hulle inderhaas en met groot  moeite  probeer  deel  word  van  die
proses.

Toe hulle besef hulle kan demokratiese regering nie keer nie, het  hulle  op
hulle beurt die President genader en gevra: Gee vir  ons  'n  volkstaatraad.
En nÃ¡ 'n klomp belastingbetalersgeld gemors is, het  hulle  besluit  om  nou
maar  deel  te  wees  van  hierdie  proses  onder  sekere  voorwaardes.  Hul
voorwaardes was: Skep vir wit Afrikaners 'n kibboets  in  die  woestyn.  Toe
hulle agterkom dat wit Afrikaners  werklik  Afrikane  is  en  deel  van  die
meerderheid van die land is, is hulle baie sag oor die volkstaatraad. Op  'n
stadium het die Mulders so erg gevoel oor die volkstaatraad  dat  hulle  van
die generaal ontslae geraak het, want hy bemark Orania nie goed genoeg  nie.
Nou   praat   hulle   van   dubbelspraak.   Wie   verkoop   vir   wie   uit?
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Before 1994, when the leader of the then NP, Mr  F  W  de  Klerk,  and  the
leader of the ANC, Mr Mandela, met and negotiated  for  a  democratic  South
Africa in which everyone could participate freely in all  processes  of  the
country, people like Dr Mulder regarded it as treason. It was said that  the
country was being sold out. At the end of this process we had peace in  this
country, South Africans were no longer murdered in our neighbouring  states.
Young white boys no longer returned from the border in black  bags.  It  was
Dr Mulder and his party who, in the run-up to the 1994  election,  tried  to
storm the World Trade Centre to stop this democratic process. When they  saw
that they could not do it, they hurriedly and with  great  difficulty  tried
to become part of the process.

When they realised that they could not prevent democratic  government  they,
in their turn, approached the President and asked: Give us a  Volkstaatraad.
And after a lot of the taxpayer's money had been  wasted,  they  decided  to
become part of this process on certain conditions.  Their  conditions  were:
Create a kibbutz in the desert for  white  Afrikaners.  When  they  realised
that white Afrikaners were in fact Africans and part of the majority of  the
country, they were very quiet about the  Volkstaatraad.  At  one  stage  the
Mulders felt so intensely about the Volkstaatraad that they got rid  of  the
general because he was not  marketing  Orania  well  enough.  Now  they  are
speaking of double-talk. Who is selling out whom? [Interjections.]]

It was not my intention to become part of this debate,  but,  unfortunately,
I was forced to.

I would like to welcome today the president  of  the  SA  Police  Union,  Mr
Sigidi, and his secretary-general  who  is  here  today,  and  they  are  to
highlight the  plight  of  the  police  and  the  police  murders  that  are
happening in this country. Early this year, I approached your office with  a
request for a special debate on police  murders  and  the  conditions  under
which the police have to do the important work  of  safeguarding  our  lives
and our property. You, Deputy Speaker, informed me  that  I  must  use  this
debate as a platform to highlight the concerns of our men in blue.

These men and women in blue are our last line  of  defence  against  anarchy
and chaos. Their tireless work and dedication made it  possible  for  us  to
safeguard our international guests  at  the  World  Summit  for  Sustainable
Development. Last year, the DA said the police  should  not  prioritise  the
resources into the investigation of the Boeremag. Fortunately, Mr  Minister,
the SAPS ignored their suspect advice, arrested those involved  and  secured
a safe festive season for all of us. We thank them.

Who is safeguarding our policemen and  women?  The  cold-blooded  manner  in
which their colleagues are killed will remain  in  their  and  our  memories
forever. We remember Captain Sipho Mokgotsi of my home  town,  Pretoria.  He
served  us  with  the  dedication  of  a  hero.  He  was  about  to  make  a
breakthrough in his investigation into a Mabopane cash-in-transit  heist.  A
week before the police could arrest the suspects, he and his wife were  shot
in cold blood, in  one  of  the  most  ruthless  police  murders  in  recent
history. Captain Mokgotsi is but one on a role call of  hundreds  of  police
that are  killed  in  what  appear  to  be  revenge  attacks  by  criminals.
Unfortunately, time is limited and I hope you will allow  a  special  debate
on this issue not only so we could pay homage  to  our  fallen  heroes,  but
where we can also highlight the concerns of our living heroes who  fight  in
the trenches against crime and corruption.

We  have  a  number  of  special  units  established  to  fight  crime   and
corruption, but there has been no unit established to deal with  the  police
killings. Why is this crime not a priority? The police are  our  protectors,
not our enemies. They are sons  and  daughters,  fathers  and  mothers.  The
police request, and I agree with them, that life sentences should  be  given
for those found guilty of killing policemen. I believe personally that  they
should be hanged. A crime against the police is a crime against  the  state.
There should be a policy of no bail and no parole. We  should  look  at  the
service conditions of the SA Police Service.  When  a  police  officer  dies
before completing ten years of service, his or her beneficiaries  will  only
receive the actuarial interest or his or her final average salary,  whatever
is the greatest.

With the meagre salaries the police earn, how can one expect  the  remaining
spouse  to  provide  for  a  family  with  that   small   amount?   National
Commissioner Selebi admitted recently that  the  salaries  of  junior  South
African Police Service members are insufficient. They  are  the  bobbies  on
the beat, the frontline of visible policing. Mr President,  is  it  not  not
time that you  mandated  an  urgent  investigation  into  the  salaries  and
service conditions of the SA Police Service? We conducted a  Defence  Review
and, based on the outcome of this review, we decided to  spend  millions  on
arms. We should conduct a crime review in this country and then  decide  the
size and capacity the force needs to be to make our people safe and  secure.
If the police want to increase their salaries or get promotions,  they  must
apply for desk jobs, away from where the criminals are. We  then  bring  new
recruits and place them on the streets without the presence  of  experienced
and skilled officers. The private  sector,  with  better  pay  packages,  is
attracting most of our skilled policemen and  women  away  from  the  force,
robbing the SA Police Service of much-needed skills and expertise.

I once again will request a full debate on  this  issue  and  I  plead  your
indulgence. A summit to discuss police killings has  been  promised,  and  I
hope the Minister will announce the date for that  during  this  debate  and
also add on to that agenda the working conditions of the SA Police Service.

If there is one area where South Africans have strengthened the  partnership
... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Ngcobo is making his maiden speech. [Applause.]

Mr N NGCOBO: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President and hon  Deputy  President,
the pursuit  of  the  goals  of  freedom  from  want,  hunger,  deprivation,
ignorance, suppression of talent, fear and intimidation  is  fundamental  to
the guarantee of human rights and dignity. The  potential  role  of  science
and technology in the pursuit  of  freedom  and  wealth  is  unquestionable.
There is often  confusion  to  the  effect  that  the  development  and  the
diffusion  into  the  economy  of  science  and  technology  are  the   sole
responsibility  of  the  Government  of  the  day.  On  the  contrary,   the
importance of science and technology should be recognised by the society  as
a whole, be it industry, civil society, the  education  sector,  scientists,
etc.

Thus,  a  people-oriented  approach  to  the  development  of  science   and
technology is one that is rooted in the following outcomes and  values:  the
enhancement  of  quality  of  life  of  all  South  Africans;  promotion  of
competitiveness and  the  creation  of  employment;  promotion  of  digital-
oriented information society; promotion of  an  environmentally  sustainable
surrounding and biodiversity; development of human  resources  and  talents,
especially in the historically disadvantaged communities, and generation  of
marketable products and services to a level that is globally competitive.

On the other hand, the Government has a responsibility to pursue  technology
policies that are geared towards focusing more  on  effective  collaboration
between partners with the purpose of technology  transfer.  Such  technology
policies should be able to provide  better  domestic  skills,  capabilities,
supplier networks and infrastructure.  Furthermore,  the  Government  should
pursue institutional changes that are based upon innovation, initiative  and
organisational  knowledge  as   driven   by   processes   of   socioeconomic
transformation.

Good technology policies  should  allow  for  the  blending  of  traditional
technologies with new, big with small,  indigenous  with  foreign,  etc.  In
order to compete successfully in  a  globally  challenging  environment,  we
also need to develop the ability to create and acquire technology  from  all
forms  of  available  sources  and  resources.  Furthermore,   the   adopted
technology  policies  should  be  able  to  establish  effective  access  to
relevant information, and thus a mechanism should be  devised  which  should
allow for the effective diffusion of such information into the economy.

Successful understanding and consumption of information by  one  party  from
another, coupled with an effective application of such  information  at  the
marketplace and at consumer level, represents what is  referred  to  as  the
``technology transfer process.'' The latter is  central  to  the  successful
development of a technology infrastructure and base  in  our  country  which
has the capacity of competing in a global context.

The initiative by the  Cabinet  which  saw  the  approval  in  2002  of  the
National Research and Development Strategy  and  the  creation  of  the  new
Department of Science  and  Technology  is  a  clear  demonstration  by  our
Government that science and technology are at the centre of the  alleviation
of poverty and the enhancement of freedom amongst our suffering people.

The strategy involves the allocation of new research resources  to  the  key
areas  of  technology  such  as   biotechnology,   information   technology,
manufacturing, poverty reduction, resource-based industries,  etc.  It  also
emphasises, at research  level,  the  exploitation  of  South  Africa's  key
geographic and human advantages such as astronomy,  biodiversity,  Antarctic
research, indigenous knowledge systems, paleontology, etc.

The strategy further encourages international collaboration in  science  and
technology in the fields of  importance  to  the  nation.  It  supports  the
national system of innovation which  has  to  drive  Southern  Africa  as  a
region of excellence in science and technology.

An innovation fund has been created to  promote  larger  skilled  consortium
projects in which academia, science councils and  industry  can  participate
by focusing on major themes of Government such as competitiveness,  equality
of life, environmental sustainability, information and technology,  etc,  so
as to address the needs of our national economy.

The strategy also encourages the establishment of programmes  which  act  as
technology diffusion stations such as the Godisa  programme  and  Tshumisano
programme. Poverty relief programmes such as the bee-keeping  programme  and
the Phumani Hand Papermaking project are but  all  demonstrative  indicators
by which our Government wants science and technology  to  be  people-centred
in this country. It is indeed a comprehensive strategy  which  needs  to  be
developed and enriched in the interests of  our  people  and  the  country's
wealth creation. In line with this latter statement, we  therefore  need  to
consider some of the  important  technologies  which  are  based  on  scarce
skills professions.

If South Africa wants to be a major player in world technology  affairs,  it
has  to  begin  now  to  monitor  closely  the  international  technological
adventures and breakthroughs as well as to do  something  about  this.  This
may be in the form of establishing our own  research  centres  around  these
technologies or sending people overseas to join such ventures as  a  way  of
participating in the  technology  transfer  process  in  the  scarce  skills
technologies.

To  augment  my  argument,  I  have  in  mind  the  following  international
technological ventures, amongst others, as an example: fuel cell  technology
for  green  energy  and  green  cars;  vacuum   technology   and   cryogenic
engineering for space, defence and civil purposes;  nanotechnology  and  its
nanomachines and aerospace engineering and the aircars.

Briefly, I think it will be unfair not to give  a  brief  overview  of  what
these technologies entail. In fact, recently, in  his  state  of  the  union
address, President Bush of the United States  of  America  proposed  a  $1,2
billion programme to help build the infrastructure needed  to  revolutionise
the cars we drive. He had a vision of an American child born  today  driving
a green car based on this technology in the next two decades.

In fact, fuel cell technology is an old space technology that is  now  being
brought down to earth. It dates back to the 1800s, but it was not until  the
20th century that it was used successfully to promote electricity and  water
in spacecraft. The Gemini spacecraft mission is  but  a  testimony  to  this
argument.

Actually, at the centre of fuel cell technology is the metal platinum  which
acts as a catalyst. What President Bush did not say was that, for  his  fuel
cell programme to succeed, he would also need a Rustenburg child born  today
who, in two decades, would be a negotiator in the platinum  metal  industry.
[Interjections.]  Fuel  cell  technology,  in  fact,  is  a  very  important
technology  and  South  Africa  stands  to  benefit  economically  if   this
technology succeeds  because  it  has  got  vast  reserves  of  platinum  in
Rustenberg. [Interjections.]

I also want to say a few words about vacuum technology  and  nanotechnology,
which is a technology of the near  future.  Nanotechnology  is  an  umbrella
term that covers many areas of research dealing  with  objects  measured  in
nanometres.  A  nanometre  is  a  billionth  of  a  metre.   The   goal   of
nanotechnology is to manufacture goods at molecular level. Nature  has  best
been able to do this. Our bodies are built out of tissue cells of  molecular
structure, and they are a testimony to  the  success  of  nanotechnology  in
nature.

What would nanotechnology bring to us as a nation? It is envisaged that  the
benefits of nanotechnology would be that:  famine  could  be  eradicated  by
machines that fabricate food to  feed  the  hungry;  the  computer  industry
could greatly benefit if computer components were shrunk  to  nanodimensions
since trillions of bytes of information could be stored in a  structure  the
size of a sugar cube [Laughter]; it would have  a  positive  effect  on  the
environment as nanorobots begin to be used to mend the ozone layer, and  the
medical industry would benefit greatly with patients  being  made  to  drink
fluids containing nanorobots programmed to attack and  destroy  viruses  and
cancer cells, for instance. [Applause.]

There is  also  a  very  interesting  development  in  Israel  in  aerospace
engineering. They are developing aircars. The aircars are  small  cars  that
are called VTOLs. VTOL means Vertically  Taking  Off  and  Landing  aircars.
[Laughter.] This firm in Tel Aviv is called Romeo Yankee Ltd. These  aircars
are differentiated into two categories, the City Hawks and the Turbo  Hawks.
[Interjections.] They envisage the City Hawks to be the cars that would  fly
up to an altitude of 8000ft, and the Turbo Hawks are  envisaged  to  play  a
very great role in missions of military  purposes.  And  so,  it  stands  to
reason that at the centre of this technology  developing  in  Israel,  is  a
military purpose which we in South Africa have also  have  to  try  to  cope
with if we are to defend ourselves in the near future.

These cars can fly and run on the road and their size is adapted to  fit  in
a normal garage and parking bay. [Interjections.] It is thus  my  view  that
ventures  in  the  scarce  skills-based  technologies  should  be  monitored
closely whilst training in scarce skills professions  should  be  encouraged
within our society so as to render us less  dependent  on  consultants  that
rape our country of its scarce financial resources. [Interjections.]

Human resource  development  in  science  and  technology  is  also  a  very
important  component  which  is  linked  to  the  initiative  as  based   on
innovation in science and education. Science and  technology  education  can
respond to the real needs of our society and the country  only  when  it  is
practical,  relevant  and  appropriate.  Our  teaching  methodology   should
emphasise problem-solving and decision-making.

Regarding the development of technical skills, curriculums should relate  to
local context, not only by way of development of technical skills, but  also
by routing in the principles based on militant philosophy and  revolutionary
science.

We have to start preparing and producing doctors, engineers  and  scientists
who understand the origins of historical  and  dialectical  materialism  ...
[Interjections] ... who  understand  the  difference  between  idealist  and
materialist philosophy, who understand the difference between objective  and
subjective  conditions  in  addressing  challenges  of   our   society   ...
[Interjections] ... and who understand where rice or cotton comes  from.  In
a nutshell, we should have technologists who are  true  reflections  of  the
success of our national democratic revolution. [Interjections.]

But, even more, the mindset and culture that science and technology are  for
white people and that blacks are for  sports  and  dancing  around  must  be
eradicated ... [Laughter] [Applause] ... let alone the attitude  that  women
are for nursing, social work and romance. [Laughter.] In  these  connections
Parliament,  through  its  relevant  portfolio  committees,  must  begin  to
implement this oversight role of identifying those centres and  institutions
of science and technology which still remain  bastions  of  racism  and  the
exclusion of black talent. [Interjections.] Blending white faces with  black
faces has also become a new technique used in many institutions  of  science
and technology here in South Africa since the establishment of our  majority
rule in 1994.

Science and technology should also be seen, in the global context,  of  what
role they can play. In the African context and in line with  the  philosophy
of the African Renaissance, our challenge is to lead the  African  continent
into becoming an  economically  competitive  regional  force  by  using  our
better developed science and technology infrastructure to provide  essential
services ranging from electricity, agriculture, communication, education  to
other products of the human mind.

Science and technology are indeed a  crucial  instrument  in  all  forms  of
human endeavour in this regard. It is part  of  our  accepted  international
obligations  to  advocate  the  eradication  of  global  poverty   and   the
marginalisation of developing countries that form two-thirds  of  the  world
community which is condemned to backwardness, superstition and  diseases  by
the so-called modern society.

Comrade President, thank you for your  initiative.  Nepad  provides  a  good
springboard for an all-African initiative and solution in advancing  science
and technology on our continent, whilst the formation of an African  Science
Technology Commission is indeed a step in  the  correct  direction  for  our
continent. Thank you, Mr President. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the address of the President on the  state  of
the nation was of a commendable standard, even though it was a bit long  and
above our heads and that of the nation. This is made clear  when  one  reads
and re-reads the speech. At each re-reading, it sparkles with new light  and
new vistas surface.

I want to further commend the high visibility of Africa in the  address  and
repeat the satisfaction and delight of some of  us  that,  since  the  light
dawned on the President when he declared ``I am  an  African'',  that  light
and vision that it brought have not left him. Pan-Africanists  of  all  ages
and colours are standing up like the Biblical cloud of  witnesses  to  watch
the manifestation of this apocalypse.

Another magnificent spark in the address was the impassioned plea from  this
Chamber for peace in the world. ``Give peace  a  chance'',  was  a  constant
refrain. We support the President on this courageous stand.

On 12 September 2001, a  day  after  the  dismal  11  September  attacks,  I
remarked in this Chamber that citizens of the global  village,  like  fellow
villagers in a ``mokhukhu'' [informal settlement], share  a  common  destiny
and cannot express their sentiments with the bang-bang of  guns  or  candles
and matchsticks. They do not have the luxury or space for survival  if  they
indulge in a war without careful  planning  and  thought.  This  country  is
renowned in the world as a miracle state, saved from a ``bloodbath''.

It has one commodity only that it can share with the world and that  is  the
miracle of sustained dialogue, negotiation, reconciliation and peace.

I appeal to the other parties to stand in solidarity with the President  and
endorse this sentiment. It may be just another miracle  that  the  world  is
waiting for.

Coming back home, let me hasten to express my one  major  disappointment  in
the speech. This  is  the  persistent  downgrading  and  downsizing  of  the
HIV/Aids pandemic. To equate HIV/Aids with TB and  malaria,  although  there
are commonalities, is disturbing. The emergence of the street assembly  with
thousands voting with their feet is not an act of defiance  of  this  august
Assembly. It is an expression of despair. Jurgen Moltman comments sharply:


  Living without hope is like no longer living. Hell is hopelessness and it
  is not for nothing that at the entrance of Dante's Hell, there stand  the
  words ``Abandon hope, all ye who enter here''...

A nation without hope needs intervention. The profile of Aids  needs  to  be
raised very high and a lot of resources poured into  this  darkness  in  the
soul of the nation. Aids is like war; if not stopped in time, we may be  too
late to help those who are already in the graves,  and  this  would  nullify
all the collective good that may accrue from our other good  intentions  and
acts. The moment to act is now. Those who are dead may not be able  to  make
a call to  the  magnificent  government  call  centre  or  the  e-government
gateway.

The President has  put  his  finger  on  another  major  crisis  facing  our
country. I refer to the joblessness, foodlessness and  hopelessness  of  the
poorest of the poor for whom the tide is turning very slowly. Parts  of  the
speech, like the repeated mention  of  social  grants,  child  grants,  food
parcels, high food prices,  free  health  care  for  the  disabled,  school-
feeding etc, show that these are shared concerns. What  is  inexplicable  is
the Government's rejection of a basic income grant for the  unemployed.  Our
view is that the concept of Umbamba sisu is not an act of surrender.  It  is
a realistic way of putting something in an empty stomach  while  you  engage
the person in planning for the transformation of the total situation  or  of
the economy.

Our view on the economy  is  that  the  tide  can  turn  only  if  crime  is
contained. There is a vicious cycle here of crime, investments,  jobs,  more
poverty and more crime. The cycle can only be broken at the entry  point  of
crime.

The President has raised hopes that our  crime  prevention  departments  are
winning. This is appreciated, but the  overall  climate  remains  unchanged,
and the criminal is not getting the message. This delays the  transformation
and prolongs the pain of those who are at the bottom of  the  heap.  It  has
been said that some  things  cannot  be  done  slowly  and  gradually,  like
extinguishing a fire, operating on a patient or killing an ox.  If  it  must
be done, it must be done speedily and expeditiously.  Why,  one  might  ask,
are criminals and the mafia more afraid of Botswana than  of  South  Africa?
This country is losing millions of rands because  of  retarded  or  arrested
growth. Crime is costing us dearly.

I noted in the President's speech that  traditional  royalty  would  not  be
marginalised and that  they  are  regarded  as  important  partners  in  the
transformation of our rural communities. This is welcome news but  needs  to
be pursued with more conviction, more vigour and  more  adroitness.  I  also
noted that expanded resources would be made available for  the  nodal  areas
of Coega, Lepelle, La Mercy.

This is welcome  news  and  I  agree  that  vigorous  development  in  these
critical areas can bring signs of hope to many people and have  more  impact
on the total strategy for changing our country.

Appreciation has been expressed about the successes  of  the  African  Union
Summit, the World Summit on Sustainable  Development  and  now  the  Cricket
competition, particularly the  high  level  of  security  for  international
guests.  We  must  add  our  word  of  congratulations  to   this   laudable
performance by our security forces.
The only sad thing is the  manner  in  which  some  countries  are  bent  on
pulling politics into activities like sport.  If  this  lapse  or  trend  is
allowed to continue, it will kill the spirit of sport stone dead. There  are
no perfect states in  our  world  as  yet,  and  sports  cannot  wait  until
countries are perfect. Sports are God's gift to mankind in  order  that  the
Olympic  spirit   may   permeate   into   the   atom-infested   world.   The
uncompromising  attitude  towards  Kenya  and  Zimbabwe  must   be   roundly
condemned.

This evil spirit will kill  international  sport.  It  will  also  kill  the
Commonwealth. It will kill the Non-Aligned Movement  and  even  the  African
Union and the United Nations. Countries of the global  village  should  join
hands, go to venues that are  suspect  and  pitch  their  tents  there.  Put
differently, instead of surrendering or abdicating or  politicising  venues,
insulting countries and continents, the cricket  family  of  nations  should
have formed a joint peacekeeping force to drive away the evil  spirits  from
Zimbabwe and Kenya,  and  let  the  spirit  of  sport  triumph.  It  is  not
difficult to see that it will be impossible  in  the  future  to  provide  a
venue that is acceptable to all - not in our imperfect world.

In conclusion, I  want  to  echo  the  President's  positive  sentiments  in
pointing  the  nation  to  the  40th  anniversary  of  the  OAU,  the   10th
Anniversary of our South African miracle; the 6th anniversary  of  the  TRC,
the 2nd anniversary of the Freedom Park, and  the  2nd  anniversary  of  the
moral regeneration movement.

Above are the dark clouds of war. We are challenged to  look  for  a  silver
lining, signs of hope, signs of life, and  signs  of  triumphant  life.  Our
South African one-word-summary for all this is Halala!

Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker, hon President Mbeki, hon  Deputy  President
Zuma,  hon  members,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  on  16  December  last  year,
President Mbeki in his president's address to the ANC  National  Conference,
in a very balanced yet unequivocal manner, placed the vexed question of  the
ongoing process of the transformation of the judiciary  and  the  magistracy
for consideration on the national agenda for the coming period.

I refrain from reading the whole quote. Suffice it to say  that  it  appears
to me that this invitation for intervention by way of  dialogue  and  action
from the President, at the very least,  contains  the  following  components
for consideration: Firstly,  that  the  ANC  believes  in,  fights  for  and
actively promotes the rule of law and  the  independence  of  the  judiciary
``to apply the law impartially and without fear or favour'' and has  a  duty
to protect, promote and build our courts, as set out  in  the  Constitution.
However, this must always be done in a balanced and nuanced  manner,  having
due  regard  to  the  respective  constitutional  and  legal  roles  of  the
legislative and executive authorities in relation to the judiciary  and  the
respect and courtesy the three arms of government should accord each other.

Secondly,  that  the  disturbing  point  of  view  that  transformation  has
obviously  not  progressed  as  well  in  the  judiciary   as   within   the
legislatures and executive branches is gaining ground.

Thirdly, that the ANC cannot afford or allow a situation to develop  whereby
our judicial system, and its institutions, lose credibility with our  people
as a whole, arising out of a failure to consider and find solutions  to  the
challenges that face the judiciary and magistracy  in  the  context  of  the
national transformation process, and
Fourthly, that the national transformation process within the judiciary  and
magistracy comprises  two  components,  which  are  both  falling  short  of
expectations and require redress. Firstly, there is the  slow  ``realisation
of the objective of equitable representation of black  people  and  women'',
which  I  shall  term  diversity,  personnel  or  symbolism  transformation.
Secondly, there is the intellectual  and  ideological  approach  adopted  by
judges and  magistrates,  during  the  prosecution  of  this  transformation
process, when ``implementing the letter and spirit  of  our  Constitution'',
hopefully ``impartially, and without fear or favour'', which  I  shall  term
intellectual content or substantive transformation.

Transformation  of  the  judicial  system,  including  the   judiciary   and
magistracy, does not mean merely destroying for the sake of  it  that  which
was built during the apartheid years, nor does it mean  merely  reforming  a
few aspects thereof. It is rather our task, in  prosecuting  our  vision  of
transformation,  to  take  that  which  is  good  or  useful  in   the   old
dispensation and in a  holistic,  integrated  and  comprehensive  manner  to
transform and build on it.

However, it is my considered opinion that the whole South  African  judicial
system and the institutions underpinning it, because  of  its  past  record,
when our new democracy took root in 1994, to varying degrees, suffered  from
a serious crisis of credibility, legitimacy and efficacy.

Therefore, I do not believe that we can  start  rebuilding  or  transforming
the judicial system, if we do not understand and recognise what it  is  that
we did to ourselves as a nation in the past. We cannot build  a  new  nation
and a new future in a vacuum. Whatever changes we want  to  bring  about  to
create a  nonracial,  nonsexist,  democratic  and  prosperous  society  must
firmly be rooted in the reality of what we have available  to  us  today  in
human, intellectual, spiritual, emotional and material terms.  Sad  to  say,
what we have is, to a large extent, damaged goods.  Yet  it  is  with  those
materials, damaged and warped as they may  be,  that  a  brighter  and  more
humane future must be built.

Since the advent of our new democracy in 1994, the courts have  slowly  been
climbing out of the quagmire in which they had been submerged, with  a  slow
concomitant  increase  in  their  levels  of  legitimacy,  credibility   and
efficacy.

It is vitally important for the  successful  prosecution  of  our  political
transition and the socioeconomic transformation  of  our  country  that  the
rehabilitation of our courts and  judiciary  remains  on  a  gradual  upward
curve; hopefully soon to gain momentum. It  is  trite  to  state  that  this
rehabilitation  process,  on  the  one  hand,  is  the   responsibility   of
particularly the Government, but also all  politicians  and,  on  the  other
hand, and most importantly, the judiciary itself.

I can state unequivocally that the ANC takes this task very seriously.  This
means scrupulously  respecting  and  promoting  the  rule  of  law  and  the
independence of  the  courts  and  our  judiciary,  and  providing  adequate
assistance and resources - within our means  -  for  the  courts  to  fulfil
their constitutional obligations. However, we also  firmly  believe  in  the
necessity of our courts and judiciary to be accountable, in the broad  sense
of the word, to the people of South Africa, although there  are  a  few  and
inadequate mechanisms available  at  this  stage  to  achieve  this  equally
important objective. This is  an  urgent  priority  that  the  committee  is
dealing with at present.

I firstly deal with  diversity  transformation.  In  his  intervention,  the
President, whilst remaining mindful that  our  democracy  is  still  in  its
infancy and accepting that the full realisation of  the  objectives  of  the
Constitution relating to the judiciary are still a  matter  of  the  future,
correctly raises the  slow  ``realisation  of  the  objective  of  equitable
representation of both black people and women'' on the Bench. What  have  we
done and what are we doing as a nation to realise this objective?

The Judicial Service Commission is charged with advising  the  President  as
to  the  appointment  of  judges  to  our  higher  courts.  The  Magistrates
Commission performs a similar task in respect of magistrates.

Section 174 (1) of the Constitution provides that -


  Any appropriately qualified woman or man who is a fit and  proper  person
  may be appointed a judicial officer.

A Constitutional Court judge must also be a South African citizen.

Section 174 (2) provides that in making judicial appointments -


  the need for the judiciary to  reflect  broadly  the  racial  and  gender
  composition of South Africa must be considered.

Since 1994, the Judicial Service Commission has sought, in recommending  the
appointment of judges, to give effect to this directive and has  recommended
the appointment of a number of black persons and  women  as  judges  of  the
superior courts. As the statistics will show, this falls far short  of  what
we need.

The JSC has  also  developed  criteria  for  consideration  in  recommending
persons for appointment, but time does not allow  me  to  reflect  on  those
here.

After each  candidate  is  interviewed  publicly  in  the  Judicial  Service
Commission, it then retreats behind closed doors,  weighing  the  merits  of
each  candidate  against  the  above  criteria.  Each  of   the   twenty-odd
commissioners then casts his or her vote accordingly, the majority  view  of
the Judicial Service Commission prevailing if the requisite number of  votes
are garnered for a specific candidate.

Broadly speaking, more often than not, when weighing up  candidates  against
each other, the distinction and  tension  between  diversity  transformation
and intellectual content transformation arises. They do not always  overlap.
Diversity transformation  is  obviously  meant  to  promote  the  designated
categories  of  black  people  and  women,  whereas   intellectual   content
transformation embraces the candidates' value system, approach  to  justice,
capacity  for  justice  and  understanding   of   the   direction   of   the
Constitution, and therefore may include any person, including  white  males,
who  actively  promote  the  philosophies  underpinning  our  constitutional
dispensation and social transformation  project.  A  candidate  may  qualify
under the one, but not under  the  other.  Which  should  be  accorded  more
weight? Or, if a person from a designated group does not meet the  requisite
criteria set for the intellectual content transformation  component,  should
they still be appointed? These are the very complex and vexed questions  the
Judicial Service Commission has to regularly grapple with. I  personally  am
not certain that we always find the  right  balance,  in  particular  as  it
relates to the intellectual transformation component.

As our  President  correctly  points  out,  part  of  the  solution  is  the
conscious and consistent building of a pool of  potential  black  and  women
candidates  for  appointment  to  the  judiciary  and  magistracy.   A   few
mechanisms have been developed and utilised in this  regard.  However,  such
attempts, in my view, have been  haphazard,  arbitrary  and  unco-ordinated.
Much still must and can be done in this regard. We need to place it high  on
our list of priorities for the coming period.

I also have various statistics for the present composition of the  judiciary
and magistracy but time does not allow me to  deal  with  them.  I  am  just
going to give an  overall  analysis.  An  analysis  of  all  1  886  serving
judicial officers, from both the  judiciary  and  the  magistracy,  starting
from an almost zero base, particularly in the higher  courts,  reflects  the
following composition: 41,1% are black, 58,9% are white, 19,1%  are  female,
and 80,9% are male; or to put it  differently:  51,4%  are  from  designated
groups, and 48,6% are white males.

As far as leadership positions of the 14 entities  comprising  our  superior
courts are concerned, 10 have heads or ... [Interjections.]  The  difference
is I don't accept it. You accept it ... acting heads of the  court  who  are
black male persons and four are headed by white males.

In conclusion, I turn to the Chief Justice who opined recently:


  I think transformation is proceeding as quickly as it can. Today a  third
  of the higher judiciary is black and 20% to 25% of judges are women. That
  is a significant change in a short period.

Although it is difficult to logically fault such a  conclusion,  we  equally
should remain mindful of the words of our previous Minister of  Justice  who
cautioned:


  I don't think that respect for the judiciary  will  come  simply  because
  there are black appointments or that there are more women, but I think it
  will make a contribution to building that respect.

Much still remains to be done in changing the diversity composition  of  our
Bench and we should do so in all haste.

Secondly, I turn to the intellectual content transformation.

In his intervention, the President reminds us that judicial  officers,  like
every other South African, come to their positions with  definite  political
and ideological perspectives. Correctly  he  points  out  that,  in  itself,
there is nothing wrong or unexpected about this, as long as  this  does  not
impair their  ability  to  implement  the  letter  and  the  spirit  of  our
Constitution and laws, impartially and without  fear  or  favour.  In  other
words, simply put,  we  do  not  want  judicial  officers  in  our  newfound
democracy to become ``pro-executive minded judges'', but neither do we  want
them to be ``anti-executive minded judges''.  We  only  expect  them  to  be
diligent and even-handed in the discharge of  their  duties.  Unfortunately,
it would seem that there are some judicial  officers  in  this  country  who
continuously interpret ``impartiality and without fear or favour''  to  mean
the promotion of an agenda which seems to have little or nothing to do  with
the philosophies underpinning our  constitutional  dispensation.  They  hide
behind  the  concept  of  the  independence  of  the  judiciary  and   legal
obfuscation to promote their brand of justice, which  more  often  than  not
harks back to a bygone constitutional and  legal  era,  whose  most  abiding
legacy is its declaration as a crime against humanity.

It  goes  without  saying  that  the  most  important  component   in   this
rehabilitation process of our previous apartheid judiciary is the  judiciary
and magistracy itself and the judges and  magistrates  that  constitute  it.
Respect, legitimacy and credibility cannot be bestowed  upon  an  individual
or institution. The judiciary is no exception. It  could  not  and  was  not
ever expected that  the  mere  taking  of  an  oath  of  allegiance  to  the
Constitution by members of the apartheid judiciary would  bestow  legitimacy
and credibility upon it. The judiciary, through mainly its own  conduct  and
the  approach  and  tone  it  adopts  towards  the  unfolding   transitional
processes and the socioeconomic transformation of our country, will set  the
agenda and pace of  its  own  rehabilitation  process  and  the  esteem  and
respect within which our people as a whole will hold it. It  is  a  delicate
balance that the judiciary must chart, with integrity, diligence and  vigour
between,  on  the  one  hand,  its  genuine  and  legitimate  constitutional
obligations and, on the other hand, its status  as  a  full,  committed  and
vital component of the political centre of this country,  which  must  steer
our fledging democracy from  its  pariah  status  to  a  proud,  stable  and
functioning democracy,  which  must  successfully  prosecute  the  unfolding
socioeconomic and ideological transformation  of  our  country.  The  litmus
test would be how  individual  judges  and  magistrates  will  pursue  their
legitimate and genuine  constitutional  obligations,  without  wittingly  or
unwittingly going out out  of  their  way  to  frustrate  or  undermine  the
legitimate and genuine choices and aspirations  of  the  majority  of  South
Africans to create a fully functioning democracy  and  a  socioeconomic  and
ideologically transformed country. It is a relationship that  the  judiciary
must base on the cornerstones of honesty, integrity, dignity  and  openness.
The judiciary and individual judges need to be  exemplary  in  this  regard,
more so since 1994, because the role of judges has become  more  pronounced,
more  part  of  the  mainstream   of   political   choices,   with   greater
possibilities  of  frustrating,  derailing  or  undermining  the   political
aspirations or choices of the majority of South Africans.

This is so because  the  adoption  of  the  interim  Constitution  marked  a
decisive and revolutionary break with our legal and constitutional past.  It
is the legal foundation upon  which  all  legality  rests,  from  which  all
derive their authority. It embodies the spirit and essence of  the  rule  of
law. It provides for a decisive break  with  Westminster-type  parliamentary
sovereignty, ushering in a constitutional state where  the  Constitution  is
supreme.

It is often asserted, and correctly so, that the  Constitution  is  supreme,
not Parliament. Like most simple assertions, this statement  possibly  hides
more than it reveals. Firstly, a constitution cannot speak for or  interpret
itself; the courts have the sole responsibility  to  definitively  interpret
the Constitution, especially the Constitutional Court.  In  this  sense,  if
the truth be told, it is really the courts who are supreme as they say  what
the Constitution is or is not. Secondly,  and  equally  importantly,  within
the parameters of constitutionality, Parliament is supreme to make  whatever
political choices it deems fit.

This, of course, leads  to  a  very  complex  and  complicated  relationship
between the trias politica, particularly in an abnormal society  like  ours.
But, as we  have  become  accustomed,  the  Constitutional  Court  has  been
exemplary in striking the right and  correct  balance,  which  other  courts
must follow, which sometimes they don't  do.  One  of  these  pronouncements
eloquently reflects this approach by the late Justice Mohamed in  the  Azapo
case, where he says:


  There can be legitimate debate  about  the  methods  and  the  mechanisms
  chosen by the lawmaker to give effect to  the  difficult  duty  entrusted
  upon it in terms of the epilogue. We are not concerned with  that  debate
  or  the  wisdom  of  its  choices  or  mechanisms  but  only   with   its
  constitutionality. That, for us, is the only relevant standard.

Then, more recently, in the UDM case, the Constitutional Court also said:


  Courts are not, however, concerned with the motives of the members of the
  legislature who vote in favour of particular legislation,  nor  with  the
  consequences of legislation ...

And a bit further:


  In  essence,  however,  it  involves  restraint  by  the  courts  in  not
  trespassing onto that part  of  the  legislative  field  which  has  been
  reserved by the Constitution, and for good reason, to the legislature.

The characterisation of the relationships between the  legislature  and  the
executive on the one hand, and the judiciary on the other, is best  captured
in the provincial judges Canadian case. And I quote:


  These relationships should  be  depoliticised.  When  I  say  that  those
  relationships are depoliticised, I do not mean  to  deny  that  they  are
  political in the sense that court decisions both constitutional and  non-
  constitutional often have political implications, and that  the  statutes
  which courts adjudicate upon emerge from the political  process.  What  I
  mean instead is the legislating executive cannot, and cannot  appear  to,
  exert political pressure on the judiciary, and conversely,  that  members
  of the judiciary should exercise reserve  in  speaking  out  publicly  on
  issues of general public policy that are or have the  potential  to  come
  before the courts, that are the subject of political debate, and which do
  not relate to the proper administration of justice.
As we  build  institutions  in  our  emerging  democracy,  it  is  of  vital
importance that  all  leaders  in  our  society  continuously  and  actively
promote and encourage that the three arms of government show each other  the
necessary respect and  courtesy,  avoiding  gratuitous  reflections  on  the
integrity of one another. Chief  Justice  Chaskalson  recently  in  the  Van
Rooyen case eloquently captured this concept of mutual respect, thus:


  In exercising such powers, obedience to the doctrine of the separation of
  powers requires that the judiciary, in its comments about the other  arms
  of the state, show respect and courtesy, in the same way that these other
  arms are obliged to show respect for and courtesy to  the  judiciary  and
  one another. They should avoid gratuitous reflections on the integrity of
  one another.

This approach also guides the ANC when it differs  with  the  courts  as  we
have always attempted to use balanced, rational,  temperate  and  respectful
methods to express our differences of opinion. We do not  subscribe  to  the
misguided and extreme views, on the one hand,  which  say  that  judges  and
their pronouncements are always above criticism  or  rebuke,  especially  in
public, and, on the other hand, that government and politicians may play  to
the gallery and whip up public emotion by castigating and criticising  every
court pronouncement that differs with their point of view  in  an  emotional
and disrespectful manner and often without all  the  facts  being  available
upon which the decision was based. Both these extreme views are out of  step
with best international practices in all democracies of the  world  and  are
unacceptable to the ANC. Therefore, if we have a substantial  difference  of
opinion with a judge or the judiciary, we will not hesitate to raise it,  in
whatever way we deem apposite for  the  occasion;  but  it  will  always  be
foremost in our minds that our actions need to strengthen the judiciary  and
its legitimacy, credibility and efficacy.

Finally, this approach is best captured in  the  words  of  the  late  Chief
Justice Mohamed:


  Judges must consciously accept the risk that their judgments  in  crucial
  areas must be subject to vigorous attack and criticism. This should cause
  them no distress. A viable and credible  constitutional  culture  evolves
  most effectively within the crucible of vigorous intellectual combat  and
  even moral examination. Judges there have no right to demand any kind  of
  protection from the same kind of vigorous criticism to which they subject
  the contentions on behalf of the litigants who appear before  them.  What
  they are entitled to demand and do demand is that such  criticism  should
  be fair and informed; that it must be in good faith;  that  it  does  not
  impugn upon their dignity or bona fides and, above all, that it does  not
  impair their independence.

I trust with these few haphazard remarks that I have started to  respond  to
the President's injunction to  us,  and  that  this  debate  will  be  taken
further. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, hon President,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
Ministers and hon members, I would firstly like to take this opportunity  to
welcome everybody back to a year of new challenges and  hard  work.  May  we
all, with the grace of God,  be  able  to  inculcate  our  efforts  for  the
betterment of all of South Africa to the best of our abilities.

South Africa has come a long way and its history needs no  introduction.  As
can be gathered from the statistics given by our hon President, we have  had
a successful 2002. The opening of  Parliament  on  Friday  was  certainly  a
lovely event, and the hon President's eagerly awaited address seems to  have
made many promises for a better year ahead.

However, as always, there are those who choose  to  criticise  and  pick  on
petty issues, such as how long  the  President  spoke  on  certain  aspects.
People should know better. The short period  of  time  spent  focused  on  a
certain issue, such as Aids, does not mean that a relaxed position  has  now
been taken on this matter. I think all of South Africa knows the  extent  of
the Aids situation and  the  hard  work  that  is  being  performed  by  the
Government in order to contain the problem. Time should be spent on  working
together in overcoming problems, not on trying to create  more  problems  by
way of cheap technical tactics.

The MF shares the President's  sentiments  on  black  economic  empowerment.
Economic growth and empowerment are a means to a better quality of life  for
all South Africans. However, to make this possible, certain key issues  have
to  be  addressed.  Firstly,  the  opportunities  through  greater  economic
participation in all sectors by participants in black  economic  empowerment
must be outlined sector by sector at all levels. Secondly,  the  concept  of
scorecards and meaningful measurements and control of participation must  be
clearly outlined, monitored, evaluated and controlled. Thirdly, a  mechanism
must be created whereby the lethargy and indifference of our bureaucracy  is
speeded up.

The MF is pleased with the hon  President's  comments  on  the  increase  of
social grants to children  up  to  the  age  of  14.  However,  the  MF  has
reservations about the age limit and feels that it  should  be  extended  to
include children up to the age of 18, as this is the age at  which  most  of
our children are writing their matric.

As mentioned earlier, the President may not have placed  great  emphasis  on
the Aids issue,  but  we  are  aware  of  the  extent  of  this  pandemic  -
especially in the KwaZulu-Natal area. The MF therefore pleads  that  greater
attention be given to contain the matter and bring the Aids infection  to  a
halt.

As regards the current USA-Iraq situation, the MF strongly opposes  war  and
stands firm with all anti-war campaigns. The MF is  pleased  with  the  news
from the President and the acceptance of the South African proposal  by  the
Iraqi government. After decades  of  bloodshed,  the  world  still  has  not
learnt that no  dispute  is  settled  with  guns.  Let  us  pray  that  this
situation does not end up in becoming another silly mistake.

The adjustments to be made to the  social  wage  also  appear  to  be  quite
promising, with increased connections of water  and  electricity,  schooling
and improvements in other living conditions. This certainly pleases the  MF,
as it will make for better living conditions. Delivery is set to intensify.

The President's address has covered a number of  aspects  of  concern,  from
finance to social to health and so forth. Even pensions are set  to  receive
better delivery. All South Africans are a concern and deserve to  be  looked
after by their Government. There is no such thing that this concern is  more
for some than for others. Some might require more than others, but  that  is
as far as the difference goes.

Unemployment is still a worrying factor in South Africa. It  is  hoped  that
via  black  economic  empowerment  more  jobs  will  be  created   and   the
unemployment rate will be confined to a low  figure.  This  would  certainly
curtail our problems regarding poverty and development and it would help  us
to build a stronger fabric of South African people.  The  MF  further  feels
that funds allocated to certain projects should not be concluded,  but  that
all funds, though used wisely, should be made use of to the maximum.

The MF once again would like to take this opportunity to voice  its  support
of the President's address, which has certainly placed hope in the lives  of
many people. It is up to us now, as Government, to ensure that  delivery  is
made efficiently and effectively. We can do this by working together.

The MF once again expresses its pleasure to be back and  encourages  getting
back into the full swing of work. We have  taken  an  oath  to  improve  the
living conditions and affairs of all in South Africa.  The  MF  salutes  our
hon President on his initiative to improve the lives of  our  people.  South
Africa  Vukuzenzele.  Once  again,  Mr  President,   sizoqhubeka   sibumbene
simunye. [We will continue together as one.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, we have had a long debate and a long one is  still
ahead of us. I will therefore suspend the proceedings  for  10  minutes  for
the comfort of hon members.

Business further suspended at 16:14 and resumed at 16:31.

The SPEAKER: I would like to draw your attention to the fact  that  this  is
Mr Mthethwa's maiden speech. [Applause.]

Mr N MTHETHWA:  Hon  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
members, the subtheme of this address is: Empower the youth  to  secure  the
future, thus pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

In dealing with this subject, it is imperative for one to  start  by  paying
tribute  to  the  father  of  South  African  revolution,  and  indeed   the
liberation of the entire humankind, our late president, O R Tambo.

On the occasion of honouring South African youth  in  1981,  President  O  R
Tambo said: ``A nation, a country,  a  people,  a  movement  that  does  not
respect  its  youth,  does  not  deserve   its   future.''   This   profound
understanding of the role of young people in society has always  guided  the
ANC. This is in contrast with theories of reaction that  tend  to  create  a
dichotomy between youth and society at  large,  to  the  extent  of  pushing
youth issues to the periphery.

Historically, the youth of South Africa has been in a  state  of  repression
by successive apartheid governments,  which  not  only  violated  all  their
fundamental rights and opportunities by means of  oppressive  and  racially-
oriented laws, but also perpetually denied  them  opportunities  to  develop
and prosper to their full potential.

Emanating from this context was a series of challenges that  confronted  and
still confront the youth of South Africa.  Amongst  others,  there  are  the
challenges  of  unemployment,  poverty,  health-related   issues   such   as
HIV/Aids, lack of skills, and lack of information that enables young  people
to make  relevant  and  informed  choices  about  their  lives  and  minimal
resources of youth development initiatives.

The  democratic  Government,  upon  assumption  of  power  in  1994,  placed
emphasis on youth  development  as  one  of  the  fundamental  tentacles  of
socioeconomic and political transformation of our country.  Signifying  this
commitment,  the  new  Government  conducted  extensive  consultations  with
youth, represented by their organisations.

Emphasis  is  currently  placed  on  designing  meaningful  and  sustainable
strategies that define in succinct terms  the  nature  of  Government's  and
society's  intervention  and  the   anticipated   impacts   thereof.   Youth
development as a cross-cutting issue continues to be  a  strategic  priority
of Government, and this explains in clear terms that  indeed  the  tide  has
turned. Ongoing efforts by youth development organs should ensure that  this
focus is sustained and that the interest does not dissipate.

There are many systems providing youth development  in  our  country  today.
Amongst others there is the Constitution of South Africa,  the  White  Paper
on Local Government  published  in  1998,  the  National  Youth  Development
Policy Framework document for 2002 - 2007, which was published in 2001,  and
the formation of the National Youth Commission itself in 1996.

The executive in the Government is responsible for all  executive  decisions
including, inter alia, the  National  Government  Youth  Development  Policy
Framework and Youth Work Practice.

There are no obvious obstacles from the national  or  provincial  government
to the inclusion of youth  development  in  all  operations  of  governance.
However, the difficulty arises because different institutions  play  varying
roles in youth development  at  national  level.  National  Government  must
ensure that there is  effective  co-ordination  and  that  there  are  clear
operational mandates  for  all  tiers  of  government  through  co-operative
governance.

Some of the institutions involved are the  National  Youth  Commission,  the
Inter-departmental Committee of Youth Affairs, the Office of the  Status  of
Women, and many others.

The provincial role, with  respect  to  youth  development  and  youth  work
practice, is very similar to that of the national sphere of Government.  The
difference that can be noted is that nine  provincial  administrations  have
to translate the national vision, policy  frameworks,  norms  and  standards
into programmes which can be implemented  in  the  context  unique  to  each
province.  Then,  at  the  national  level,  for  youth-sensitive  resources
allocation, monitoring and  creating  partnerships  between  Government  and
civil society.

For local government, its singular role is a  theatre  of  action.  Even  in
areas where the competencies are  placed  at  the  provincial  and  national
level,  for  example,  education,   social   security   grants,   etc,   the
responsibility to co-ordinate how these things happen  at  the  local  level
remains in the hands of the local government officials.

On the issue of youth economic participation, it should be  noted  that  the
high unemployment that people are referring to  today,  is  because  of  the
apartheid legacy.

Lack of specific skills amongst young people, especially those that are  out
of the social and  economic  mainstream,  act  as  a  serious,  debilitating
factor  for  the   latter's   massive   involvement   in   income-generating
activities.

At the Stellenbosch  Conference,  the  ANC  took  resolutions.  Notable  are
resolutions that affect youth and  acknowledge  that  the  participation  of
youth in the political, social and economic life of the country  is  key  to
strengthening and enhancing the culture of democracy.

In these resolutions, emphasis was laid on paying urgent  attention  to  the
implementation  of  youth  programmes  and  the  monitoring  thereof.  These
programmes include the National Youth  Service,  an  integrated  sustainable
youth economic participation  strategy,  the  proposed  legislation  on  co-
operatives to cover specific needs of youth,  the  Preferential  Procurement
Policy to be reformed and amended to benefit  youth  enterprises  and  links
with big business for skills development and markets, as well as  sufficient
access to  financial  resources.  The  ANC-led  Government  should  continue
unapologetically to develop these programmes that address the needs of  this
sector, with all youth stakeholders playing a central role.

On the other hand, the Umsobomvu initiative, together with other  government
departments, has for the  past  two  years  covered  areas  such  as  skills
training, access to information,  counselling  on  HIV/Aids-related  issues,
and putting in place building blocks of sound youth entrepreneurship.

This is another way, and another attempt of the  Government,  to  push  back
the frontiers of poverty and ignorance amongst youth.

These mechanisms are in no way  exhaustive,  since  we  know  that  societal
wants are unlimited, whilst resources in any society  remain  limited.  This
is a clear example, which explains that  the  road  to  social  progress  is
always under construction.

Young men and women form a  substantial  part  of  the  population  and  are
affected by crime and violence, either as perpetrators or as victims.

However, our communities have no tolerance of criminal acts, such  as  those
of some who tend to take the law into their own  hands.  This  needs  to  be
discouraged and the point made that people should respect the country's  law
enforcement agencies. Young people,  particularly  those  under  age,  found
engaged in criminal activities  often  spend  unspecified  periods  awaiting
trial. During those periods, they come under further criminal influence  and
often become more hardened themselves.

Where young people are found engaged in crime, a proper assessment of  their
socioeconomic conditions and the actual crime has to be made.

On this score, we need to applaud some  of  the  initiatives  taken  by  the
Constitutional Development Department concerning social  mobilisation.  This
should be aimed at continuing the reversal of the effects  of  apartheid  on
young people; effecting drastic change in the status of young men  and  men,
and societal perception, which is mostly negative.

On the recommendations, all  government  departments,  both  provincial  and
local, should in their annual business plans make provision  for  programmes
aimed at addressing youth challenges and submit the impact thereof.

The Department of Provincial and  Local  Government  has  a  major  task  in
actually providing opportunities for the development of youth,  particularly
through the LED.

I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD:  Hon  President,  Madam  Speaker,  and  colleagues,  in  your
speech, Mr President, you emphasised the need to  determine  the  values  we
seek to define us, the need to enhance a moral renewal. But,  we  have  lost
our values. What does every South African see at the opening of  Parliament?
They see  moral  and  ethical  turpitude.  They  see  a  motley  crew  under
investigation, while the new South Afica is under construction. They see  at
least four people brushing with the law or grabbing  the  limelight  due  to
corruption charges and/or criminal investigation.

They see the lying former ANC Chief Whip, Mr Tony Yengeni, of  WaBenzi  arms
deal and Zama Resources Ltd fame, taking up his seat in  the  Parliament  he
defrauded  and  misled,  flanked  by  Mrs  Winnie   Madikizela-Mandela   ...
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, I drew attention earlier today  to  the  fact  that
there has been no sentence as yet, I am informing  the  House  now,  in  the
case of Mr Yengeni. He is still a member of this House until  the  House  or
his party decides otherwise. Please bear that in mind in any statements  you
make. [Interjections.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Thank you, Madam Speaker, we will be guided  in  this  regard
by the plea agreement Mr Yengeni has signed with the state in  pleading  his
sentencing. [Interjections.] Mrs Winnie Madikizela, herself no  stranger  to
the legal process, is a stranger to this Parliament. They  see  the  Western
Cape Premier, Mr Marthinus Van Schalkwyk, whose New NP apparatchiks  in  the
Western Cape, Mr Marais and Mr Malatsi,  have  immortalised  Don  Vito,  the
Count and golf estates, the same  Count  whose  Augusta  helicopters  won  a
controversial bid in the arms procurement, prompting  the  question  whether
the ANC-New NP alliance have merged donors and friends in addition to  their
alliance. [Interjections.]

They see Deputy President Jacob Zuma,  currently  under  investigation,  who
has a close controversial friend, Mr Schabir Shaik, himself facing  criminal
charges, and implicated in a conflict  of  interest  mess  involving  former
Minister Mac Maharaj.  [Interjections.]  Mr  Maharaj  now  appears  to  have
displayed contempt for Paliament's code of  conduct,  in  Yengeni-style  and
used his Cabinet position in Modise-style. [Interjections.]

Today, we can rightfully ask what the values are that define us.  What  type
of moral regeneration do we speak  of?  How  can  there  be  any  notion  of
morality when the Deputy President  of  our  country,  Mr  Jacob  Zuma,  the
leader of Government's  moral  renewal  campaign,  maintains  a  stony-faced
silence over whether he met Thales' Mr Alain Thetard in  November  1998,  or
on 11 March 2000, if he  has  nothing  to  hide?  It  is  a  simple  factual
question. [Interjections.] Why is it that you are  unwilling  to  appoint  a
commission of inquiry to probe this matter? [Interjections.]

In her reply to the DA request, dated 12 December 2002, your  legal  adviser
states the following:


  The President has not received any information that would necessitate the
  establishment of a commission of inquiry in this regard. You will  surely
  appreciate the prudence of not appointing commissions of inquiry  on  the
  basis of mere allegations.

Apart  from  the  clear  and  apparent  fact  that  the  raison  d'Ãªtre   of
commissions of inquiry is to probe allegations, you acted on  the  basis  of
Mr Kevin Wakeford's mere allegations. You appointed the  Myburgh  Commission
of Inquiry on 15 January 2001. The Wakeford allegations  were  found  to  be
baseless and unproven. Why this double standard?

What type of society  are  we,  and  what  values  do  we  embody  when  the
presidential ceremonial entourage at the opening of Parliament resembles  an
identification parade at a criminal investigation?

Mr President, we have every right to ask you today: What values will  define
us? [Interjections.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: The last reference  that  Ms
Taljaard has made to the presidential entourage is clearly  unparliamentary,
and I ask her to withdraw it. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, I was part of the procession that  accompanied  and
brought the President into the  House.  So  were  all  the  other  presiding
officers. I would ask you, Ms Taljaard,  please  to  withdraw  that  comment
about the entourage.

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I will look for your guidance in this  regard,
as at least two members of that ceremony are indeed under  investigation  by
the Scorpions. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER:  Ms  Taljaard,  you  have  referred  to  the  entire  entourage
resembling  an  identity  parade.  Would  you  please  withdraw   that   and
apologise?

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I withdraw that. What type of society ...

The SPEAKER: And apologise! [Interjections.] Order!

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I apologise and I withdraw it.

The SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

Ms R TALJAARD: What type of society are we, and what  values  do  we  embody
when members of the presidential entourage, including the  Deputy  President
and Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk, are currently  under  investigation  by  the
Scorpions and the criminal investigative agencies in this country?

We have every right to ask you today what values will define us? What  moral
renewal edifice will we build with foundations of quicksand? We have had  at
least three  Cabinet  members  implicated  and/or  under  investigation  for
suspected corruption in South Africa's first decade of freedom: the late  Mr
Modise, Mr Maharaj and Deputy President Jacob Zuma.

There are further unresolved questions about former Minister Jay Naidoo  and
chief negotiator Jayendra Naidoo and the J&J Corporation. You promised  that
clear rules on cooling-off periods would be forthcoming for members  of  the
executive. You promised this in a Cabinet statement after a Cabinet  meeting
during the course of the furore of the arms deal. We have to ask: Where  are
these  ethical  guidelines  on  cooling-off  periods  for  members  of   the
executive?

We must not be surprised if those at other levels of our society take  their
cue straight from the top and display similar unacceptable  conduct  in  the
public sector.

In  recent  months,  we  have  seen  scandals  erupt  at  a  number  of  our
parastatals and regulatory bodies. It is  clear  that  when  the  corruption
circus rolls into town - and I am not only referring to the  maladministered
ANC-run Eastern Cape - everyone wants to get in on  the  act.  We  have  the
credit card antics of Mr Mkhwanazi, our National Energy Regulator.  We  have
the unlicensed pilot and Civil Aviation Authority CEO, Mr  Trevor  Abrahams'
gross misconduct revealed in a damning forensic audit. We have  the  wedding
sponsorship of former Public Enterprises Director, Andile Nkuhlu  by  Zama's
Mr Mlonzi, which derailed the Komatiland privatisation. We have the  housing
scandal  of  Spoornet  CEO,  Mr  Zandile  Jakavula,  and   the   arms   deal
sharedealings of former Armscor chairman, Ron Haywood, and  Denel  chairman,
Ian Deetlefs, in concert with Mr Modise.

We also have Public Enterprises DG, Mr Sivi Gounden,  who  appears  to  have
intervened in Transnet's  procurement  procedure  in  favour  of  ANC-linked
Skotaville Press. In addition, we have  the  conduct  of  officials  at  the
Department of Public Works in relation to the sale of a house to Mrs  Zanele
Mbeki.

Instead of having an iron-fisted approach of cracking down on corruption  or
dubious practice, most of these cases were dispensed with by a  limp-wristed
wrap on the knuckles or inaction.
What is lacking in this Government are sound  ethics,  moral  authority  and
the political will to act. While you have addressed  this  issue  with  many
lofty words and ideals in numerous speeches since you  became  President  in
1999, what is lacking is action. What Churchill wrote of  Stanley  Baldwin's
government in 1936 is equally applicable to the ANC  Government's  dithering
on corruption, and I quote:


  So they go on, in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved
  only to be irresolute,  adamant  for  drift,  solid  for  fluidity,  all-
  powerful to be impotent.

Minister Maduna, indeed, the legal process with Mr  Yengeni  will  take  its
course, sentencing will be given and all eyes will be on your party  to  see
what you do when the legal process deals with a member of your party.

Mr President, the DA urges you today to  be  decisive  and  resolved.  Sweep
away the cobwebs of corruption and conflicts of interest  that  blight  this
Government. Failure to act will see a dawn, and a false dawn, to the  second
decade of freedom. The second decade of freedom will be  a  dream  deferred,
unless you deal with corruption. I thank you. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

[... to scrub pots after meals is to attract the attention of pigs. That  is
to court trouble. That is to take a lioness to a place of  confinement.  One
should indeed adhere to the noble teachings of our ancestors  that  go  like
this: People should not be worried all that much when a child  goes  without
clothing to keep it warm, but they should be very  worried  when  the  child
has an empty stomach.

Hunger and poverty are enemies that can devour one with  their  long  teeth.
Let the year that brought suffering to me pass by; the  good  should  remain
with me.]
Between two evils, always choose the one that you don't know.  But,  in  our
case, it is impossible to leave the evil  that  we  know.  From  the  little
information that I have, the speaker before me is supposed to be  a  lawyer.
And as a self-professed lawyer like many other members  of  her  party,  she
should know that people have to be charged and tried in a court of law,  and
be found guilty before you can even  articulate  any  position.  [Applause.]
But, like I said, if there are two evils, I  will  choose  the  one  that  I
don't know. This one, which I already know,  is  going  to  waste  my  time.
[Laughter.]

The debate on whether the restructuring of  state-owned  enterprises  policy
has failed is neither here nor there, to the  disappointment  of  those  who
hoped that this one policy  would  lead  to  an  end  of  the  revolutionary
alliance. The 51st National Conference of the ANC has demonstrated that  all
alliance partners support policies of the ANC, which are in  turn  those  of
the Government. [Applause.]

There has never been an indication of policy failure in any way.  We  might,
of course,  have  problems  with  the  successful  implementation  of  those
policies. We need, therefore, to ensure that policy-makers and owners  share
the same vision as policy implementers. The restructuring policy  has  shown
that it is well-placed  to  ensure  that  we  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. It has only not benefited a few, as other people would like  us  to
believe. It has benefited communities.

One such good example is the Alexkor Mine in the Alexandra Bay.  You  remove
the mine, and the community is left  with  nothing.  Even  the  municipality
would be unable to deliver essential  services  to  the  community.  Another
good example is the role that is  played  by  the  Esselen  Park  School  of
Excellence, which is a Transnet subsidiary. Through this school, young  boys
and girls are given an opportunity to  make  meaningful  their  young  lives
with the youthfulness that they possess.

When we embarked on the restructuring process in South Africa in  comparison
to other countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico  and  so  forth,
where the aims of their restructuring were, amongst others,  to  reduce  the
public debt, our aim was to ensure support for black  economic  empowerment,
including community trust, employee ownership and the general  promotion  of
small, medium and micro enterprises.
Of course, at the same time, the restructuring  of  the  state-owned  assets
must ensure increased competition which in turn will improve efficiency  and
quality of services. Further aims will ensure  new  investments  in  private
companies and activities to allow the disadvantaged into the  mainstream  of
the economic arena. It  will  assist  in  the  modernisation  of  the  South
African industrial sector by increasing  competitiveness  and  strengthening
management  in  various  sectors  of  the  community.  It  will  allow   the
Government to concentrate its efforts on activities where  the  presence  of
the state is essential, such as in the social  services  sector,  education,
health, housing, etc.

We have always argued, and we continue to argue that restructuring of state-
owned assets is an integral part  of  the  transformation  of  our  economy,
which aims to increase the rate of growth and  development  of  the  economy
and of the infrastructure  to  meet  basic  needs  and  strengthen  economic
potential. This growth and development, which we  always  have  argued  for,
has to be sustainable and ensure that the economy yields meaningful jobs.

The national programme on restructuring is  always  aimed  at  ensuring  job
creation where possible and includes the creation of safety nets  for  those
workers who cannot secure continued employment  and  those  that  cannot  be
retained into fields that should ensure their retention.

Bjale ka ge ke Å¡etÅ¡e ke laeditÅ¡e mo nakwaneng ye sa tÅ¡wago  go  feta,  batho
ba gaborena ga ba swanela gore ba nagane gore ke ka baka la MmuÅ¡o wa ANC  ge
go se na meÅ¡omo. Re tseba gabotse gore batho ba gaborena ba  bantsi,  le  ge
ba hloka meÅ¡omo, ba a tseba gore ga se ka baka la lenaneo  le.  (Translation
of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[As I indicated earlier on, our people should not think that it  is  because
of the ANC-led Government that there is  unemployment.  We  know  very  well
that most of our people know that their unemployment was not caused by  this
programme.]

It is not through the restructuring  of  the  state-owned  assets  that  our
people are unemployed. I want this fallacy to go away  forever.  State-owned
assets do not employ more than 300 000  people  in  South  Africa,  and  you
don't have more than 100 000 of those  on  the  streets.  People  have  been
retrenched from all walks of  life.  But,  for  one  particular  reason,  we
always target restructuring - because it is done by Government.

Go ala dibodi ke go goka manong. Ke go apeÅ¡a ngwedi motÅ¡eka.  [Disego.]  [To
bare rotten matter on the surface is to attract the attention  of  vultures.
That is to honour the moon. [Laughter.]]

We are not going to be told by generals how to run the economy. The  economy
is not like a troop of soldiers who  are  standing  to  attention,  and  are
waiting for a command and who do as they  are  commanded.  The  notion  that
bureaucrats are by nature inefficient  is  not  only  misleading,  but  also
untrue. Some large private sector organisations  are  equally  bureaucratic.
Chang and Singh also question  whether  discipline  imposed  by  state-owned
enterprises bureaucrats and by the political system is  inherently  inferior
to debt imposed by markets on private corporations.

From a perspective which is not sympathetic to  private  sectors,  Ramamurti
has questioned the underlying exceptions made. Bureaucrats run those  state-
owned enterprises when, in fact, most are separate from and are  independent
of government and civil society. That divestiture will take bureaucrats  out
of business  when,  in  fact,  many  of  the  industries  which  state-owned
enterprises operate require regulation from privatisation, or that there  is
a consensus on the superiority of private over  public  ownership  when,  in
fact, this assumption is hotly debated in most  countries.  Perhaps  not  in
the abstract, but when applied to particular markets and activities.

Therefore, the restructuring of state-owned enterprises becomes  essentially
a step for sustainable growth and maintenance  of  economic  stability  that
ensures that  we  push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  towards  a  total
eradication of poverty. One of the pillars of this process has  to  do  with
the  establishment  of  new  partnerships  between  Government  and  private
enterprises, as this is the only way to ensure job creation.

Very funnily, even when these things happen before our eyes, the  triple  Ps
- private-public partnerships - we don't see  them.  Hon  Gibson  on  Friday
enjoyed one such partnership when  the  SAB  actually  sponsored  the  Chief
Whip's bash. I could see you enjoyed it. We could hear that  from  what  you
were saying! [Laughter.]
The President on Friday had this to say on the same issue:


  The Government will continue to work on  public-private  partnerships  to
  increase its capacity to respond to the needs of  our  people.  Fifty  of
  these are already in  operation  in  areas  such  as  health,  education,
  housing, information technology, tourism, and  Government  accommodationÃ¿
  ...

and I should add: The Chief Whip's bash!

The restructuring of state-owned assets has not, as many would  like  us  to
believe, been a blanket privatisation. On the  contrary,  a  number  of  new
entities were formed -  entities  such  as  Aravia.com,  Sasria,  Khula  and
Ntsika. Clearly, these new entities have brought them  with  efficiency  and
effective management. These were new entities that have brought  with  them,
not only new jobs, but sustainable jobs.

Ge e le lenyaga mokhora re o humane. Tlala ngwaga wono e otile. E  otiÅ¡itÅ¡we
ke mahuma ao re a humanego. Ka gona, ge e rata go phela a e  tÅ¡habele  mono.
Tlala le yona e tÅ¡haba tlala. [This year we have an abundance of food.  This
year hunger is lean. It is lean because of the good  rains  we  had  earlier
this summer. Therefore, if hunger wants to continue  living,  it  must  take
refuge here. Hunger is actually afraid of famine.]

Now, hon Taljaard, you would make a very good researcher if only  you  would
take this little bit of advice, though it is not wise to give  advice  in  a
crowd. [Laughter.] When you research, you don't determine the  end  results;
you discover them. [Laughter.] The problem with your method of  research  is
that you already have the results. So, you go and find a way  of  justifying
your results. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

You see, as a lawyer myself - unfortunately turned economist - I  know  that
you have to prove something. You don't say anything that is not a fact.  You
have to first find facts and move  with  the  facts  and  say  this  is  the
situation. But, that weakness and the  intelligence  of  that  magnitude  is
unfortunately absent somewhere on my left-hand side. [Laughter.]

I only hope that, by the end of tomorrow, they will be clearly  educated  to
the point that, this year, we are going to have a meaningful  discussion  in
this House and stop howling and whining in the bush. There are no  juju  men
here. You don't come here and  throw  bones  and  hope  that  you  will  get
results. [Laughter.] The results are  achieved  through  facts.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon
Deputy President and hon colleagues, my participation today in  this  debate
as a  member  of  the  Government  for  the  first  time  is  based  on  the
fundamental assumption that my party, the New NP, is in its heart  and  soul
a party of the new South Africa, prepared to be  an  active  participant  in
the new politics and the mainstream of South African political  thought  and
action. My party is committed to  demonstrating  in  a  practical  way  that
South Africans of all races can work together for the common good.  That  is
our approach and that is what the debate ought to be about. We will  not  be
deflected from our course by the very silly, often loud noise from our  left
- which is in fact to the right of the  political  spectrum.  [Applause.]  I
want to say, in  particular,  that  the  speech  by  the  hon  Taljaard  was
probably one of her weaker efforts in this House, very strident,  very  weak
and low on substance. [Interjections.] It was probably written  by  the  hon
Chief Whip of the Opposition, Douglas Gibson. [Applause.]

I intend briefly to refer  to  three  matters  today,  namely  the  language
policy, black economic empowerment and  affirmative  action.  In  discussing
language, I will be using my home language, Afrikaans.

Adjunkspeaker, tydens die afgelope ANC-kongres in  Stellenbosch  het  ek  u,
mnr die President, vir die eerste keer hoor Afrikaans praat - nie  vir  baie
lank nie, maar dit het baie goed gegaan. Ek  wil  vir  u  sÃª:  Ek  beskou  u
optrede as 'n gebaar van erkenning vir Afrikaans waarvoor ek u ook  hier  in
die Parlement wil bedank. Die Minister in u Kantoor,  dr  Essop  Pahad,  het
ook onlangs baie positiewe uitsprake  gemaak  oor  die  rol  van  Afrikaans.
Saamgesien met die Raamwerk Nasionale Taalbeleid wat reeds deur die  Kabinet
aanvaar is, lyk dit asof die fase van wat ek sou sÃª  verengelsing  in  Suid-
Afrika was, wat moontlik onbedoeld was, maar nou finaal  verby  is.  Ek  wil
die  President  en  die  regering  daarvoor  bedank  en  wil  vra,  mnr  die
President,  dat  daardie  benadering  ook  in  hierdie  hoogste   Raad   van
toepassing sal wees. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[Deputy Speaker, during the last ANC congress held in Stellenbosch  I  heard
you, Mr President, speaking Afrikaans for the first  time  -  not  for  very
long, but it went very well. I would like to tell you: I regard this act  as
a sign of acknowledgement of Afrikaans, for  which  I  would  also  like  to
thank you here in Parliament. The Minister in your Office, Dr  Essop  Pahad,
has also recently made quite a few positive statements  regarding  the  role
of Afrikaans. Seen in  conjunction  with  the  Framework  National  Language
Policy, that has already been accepted by the Cabinet, it seems  as  if  the
phase that I would call anglicisation in South Africa,  which  was  probably
unintentional, is now finally over. I would like to thank the President  and
the Government for that and I would like  to  request,  Mr  President,  that
that approach would also be made applicable to this highest Chamber.]

In your speech, you made references to black economic  empowerment  and  you
made the important point of the need for partnership between all sectors  of
our society to draw us all into a more prosperous and equitable future,  and
you emphasised that the empowerment you refer to  is  an  inclusive  process
and not an exclusive one, which, in our view, is a necessary and  reassuring
perspective. Clearly, the eradication of the  inequities  of  the  past  can
best be served by a  pragmatic  and  flexible  approach  which  creates  the
certainty and stability you argued for.

In the spirit of partnership, the time has also arrived  to  look  again  at
the way in which affirmative action negatively affects South  Africans  from
minority communities in the workplace. It can  be  argued  that  affirmative
action has achieved much of what it was intended to,  and  rightly  so,  but
the question must be asked if it does not - especially when  applied  in  an
unfair  and  unbalanced  way  -  contribute  to  a  feeling  of   exclusion,
alienation and marginalisation, which were such very cruel features  of  our
racially divided  past.  Affirmative  action  must,  by  definition,  affirm
something.

Ideally, it should be an affirmation of worth, of  value,  of  dignity.  The
problem with affirmative action in some companies and  industries  in  South
Africa is that this is not the case and, in some cases,  it  is  a  practice
which is more about filling quotas than  empowering  communities.  My  party
has often argued in the past that we favour a sunset clause  in  respect  of
affirmative action and as we approach the tenth year of  our  democracy,  we
must ask if the time for the sunset has not arrived so that we  can  have  a
new dawn where merit alone, and not race, is the only factor for  the  first
time in our history.

In your speech you said, Mr President, that  our  people  are  developing  a
strong sense of common patriotism and I  agree  that,  with  a  few  notable
retrogressive exceptions, perhaps this is largely true. It also reminded  me
of an observation of the late Prof Piet CilliÃ©, who said:


  True patriotism is not to love your country for what it is, but for  what
  it can be, namely a country which  encompasses  the  dreams  of  all  its
  citizens.

The New NP will work hard and will support your efforts,  Mr  President,  to
turn that dream into a reality for all South Africans. [Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Deputy Speaker, Mr President, Mr  Deputy  President,  I
will today  deal  with  the  concept  of  oversight  and  accountability  in
governance - hopefully in a more constructive and  dignified  way  than  was
done by the hon Taljaard a while ago.

In the last three major  presidential  speeches  delivered  on  16  December
2002,  8  January  and  14  February  2003,  reference  was  made   to   the
responsibility of the state to be  accountable  in  all  of  its  individual
components. In the address delivered in  the  North  West  province  earlier
this  year,  emphasis  was  laid  on  individuals   in   elected   positions
discharging their responsibilities with regard to  the  functioning  of  the
system of governance.

In Stellenbosch, the highest constitutional structure of the ANC  heard  the
following call:


  Led  by  the  executive  authorities  we  have  to  ensure   that   these
  administrations discharge their responsibilities of  serving  the  people
  through the effective and efficient implementation of policies decided by
  our legislature and the executive authority.


  The truth is, however, that during the period  since  our  50th  national
  conference there has been  a  number  of  instances  of  failure  of  our
  administrations and our leadership with regard to the  implementation  of
  these policies. The firm message this communicates to us is that we  have
  to strengthen accountability of all members of our leadership.

The executive arm of Government  is  enjoined  by  our  Constitution  to  be
accountable to Parliament within the broader design of  our  democracy  that
hinges on accountability,  responsiveness  and  transparency.  The  delicate
balance between the three mechanisms that make up the  state  is  maintained
equally by the executive as it is by Parliament and  our  courts.  Moreover,
initiatives of the executive, both in this Parliament and without, point  to
an adherence to the values and spirit of  the  Constitution  that  goes  far
beyond the letter of the law.

In the state of the nation address, reference is made to the  importance  of
maintaining contact with the people of  our  country  who  elected  us.  The
leader of the UDM earlier  spoke  in  scathing  terms  of  the  presidential
imbizos. Imbizos  are  traditional  democratic  mechanisms  that  have  been
adapted to modern times.  Drawn  from  the  wisdom  of  our  common  African
ancestors, they bring into the democratic fold  the  most  marginalised  and
vulnerable of our people.  The  imbizo  at  Bekkersdal,  to  which  specific
reference was made in the state of the nation address,  was  indeed  a  very
special occasion. The impact of a presidential and  governmental  imbizo  in
this community living  daily  without  basic  necessities  such  as  readily
accessible water and no prospect of adequate housing due  to  the  dolomitic
land on which the township is located, cannot be overstated.  Not  only  did
it result in a sudden boost of morale in the township, but  it  brought  the
prospect of real delivery through a shift in government policy and  spending
priorities. In simple terms, it  brought  to  the  people  of  Bekkersdal  a
promise of a better life. Imbizos are in this way a very real and  effective
initiative of the ANC-led Government and are to be applauded, and  hopefully
will be sustained  as  part  of  the  institution  of  the  Presidency  into
perpetuity. [Applause.]

However, imbizos do have their limitations, most  of  which  relate  to  the
demands of time on  the  executive  branch  of  Government.  This  is  where
Parliament's oversight capability is of great  import.  The  representatives
of the people, by their  very  nature,  often  have  intimate  knowledge  of
policy deficiencies or  implementation  lapses  which  is  obtained  through
regular constituency work or through parliamentary oversight visits or  even
public hearings. A more effective interface  between  MPs,  both  nationally
and provincially, and the relevant executive authority  inevitably  enriches
the  process  of  policy  formulation  or  implementation  by  the  relevant
government departments.  This  immediately  leads  to  more  responsive  and
effective government. There are vast areas for improvement in the manner  in
which Parliament conducts  its  oversight  function.  Up  to  now,  much  of
Parliament's focus has been on its lawmaking function. Parliament  has  now,
through a process initiated by the  presiding  officers  to  their  enormous
credit, begun to introspect and plan around its oversight role. To this  end
the Joint Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Oversight  and  Accountability  has  tabled
its final report before the Rules Committee for adoption  in  the  next  few
weeks.

Recommendations include, inter alia, structured  programming  of  meaningful
debates on oversight reports compiled by committees. This will  enable  more
effective engagement with the executive on matters  such  as  implementation
glitches. It is envisaged that  these  meaningful  engagements  between  the
representatives of the people and the  executive  authority  will  begin  to
develop into early warning signals of potential pitfalls which would,  inter
alia, result in direct savings.

For Parliament to  effectively  monitor  the  implementation  of  government
programmes and exercise its constitutional oversight role, it is  imperative
that   parliamentarians   have   an   in-depth   understanding   of    their
constitutional  mandate,  particularly  in  the  light  of   the   sometimes
blatantly unconstitutional tendencies that emerged  from  certain  quarters,
arising from the arms procurement. That there is a constructive  reason  and
point to oversight other than scoring political points seems  to  have  been
lost on some in this House; that oversight is meant,  after  all,  to  build
Government is twisted into a systematic deluge of  Government-bashing  which
seems to be aimed primarily at securing the proverbial head of a Minister.

There is, of course, a major role for opposition  parties  to  play  in  any
democracy. But there has to  come  a  time  when  the  opposition  party  in
question realises that to try to be everything to everybody and anybody  who
has ever said anything bad about Government  is  simply  senseless,  and  it
means that you are going to  end  up  looking  curiouser  and  curiouser.  A
simple regurgitation of media allegations is not a high enough  standard  to
set for this institution. [Applause.]

The report of the ad hoc  committee  begins  by  recommending  that  serious
attention be paid to developing amongst ourselves as  MPs  an  understanding
of  our  constitutional  mandates  and  their   purpose   in   the   broader
architecture of our system of democracy. This is not  to  say  that  quality
oversight work does not already get done in  Parliament.  On  the  contrary,
many best practices are developed particularly within committees,  and  that
these should be harnessed and become standard practice is also  recommended.
Synergy between the two  Houses  on  matters  of  common  interest  and  the
expansion  and  improvement  of  the  committee  section,   which   is   the
administrative support section of committees, is further  recommended.  This
area in Parliament is particularly dire and will require more  resources  to
be allocated to Parliament. [Applause.]

The support of the executive in  this  regard  and  the  overall  review  of
Parliament is particularly important when we consider that it is  governance
itself  that  is  enhanced,  enriched,  made  more   responsive   and   more
transparent, ideals that Government has long committed itself to.

The troika of the state machinery remains incomplete without the  judiciary.
What of  accountability  in  this  vital  element  of  Government?  Our  new
democracy has embraced the concept of judicial  independence  to  rebuild  a
pivotal element that was deliberately and systematically eroded in our  not-
so-distant past. Our Constitution  goes  further  and  addresses  the  long-
standing  debate  around  judicial  deference  and  judicial  activism.  The
Constitution clearly enjoins  judicial  officers  towards  activism  in  the
furtherance of fundamental human rights and, more  broadly,  the  underlying
values of the Constitution. This means that judges now have  a  bigger  role
to play in governance issues than ever before in our history and  therefore,
I submit, must be more accountable than ever before.

Judicial  independence  relates   to   the   constitutional   guarantee   of
independence  of  mind,  or  to  put  it  another  way,  the  guarantee   of
impartiality in dispensing justice. Judicial independence cannot,  and  does
not, mean freedom from accountability. The justice portfolio  committee  has
before it currently a Bill that seeks to introduce a disciplinary  mechanism
within the judiciary. Key issues such  as  who  sits  in  judgement  of  our
judges arise but so does the related question  of  accountability,  so  that
when judges begin by their unreasonable conduct  to  thwart  or  defeat  the
purpose  of  laws  that  have  been  found  to  be  constitutional  by   our
Constitutional Court, they may be held to account.

Together with like-minded members  of  the  judiciary,  Parliament  and  the
executive must engage over the idea that is  espoused  in  our  Constitution
that the different elements that make up the state  should  be  accountable,
transparent and responsive. That our judiciary  should  find  itself  firmly
within this loop is mere compliance with the values and spirit  underpinning
our democracy and will go a long way towards restoring utmost faith  in  our
courts. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon  Deputy  President,  hon
members, in my last speech last year, I referred to 14 February as  the  day
of the President's state of two nations address. Today I am in the  position
to deliver my state of two parties address. [Laughter.]  There  is  the  one
I'm just clinging to, the other one I'm going to. [Laughter.]

Hon President, as loyal and objective South Africans, we can appreciate  the
positive initiatives you have announced in your speech. In this regard,  the
following  should  be  mentioned:  extended   infrastructure   and   capital
investment. Important as social development and welfare services may be,  it
is capital projects that provide jobs and opportunity.

Secondly, there is the much-needed focus on better delivery,  especially  at
local level. Far too  often,  there  is  a  vast  difference  between  those
beautiful plans and schemes we hear about here in Parliament  and  the  hard
realities people experience in the real South Africa outside.

Thirdly, there is the extending of the social grant for children from  seven
to fourteen years. Of course, it is plain logic that a child of eight is  as
dependent as a child of seven. Also, we have the reaffirmation of  the  Gear
policies, rather  than  cheap  stuff  such  as  unsustainable  shortcuts  of
populist socialism, and the partnership with  the  business  community,  and
plans that black empowerment should be achieved by  way  of  sound  economic
principles. All these things we appreciate.

Maar die AEB het egter ook ernstige kritiek op die President  se  toespraak.
Die  kommando's.  Die  skielike  aankondiging   dat   die   kommando-stelsel
uitgefaseer gaan word, het skokgolwe deur ons landelike gemeenskap  gestuur.
Terwyl die kwessie van plaasaanvalle die mees sensitiewe  kwessie  is  onder
die blanke gemeenskap, terwyl die verslag van die Du  Plessis-kommissie  nog
steeds uitstaande is, terwyl die twee jaar-oue beloftes van  helikopters  en
40 000 reserviste nog uitstaande is, terwyl  noodoproepe  na  die  plaaslike
polisiekantoor dikwels beantwoord  word  met:  ''Ons  het  nie  'n  voertuig
beskikbaar nie.''. Terwyl al hierdie dinge gebeur, kondig u ewe luiters  aan
dat hierdie eerste en oudste  linie  van  beskerming  weggeneem  gaan  word,
sonder 'n duidelike alternatief om die vakuum te vul.  Is  dit  nie  in  die
minste 'n teken van onsensitiwiteit vir  die  behoeftes  en  vrese  van  ons
boeregemeenskap nie?  Besef  u  watter  rol  die  kommando's  speel  in  die
beveiliging van landelike gemeenskappe,  swart  en  wit?  Besef  u  dat  die
kommunikasiestelsel binne die kommando's die eerste en  belangrikste  kontak
is  tussen  afgeleÃ«   plaasboere   en   die   buitewÃªreld,   veral   wanneer
telefoondrade alreeds geknip is deur kriminele?

Mnr die President, ek wil  u  'n  baie  reguit  vraag  vra.  U  het  hierdie
aankondiging oor die  kommando's  gedoen  in  dieselfde  hoofstuk  waarin  u
verwys het na terreur aan die kant van  die  sogenaamde  Boeremag.  Het  die
sporadiese bedreiging  van  die  fanatieke  Boeremag  iets  te  doen  met  u
besluit? Indien wel, dan skop u die kat omdat die hond u gebyt  het.  Het  u
so geskrik vir 'n paar geÃ¯soleerde  ekstremiste  dat  u  die  kind  met  die
badwater wil uitgooi? Ek gee u vandag die versekering, en ek  plaas  my  eie
geloofwaardigheid daarvoor op die spel,  ons  kommando's  is  99%  toegewyde
landsburgers wat bloot wil beskerm  en  nie  bedreig  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[But the AEB also has serious  criticism  on  the  President's  speech.  The
commandos. The sudden announcement that the commando system will  be  phased
out sent shock waves through our rural communities. While the issue of  farm
attacks is the most sensitive issue among the  white  community;  while  the
report of the Du Plessis commission is still  outstanding;  while  the  two-
year-old  promises  of  helicopters  and  40   000   reservists   is   still
unfulfilled; while emergency calls to the local police  stations  are  still
answered with: ``We have no vehicle available.''.  While  all  these  things
are happening, you announce quite casually that this, the oldest  and  first
line of defence will be taken away, without a clear alternative to fill  the
vacuum. Is this not at least a sign of insensitivity towards the  needs  and
fears of our farming community? Do you realise what role is being played  by
the commandos in the protection of the rural  communities,  both  black  and
white? Do you realise that the communication system within the commandos  is
the first and most important contact among isolated farmers and the  outside
world, especially when telephone wires have already been cut by criminals?

Mr President, I would like to ask you a very straightforward  question.  You
made this announcement about the commandos in the same chapter in which  you
referred to terrorism on the part of the Boeremag. Does the sporadic  threat
of the fanatical Boeremag have something to do with your  decision?  If  so,
then you are kicking the cat because you have been bitten by the  dog.  Were
you given such a fright by a couple of isolated extremists that you want  to
throw out the baby with the  bathwater?  I  shall  give  you  the  assurance
today, and I shall put my own credibility on the line for this, that 99%  of
our commandos are committed citizens who only want to  protect  and  who  do
not pose any threat.]

I give you the assurance, Mr  President,  that  the  Boeremag  is  a  small,
isolated group and that their basis of religious exclusivity and  fanaticism
will never have fertile soil in the Afrikaner community,  precisely  because
of our belief in the solemn grace of God and  the  universal  power  of  the
redeeming blood of Christ for all the peoples of the world.

A second matter of grave concern is your foreign  policy.  Mr  President,  a
matter of real concern is our positioning in  the  international  world.  We
agree with you that war in Iraq should be avoided if in  any  way  possible.
We agree with you on the matter of Iraq  and  its  compliance  with  the  UN
regulations on disarmament, that it should be dealt with multilaterally  and
not by one superpower, but you can't  escape  the  impression  that  the  SA
Government is biased in favour of Iraq. Saddam Hussein  and  his  atrocities
are de facto excused when people in our Government say it is only about  the
oil that America is after and that Saddam is an innocent victim.

By warnings from the General ... [Interjections] ... I  am  not  talking  to
you. The warnings from the General Secretary of the ANC and the Minister  of
Health and the Minister of Foreign Affairs against possible  US  attacks  on
South Africa serve as an encouragement to Iraq to stand  firm  in  turbulent
times. From your address on Friday, one  gets  the  impression  that  Saddam
only needs some training in disarmament and everything will  be  hunky-dory,
without asking the crucial question whether he has the will to disarm.

From your speech, one gets the impression that with regard to Zimbabwe,  the
policy of silent diplomacy has made way for one of total  silence.  Likewise
South Africa supported Gaddafi in Libya's bid to host the  World  Commission
on Human Rights. Must we assume, Mr President, that  your  Government  still
has a soft spot for the Mugabes and the Gaddafis and  the  Saddams  of  this
world? Must we assume  that  old  struggle  loyalties  still  dominate  your
international policy, like the well-known song, ``Sal ons  ou  vriende  ooit
vergeet?''. Mr President, there  inevitably  comes  a  time  in  responsible
decision-making when old loyalties must make  way  for  new  realities  and,
believe me, that takes some guts. I have taken that risk recently and,  here
I am, still home and dry. Why shouldn't you do the same? [Laughter.]

President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote  a  letter  to  Australian  Premier,  John
Howard,  together  with  you,  co-member  of  the  Commonwealth  Troika   on
Zimbabwe. On the whole, the letter reveals great  sympathy  for  Mr  Mugabe,
especially for his land  reform  plan.  Obasanjo  gives  him  the  following
credit: ``The results of the  government's  effort  in  land  redistribution
have been claimed as remarkable.'' Can you, in  your  reply,  state  clearly
whether you share these sentiments and if so,  what  would  be  the  bearing
thereof on South Africa's land issue?

The last part of my speech I want to devote to the  crucial  matter  of  the
place and co-existence of minorities in South Africa. There are  people  who
think that somehow some miracle will bring back what they  call  ``the  good
old days''. They don't take the new South Africa for real but, on the  other
hand, it would be equally disastrous  to  take  the  new  South  Africa  for
granted, as if it will automatically succeed, without due consideration  for
the complexity of the South African community; as if the majority  can  only
carry on fulfilling its own agenda without even  asking  what  expectations,
emotions, aspirations and concerns are living in the hearts of minorities.

Ek het tot die  besef  gekom,  agb  President,  dat  daar  'n  onlosmaaklike
wederkerige interafhanklikheid is tussen die bevordering van breÃ«  nasionale
prioriteite en die beskerming van die regte  van  minderhede.  Aan  die  een
kant, so lank  as  miljoene  mense  'n  gebrek  het  aan  die  mees  basiese
lewensmiddele,  sal  die  mees   gesofistikeerde   korrektiewe   regte   van
gemeenskappe soos taal, kultuur en 'n eie gemeenskapslewe 'n sekondÃªre  plek
op die agenda inneem. Solank as wat mense  natreÃ«n  op  die  Kaapse  Vlakte,
honger ly in die afgeleÃ« gebiede van die Oos-Kaap en  Limpopo,  werkloos  op
straathoeke sit, in hulle duisende sterf aan Vigs, moet skoolgaan  onder  'n
boom, so lank sal dit wat vir ons kosbaar is as luukshede beskou  word.  Ons
erken dit. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I have realised, hon  President,  that  there  is  an  inextricably  mutual
interdependence between the promotion of  broader  national  priorities  and
the protection of the rights of minorities. On the  one  hand,  as  long  as
millions of people lack the most basic foodstuffs,  the  most  sophisticated
corrective  rights  of  communities,  like  language,  culture  and  an  own
community life, have to take a secondary position on the agenda. As long  as
people are drenched by rain on the Cape Flats, are starving in remote  areas
of the Eastern Cape and  Limpopo;  sitting  unemployed  on  street  corners;
dying in their thousands of Aids; must attend school under a tree,  that  is
how long things that are precious to us will be regarded as  luxuries.  That
much we admit.]

But,  on  the  other  side  of  the  coin,  as  long  as  communities   feel
collectively insecure about their land, about their culture,  the  education
of their children, the ethos of their schools, the safety of their  farmers,
the career prospects of their  youth  and  their  middle-aged  in  a  labour
market diversity  affected  by  a  never-ending  racially-based  affirmative
action - another distinctive characteristic  of  their  community  life  and
community institutions - so long will the country  forfeit  and  miss  their
invaluable and  loyal  creative  contribution  to  the  advancement  of  the
country as a whole, and that we can't afford.

In this regard, a proposal by the AEB at  the  parliamentary  forum  of  the
World Summit for Sustainable Development was unanimously accepted and  taken
up as one of the priority areas for sustainable development,  and  I  quote:
``Recognising cultural diversity  and  promoting  the  rights  of  cultural,
religious and linguistic communities.'' This, Mr President, is  something  I
sorely missed in your address on Friday. Really, there was nothing in it  to
strengthen my hands to convince  my  people  that  Government  really  takes
their concerns and legitimate aspirations seriously. [Interjections.]

There was nothing I could give to the widow left alone after a farm  killing
or to the matriculant with seven distinctions whose application for  medical
study was turned down  or  to  the  well-qualified  young  professionals  in
London who dearly want to come  back  and  invest  their  skills  and  their
expertise in a country they so dearly love.

When you address this House again, Mr President, please tell them that  they
are important too. They want to hear it from you - not from  me.  Tell  them
that their wellbeing is on your agenda as  well,  that  their  concerns  are
your concerns. Strengthen the hands of us loyal South Africans who  dare  to
place our heads on the block to come to terms with new realities,  who  dare
to  convince  our  people  that  their  future  lies  here.  I  thank   you.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Ms N R NTSHULANA-BHENGU: Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  President,  the  Deputy
President, hon members, the President  devoted  part  of  his  all-important
state of the nation address on Friday to the Cricket World Cup and sport  in
general.

We  commend  President  Mbeki  for,  once  again,  reaffirming  the  ANC-led
Government's view that sport is central  to  our  country's  nation-building
and social development. We  acknowledge  the  warm  welcome  that  President
Mbeki gave to the international sports bodies during  the  opening  ceremony
of the Cricket World Cup in Cape Town. Special praise  goes  to  the  United
Cricket Board of South Africa for its success in bringing this major  sports
event to Africa. We acknowledge the role played by the Departments of  Sport
and Recreation, Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  Safety  and  Security,
Transport, Trade and Industry, Home  Affairs,  Foreign  Affairs,  Provincial
and Local Government and Health.

This to us demonstrates an integrated approach to social transformation.  We
believe that the International Cricket  Council's  decision  to  award  this
major international sport to Africa  is  this  body's  acknowledgement  that
Africa has the capacity to host events of this magnitude. We recognise  this
as a contribution of the ICC to the  African  Renaissance  and  Nepad.  This
event will leave Africa  with  a  legacy  of  skills,  social  and  economic
benefits.

We however wish to express our regret  and  disappointment  at  last  week's
cancellation of the cricket match involving the English team, following  the
team's  refusal  to  participate   in   Zimbabwe.   We   urge   our   sports
administrators to spare no effort in ensuring that  the  general  enthusiasm
for the Cricket World Cup shown by our  people  is  translated  into  active
involvement in sport.

We assure the world that South Africa will make this  year's  Cricket  World
Cup the most memorable in the history of the game. We  in  the  ANC  welcome
the President's announcement that, towards the end  of  2003,  South  Africa
will host another prominent  international  sports  event,  the  President's
Golf Challenge. This will serve as another  motivation  for  taking  forward
our campaign of getting the nation to play, and claim  our  youth  from  the
streets.

We also  welcome  President  Mbeki's  announcement  that  Government  stands
firmly behind the bid for the 2010 Soccer World Cup. The Minister  of  Sport
and Recreation, Mr Ngconde Balfour, has initiated a  debate  on  bidding  to
host major international sports events in South Africa. This is in  response
to the challenge of co-ordination and early involvement  of  the  Government
and other role-players when bids are initiated.

We believe that bidding to host international sports  event  is  a  national
issue  rather  than  that  of  individual  sports   federations.   Therefore
Government should play a leading role. We believe such efforts  at  ensuring
that the country has an integrated approach to bidding for the  events  will
greatly improve our country's success at hosting events of this magnitude.

We in the ANC believe  that  sport  should  play  a  critical  role  in  the
struggle to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment. We  urge  Government  to
play a central role, and where necessary, an  interventionist  role  in  the
transformation of  sport  and  recreation  and  to  develop  programmes  and
initiatives aimed at increasing the level of youth  participation  in  sport
as part of moral regeneration. We therefore reaffirm that sport should  form
an integral  part  of  a  comprehensive,  people-centred  and  people-driven
programme of transformation.

The ANC at its national conference held in December 2002 resolved  that  the
Sports Transformation Charter be developed as  a  tool  for  facilitating  a
total transformation of sport in South Africa. We charged the Department  of
Sport  and  Recreation  to  move  with  speed  in  finalising  this  and  to
facilitate the adoption of the Sports Transformation Charter by the nation.

Uhlelo lokwakhiwa kwezinkundla zemidlalo ezindaweni  ezikhungethwe  yindlala
nobubha lwaqala  ngonyaka  ka-2000.  NgoMashi  kulo  nyaka  ophezulu  kuzobe
sekuphele izinkundla eziyikhulu  namashumi  amane  ezakhiwe  ngalolu  hlelo.
Ngonyaka ka-2003 kuphela kuzokwakhiwa ezinye eziyikhulu.

Kuyajabulisa ukuthi abesifazane  basemakhaya  bahlomula  kakhulu  ngokuthola
imisebenzi kanye nokuqeqeshwa kumakhono okwakha  ngesikhathi  kwakhiwa  lezi
zinkundla. Kodwa kumele siphawule ukuthi ukuphumelela kwalolu  hlelo  angeke
sikukale ngenani lezinkundla ezakhiwe  kuphela.  Kuyomele  siqaphele  ukuthi
lezi zinkundla  ziyasiza  yini  ukunciphisa  izinkinga  ezikhungethe  intsha
yakithi,  okuyizinto  ezifana  nokusetshenziswa   kwezidakamizwa,   ukuphuza
uphuzo  oludakisayo,  ukuhlala  kwentsha  emigwaqeni  nokuzinikela  kwentsha
kwezocansi.
Kubalulekile   ukuthi   lezi   zinkundla    zisetshenziswe    njengezikhungo
zokuqhubela phambili uhlelo lokuvuselela izimilo. Imiphakathi  esivela  kuyo
impofu.  Ngakho-ke  kumele  kubukezwe  uhlelo  lokukhokhiswa   kwemiphakathi
ngokusebenzisa izinkundla zemidlalo. Kanjalo nemiphakathi kumele  ikuvimbele
ukulinyazwa nokuphathwa kabi kwezakhiwo zemidlalo.

Siyakuthakasela  ukubambisana  komNyango  wezemiDlalo  nomNyango  wezeMfundo
ohlelweni  lwezemidlalo  ezikoleni.  Kodwa   kumele   sikubhekisise   ukuthi
izinkundla   zemidlalo   zakhiwe   eduze   nezikole   ukuze   zisetshenziswe
imiphakathi nabafundi ngokulingana.

Kunezikhungo   zokuqeqesha   othisha   ezavalwa   ezinezinkundla   zemidlalo
eziseqophelweni eliphezulu. Lezi zinkundla  zingasetshenziswa  ukuthuthukisa
amakhono  emidlalo.  Ngisho   izinkundla   ezifana   nalezo   ezisemakolishi
ezemfundo    njengeNdumiso    eseMgungundlovu,    iMadadeni    eseNyukhasela
naseGamalakhe   ePort   Shepstone   nezinye   eziningi   kwezinye   izifunda
zaseNingizimu Afrika.

Sinenselelo yokusungula  izikhundla  zokuqeqeshela  ezemidlalo.  Kuzodingeka
ukuthi  kube   nokuxoxisana   phakathi   komNyango   wezeMidlalo   nomNyango
wezeMfundo kanjalo nomNyango  wezeMisebenzi  yoMphakathi  mayelana  nendlela
okungenziwa   ngayo   ukuthi   izinkundla   zemidlalo   ezikulezi   zikhungo
zisetshenziselwe ukuqeqesha imiphakathi eseduze nazo.

UmNyango   wezemiDlalo   uyaqhubeka   nohlelo    lokusungulwa    kwesikhungo
sokuqeqeshelwa  kwezemidlalo  sikazwelonke.  Uhlelo  lokwakhiwa  kwezikhungo
zokuqeqeshelwa  ezemidlalo  luyaqhubeka.  Ngikhuluma  nje   izifunda   zonke
sezinikeziwe  imali  yokusungulwa  kwalezi  zikhungo  zezifundazwe.  Ngalolu
hlelo uHulumeni  uqonde  ukuthuthukisa  ezemidlalo  eqophelweni  eliphezulu.
Ukuphumelela kwalolu  hlelo  siyokubona  ngokunyuka  kwesibalo  sokuqeqeshwa
kwabantu  ebebengenawo  amathuba  kwezemidlalo   ngesikhathi   sobandlululo,
ngokuphumelela kwabo ekuphatheni ezemidlalo nangokunyuka kwezinga  lokudlala
kwabadlali namaqembu aseNingizimu Afrika emidlalweni yomhlaba wonke.

Siyakuthakasela  ukuthuthukiswa  kwemidlalo   ezikoleni.   Sikholwa   ukuthi
imidlalo   ezikoleni    ineqhaza    elibalulekile    ekulwiseni    izinkinga
zokungathuthuki  kwemiphakathi  yethu.  Engqungqutheleni  kazwelonke  ye-ANC
ebingoDisemba ngo-2002, i-ANC ithathe isinqumo  sokuthi  igqugquzele  ukuthi
uhlelo lokuthuthukisa ezemidlalo  nezokufunda  ngezemidlalo  lube  ngaphansi
komNyango wezeMfundo  bese  uhlelo  lokuqhudelana  nobungcweti  kwezemidlalo
lube ngaphansi komNyango wezemiDlalo. Ngakho siphakamisa ukuthi le  minyango
kaHulumeni ilusukumele phezulu lolu daba futhi isebenze ngokubambisana.

Sinxusa ukuthi uhlelo lonke oluhambisana  nokwakhiwa  kwezindlu  luhambisane
nokwakhiwa kwezinkundla zemidlalo ukuze  sigweme  inkinga  yokuthi  izingane
zethu  ziqale  zidlale  umacashelana,  zikhuleliswane,  zidle   izidakamizwa
ngaphambi kokudlala imidlalo  eyakha  izimilo  nobuntu.  Imidlalo  yendabuko
ingeminye imidlalo ebonisa isigqi  sase-Afrika  nobuzwe  bethu.  Lolu  hlelo
kumele luhambisane nohlelo lokuvuselelwa kwe-Afrika,  i-African  Renaissance
neNepad.

Sigqugquzela   imiphakathi   ukuthi   iyisukumele    imidlalo    ngezinjongo
zokuvuselela  ubuzwe  bethu.  Sinxusa   abagqugquzeli   bezemidlalo   ukuthi
bakhangise  ngemidlalo  yendabuko  lapho  kuvulwa  imidlalo  enjenge-Cricket
World Cup ukuze kubonakale futhi kucace ukuthi sise-Afrika.

INhlangano  kaKhongolose  izibophezele  ekuthuthukiseni   nasekugqugquzeleni
imidlalo  yabesifazane  nabantu  bakithi   abakhubazekile.   Ukusetshenziswa
kwamagama    ayizidlaliso    njengaleli    elithi    Amakrokokroko    kumele
angasetshenziswa    ngendlela    yokubandlulula    labo    bantu     bakithi
abakhubazekile. Ukuxhaswa  nokusekelwa  kwemidlalo  yale  mikhakha  kusalele
emuva uma kuqhathaniswa nemidlalo yabesilisa kuleli zwe.

Thina  singuKhongolose  sinxusa  osomabhizinisi  ukuthi   baxhase   umkhakha
wabesifazane kwezemidlalo kanye  nomkhakha  wabantu  bakithi  abakhubazekile
ngendlela efanayo nale okuxhaswa ngayo imidlalo yabesilisa ukuze le  midlalo
ibe sezingeni elilinganayo neminye  imidlalo.  Sinxusa  ohulumeni  basekhaya
ukuthi   bakhombise   uzwelo   kwabesifazane   nezidingo   zabantu   bakithi
abakhubazekile  uma  behlela  ukwakhiwa  kwezinkundla  zemidlalo  ukuze   le
mikhakha izithole iyingxenye ephelele yomphakathi wakithi.

UKhongolose  ukhulume  kabanzi   ngokubaluleka   kokuqeqeshwa   nokuzinikela
kwamajoni okuthuthukiswa komphakathi. Ukuqhubekela kwalo mkhankaso  phambili
kuzomele  imiphakathi  yethu,  amalungu  ephalamende  nabaholi  bezepolitiki
bakhulumisane namaqhawe ethu kwezemidlalo afana noTap-tap Makhathini,  Sugar
Ray Xulu, noPatson Banda nabanye abaningi ngezinjongo  zokusebenzisana  nabo
ukudlulisela  ulwazi  lwabo  olunzulu  kwezemidlalo  nanjengamaqhawe  intsha
yethu engafunda kuwo umlando  wezemidlalo  nobunzima  abadlula  kubo.  Lokhu
kungaba ngeminye yemizamo yomkhankaso wokuvuselelwa  kwezimilo  nokuziphatha
kahle emphakathini.

Sibonga uNgqongqoshe wezemiDlalo, uMnu Ngconde Balfour, ngezimbizo abe  nazo
emiphakathini eyahlukene. Sikholwa  ukuthi  lezi  zimbizo  zisiza  uHulumeni
ukuthi  azizwele  izidingo  zabantu.  Ngingcina  ngokubonga   bonke   abantu
baseMzansi Afrika abasabele ngobuningi  babo  ngesikhathi  uMongameli  wezwe
esimema ukuthi sibe ngamavolontiya. Sibonga kakhulu  labo  abangamavolontiya
kulesi  sikhathi  somdlalo  wekhilikithi  iCricket  World   Cup.   Umsebenzi
owenziwa amavolontiya uyancomeka. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The programme of  building  stadiums  in  starvation  and  poverty-stricken
areas started in the year 2000. In March this year  140  stadiums  that  are
being built in this programme  will  be  completed.  In  2003  only  another
hundred will be built.  It  makes  one  happy  that  women  in  rural  areas
benefited by getting jobs and building skills training when  these  stadiums
were built. But we must comment  on  the  fact  that  the  success  of  this
programme cannot be measured only in terms of the number  of  stadiums  that
have been built. We should be careful to ensure that these stadiums help  in
alleviating problems that affect our youth, things like drug abuse,  alcohol
intake, youth living on the streets, and their subjection to sex.

It is imperative that these stadiums  are  used  as  centres  for  promoting
moral regeneration. We come from poor communities, therefore the  system  of
paying for the usage of stadiums by communities should be reviewed.  At  the
same time, communities must avoid vandalising sports facilities.

We commend  the  co-operation  between  the  Department  of  Sport  and  the
Department of Education in the schools' sports programme. But we  should  be
careful to ensure that stadiums are built near the schools so that they  can
be used by communities and learners  equally.  There  are  teacher  training
centres that were closed down, which  have  stadiums  of  a  high  standard.
These stadiums could be used to develop sports skills. I  am  talking  about
stadiums  like  those  at  colleges  of  education  such   as   Ndumiso   in
Pietermaritzburg, Madadeni in Newcastle and  Gamalakhe  in  Port  Shepstone,
and many others in the regions of South Africa.

We are still faced with the challenge of building sports training  stadiums.
There is going to be a need for  communication  between  the  Department  of
Sport and the Department of Education, and also  the  Department  of  Public
Works, with regard to the way in which the stadiums  in  these  centres  are
used to train communities which are near to them.

The Department of Sport is continuing with the programme of creating  sports
training centres nationally.  The  programme  of  building  sports  training
centres is going ahead. As I speak all  the  regions  have  been  given  the
money  to  create  these  centres  for  provinces.  By  this  programme  the
Government intends to develop sports to a higher level. The success of  this
programme will be measured by the increase  in  the  number  of  people  who
receive  training,  people  who  had  no  opportunities  in   sport   during
apartheid, by succeeding in managing sport and the standard  of  play  shown
by players and South African teams in world sport.

We commend the development of sports in schools. We believe that  sports  at
schools have an important role in combating problems  of  nondevelopment  in
our communities. At the ANC national conference that was  held  in  December
2002, the ANC took a decision to encourage a  sports  development  programme
and sports education under the Department of Education, and a  programme  of
competition and championship in sports under the Department of Sport.

We are appealing that the whole programme that goes  with  the  building  of
houses should go hand in hand with the building of sports stadiums  so  that
we can avoid this problem of our children playing  hide  and  seek,  getting
pregnant and doing drugs before  they  play  games  that  build  morals  and
humanity. Traditional games are some of the games that show  African  rhythm
and our nationality. This programme should go hand in hand with the  African
Renaissance and Nepad.

We encourage communities to take up sports with the purpose of  regenerating
our  nationality.  We  appeal  to  sports  organisers  that   they   promote
traditional games in opening ceremonies at events such as the Cricket  World
Cup so that it is clear that we are in Africa.

The ANC is committed to developing and encouraging women in sport,  and  our
disabled people. The use of nicknames like ``Amakrokokroko'' should  not  be
used in a discriminatory manner against our people  who  are  disabled.  The
sponsoring and supporting of  sports  in  these  categories  is  being  left
behind, compared with men's sports in this country.

We as the ANC would like to appeal to businesses to support  women  and  our
disabled people in sports in the same way as male sports are  supported,  so
that these sports are of the same standard as other sports. We  also  appeal
to local governments to show sympathy towards women and  the  needs  of  our
disabled people when they plan to build sports centres so that these  people
will find themselves being part of our community in totality.

The ANC spoke at length about the importance of training and  dedication  of
soldiers of community development. For this campaign  to  move  forward  our
communities, members of Parliament and political leaders should  communicate
with our sports heroes like  Tap-tap  Makhathini,  Sugar  Ray  Xulu,  Patson
Banda and many more with the purpose of working with them to pass  on  their
sound knowledge in sports and as heroes from whom our youth  can  learn  the
history of sports and the hardships they went through. These could  be  some
of the attempts of the campaign to  regenerate  morals  and  good  behaviour
within the community.
We thank the Minister of Sport  and  Recreation,  Mr  Ngconde  Balfour,  for
meetings he  has  had  in  different  communities.  We  believe  that  these
meetings assist the Government to hear for  itself  the  people's  needs.  I
conclude by thanking all the people of South Africa who responded  in  large
numbers when the President of the country invited us to  be  volunteers.  We
thank those who are volunteers at this time of the Cricket  World  Cup.  The
work that is done by volunteers is commendable.]

Dr A I  VAN  NIEKERK:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  President,  hon  Deputy
President, colleagues, there is a saying that says: We  live  today  in  the
tomorrow of our yesterdays.

It is the nature of mankind to strive for the  better.  In  our  minds,  the
tomorrow that we wish for for  all  will  always  be  flawless,  better  and
ideal. Unfortunately, life does not work that way. The reality  is  what  we
experience  in  practice,  of  all  the  plans,  especially  those  of   the
Government, for the tomorrow that we live in.

That is what we must assess in this debate - whether this tomorrow  that  we
have longed for is good or bad; whether the tomorrow ideals  which  we  have
put in place and experienced in practice are really as bad as  some  say  or
as good as others say. Life is never perfect. Those  conditions  only  exist
in fairy tales.

If we look back and compare the past with the present  in  our  country,  we
will find many differences. In most instances, if not  all,  the  conditions
that prevail today are different from what we have experienced in the  past.
In many instances, they are better, yes, but not necessarily ideal.

Much of the dispute we have today in our debate is not to  make  the  change
or better conditions undone, but to eliminate that which is  not  ideal.  In
this way, we can ensure that the tomorrows that we  and  our  children  will
experience will be better and nearer the ideal that we strive for.

That is why there  are  questions  on  many  aspects  and  policies  of  the
Government of the day - a Government which has  the  duty  to  govern  South
Africa for the benefit of all the people, and not only some.

There is a long range of questions on many subjects in the mind  of  people.
To name a few: the question  of  land  reform,  HIV/Aids,  jobs,  crime  and
Zimbabwe. The one question, however,  which  worries  me  the  most  is  the
threat to our democracy, namely  that  we  will  become  a  one-party  state
without an independent opposition, which cannot be coerced or  co-opted;  an
opposition that can put an alternative on the table for the people  of  this
country. The comments on this matter by the Government of the  day  and  its
lack of tolerance for opposition parties  which  do  not  toe  the  line  is
disturbing.

Opposition parties can and must be independent and have an independent  say.
In having an own opinion and policy, they can still  be  and  are  loyal  to
South Africa  and  uphold  our  Constitution.  There  is  no  need  for  the
opposition  to  be  in  bed  with  the  ruling  party,  while   they   sleep
contentedly, waiting for the  majority  jet  to  find  its  instruction  and
destination, as hon member  Boy  Geldenhuys  from  the  New  NP  so  vividly
described. In  doing  so,  an  opposition  party  loses  sight  of  its  own
destination, eventually toes the line and is  tolerated,  without  any  real
influence, and disappears into oblivion.

Onsekerheid is die grootste opwekker van kritiek en teenstand in  die  lewe.
Daar is groot  onsekerheid  oor  hoe  die  Regering  van  die  dag  verskeie
kwelpunte hanteer. Een daarvan is die bedoeling om  die  kommando's  op  die
platteland tot niet te maak.

'n Ander kwessie is grondhervorming.  Die  gerug  dat  die  Regering  planne
beraam om die onteieningsbeginsel te omseil, is vir my baie kommerwekkend.

Die negatiewe berigte en beskuldigings oor swak hantering van arbeid in  die
boerderysektor en konstante klappe na hierdie sektor  stem  mense  negatief.
Die groot dam van welwillendheid wat ons sedert 1994 ervaar het,  is  vinnig
besig om te verdwyn.

Hoekom slaan die Regering van die dag keer op  keer  die  uitgestrekte  hand
van die landbousektor weg wanneer dit kom  by  sinvolle  grondhervorming  en
hulle  betrokkenheid  daarby?  Op  vele  ander  terreine  waar  kundige   en
praktiese hulp deur die landbou aangebied  word,  word  hulle  doodeenvoudig
geÃ¯gnoreer. Die welwillendheidsdam verdamp daardeur in die niet.

Niemand, mnr die President, wil terug na gister nie. As gister egter  in  'n
ander gedaante vandag terugsluip, ondermyn dit die vertroue  en  vermoÃ«  van
ons mense en ons Grondwet om 'n nuwe Suid-Afrika te skep  en  daar  is  baie
tekens  daarvan.  Die  goedpraat  van  buurlande  se  verkragting  van   die
demokrasie en goedpraat van politieke sirkusse, is ondermynend  en  ondermyn
diÃ© vertroue.

Mnr die President, as die verkeerd van gister al meer vandag te  sien  word,
is die mÃ´re van ons verwagting van 'n beter toekoms net 'n  hersenskim.  Dan
word die beter mÃ´re wat ons soek al meer die vandag van ons lewe,  en  selfs
die gister van ons lewe. Ons soek  dit  nie!  En  daarom  is  ons  hier,  as
onafhanklike opposisie met 'n eie mening en siening om te help  om  dit  wat
reg en beter is vir ons land en al sy mense te vind en 'n bydrae daartoe  te
lewer. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Uncertainty is the biggest instigator of criticism and resistance in  life.
There is great uncertainty on how the Government  of  the  day  is  handling
several problematic issues. One of these is the decision  to  do  away  with
the commando system in the rural areas.

Another issue is land reform. I find  the  rumour  that  the  Government  is
planning  to  circumvent  the  principle   of   land   expropriation   quite
disturbing.

The negative reports and allegations about the poor managing  of  labour  in
the farming sector and the constant  criticism  aimed  at  this  sector  are
making people negative. The  large  reservoir  of  goodwill  which  we  have
experienced since 1994 is slowly disappearing.

Why does the Government of the day again and  again  brush  aside  the  hand
offered to it by the agricultural sector when  it  comes  to  sensible  land
reform and their involvement in it? In several other areas in  which  expert
and practical assistance is offered by the  agricultural  sector,  they  are
ignored completely. The reservoir of goodwill  is  evaporating  into  within
air.

Nobody, Mr President, wants to return to the  past.  However,  if  our  past
tends to creep back in a different guise today, it undermines the trust  and
abilities of our people and our Constitution to create a new  South  Africa,
and there are many signs of this. The attempt to  justify  our  neighbouring
countries' violation of democracy, and  the  attempt  to  justify  political
circuses, is subversive and undermines such trust.

Mr President, if the wrong of the past is seen more  and  more  today,  then
the tomorrow of our expectations of a better future is but a mere  illusion.
Then the better tomorrow which we are all looking for becomes more and  more
the today, and even the yesterday, of our lives. We do not  want  that!  And
that is why we are here, as an independent opposition with an opinion and  a
vision of our own to assist in finding that which is right  and  better  for
our country and all its people and to make a contribution in that regard.  I
thank you.]

Mr L CHIBA: Madam Deputy Speaker, President Thabo  Mbeki,  Deputy  President
Jacob Zuma, comrades and colleagues, in his state of the nation  address  on
Friday, the President stated that our currency wrested back  the  losses  it
had suffered during 2001 and that, during 2002, it had  recorded  its  first
annual gain against the US dollar in 15 years.

The fluctuations in the rate of exchange in  the  past  two  years  and  the
implications thereof constitute the main thrust of my input.
The rapid depreciation of our currency in 2001 and its appreciation in  2002
have been unprecedented in the history of foreign exchange  fluctuations  in
South Africa. Contrary to expectations, the  rand  had  depreciated  against
the dollar by 35% by December 2001. At the time, some  observers  attributed
this to  the  political  situation  in  Zimbabwe  and  issues  of  financial
instability in some emerging market economies. In  addition,  the  September
11 attack on the United States caused a decline in  global  equity  markets,
and  asset  fund  managers  preferred  dollar-  denominated   assets.   This
stimulated a greater demand for the US currency.

The anticipated deficit in the current account in the  balance  of  payments
led to a further increase in the demand for dollars. This  exerted  downward
pressure on the exchange rate. Other  economies,  such  as  Australia,  also
experienced a similar decline in the value of their currency.

This extraordinary depreciation led to allegations of  improper  conduct  in
foreign exchange trading, resulting in the appointment of  a  commission  of
inquiry, which found no evidence that might have contributed  to  the  rapid
depreciation of our currency. The depreciation had the negative  consequence
of rising inflation, particularly with regard to the  price  of  foodstuffs.
There was also a significant increase in the price of fuel  internationally,
leading to several hikes in the local  price  of  liquid  fuel.  To  contain
rising inflationary pressures, the SA Reserve Bank was left with  no  option
but to increase interest rates.

The combination of these developments impacted negatively  on  the  standard
of living of  the  vast  majority  of  our  people.  Food  prices  spiralled
further, transport costs  escalated,  and  there  was  an  increase  in  the
repayments of mortgage and hire purchase agreements. The Government must  be
commended for responding appropriately.

Firstly, the matter of the rising prices of foodstuffs was referred  to  the
Competition Commission which found no manipulation of prices. Secondly,  the
Government made R400 million available for  food  parcels  and  agricultural
starter packs. Thirdly, a tax relief of R15 billion  assisted  in  combating
the  effects  of  inflation.  This  relief  was  biased  towards  low-income
households. For those who argue that tax relief  benefits  only  the  middle
and upper income groups, it must be borne  in  mind  that  in  a  developing
country such as ours, with a  high  unemployment  rate,  workers  distribute
their incomes to an extended family or dependants.

Fourthly, the President announced during his state  of  the  nation  address
that the Government has decided to replace the in bond  landed  cost  system
with a basic fuel price formula. In terms of this  new  arrangement,  it  is
estimated that fuel users would save more than  one  billion  rand  a  year.
This is an important milestone in the history of the oil  industry,  because
South Africa's fuel pricing system was established ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! There is a point of order.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy Speaker, I feel very  ashamed  by
the  extent  of  the  noise.  I  know  that  we  misbehave  in  this  House,
particularly when the President is not here. I think it puts  us  to  shame,
when the President is here, and while we are discussing  the  state  of  the
nation address, that there is so much talk that we drown  out  the  speaker.
We cannot even hear what the speaker is saying. I just wanted to place  that
on record.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon Minister. I do  not  have  to  repeat  or
interpret. Please proceed, hon Chiba.

Mr L CHIBA: Thank you. As I was saying,  the  estimated  amount  fuel  users
will be saving is  approximately  one  billion  rand  a  year.  This  is  an
important milestone in the  history  of  the  oil  industry,  because  South
Africa's fuel pricing system  was  established  in  the  apartheid  era  and
offered marketing oil  companies  rewards  for  the  risks  they  were  then
taking.

The flip side of our depreciated currency was that it made our exports  more
competitive. The value of our exports, excluding  gold,  increased  by  22%.
The weaker rand  boosted  manufacturing  production,  indicating  favourable
news for economic growth.

The depreciated currency also stood the  tourism  industry  in  good  stead.
South Africa is considered to be one of  the  world's  safest  and  cheapest
destinations, and the industry constitutes 5% of gross domestic product.  It
is one of the fastest  growing  industries  in  South  Africa  and  has  the
potential of generating a huge number of jobs. Globally  tourism  was  under
pressure,  but  South  Africa  was  performing  better   than   many   other
destinations. In December 2001, South  Africa  was  granted  the  status  of
approved destination by the People's Republic of China, further injecting  a
spurt into the tourism industry.

There was a dramatic appreciation of the rand in the  first  half  of  2002.
The stronger rand is unlikely to reduce the number of  foreign  visitors  to
South Africa. With the Cricket World Cup our country will once again  be  in
the world's spotlight. Together with the President's Golf  Challenge,  these
events will attract an estimated 25 000  foreign  visitors  to  our  shores,
thereby  boosting  our  reserves  of  much-needed  foreign   currency.   The
attraction of Cape Town, now ranked as one of the  world's  top  10  tourist
destinations, has further boosted demand. It is therefore expected that  the
booming tourism industry will continue.

The stronger rand is primarily attributed to  the  surplus  of  the  current
account in the balance of payments. The inflow of capital into  the  country
as a result of higher interest rates enhances prospects  for  the  continued
growth  of  exports  and  an  increase  in  the   price   of   international
commodities, making the rand the  best  performing  currency  in  the  world
during 2002.
At the time of the rapid depreciation of  our  currency,  various  observers
claimed that the depreciation was an expression of  the  low  confidence  in
the country. If we take such claims  to  the  logical  conclusion,  then  it
follows  that  the  unprecedented  appreciation  of  the  currency   is   an
expression of the highest confidence in the  South  African  Government  and
its management of the economy.

With the  boom  in  manufacturing  and  production,  sales  soared  to  R614
billion. The predicted growth rate of 2,6 % is  expected  to  reach  3%  for
last year. Although the appreciation of our currency will impact  negatively
on our export ability, indications are that the economy is robust enough  to
absorb the effects of an appreciating rand.

With regard to the economic outlook, the high level of  business  confidence
is  encouraging.  The  outlook  for  economic  growth  is  positive.  It  is
therefore likely that the upswing in the South African business  cycle  will
continue for a couple of years.

We have registered many gains and successes. The  challenge  that  confronts
us is to ensure that these gains are not eroded.  We  are  in  an  important
stage in the growth of our economy. However, one factor which is beyond  our
control, and which may impede our economic advancement, is  the  US-led  war
against Iraq. The war would mark the beginning  of  global  uncertainty  and
insecurity. It may harm our prospects of  economic  growth,  of  investments
and of our  exports,  which  constitute  one-third  of  our  gross  domestic
product.

In the light of this,  I  fail  to  understand  how  some  of  our  economic
commentators can state the following: That the effect of the  war  could  be
neutral for South  Africa,  because  our  healthy  fiscal  situation  should
cushion the economy; that,  since  South  Africa  has  gold  as  a  built-in
stabiliser, if oil prices rise, so will gold, rendering the  effect  on  the
balance of payments relatively neutral; and that the healthy state of  South
Africa's fiscal situation can cushion the economy  for  a  couple  of  years
without the fear  of  macroeconomic  instability  or  fiscal  and  financial
difficulty.

But when any country is at war, its resources are  geared  towards  the  war
effort, and its economy is under  duress.  Consequently,  for  war-mongering
countries such as the United  States,  the  needs  of  developing  countries
assume a very low priority. In the event of a war,  the  issue  of  economic
development in our region will  receive  very  scant  attention.  Hence  the
prospects of realising our stated objective of pushing  back  the  frontiers
of poverty could  be  rendered  all  the  more  difficult.  From  this  past
weekend's anti-war demonstrations, the message is abundantly  clear:  People
the world over want peace and not pieces.

In conclusion, the vast majority of the peace-loving people of South  Africa
and the world commend our President and  our  Government  for  the  sterling
efforts they made and the bold initiatives they  took  to  ensure  that  the
crisis is resolved peacefully. To what extent these efforts and  initiatives
bear the desired fruit, remains to be seen. Only time  will  tell.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[The nation has rejoiced to hear the President thanking all  the  multitudes
who rolled up their sleeves to help improve and build a better life for  all
South Africans. This also includes  other  members  of  Parliament  who  are
striving hard to make sure that people are able to register  the  births  of
their children for them to receive the child grant until they are  14  years
old. There should also be help at police  stations,  schools  and  hospitals
for services to reach our people and for our programme, Batho  Pele,  to  be
maintained.

We know very well, comrade President, that you are speaking about  something
you have seen with  your  own  eyes  as  you  have  been  to  our  different
provinces, listening to people's demands in a form of Imbizo. We  thank  you
for your support, Mr President.

Madam Deputy Speaker, we felt  honoured  when  our  Government  announced  a
campaign to build multipurpose community centres where women and  the  youth
are going to learn the handiworks to improve their lives and those of  their
families. Even our grandfathers and grandmothers will have  a  better  place
to receive their pension with dignity and respect.  They  will  get  support
from those who will be helping them so that they will not have to  stand  in
long queues in the rain or in the hot sun, as is happening now.

We welcome all that the President has introduced to us and we  promise  that
we will use these things with care and diligence.]

The President has spoken of the need to introduce and  train  public  sector
workers who can act as community-based  development  workers.  The  idea  is
that these public sector workers would combine many skills. They  would  not
be narrowly specialised and would also not be  bound  to  desks  but  should
work amongst communities and be able to help  communities  access  different
resources from  different  departments,  like  social  grants  for  projects
connecting up with integrated development plans or  with  training.  Looking
at these proposals from the perspective of my constituency, I  can  see  how
important these public  sector  cadres  can  become.  There  are  many  good
government programmes but it can be very difficult for  remote  rural  areas
to access Government.
In our communities we have good ideas ourselves. We have  co-operatives  and
micro-businesses. We know how to farm but how we get  our  products  to  the
markets is another question. We have skills but we  need  start-up  funding.
How we get  that  is  yet  another  question.  If  we  go  to  a  government
department or a parastatal, we are told to produce a business plan.  We  are
farmers and we do not know how to produce a business plan. That  is  why  we
need public sector  workers  who  understand  these  things,  public  sector
workers who think development and  community  empowerment,  not  just  about
what the regulations say.

We warmly welcome these proposals, and we hope that a quick  start  will  be
made with training and developing these development workers.

The state of the nation address also promised that we will see  the  passing
of the communal land rights Bill this year. Many people in  my  constituency
have been waiting with great expectation  for  many  years.  The  status  of
communal  land  has  been  uncertain  and  households  are  insecure   about
investing in housing  or  development  because  they  might  be  arbitrarily
pushed off the land when its value has been improved.

For  many  poor  households  living  on  communal  lands,  there  is   great
difficulty in accessing mortgages or other loans  for  development.  In  the
absence of clear tenure rights, banks are even more reluctant than usual  to
lend. The new Bill will mark a large step forward for hundreds of  thousands
of poor households in rural South Africa. Some traditional leaders,  though,
are suspicious of this legislation. They fear losing  their  own  powers.  I
want to appeal to  traditional  leaders  to  see  the  bigger  picture.  The
legislation is not about destroying the powers of traditional  leaders,  nor
is  it  about  ending  communal  land   tenure.   It   is   about   bringing
transformation, investment and development to our rural areas.

Le se ke la tÅ¡haba magoÅ¡i a rena, bogoÅ¡i bo a tswalelwa a go na motho yoo  a
tlilego go le  amoga  bjona.  [Our  Chiefs  need  not  feel  threatened  for
chieftainship is hereditary and no one will take that away from them.]

Those traditional leaders who seek to resist development will be  condemning
their communities and themselves. Development  will  simply  pass  them  by.
Added to all of the above-mentioned is  another  important  announcement  in
the state of the nation address. This is the commitment to ensuring  a  much
more focused approach to microlending, microenterprises  and  co-operatives.
Many important projects in the rural communities which have  good  prospects
of being successful and sustainable suffer from a lack  of  success  because
of funding in order to manage the period between harvests  or  in  order  to
get a successful harvest to the market. Things are changing in our  country,
even in the remote rural areas. This year, and in the coming year,  we  need
to implement existing policies with greater energy and seriousness.

In the coming year, we also look forward to  the  introduction  of  the  new
measures, not least community development workers, the communal land  rights
legislation and more effective microlending programmes.  We  hope  that  the
ones on the left  understand  that  forward  we  go,  backward  never.  This
Government is doing a good job that they also benefit  from,  regardless  of
what excuses they make. [Applause.]

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Mev die Adjunkspeaker,  dit  is  baie  duidelik  dat  die
eerste skote geklap het vir die verkiesing wat volgende  jaar  sal  kom,  en
dit is net 'n jammerte dat mense hier aangeval  word  wat  nie  hier  is  om
hulself te verdedig nie. Die agb dr Mulder is nie nou  hier  nie,  maar  ons
sal by 'n latere geleentheid met hom afreken.

Wat interessant is, is dat die agb lid Taljaard  ontpop  het  in  'n  uiters
knap speurder. Sy probeer al wat 'n korrupsiesaak is oopvlek, maar  skynbaar
het sy baie moeite om vas te stel presies wie Hans is.  [Gelag.]  As  sy  'n
bietjie moeite wil doen en vir ons kan sÃª wie Hans is, dan sal ons ook  weet
waar hulle hulle geld gekry het. Ten minste het die Nuwe NP die  moed  gehad
om die geld terug te gee.

Die agb lid dr Kraai van Niekerk verstom my vir 'n man van  sy  ouderdom  en
sy wysheid. Hy kom hier en wil maak asof die Nuwe NP saam in die bed is  ...
luister mooi ... in die bed is saam met die ANC. Daar is 'n  verskil  tussen
saamwerk en saamstaan.

Maar wat nog interessanter is, agb Leon, wat sÃª u vir Dr Buthelezi as u  met
hom wil saamwerk? Hy is dan ook in die Kabinet van die  President.  Dis  ses
van die een en 'n halfdosyn van die ander. En agb Dr Buthelezi, ek  wil  vir
u waarsku. Hierdie agb vriend van my kan nie onder ander leiers  staan  nie.
Hy alleen sal die leier wees. [Applous.] Gaan doen 'n bietjie  selfondersoek
en u sal voortaan sien hoe ons met hulle gaan afreken. Die  kiesers  sal  in
April 2004 besluit wat  met  wispelturige  mannetjies  soos  hierdie  gemaak
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Madam Deputy Speaker, it is very  clear  that  the  first
shots have rung out for the election which will come  next  year.  It  is  a
pity that people who are not here to defend themselves  are  attacked  here.
The hon Dr Mulder is not here at the moment, but we shall deal with  him  at
a later stage.

What is interesting, is that the hon member Taljaard  has  revealed  herself
to be an exceptionally able sleuth. She attempts to expose  each  and  every
corruption case, but she apparently has much trouble in determining  exactly
who Hans is. [Laughter.] If she takes a little trouble and is able  to  tell
us who Hans is, then we will also know where they got their money. At  least
the New NP had the courage to return the money.

The hon member Dr Kraai van Niekerk astonishes me for a man of his  age  and
his wisdom. He comes here and wants to pretend that the New  NP  is  in  bed
with ... listen to this ... the ANC. There is a difference  between  working
together and standing together.

But even more interestingly, hon Leon, what do you tell  Dr  Buthelezi  when
you want to work with him? He is also in the Cabinet of  the  President.  It
is six of the one and half a dozen of the other. And the hon  Dr  Buthelezi,
I want to warn you: This  hon  friend  of  mine  cannot  serve  under  other
leaders. He alone will be the leader. [Applause.] Go and do a  little  self-
examination, and you will see how we will deal  with  them  in  future.  The
electorate will decide in April 2004 what must be done  with  fickle  little
men like these.]

Dr M G BUTHELEZI: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I just wanted  to  say
that the hon member must know that my reasons for being in the Cabinet  with
the  President  are  completely  different  from   the   reasons   why   ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, order!

Mr C B HERANDIEN: We will debate that issue later on, but nonetheless ...
Madam Speaker, allow me first to congratulate the hon  Minister  of  Housing
on her appointment as Deputy Secretary-General of the ANC and wish her  well
in the future  role  she  is  going  to  play  in  South  African  politics.
[Applause.] Although we sometimes  differed  greatly,  we  have  learned  to
understand each other and I wish her well.

A lot has been  said  about  poverty.  However,  Mr  President,  it  is  not
acceptable that money that is earmarked for projects  is  not  being  spent.
And, in this regard, I would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon  Minister  of
Education for the commitment he gave this House  today  that  he  will  take
personal, political responsibility for his budget in future.

Dit help ons min dat ons 'n Minister van Finansies het  wat  wÃªreldwyd  hoog
aangeskrewe staan, maar ons gebruik nie die  geld  wat  die  staat  vir  ons
beskikbaar stel nie. Daar behoort beter koÃ¶rdinering  tussen  provinsies  en
die sentrale Kabinet te wees. Ons kan nie  die  luukse  bekostig  om  fondse
jaar na jaar oor te rol nie.

Provinsies behoort ook onderling beter saam te werk. In diÃ© verband  wil  ek
die voorbeeld noem van die samewerkingsooreenkoms, en dit is nie in die  bed
wees nie, wat daar ten opsigte van landbou tussen die Wes-, Oos-  en  Noord-
Kaap gesluit is. Ek reken op alle  gebiede  behoort  hierdie  voorbeeld  ook
gevolg te word.

Ek wil net in die verbygaan noem dat die Wes-Kaapse regering alreeds  beskik
oor  'n  akademie  wat  gevestig  is  by   Kromme   Rhee,   waar   amptenare
indiensopleiding kry, en ons is heeltemal bereid om dit te deel met die  res
van die land.

Mnr die President, 'n bron van groot kommer vir almal van ons is die  snelle
ontvolking  van  die  platteland.  Dit  plaas  onnodig  groot  druk  op  die
nabygeleÃ« groot dorpe en stede en dit het aanleiding  gegee  tot  onordelike
verstedeliking. Saam sal ons maniere  moet  probeer  vind  hoe  ons  hierdie
probleem kan aanpak  sodat  die  ontwikkeling  op  die  platteland  ook  kan
plaasvind.

Onnodig groot druk word ook op ons polisiemag geplaas deur stropers wat  ons
marine kusbronne wil vernietig.  Baie  geluk  aan  die  polisie  wat  moeite
gedoen het, en steeds suksesvol is, om ons bronne te  beskerm.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It helps us little to have a Minister  of  Finance  who  is  held  in  high
regard worldwide, but we  do  not  use  the  money  which  the  state  makes
available to us. There should be better co-ordination between provinces  and
the central Cabinet. We cannot afford the luxury of rolling over funds  year
after year.

There should also be better mutual co-operation between provinces.  In  this
regard I want to mention the example  of  the  co-operation  agreement,  and
this is not being  in  bed  with  one  another,  which  has  been  concluded
regarding agriculture between the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape.  I  am
of the opinion that this example should be followed in all fields.

In passing, I just want to mention that the Western Cape government  already
has an academy which has been established at Kromme  Rhee,  where  officials
can undergo in-service training, and we are quite willing to share  it  with
the rest of the country.

Mr President, a source of great concern to us all is the rapid  depopulation
of the rural areas.  It  puts  unnecessary  pressure  on  nearby  towns  and
cities, and it has given rise to disorderly urbanisation. Together  we  will
have to find ways in which we can tackle this problem, so  that  development
can also take place in the rural areas.

An unnecessarily great amount of  pressure  is  also  being  placed  on  our
police force by poachers who want to destroy our coastal  marine  resources.
Congratulations to the police, who have taken trouble,  and  who  are  still
successful in protecting our resources.]

Minority groups have two fundamental choices. The one  choice  is  to  fight
back, oppose everything, put fear into communities and be pessimistic  about
everything. On the other hand, we can offer hope to co-build the  future  of
our country. It is more meaningful to be successful together.  This  is  our
country and every one of us belongs here, so let's  make  it  work.  We  can
only succeed if we build the country  together  for  our  children.  Let  us
rather forget the evils of the past and move  together  towards  building  a
better nation.

Baie mense gebruik Zimbabwe as voorbeeld om  vrees  by  gemeenskappe  in  te
boesem. Gelukkig het ons in hierdie land genoeg verantwoordelike  leiers  om
te verhoed dat dit wat daar plaasvind ook met ons  gaan  gebeur.  Ons  erken
ons het geleer uit ons foute van die verlede, daarom  kan  ons  nie  toelaat
dat ons vasgevang bly in ons geskiedenis nie. Die Nuwe  NP  se  boodskap  is
klokhelder en duidelik: Maak 'n betekenisvolle bydrae  tot  die  vooruitgang
van ons land, of vergaan saam met diegene wat verkies om hul te  isoleer  in
hul woede en frustrasie. Ek dank u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Many people use Zimbabwe as an example  to  inspire  fear  in  communities.
Luckily we have enough responsible leaders in this country to  prevent  what
is happening there from happening to us as  well.  We  admit  that  we  have
learnt from our mistakes of the past,  and  that  is  why  we  cannot  allow
ourselves to stay caught up in our history. The New  NP's  message  is  loud
and clear: Make a meaningful contribution to the progress  of  our  country,
or perish with those who prefer to isolate themselves  in  their  anger  and
frustration. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr D A HANEKOM: Deputy Speaker, President Mbeki, Deputy President  Zuma  and
hon members. Mr President, you started your state of the nation  address  on
Friday by reflecting on the dramatic  events  of  10  years  ago.  You  were
paying tribute to the truly great people who helped bring  us  to  where  we
are today. While you were talking, I had an overwhelming sense  of  what  an
immense privilege it is to be able to serve our country the way we  are  and
to be sitting in this Chamber.

How many of us would ever have imagined, 10 years  ago,  that  we  would  be
sitting here today? We remember the conversations we had just  a  few  years
earlier in our prison cells, in exile, or late at night  in  safe  houses  -
our  yearning  to  return  home,  our  yearning   for   freedom,   nostalgic
reminiscence of our beautiful country. We often spoke about  what  we  would
do one day when our country was finally liberated. We  spoke  about  wanting
to be teachers or lecturers one day, or nurses or  doctors,  or  lawyers  or
journalists. Some wanted to serve in the new defence  force  or  the  police
force and some, like myself, even wanted to go back to farming one day.  But
I do not recall a single person saying that what they really wanted  was  to
be a member of Parliament one day. Yet here we are, 10 years later,  and  it
presents us with a unique opportunity to take  the  struggle  for  a  better
life for all a few steps further every day of our lives.

We fought to end racist minority rule and we won that fight, but  we  cannot
rest until we have won the fight to end the poverty that  remains  with  us.
We should not deceive ourselves and the public by pretending that there  are
simple  solutions.  There  is  no  such  thing.  While  ideas  such  as  the
introduction of a basic  income  grant  deserve  careful  consideration  and
should not simply be dismissed, to suggest that all the country  is  waiting
for is for the President to announce a few simple  measures,  such  as  this
grant, is oversimplifying a complex challenge and is in fact misleading.  On
its own, it could not possibly eradicate poverty in our country.

What is clearly needed is a set of measures that are developmental in  their
nature, and which address real and immediate needs  that  are  complementary
and sustainable in their conceptualisation and in practice.

Your speech,  Mr  President,  was  not  a  populous  pronouncement,  however
tempting it may be to do so in the run-up to  an  election.  The  goals  and
ideals that we have fought for were not about winning  elections.  They  are
about creating a better life for all our people and in  particular  for  the
poor. Your address gives us a framework that can help us  achieve  our  aims
of pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

I would like to pick up on a few points that could result  in  job  creation
on a significant scale and could go a long way towards reducing poverty,  if
properly implemented. The first point is your announcement on the  expansion
of services to our people and, in particular, the progressive  extension  of
the child support grant to cover children up to the age of  14.  Of  course,
this is not the long-term answer to all the challenges  facing  us,  but  it
will bring welcome relief to many and will help  support  those  who  simply
cannot find work or whom we will not be able  to  reach  in  the  short-term
with the best will in the world through increased  investment  in  our  job-
creating efforts.

When you say that the Government must act  to  ensure  that  we  reduce  the
number of people dependent on social  welfare,  surely  all  people  serious
about finding solutions must agree with you? The reduction of dependency  on
grants means the creation of jobs. This will require monumental effort  from
all levels of government, from business and from labour with  well  thought-
out interventions. Economic growth on its own will not be enough.
The Growth and Development Summit offers an important  opportunity  for  the
emergence of creative ideas  and  a  commitment  from  all  stakeholders  to
collective action. The summit comes at a critical time in our  country  -  a
time when we have opportunities such as we have never had before. Our macro-
economic policies are bearing fruit; the rand is performing extremely  well.
Inflation is coming down; growth forecasts are good; revenue  collection  is
steadily improving; our deficit has been reduced and  our  foreign  reserves
are healthy. But the poor remain poor and were hard hit by last year's  food
price increases. Unemployment remains at an  unacceptably  high  level.  The
opportunities that a relatively strong economy offers  us  cannot  be  lost.
The summit cannot just be a consensus-seeking exercise.  The  challenges  of
poverty eradication and job creation will have to be tackled head-on.

You have presented us, Mr President, with a comprehensive  set  of  measures
to start dealing with these challenges.  But  implementation  strategies  no
doubt still need further attention. New, creative ideas need to be  explored
and, above all,  the  summit  must  emerge  with  a  genuine  commitment  to
effective collective action to address these challenges.

One important part of a comprehensive set of interventions will have  to  be
the expanded public  works  programme  that  you  referred  to.  We  need  a
massively expanded public works programme, but one that  goes  much  further
than simply a number  of  projects,  run  by  some  government  departments.
Principles of labour intensity need to be embraced and applied  to  all  our
road-building,  our  construction  of  airports   and   harbours   and   the
maintenance of public facilities.

An initiative of the MEC for Health in the  Gauteng  Province  offers  us  a
good example. The curtains in public hospitals for which she is  responsible
were old and needed to be replaced. She  used  this  opportunity  to  create
jobs by awarding the contract to unemployed women  who  were  assisted  with
sewing machines and given the necessary training.  They  are  now  examining
how the training they have received and the  skills  acquired  can  lead  to
permanent employment.

The Working for Water Project, well-known to Prof Asmal over here,  employed
42 000 people at its peak and did immensely valuable work in removing  alien
species, especially from our water  attachment.  The  programme  has  barely
scratched the surface in removing alien vegetation, but  it  has  not  grown
over the last few years. And yet it provides benefits to the poor, over  and
above employment, by restoring the productive capacity of  land,  increasing
water availability and even making communities safer against the  threat  of
runaway fires.

Every municipality has its standard waste management function and refuse  is
collected and disposed of. Meanwhile, there are areas that  they  simply  do
not seem to be able to clean-up with their regular municipal staff. We  have
all seen areas in our townships and informal  settlements  that  have  years
worth of litter lying there, posing a health hazard and  undignified  living
conditions. Some municipalities have introduced clean-up  projects  for  the
unemployed, but  not  all.  These  activities  have  positive  spin-offs.  A
cleaner country becomes more attractive to tourists  and  increased  tourism
creates jobs.

The local shopping centre close to where I live is always spotlessly  clean,
but outside there are not enough rubbish bins, drains  are  clogged-up  with
plastic bags and tins and there is always a lot of  litter.  Why  can't  the
Pick and Pays and Shoprites and Spars have national programmes to  clean  up
the areas around their shopping centres? [Applause.] We  need  to  think  of
creative ideas to  encourage  all  businesses  countrywide  to  employ  more
people.  We  could  possibly  have  a  national  programme  of  support   to
businesses who employ people from  registered  lists  to  do  work  that  is
additional to their normal operational  requirements,  with  the  Government
and the firm each paying 50% of the salary, with the firm taking  management
responsibility,   thus   overcoming   possible   capacity   limitations   of
Government. We could have  a  massive  country  clean-up  or  alien  species
removal happening on a much  greater  scale,  with  private  nature  reserve
involvement, for example. Groups of  farmers  may  club  together,  Minister
Didiza, and fix up the access roads that they use, because  it  will  be  in
their interests to do so.

Deputy Speaker, these are not ideas that come from the  national  conference
of the ANC. I would be the first to admit that they need much  more  thought
and there are no doubt many far better proposals. I am airing  a  few  ideas
to make a point, and the point is that  we  need  people  to  come  up  with
ideas. We need creative thinking.

The state of the nation address presents us with a carefully considered  and
comprehensive framework, but it allows for an infinite number of  ideas  and
initiatives. Determination and commitment to make this  country  of  ours  a
better place for everyone is  what  is  needed.  An  expanded  public  works
programme with all the potential it has to create jobs will not  be  enough.
The economy will have to continue to grow - that much  we  all  know.  Every
economist in the country can see that we have done extraordinarily  well  on
this front, but we also know that even this is not enough.

We need to pay special attention to certain  sectors  of  our  economy  that
have great livelihood-enhancing and employment-creating potential,  but  are
struggling with a range of disadvantages and constraints. In  particular,  I
am referring to small businesses - the man who cuts your hair on the  street
corner. Not Trevor Manuel's hair, but possibly  the  President's  hair.  The
woman selling fresh produce ... [Interjections.] Not yours either, Douglas.
The woman selling fresh produce on the pavement, the backstreet  panelbeater
and the builder who is skilled, but cannot obtain finance to buy  himself  a
bakkie or a ladder. Stimulating this sector of the economy  will  result  in
reduced dependency on grants, will make our economy more  competitive,  will
benefit consumers, will enhance household livelihoods  and  will  result  in
jobs that are not Government provided. The  potential  benefits  to  society
are huge.

The real question is: What do you do to support this  sector  and  where  do
you begin? Again, there are no easy answers, but there  are  at  least  some
things that can be done that will make a difference. Offer skills  training.
Do not wait for people to come to you. Go to them. Assess  their  needs  and
inform  them  about  the  training  opportunities.  Set  aside  areas  where
informal  training  and  other   business   activity   can   flourish   with
infrastructure  and  facilities  including  sanitation   facilities.   Local
governments  will  have  to  lead  this  process,   provide   deposit-taking
facilities  and  banking  facilities  to   encourage   saving   and   reduce
vulnerability to theft of hard-earned cash and, above all,  find  innovative
ways of ensuring that small businesses have access to finance on  reasonable
terms.

Mr President, you referred to the establishment of an Apex Fund  to  provide
micro-credit  to  people  at  grassroots  level.  This  is  another  welcome
announcement. As we all know, though, the devil lies in the detail  and  the
fund will only assume real value once it translates  into  access  to  loans
for  poor  people  and  small  businesses,  even  without  collateral.   The
discussions with institutions active  in  this  field  should  happen  as  a
matter of great urgency. The extent to which access to  finance  can  assist
in stimulating economic activity should not be underestimated. It  would  be
useful  to  include  NGOs  who  have  experience  in  this  field  in  these
discussions.

If you have time, Mr President, you might even consult with your  wife,  who
feels passionately about microcredit and has great insights  and  experience
through her work in this field.

There is so much to be said, so much to be done, so little  time.  And  even
my time is running out. I am confident, Mr President, that  all  of  us  are
approaching this year ahead with a great deal of positiveness, with a  great
deal of enthusiasm. We are going to roll up our sleeves this year in  united
action to  roll  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

                       CASE AGAINST MR T S YENGENI, MP

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members that ends the speakers' list for today  but,
before adjourning the House, I have two announcements to make.

Members will be aware that  the  court  proceedings  in  the  criminal  case
against Mr Yengeni have been concluded. Since the court has accepted a  plea
of guilt to a charge of fraud, sentencing has not yet taken  place.  I  have
written to the Ethics Committee requesting them to  resume,  without  delay,
their consideration of the complaint  against  Mr  Yengeni  which  they  had
suspended with the approval of the House, pending the outcome of  the  court
case. I have submitted Mr Yengeni's plea of guilt to them.

Further, members will recall that Mr Yengeni made a  personal  statement  to
the House on this matter. This falls  outside  the  mandate  of  the  Ethics
Committee. A copy of that statement is being provided to  all  parties.  The
House needs to consider how it wishes to  deal  with  the  content  of  that
statement. I shall discuss with parties an appropriate process for that.

The other announcement, hon members, is perhaps more familiar. It is that  I
wish to remind hon members that the debate will  resume  at  09:30  tomorrow
morning, and we are expected to  adjourn  for  lunch  at  about  12:30.  The
President will reply to the debate at 15:00 tomorrow.

The House adjourned at 18:30.

                ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS

                          FRIDAY, 15 NOVEMBER 2002

TABLINGS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

Papers:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (a)    General Report of the Auditor-General on the Audit Outcomes  for
         2001-2002 [RP 226-2002].


     (b)    Report of the Auditor-General on the  Special  Investigation  of
         the Coega Project [RP 169-2002].
2.    The Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs:


     (a)    Report  and  the  Financial  Statements  of  the  South  African
         Veterinary Council for 2001-2002.


     (b)    Report and Financial Statements of the Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd for
         2001-2002.

3.    The Speaker:


     1.      Written  comments  received  from  the  public  and  provincial
         legislatures on the Constitution of the Republic  of  South  Africa
         Fourth Amendment Bill [B 69 - 2002], submitted by the Minister  for
         Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  in  terms   of   section
         74(6)(a) of the Constitution, 1996.
         Referred to the Portfolio Committee on Justice  and  Constitutional
         Development.


     2.     Letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, tabled in terms  of
         section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management  Act,  1999  (Act
         No 1 of 1999), explaining the reasons for the late tabling  of  the
         annual report:
         In  accordance  with  the  stipulations  of  the   Public   Finance
         Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999 as amended by Act No  29  of
         1999), the Department of Foreign Affairs should have submitted  and
         tabled its 2001/02 Annual Report in Parliament not  later  than  30
         September 2002.


         Due to the Department's high-level involvement in  the  proceedings
         of the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  (WSSD)  and  the
         unforeseen technical delays in the production and printing  of  the
         Report exacerbated by requirements from the Office of the  Auditor-
         General, the Department could not discharge its  mandate  timeously
         in this regard.


         The net effect  was  that  the  Department  could  only  manage  to
         officially table its Report in Parliament on 11  October,  11  days
         after the deadline.


         The Department wishes to express  its  sincere  apologies  for  any
         inconvenience this might have caused.


         With kind regards
         NKOSAZANA DLAMINI ZUMA
         MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS


     3.     Letter from the Minister of Finance, tabled in terms of  section
         65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act  No  1  of
         1999), explaining the  reasons  for  the  late  tabling  of  annual
         reports:


         Section 65 of the Public Finance  Management  Act  (PFMA)  provides
         timelines  for  the  submission  of  departmental  Annual  Reports.
         Section 65(1) calls for the Annual  Report  to  be  tabled  in  the
         National Assembly "within one month after  the  accounting  officer
         for the department...received  the  audit  report".  Section  65(2)
         states  that  "If  an  executive  authority  fails  to  table,   in
         accordance with subsection (1)(a), the Annual Report and  Financial
         Statements of the Department..., and  the  Audit  Report  on  those
         statements, in the relevant legislature  within  six  months  after
         the end of the financial year...the executive authority must  table
         a written explanation in the legislature setting  out  the  reasons
         why they were not tabled".


         In according with section 65(2), I wish to inform  Parliament  that
         the Annual Reports of Statistics South Africa and the PIC were  not
         tabled within the timeframes set in section 65.


         In respect of Stats SA, the delay in presenting the  Annual  Report
         to Parliament is a result of the late finalisation  of  Stats  SA's
         financial statements (including  the  management  report)  and  the
         audit report  thereon.  Discussions  with  the  Auditor-General  to
         solve  outstanding  issues  are  ongoing.  The   annual   financial
         statements of the PIC were completed and finalised  in  July  2002.
         The Auditor-General's representatives, KPMG, however, required  the
         PIC to attach an annexure of "Assets managed  on  behalf  of  Third
         Parties" to the financial statements. The PIC  was  also  requested
         to prepare  this  annexure  in  accordance  with  General  Accepted
         Accounting  Practice  (GAAP).  The  finalisation  of  the  annexure
         involved  numerous  technical  interactions  between  the  Auditor-
         General, KPMG and the PIC.  Problems  were  also  experienced  with
         regard to the finalisation of performance  figures  in  respect  of
         assets managed on behalf of third parties, more  particularly  with
         regard to the categorisation  and  income  recognition  of  special
         investment products.


         As soon as finalisation in the above regard has been  reached,  the
         Annual Reports will be presented to Parliament.


         Please accept my apologies for the delay.


         Yours sincerely


         TREVOR A MANUEL, MP

     Letter from the Minister of Public  Enterprises,  tabled  in  terms  of
     section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act  No  1
     of 1999), explaining the reasons for the late  tabling  of  the  annual
     report for Aventura:


         However, due to the medical and pension fund deficits which  needed
         to be addressed by the Actuaries and  the  consequential  delay  in
         acquiring a letter of Comfort to enable the Auditors  to  issue  an
         unqualified report, the finalisation of the Annual Report has  been
         delayed. These matters have now been resolved.


         The Annual Report for Aventura will be  available  for  tabling  in
         Parliament not later than 31 December 2002.

     Dear Madam


     Traditionally, the Council on Higher  Education  (CHE)  released  their
     Annual  Report  during  their  Consultative  Conference  scheduled  for
     November of each year. They planned to do the same  this  year  without
     realising that they are contravening the reporting requirements of  the
     PFMA. They apologised for this oversight and  committed  themselves  to
     rectify this shortcoming. The CHE  Annual  Report  will  be  tabled  in
     Parliament by 29 November 2002.


     I can confirm that all the requirements  were  met  concerning  timeous
     submission of the financial statements to the Auditor-General  and  the
     auditing of the  financial  records  and  statements  by  the  Auditor-
     General.


     I trust that my sincere apology will be accepted.


     With my best wishes
     Professor Kader Asmal (MP)

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.     Report  of  the   Portfolio   Committee   on   Public   Service   and
     Administration on provincial visits, dated 6 November 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Public Service  and  Administration,  having
     undertaken provincial visits in April 2002, reports as follows:


     A.     Background


         The Committee undertook visits to selected provinces, and  to  some
         national departments, during the week of 21 to 27 April  2002.  The
         provinces visited were Gauteng, the Western Cape  and  North  West.
         The  visits  were  part  of  the  oversight   function   that   any
         parliamentary committee has to exercise to ensure  that  government
         policies are implemented  timeously  and  correctly,  that  service
         delivery is taking place, and that problem  areas  are  identified,
         isolated and mechanisms devised to address them.


         During the visits, the  Committee  sought  to  be  briefed  by  the
         Offices  of  the  respective  provincial   Premiers,   Members   of
         Executive  Councils  (MECs)  and  Heads  of  Department  (HODs)  of
         selected departments, varying from province to  province,  as  well
         as to have on-site views and briefings by targeted institutions  on
         performance highlights selected at the Committee's discretion.


         Three focused areas were identified for briefings by the  Premiers'
         Offices:


         *  Provincial public service management plans


         *  Provincial organisational structures


         *  Service delivery highlights.


         The targeted departments were requested to brief the  Committee  on
         their performance highlights for the 2001-02 financial  year,  with
         the exception of the national  Department  of  Public  Service  and
         Administration, the Public Service Commission, SAMDI and the  State
         Information Technology Agency (SITA). Their focus was requested  to
         be on their 2002-03 budget and programme of action.


         The sites for  visits  were  selected  to  provide  a  synopsis  of
         departmental  programmes  in  operation,  thus  allowing  Committee
         members to get a  feel  of  policies  in  action  and  institutions
         including systems through which plans are communicated (i.e.  their
         offices). Findings from these sites are  also  well  documented  in
         this Report.


     B.     Observations


         1. Gauteng Province


              (a) The co-ordination forum established  and  located  at  the
                  Premier's Office comprises the Premier,  executive  mayors
                  of metropolitan councils and senior government officials.


              (b) The shared services centre as an establishment brings a co-
                  ordinated service delivery mechanism to the people.


              (c) The provincial Department of Housing set aside  an  amount
                  of R40 million for housing projects to be  constructed  by
                  women contractors, as  part  of  their  women  empowerment
                  policy.


              (d) The continued invasion of unoccupied land affects  housing
                  delivery negatively.


              (e) The Department of Public Transport, Roads and Public Works
                  reportedly achieved 59% of black economic  empowerment  in
                  terms of contracts awarded.


              (f) Their is weak interaction between Chris  Hani  Baragwanath
                  Hospital and local clinics.
              (g) A greater part of  the  Chris  Hani  Baragwanath  Hospital
                  looks dilapidated.


              (h) The nurse training programme at  Chris  Hani  Baragwanatha
                  Hospital is no longer accommodating as  many  trainees  as
                  in the past.


              (i) There  seems  to  be  mixed  feelings  from  residents  of
                  Alexandra on the impact of  the  Alexandra  Urban  Renewal
                  Programme.


         2. North West Province


              (a) Affordable access roads to 19  villages,  victims  of  the
                  2000 flood disaster, are currently under construction.


              (b) There is a lack of equitable gender representation in  the
                  management structure of the Department of Health - 80%  of
                  the workforce  are  female,  yet  90%  of  the  management
                  component are male.


              (c) The Department of Minerals and Energy  reported  that  the
                  Anglo-American group in the North West  has  a  clause  in
                  their policies promoting black economic empowerment.


              (d) About 400Â 000 people in rural  settlements  still  do  not
                  have access to potable water.


              (e) People living in remote rural areas experience  difficulty
                  in  reaching  institutions  where  they  can   apply   for
                  identity documents and birth certificates.


              (f) There is a lack of equipments such  as  computers,  faxes,
                  photocopiers and telephones at border post offices.


         3. Western Cape Province


              (a) Most owners of low-cost houses  reportedly  cannot  afford
                  the service charges.


              (b) Poll's Moor Prison, with a carrying capacity of 3Â 000,  is
                  overcrowded, with 7Â 000 inmates, 4Â 000 whom  are  awaiting
                  trial (1Â 900 are juveniles).


         4. Cross-cutting observation


              There is an exodus of professional personnel from  the  health
              departments.


     C.     Recommendations


         1. Gauteng Province


              The Committee recommends:


              (a) That an  audit  be  performed  to  determine  whether  all
                  Premiers' Offices  have  a  co-ordinating  structure  with
                  mayors, like the one in Gauteng, and that,  in  the  event
                  that such a  structure  does  not  exist,  each  Premier's
                  Office set up such a structure with the  same  or  broader
                  mandates, as per prevailing provincial conditions.
              (b) That the Province be commended for having established  the
                  Shared Service Centre, and also the other  provinces  that
                  are using the Multi-purpose Community Centres.


              (c) That the Gauteng Department of Housing submit  a  progress
                  report on their R40  million  housing  projects  earmarked
                  for women contractors.


              (d) That it confer with  the  committees  dealing  with  land,
                  housing and local government to discuss  ways  of  dealing
                  with problems of land  invasion  and  all  other  problems
                  experienced with the government's housing programme.


              (e) That a  detailed  activity  report  be  requested  on  the
                  Community-Based Public Works Project,  where  the  Gauteng
                  department achieved 59% of black economic  empowerment  on
                  contract allocation.


              (f) That Chris Hani  Baragwanath  Hospital  give  feedback  on
                  promised progress towards an improved  integrated  working
                  strategy with local clinics, as was indicated  during  the
                  visit.


              (g) That the Gauteng Departments of Health and of Public Works
                  speedily  intervene  to   deal   with   the   unacceptably
                  dilapidated  appearance  of  the  Chris  Hani  Baragwanath
                  Hospital.


              (h) That, in  view  of  challenges  around  the  retention  of
                  professional personnel in the Department  of  Health,  the
                  nurse training programme be reviewed  to  accommodate  the
                  rising need for professional personnel.


              (i) That a People's Forum be  held  within  the  community  of
                  Alexandra, with the main aim of assessing  the  impact  of
                  the Urban Renewal Programme, in  respect  of  projects  as
                  well as the efficiency of the management.
         2. North West Province


              The Committee recommends:


              (a) That a report be furnished by  the  Department  of  Public
                  Works on the state of roads for the areas affected by  the
                  flood disaster in 2000.


              (b) That the Department of Health in the North West be  called
                  upon to rectify the anomaly that, in a workforce of  which
                  80% are female, 90% of the management component are male.


              (c) The Committee commends the Anglo-American  group,  through
                  the Department of Minerals and Energy, for  their  efforts
                  to promote black economic empowerment, and  further  calls
                  on the Department of  Minerals  and  Energy  to  submit  a
                  performance report in this regard.


              (d) That the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry submit a
                  plan of their activities  to  deal  with  the  backlog  of
                  about 400Â 000 people still waiting for running water.


              (e) That the national Department of Home Affairs' statement of
                  intent to expand and intensify service provision to  rural
                  areas be pursued with vigour to enable citizens to  access
                  government  services  such  as  birth   certificates   and
                  identity documents, as these are  key  documents  required
                  to apply for social grants and other government  services.
                  Particular emphasis should be placed  on  those  provinces
                  whose people largly live in rural areas.


         3. Western Cape Province


              The Committee recommends:


              (a) That a study be conducted on the affordability of  service
                  charges  by  owners  of  low-cost  houses,  and   on   the
                  implications thereof.


              (b) That  the  Departments  of  Justice  and  of  Correctional
                  Services take care of the overcrowding problem  in  Poll's
                  Moor Prison.


         4. Cross-cutting recommendation


              The Committee recommends that the  provincial  Departments  of
              Health  submit  reports  on   their   respective   states   of
              preparedness to deal with the  challenges  occasioned  by  the
              exodus of professional personnel from their establishments.

              are aware of the existence of  these  institutions  and  their
              functions


         6. Look at the relations between these institutions and the  public
              they serve.
         The Committee agreed that this Report would be compiled  after  all
         the information had been collated and analysed, and that  it  would
         be submitted to the National Assembly.

         provinces in the next financial year.


     B.     Background


         Section  55(b)  of  the  Constitution  states  that  the   National
         Assembly must provide for mechanisms to maintain oversight of -

     C.     Procedure


         Communication on the proposed visit  was  conducted  both  verbally
         and in  writing.  Specific  emphasis  was  placed  on  meeting  the
         institutions and their constituencies in order  to  get  first-hand
         information on problems experienced.

     E.     Findings


         1. CCMA (Head Office)


              The Committee met with the chairperson of the governing  body,
              the director, the acting director,  senior  commissioners  and
              heads of department. It also conducted an in  loco  inspection
              of the offices  and  interacted  with  members  of  staff  and
              clients.


              (a) Institutional vision


                  The institutional vision is to promote social justice  and
                  economic  growth  with  social  partners  by  transforming
                  relations in the labour market. Part of the vision is  the
                  strengthening of relations  with  neighbouring  countries.
                  The CCMA has shared experiences with other countries.  The
                  institution has proved to be ahead of its counterparts  on
                  the African continent.


              (b) Projects for 2002-03


                  *    Legislative amendments
                  *    Information systems


                  *    Customer service


                  *    Capacity building


                  *    High standard operations and performance.


              (c) Institution-building focus for 2002-03


                  *    Additional training of bargaining council panellists


                  *    Provision of  IT  support  for  bargaining  council's
                    customised case management systems


                  *     Technical  support  for   new   dispute   settlement
                    services in SADC countries


                  *    Collaborative work and technical assistance to  other
                    South African institutions


                  *    A fundamental shift in  CCMA  policy  direction  from
                    conciliation and  arbitration  to  partnership-building
                    and networking for  effective  dispute  management  and
                    prevention.


              (d) Training


                  *    Induction courses are  provided  to  newly  appointed
                    commissioners and bargaining council  panellists.  Most
                    new commissioners join the institution with very little
                    knowledge of certain laws. There is a need for them  to
                    gain substantial knowledge of the laws with which  they
                    are dealing.


                  *    The need to upgrade training is due to  criticism  of
                    the quality of dispute resolution.


                  *    In the current financial year all bargaining  council
                    panellists are required to attend training.
                  *    Training is  provided  on  substantive  law  courses,
                    conciliation and managing dismissal disputes.


                  *    There  is  an  agreement  that  training  courses  on
                    arbitration should be improved.


                  *    Training is also provided on  labour  law  amendments
                    and CCMA rules. A number  of  officials  at  provincial
                    level have attended such courses.


                  *    The CCMA recognises the need  for  capacity  building
                    and training of managers. Opportunities  are  given  to
                    female managers as well.


                  *    Basic training in customer service is  also  provided
                    to staff.  Frontline  and  call  centre  staff  receive
                    training on how to deal with people.


                  *    There is no immediate impact of  losing  people  who,
                    after  being  trained,  are  attracted  to  the  public
                    sector.


              (e) Appointment of commissioners


                  Once positions become vacant,  the  governing  body  gives
                  the  go-ahead  for   posts   to   be   advertised.   After
                  interviews, the successful  ones  undergo  a  skills  test
                  before training. At present there are  408  part-time  and
                  102 full-time  commissioners.  Interviews  were  conducted
                  for posts applied for in September 2001.


              (f) Screening and case management


                  *    All cases/complaints are presented in  the  reception
                    area. Almost  420  cases  are  attended  to  each  day.
                    Complainants are assisted  to  complete  the  complaint
                    forms.


                  *    When a staff member finds it  difficult  to  explain,
                    it is referred to the duty commissioner.


                  *    Staff members attached to the front desk  are  fluent
                    in at least five languages.


                  *    Each floor has  a  senior  commissioner  and  a  case
                    management   commissioner.    The    case    management
                    commissioners deal with  conciliation,  in  some  cases
                    done telephonically and  voluntarily.  On  average,  20
                    cases are settled per day.


                  *    Many  cases  reported  are  as  a  result  of  unfair
                    dismissals. There are very few cases of discrimination.


                  *    Cases are screened to  avoid  non-jurisdiction  cases
                    entering the system. Cases falling outside  the  CCMA's
                    jurisdiction, are redirected.  30%  of  cases  screened
                    have jurisdiction.


                  *    A follow-up is done on such cases and applicants  are
                    advised through correspondence to whom they  can  refer
                    their cases.


                  *     Some  applicants  whose   applications   have   been
                    referred to the bargaining council, come  back  to  the
                    CCMA if their cases are not attended to.  However,  the
                    CCMA has no jurisdiction  over  cases  that  have  been
                    referred to the bargaining council.


                  *    The Acting Senior  Case  Management  Officer  screens
                    referrals to check for defects.


                  *    The public expects the CCMA should play the  role  of
                    a legal representative.


                  *    A call centre has been  piloted  for  a  month.  Over
                    6Â 000 calls have been received, in different languages.


                  *    A fraud and corruption hotline has also been set up.
                  *     The  staff  generally  work  under   pressure.   The
                    staff/workload ratio is a cause for concern.  One  case
                    management officer handles all queries.


                  *    Clients who come to  present  their  cases,  are  not
                    received and welcomed. Most of them look disillusioned.


              (g) Partnership building and networking


                  The CCMA has launched user forums in all  provinces,  with
                  the objective to facilitate information sharing,  and  the
                  exchange of experiences and ideas  between  the  CCMA  and
                  stakeholders.


                  The  expected  outcome  is   the   creation   of   greater
                  understanding between  the  CCMA,  its  users  and  social
                  partners on  problems  experienced  by  users,  the  daily
                  challenges and issues experienced by  the  CCMA,  and  how
                  best to use the CCMA.


              (h) Constraints and challenges facing CCMA


                  *    Delays in the finalisation of cases  are  most  often
                    caused  by  users  themselves.  A  high  percentage  of
                    inspectors are  newly  employed  and  still  undergoing
                    training.  Some  regional  offices  still  have   staff
                    shortages.


                  *    The CCMA office in  Gauteng  has  to  cope  with  the
                    workload of Pretoria, because Pretoria  does  not  have
                    sufficient venues to hear cases. This has  caused  some
                    commissioners to  volunteer  their  space  for  hearing
                    cases.


                  *    It has been discovered that  most  people  are  still
                    not clear about their rights. Every client who comes to
                    the front desk, is advised of his/her rights. The  CCMA
                    is also considering offering  training  to  the  advice
                    centres.


                  *     The  institution  is  faced  with  a  challenge   of
                    matching service delivery with financial constraints.


                  *    There is an increase in the number  of  cases,  which
                    stems  from  the  old  labour   environment.   However,
                    commissioners have been drawn from other  provinces  to
                    assist. As a cost-cutting exercise commissioners had to
                    pay for their accommodation and meals. More than 15Â 000
                    cases were dealt with.


                  *    A copy of the training programme offered by the  CCMA
                    was made available to the Committee.


         2. Umsobomvu Youth Fund


              (a) The Committee met with Mr M Kekana, CEO, the  Director  of
                  the National School of Accounting (NSA), and students.


                  *    The Fund has made much progress since  its  inception
                    in January 2001, and has proved to be fully  competent.
                    Of the  two  divisions,  Youth  Development  and  Youth
                    Entrepreneurship, the former has developed enormously.


                  *    Numerous resources were  dedicated  towards  capacity
                    building.


                  *    20% of funds  are  spent  on  creating  contacts  for
                    young people in career employment and entrepreneurship.


                  *    The Fund has formed  a  partnership  with  the  Youth
                    Commission.


                  *    Youth advisory  centres  were  developed  to  provide
                    young people with  advice  and  information  on  career
                    development,  employment  and  entrepreneurship.  Three
                    service  providers   have   been   selected   for   the
                    establishment of pilot centres. Currently these are  in
                    Kagiso, Soweto and the Western Cape.


                  *     The  Fund  offers  youth   service   programmes   in
                    construction, agriculture,  and  HIV/AIDS  care.  These
                    programmes  are  taking  place   in   Mothibistad   and
                    Atamelang, North-West.


                  *    Youths are involved in constructing  a  multi-purpose
                    centre and, in agriculture, in  creating  250  communal
                    gardens. Training is given in HIV/AIDS counselling, and
                    there are general counselling to youths at school.


                  *     Negotiations  have  been  entered  into   with   the
                    Department of Public Works on how it could be used as a
                    training centre. The Red Meat  Association  will  offer
                    training on livestock farming and land restitution. The
                    Agricultural Research Council will teach  young  people
                    technical and professional skills.
                  *    The Fund has signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding
                    with the SABC, and it is going to fund the Yizo Yizo  3
                    series.


                  *    Two entrepreneurship projects have been  set  up,  in
                    Maluti and Keiskammahoek.


                  *    Capacity needs to be built  within  youth  structures
                    to  enable  them  to  co-ordinate  and  network   among
                    themselves and with the Fund.


              (b) School to work


                  *    The National School of Accounting  (EQUIP  Programme)
                    is one of the major projects  supported  by  the  Fund.
                    About   500   graduates   from    historically    black
                    universities undergo a  bridging  programme  to  assist
                    them to acquire a chartered  accountant  qualification.
                    The bridging programme is  aimed  at  closing  the  gap
                    between university and working environment.  The  focus
                    is on areas that are in demand.


                  *    The life skills component is what attracted the  Fund
                    to the NSA programme.  Minimal skills impact  is  being
                    infused into this programme.


                  *     The   Fund   receives   quarterly   monitoring   and
                    evaluation reports.


                  *    As a way of assisting  students  in  getting  through
                    the learnership programme, some editing firms have been
                    approached to do presentations on their  organisations.
                    Some  have  vacancies  relating  to   the   learnership
                    programme.


                  *    The NSA enrols 50 students per year. The capacity  of
                    the NSA is limited by funding. The cost per student  is
                    R32 000, excluding  R15Â 000  living  costs.  With  more
                    funding the institution could  expand.  Increasing  the
                    number of students  would  also  necessitate  employing
                    more professionals.


                  *    The Fund has commissioned a resolution that is  going
                    to inform labour market opportunities. For example, one
                    employer in Johannesburg could employ 200 trainees.


                  *    The legal fraternity is not  included  in  programmes
                    funded by Umsobomvu.


                  *    The vision also includes opening an NSA satellite  in
                    the Eastern Cape.


                  *    The NSA accepts students from  peri-urban  and  rural
                    areas.


              (c) Challenges facing Fund


                  *    The agency has insufficient  funding.  This  year  it
                    will commit R18 million. It needs to have direct access
                    to funding from departments such as Public Works.
                  *     Funds  are  solicited  from  foreign   donors,   and
                    linkages will be formed with the National Skills  Fund.
                    Government funding is not sufficient.


                  *    There is  a  need  to  build  capacity  within  youth
                    structures to enable them to  co-ordinate  and  network
                    among themselves and with the Fund.


     F.     NEDLAC


         The Committee met with representatives from NEDLAC constituencies.


         *  NEDLAC moved to new premises in February 2002, and has  a  staff
           complement of 18, including  the  executive  director,  a  small
           secretariat and general assistants.


         *  190 meetings were held during the last financial year.


         *  The constituencies of NEDLAC reaffirmed a commitment  to  social
           dialogue and working together. NEDLAC is committed to  assisting
           its  constituencies  to  better   reach   their   members   with
           information about what is happening at NEDLAC.


         *  The NEDLAC summit was due to be held on 28 September  2002.  The
           growth and development summit will be held in the first  quarter
           of 2003.


         *   The  annual  summits  assist  in  ensuring   that   broad-based
           participation   is   drawn   from   various   structures.   Each
           constituency  is  guided  by  its  objectives,   positions   and
           principles.


         Annual financial statements


         *  An audit,  which  includes  examining  evidence  supporting  the
           amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
           the accounting principles used, significant  estimates  made  by
           management, and evaluating the overall  financial  presentation,
           was conducted by Gobodo Incorporated.
         *  This was done in accordance with  statements  of  South  African
           Auditing Standards.


         *  The audit opinion proved that the  financial  statements  fairly
           present, in all material respects,  the  financial  position  of
           NEDLAC, and the results  of  its  operations  for  the  year  in
           accordance with generally accepted accounting practice.

         4. Capacity building at NEDLAC


              (a) A substantial  amount  of  money  is  devoted  to  support
                  constituency  structures.  This   helps   to   develop   a
                  constituency's capacity to engage in NEDLAC  and  to  take
                  part in policy formulation.


              (b) NEDLAC jointly hosted a three-day  workshop  with  COSATU,
                  Western Cape, as part of its capacity  building  programme
                  for constituencies.


         5. NEDLAC constituencies


              (a) Labour


                  *    The input that NEDLAC makes, is  appreciated.  NEDLAC
                    has managed to diffuse the tension that used to exist.


                  *    Negotiations on labour law  amendments  were  lengthy
                    and tedious.


                  *    The negotiation process on the Immigration  Bill  was
                    surrounded by controversy and a lack  of  agreement  on
                    the labour law amendments.


                  *    Because of  the  hectic  schedule,  labour  sometimes
                    finds it difficult to interact at the joint  task  team
                    level.


                  Challenges


                  *       Co-ordination    of    inputs    from    different
                    constituencies


                  *    Strengthening administration in the  Chamber  through
                    empowering people and improving resources


                  *    Slow pace at which decisions are processed


                  *    Need for more financial and human resources


                  *    Justice is not done to tasks  allotted  to  different
                    constituencies


                  *    Little co-operation within constituencies.
              (b) Business South Africa


                  This is a 19-member organisation, consisting  of  employer
                  organisations and confederations.  An  alliance  has  been
                  formed with the Black Business Council in  order  to  work
                  together  to  form  one   national   non-racial   business
                  society.


                  Challenges


                  *    There is a concern that the government  is  selective
                    in the manner in which policies are referred to NEDLAC.
                    Examples of this  are  the  Immigration  Bill  and  the
                    Insolvency Bill.


                  *    The lack of  human  and  financial  resources  places
                    constraints on the work of the organisation.


                  *    Some issues take too long as a  result  of  input  by
                    parties.


                  *    There is a problem with quick decisions  being  taken
                    due to time constraints.


              (c) Government


                  The lack of resources would be  looked  at.  All  concerns
                  raised by constituencies were noted.


              (d) Community


                  This constituency is represented by organisations such  as
                  the  SA  Youth  Council,  SANCO,   the   National   Womens
                  Coalition, etc.


              (e) Ordinary people from the community have an opportunity  to
                  interact with NEDLAC, especially on labour  policies  such
                  as equity.


              Challenges


              *    NEDLAC  has  been  confronted  from  time  to  time  with
                unplanned  activities  from  unexpected  competencies,   for
                example the WSSD.


              *   Capacity building and resources need attention.


              *   Regular interaction with community  representatives  needs
                to be harnessed.


              *   More  attention  needs  to  be  focused  on  key  national
                objectives such as poverty alleviation and HIV/AIDS.


         4. Ditsela


              (a) The Committee  met  with  the  Director,  members  of  the
                  governing body and staff.


              (b) Ditsela was established in 1997, with a  staff  complement
                  of three. At preent, it has 18 staff members.


              (c) The existing board was appointed by COSATU and FEDUSA.


              (d) This institution gets core funding from the Department  of
                  Labour and has to report every four months.


              (e) The budget for the current financial year is R8,2 million.


              (f) Ditsela requested financial support from other independent
                  unions.


              (g) Accounting on funding is done every three months by  means
                  of audit reports.


              (h) Attempts have been made to bring NACTU on board, but to no
                  avail. Two seats on  the  board  have  been  allocated  to
                  NACTU.


              Challenges


              *   A model that would help to address key problems  faced  by
                the new generation of shop stewards, needs to be developed.


              *   A plan for a pilot programme to  train  shop  stewards  is
                being designed.


              *   Capaciy on the shop floor seems to be  decreasing  due  to
                natural attrition and union members going into business.


              *   Ditsela recognises the issue of women. An advanced  course
                in leadership has been introduced.


              *   There is  a  challenge  to  get  into  the  Department  of
                Education and develop a concept of introducing  trade  union
                studies by linking them to broader society and to  the  role
                they play in society.


              *   The problem of capacity  and  budget  constraints  hinders
                Ditsela in reaching out to other parts.
              *   There is need for training in the labour  field  to  reach
                areas besides unions.


              *   Ditsela is currently working on skills development.


              *   The Department of Labour has assigned Ditsela to  drive  a
                massive health and safety programme. A project proposal  has
                already been designed, but the programme has been stalled by
                changes in the Department.


              *   The institution responded to requests  made  to  establish
                links. There is a need for Ditsela to expand its network  by
                linking with international institutions such as the ILO  and
                Ruskin College.


              *   Courses prioritised for the 2003-04 financial year include
                negotiation skills, a  women's  leadership  course,  and  an
                office-bearers' courses, as well as core skill courses  such
                as writing skills and  using  the  Internet  and  electronic
                mail.
              *   Negotiations are conducted with WITS on  accrediting  some
                of the advanced courses.


              *   Staff development is taking place within the  institution.
                A workshop was conducted recently on how Ditsela  would  fit
                in with the WSSD. Internship courses are  offered  to  train
                people on the operations of Ditsela.


     G.     Concluding remarks


         The Committee expresses its appreciation for the  efforts  made  by
         the above institutions to make the visit a success.  The  Committee
         further recommends that in future there  should  be  continuity  in
         interaction between these institutions and the Committee.

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committee  on  Labour  on  provincial  visits,
     dated 26 September 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Labour,  having  visited  various  provinces
     from 19 to 20 June 2001, reports as follows:
     The objective of the  visits  was  to  identify  industrial  activities
     indigent to a specific province and then to focus  exclusively  on  the
     level of implementation of the labour market programmes designed by the
     Department of Labour (the Department).  The  focus  will,  however,  be
     completed by the skills development and employment  equity  programmes,
     which will form the underlying and common thread.


     A.     Mpumalanga


         1. Findings


              (a) There was a  continuous  linkage  between  the  divisional
                  collective  bargaining  body  at  head  office   and   the
                  provincial office to reconcile the reports.


              (b) In 1999 the provincial job summit  was  established  after
                  the Department had realised that it could not run all  the
                  initiatives.


              (c) The summit led to the establishment of the provincial  job
                  summit  co-ordinating  committee,  which  comprised  three
                  clusters.


              (d) The economic and investment  cluster  was  headed  by  the
                  Department of Finance and  Economic  Affairs,  the  skills
                  development cluster by  the  Department  and  the  special
                  employment programmes cluster by the Department of  Public
                  Works.


              (e) As regards inspections, the province  was  looking  at  40
                  inspections per inspector per month.


              (f) Procedural  compliance  and  substantive  compliance  were
                  highlighted as Employment Equity Act problems.


              (g) The  provincial  executive  manager  said  the  focus  was
                  currently on procedural compliance.


         2. Challenges
              (a) There were 4Â 032  outstanding  cases  due  to  a  lack  of
                  capacity.


              (b) Construction and agricultural sectors were  identified  as
                  problem areas.


              (c) Problems experienced in the construction sector  were  due
                  to contractors who are contracting with local government.


              (d) The Department's tender procedures had no provision  which
                  complied with labour laws.


              (e) Retrenchments in most sectors resulted in  delays  in  the
                  filling of  vacancies.  Therefore,  business  units  could
                  only fill 70 per cent of the  vacancies,  instead  of  the
                  targeted 90 per cent.


              (f) There was still many outstanding complaints.


              (g) There was a scarcity of skilled people.


              (h) The poor economy and the decline in the labour market made
                  it very difficult  to  assist  retrenched  workers  to  be
                  reabsorbed in the labour market.


              (i)  Retrenched  workers  were  not  interested  in  training;
                  instead they visited  the  office  to  claim  Unemployment
                  Insurance Fund (UIF) payouts.


              (j) The  implementation  of  the  Employment  Equity  Act  was
                  highlighted as the most problematic area.


              (k) NACTU mentioned that some of the  cases  referred  to  the
                  Department are complaints from employees who are  employed
                  on the basis of verbal contracts.


         3. Recommendations


              (a) When a case is  referred  for  inspection,  it  should  be
                  finalised within 30 days of referral.
              (b) The Department should look again at cases where  employers
                  do not deduct  UIF  contributions  from  their  employees'
                  salaries. This is unfair  to  employees  who  have  worked
                  with one employer for more than five years.


              (c) The  Department  should  ensure  the  enforcement  of  the
                  Employment Equity Act on farmers.


              (d) NACTU suggested that organised labour and  the  Department
                  should join hands to address employment issues.


              (e) The inspection blitz of the Department that focused mostly
                  on child labour and seasonal labour could be the  solution
                  to most of the problems in farm areas.


              (f) More staff was required at the provincial office to  drive
                  the skills development strategy.


     B.     Witbank Labour Centre


         Meeting with clients in queues


         1. Farm and domestic workers got dismissed after  they  had  lodged
              complaints with the Department against their employers.


         2. The Middelburg Labour Centre developed a  programme  where  they
              met domestic workers three  times  a  week.  The  aim  of  the
              meetings was to educate domestic workers about their rights.


         3. The Department used radio stations and  local  newspapers  as  a
              means of communication with farm and domestic workers.


         4. The  delegation  was  informed  that  domestic  workers  in  the
              highveld region were unionised,  and  that  this  resulted  in
              problems being solved more speedily at ground level.


     C.     Groblersdal Labour Centre


         1.  Findings


              (a) The blitz inspection of the Department managed to  include
                  most areas that were virtually unreachable.


              (b) The level of  compliance  with  legislation  had  improved
                  drastically in the area.


         2.  Evander


              (a) Challenges


                  *    The relationship between employers and employees  was
                    hostile.


                  *    There was a high level of non-compliance with  labour
                    laws in the area.


                  *    The community faced a problem of slow  feedback  from
                    the Department on matters of compliance.


                  *    Transfer and resignation of personnel  disturbed  the
                    smooth running of  labour  centres  and  also  hampered
                    their working relationship.


                  *    Compliance with labour laws at  Bethal  Hospital  was
                    low; the Committee was requested to intervene.


                  *    Farm evictions in Piet Retief was prevalent, and  the
                    Department seemed to have done nothing about the plight
                    of farmworkers.


                  *     Companies  such  as  Edgars  and  Foschini  employed
                    people as casual or temporary workers  on  a  continual
                    basis for more than 10 years.


                  *    Many companies were  not  training  their  employees,
                    but continued to claim a skill levy.


                  *     Training  on  the  implementation  of   the   Skills
                    Development Act  was  cumbersome  and  its  impact  not
                    visible on the ground.


                  *    The  gender  composition  of  the  personnel  in  the
                    department was not in compliance  with  the  Employment
                    Equity Act.


              (b) Recommendations


                  *    The community suggested that the Labour Centre  Forum
                    develop a mechanism to  implement  decisions  taken  at
                    meetings.


                  *    The terms  of  reference  for  the  Forum  should  be
                    clearly pronounced.


                  *    Inspectors should visit shops to check the  level  of
                    compliance.


                  *    The community suggested that the  Department  develop
                    a feedback mechanism.


                  *    The Department should plan meetings  in  advance  and
                    communicate  information   to   the   relevant   people
                    timeously.


                  *    The Department should budget for training  SMMEs  and
                    people with disability.


                  *     People  with  disability   were   not   offered   an
                    opportunity to  attend  training  by  various  training
                    institutions in order to broaden their skills base.  As
                    a result, they remained at a disadvantage when it  came
                    to employment. Sign language should be accommodated for
                    people with disability.


                  *    The Department should consider  opening  a  satellite
                    office in Mbalenhle township, as many residents in  the
                    area cannot afford travelling to Evander.


              (c) Conclusion


                  The community saw the service rendered by  the  Department
                  in the area to be of a high standard, adding value to  the
                  community.

                  Total      16
                             --


                  *    Two posts were frozen.


                  *    They needed more African males to  balance  race  and
                    gender at the centre.


                  *    The centre was involved  with  the  women  millennium
                    project, funded by the Department.


                  *    The project employed  30  people,  mostly  women,  to
                    knit curtains and jerseys.


                  *    The project was  targeted  at  disadvantaged  groups,
                    especially unemployed youth.


                  *     The  centre  offered  training  related  to  poverty
                    alleviation  projects  of  the  Department  of   Social
                    Development.


                  *    The centre serviced the following areas:


                    - Tsakane
                    - Geluksdals
                    - Dalpark
                    - Brakpan North Industrial Area
                    - Greater Brakpan.
              (b) Challenges


                  *    Security companies were not complying with the  Basic
                    Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA) and the Wage Act.


                  *    Employers in the domestic sector did  not  understand
                    or comply with the provisions of the Act.


                  *    CCMA and UIF cases were a major problem,  since  many
                    companies were closing down.


                  *    Employers leave without completing all the  necessary
                    forms, and it was difficult to trace them.


                  *    The centre did not conduct  occupational  health  and
                    safety inspections. If an inspection was required,  the
                    centre had to request an inspector from  the  Germiston
                    labour centre.


                  *    Business in Brakpan was declining.
                  *    Major businesses established, do not last  more  than
                    three months before  they  move  to  other  areas  like
                    Germiston or Kempton Park.


              (c) Relationship with stakeholders


                  *    The  centre  had  established  working  relationships
                    with various community-based organisations,  especially
                    non-governmental organisations (NGOs).


                  *    There was interaction with the unions on issues  such
                    as joint inspections.


                  *     There  was  a  sound   relationship   with   various
                    employers in the area, especially  in  respect  of  the
                    drafting of employment equity plans.


                  *    There was  also  a  good  working  relationship  with
                    various  government   departments,   such   as   Social
                    Development.


                  *    The centre was part of the  Government  Communication
                    and Information System.


              (d) Meeting with staff


                  Challenges


                  *    The unavailability of space in  the  centre  made  it
                    impossible   to   implement   integrated   registration
                    services.


                  *    There were no air-conditioners in the centre.


                  *    There was a shortage of UIF computers.


                  *    Head office took a long time to make payouts on  CCMA
                    and UIF cases.


                  *     Staff  members  could  not  answer  enquiries   from
                    employers and clients.


                  Meeting with clients at centre


                  *    The Committee interacted  with  clients  queueing  at
                    registration services,  and  questioned  clients  about
                    service  delivery   they   are   receiving   from   the
                    Department.


                  *    Most clients which the  delegation  interacted  with,
                    were pleased with the quality of  service  rendered  by
                    departmental officials at the  Brakpan  labour  centre,
                    especially those at the registration services  for  the
                    speedy service.


         3. Recommendations


              (a)  The  centre  must  utilise   parliamentary   offices   to
                  disseminate information.


              (b) The centre should link up with the local council.


              (c) The centre should work  closely  with  other  departments,
                  such as the Department of Trade and Industry, to  identify
                  projects.
     E.     Johannesburg labour centre - meeting with inspectors


         1.  Challenges


              (a)  Inspectors  were  leaving  the  Department  for   greener
                  pastures  in  government  departments  and   the   private
                  sector.


              (b) The lack of resources (computers, transport and furniture)
                  made it difficult  to  further  the  principle  of  "Batho
                  Pele".


              (c) Inspectors  lacked  support  or  counselling  after  being
                  exposed  to  horrible  incidents,  such  as   injured   or
                  deceased persons.


         2.  Recommendations


              (a) Provincial matters should be addressed through the correct
                  protocol channels.


              (b) The delegation promised to raise issues  of  concern  with
                  the Minister when they meet him.


         3.  Co-operation with stakeholders


              (a) Inspectors indicated that  unions  are  co-operating  with
                  them during inspections.


              (b) Some employers were more co-operative than others.


              (c) The Public Prosecutions Office and the Small Claims  Court
                  co-operated in finalising cases.


              (d) A problem was experienced with the SAPS  not  co-operating
                  when a warrant of arrest is issued for an employer who  is
                  not complying with the law.


         4. Walkabout and interaction with staff and clients


              (a) The centre serviced 500 to 800 clients a day.


              (b) It lacked information signs that provide direction  for  a
                  particular service offered.


              (c) Clients were happy that queues at the UIF pay  point  were
                  moving faster.


         5.  Meeting with stakeholders to discuss Employment Equity Act


              (a)  Stakeholders  indicated  that  they  were  succeeding  in
                  complying with the implementation of both  the  Employment
                  Equity  Act  and  the  Skills  Development  Act,  due   to
                  assistance received from officials of the Department,  the
                  Department's website and SETA.


              (b) There was a scarcity of skilled people from the designated
                  groups, especially people with disability.


              (c) The centre intended developing a strategy to identify  and
                  link with associations of the physically disabled  to  get
                  assistance from them.


     F.     Meeting with business unit managers


         1. Overview of Integrated Beneficiary Services (IBS)


              (a) The IBS was administering the COIDA Act and the UIF Act.


              (b) Decentralisation of COIDA  and  UIF  functions  from  head
                  office to the province was in an advanced stage.


         2. Challenges facing IBS


              (a) The IBS needs to establish a permanent  relationship  with
                  clients and stakeholders.


              (b) There was a shortage of computers.


              (c) There was negative publicity from the media about the  UIF
                  being bankrupt.


     G.     Employment and Skills Development Services (ESDS)


         1. Overview of ESDS


              (a) ESDS was part of employment services at head office.


              (b) The main objective of ESDS was to make sure that employees
                  enter or re-enter the labour market.


              (c) The province was allocated R12 million to  train  employed
                  people and prisoners on parole.


         2. Job creation projects


              (a)  ESDS  was  involved  in  many  projects  with   different
                  stakeholders.


              (b) The province developed a database of stakeholders.


              (c) Regional heads were trained to identify projects in  their
                  areas.

              (a) People did not know about the existence of the projects.


              (b) There was a shortage of staff.


              (c) A poor relationship existed with  the  Gauteng  provincial
                  government.


              (d) The formal sector was shrinking.


              (e) The shortage of IT systems has hampered progress.


         4. Management Support Services (MSS)


              (a) Overview of MSS
                  The role of MSS was to support all  business  units,  such
                  as staff, resources, accommodation, delivery of  services,
                  facilities, etc.


              (b) Priorities


                  These included the introduction  of  the  new  performance
                  management system, the identification of training  skills,
                  the alignment of the Employment Equity Act with  a  proper
                  recruitment strategy, the balancing of  staff  complements
                  and the boosting of morale.


              (c) Challenges


                  *    It was difficult to recruit people  with  disability,
                    and there was a lack of proper facilities for them.


                  *    The policy on internship was not yet in place.


                  *    The relationship with  the  Public  Works  Department
                    was poor.


                  *      Budget   constraints   made   it   difficult    for
                    registration services to be restructured.


                  *    Staff resignations due to unclear career pathing  and
                    upward mobility cost the province dearly.


     H.     Sebokeng - visit to Industries Education and Training  Institute
         (IETI)


         1.  Background


              (a) The IETI, an employment creation  project  funded  through
                  skills   development   strategy,   was   an   organisation
                  established  to  train  and  develop  skills  of  selected
                  groups, such as people with disability and the youth.


              (b) It promoted independence and sustainability of income, and
                  enhances the quality of people's lives.
              (c) The IETI intended  to  achieve  its  purpose  through  the
                  process   of   saleable   skills   development,   economic
                  development,  career   pathing,   learnership   and   SMME
                  development of its target population.


              (d) The IETI  attempted  to  influence  the  overall  training
                  mechanism  in  a  positive  manner  and  to   fulfil   the
                  initiative instituted by the RDP.


         2.  Objectives


              (a) To participate with industries and communities to identify
                  training and development needs.


              (b) To  align  the  Department  with  training  needs  of  the
                  industry arising from the Skills Development Act  and  the
                  Employment Equity Act on a national basis.


              (c) To identify areas where training and development will have
                  the most impact.
              (d) To train people  to  a  level  of  competence,  and  where
                  possible, to artisian status, in order to place  a  highly
                  trained workforce at the disposal of the industry.


         3.  Training centre


              (a) The motto of the centre was "Job creation  through  skills
                  development".


              (b) The centre had 48 students.


              (c) Most of the students were  unemployed  and  did  not  have
                  funds to start their own businesses.


              (d)  All  students  came   from   disadvantaged   backgrounds,
                  including black females and people with disability.


              (e) People with disability were developed  in  entrepreneurial
                  and technical skills to earn a sustainable income.


              (f) The availability of able students at the  training  centre
                  assisted  students  with  disability  to   perform   their
                  physical chores.


              (g) The centre is a tripartite partnership between  IETI,  the
                  Association of the Disabled and the Department of Labour.


         4.  Interaction with trainees/students


              Trainees had  skills  such  as  welding,  woodwork,  business,
              computers and electronics. Students appreciated the  visit  by
              the delegation and were grateful for the financial  assistance
              from the Department.


     I.  Northern Cape


         1.  Hartswater farm


              (a) Findings


                  *    Farmers were not aware of their  role  regarding  the
                    existing labour laws.


                  *    Many farmers were not complying  with  all  the  laws
                    yet, but were willing to listen and abide by the law as
                    far as possible.


              (b) Challenges


                  * Farm sizes ranged from  20  to  25  ha.  There  was  not
                    enough space to build houses for workers.


                  * Permanent workers had contracts but there were no  clear
                    guidelines on how to hire casual labour.


                  *  During  school  holidays  girls  between  12   and   15
                    accompanied their parents  to  help  pick  cotton,  for
                    workers were paid per kg picked. It seemed that not all
                    farmers abided by the Child Labour Act.


              (c) Recommendations
                  *    Farmers must establish the  need  for  housing  among
                    farmworkers and the government should look  into  rural
                    development for them.


                  *    As regards  casual  workers,  a  strategy  should  be
                    worked out between the Department and farmers.


                  *    Farmers can apply  for  exemptions,  for  example  on
                    deciduous fruits.


                  * Farmers can have cases negotiated, and in certain  cases
                    exemptions may  be  negotiated  with  the  Minister  of
                    Labour.


              (d) Meeting with farmworkers


                  * Workers were not treated as fellow  human  beings.  They
                    worked with no resistance to unjust laws.


                  * Farmers did not receive leave pay.


                  *    When a worker  fell  ill,  money  was  deducted  from
                    his/her  wages  upon  return,  for  transport  to   the
                    hospital or a doctor.


     J.  Northern Cape - provincial office


         1.  Findings


              (a)  More  females  were  employed  in   the   Northern   Cape
                  Directorate.


              (b) The province  had  not  finalised  its  employment  equity
                  targets.


         2.  Meeting with stakeholders


              (a) Findings


                  *    Many  companies  experienced  serious  problems  with
                    skills development due to budget constraints.


                  *    Time-frames for employers to  submit  their  business
                    plans were too short.


                  *     In  respect  of   employment   equity   and   skills
                    development,  there  was  a  need  to  address  "window
                    dressing" and the  necessity  of  bringing  experienced
                    people from other provinces instead of equipping  local
                    people.


                  *    Companies were promoting child labour, for example  a
                    company in Springbok (Black  Mountain),  an  Australian
                    Company called Torax, etc.


                  *    Cheap labour  was  promoted,  and  many  people  were
                    working in unsafe conditions.


                  *    Employers were turning their dogs loose  on  workers,
                    and livestock was impounded when found trespassing.


                  *    Persons with 32 years' service were  being  dismissed
                    when they requested a salary increase.


                  *    Labour  courts  were  unable  to  assist  people  and
                    victims, who had applied for compensation under  COIDA.
                    Those persons were frustrated, as some have applied  as
                    long ago as 1990 but have not been paid.


                  *      Telephonic   enquiries    to    the    Compensation
                    Commissioner's office were not answered timeously,  or,
                    in most cases, not at all.


         3.  Meeting with Department of Economic Affairs


              Findings


              (a) In respect of the  Basic  Conditions  of  Employment  Act,
                  difficulties were experienced, especially  in  respect  of
                  the Department of Health and nurses' time of duty.


              (b) Labour court judges were hostile towards  the  affirmative
                  action policy.


     K.  Western Cape


         1.  Mitchells Plain Labour Centre (Morgenster)


              (a) Findings


                  *    The centre rendered the following services:


                    - Beneficiary services (main function)


                    - Labour relations enquiries


                    - Inspection and enforcement


                    - Employment equity


                    - Skills development strategies.


                  *    The beneficiary service  was  said  to  be  the  most
                    important function rendered by the centre  due  to  the
                    large number of unemployed people.


                  *    The centre rendered services to between 180  and  200
                    clients reporting for the first time  to  register  for
                    employment.


                  *    On busy days the centre rendered  services  to  1Â 800
                    people.


                  *     The  centre  serviced   people   from   Khayelitsha,
                    Mitchell's Plain, Mandalay, Philippi and Delft.


                  *    Taxis were used  as  a  means  of  transport  to  the
                    satellite office.


                  *    Staff at the centre comprised  12  people,  three  of
                    whom were in the satellite office at D F  Malan  labour
                    centre in Nyanga.


                  *    80% of  the  cases  dealt  with  were  resolved,  but
                    currently there are no  figures  available  to  support
                    these statistics. Information will be supplied  in  due
                    course.


                  *    The inspection  and  enforcement  department  carried
                    out occupational health and safety duties although they
                    were  not  qualified  to  do  so.  However,   intensive
                    inspections were referred to the Cape  Town  provincial
                    office.


                  *     Since  this  Department  was  performing   intensive
                    duties, they only lodged complaints and submitted  them
                    to the provincial office.


              (b) Placement and benefits


                  *     Front-line  staff  members  registered  clients  for
                    employment and placed them  when  the  opportunity  for
                    employment became available.


                  *     Employment  service  practice  held   workshops   to
                    prepare clients for re-employment.


                  *     The  waiting  period  for  benefits  was  12  weeks,
                    depending  on  the   availability   of   the   required
                    documents.


                  *    The Department made it a  priority  to  keep  regular
                    contact with the client on progress of the placement.


         2.  Challenges


              (a) The centre is located in an environment where there  is  a
                  high rate of gangsterism. Security is a problem since  the
                  building is shared with other tenants. Security  personnel
                  are not present at the centre at all times. They are  only
                  present on payout days.


              (b) Robberies have cost the centre dearly,  and  it  has  lost
                  most of its  equipment.  People  were  constantly  mugged,
                  especially on payment days. Mr Adam, head of  the  centre,
                  forwarded two letters to the provincial  office  regarding
                  complaints about burglaries. A neighbourhood watch  helped
                  look after the building.


              (c) Complaints were also lodged by a number of clients who had
                  to use two taxis to get  to  the  centre.  This  ended  up
                  being quite expensive. People were robbed  inside  a  taxi
                  when leaving the building. They preferred to use the  Cape
                  Town provincial office, where only one  vehicle  was  used
                  and was less expensive.


              (d) The centre was facing a shortage of  staff  to  render  an
                  adequate service.


              (e) Staff  members  lacked  sufficient  information  regarding
                  procedures on certain pieces of legislation,  for  example
                  the Labour Relations Act and the Occupational  Health  and
                  Safety Act.
              (f) The centre was without an integrated computerised system.


              (g) Budget constraints affected the distribution of resources.


              (h) Fraud was experienced  at  the  centre.  The  culprit  was
                  arrested before he could receive his first cheque.


         3.  Meeting with public in queues


              The following concerns were raised:


              (a) Members of the public expressed their  dissatisfaction  at
                  the number  of  times  they  visited  the  office  without
                  receiving their first cheque.


              (b) People felt they were not informed about  the  causes  for
                  the delays.


              (c) People also felt that there was a lack of information from
                  staff members regarding the documents  they  should  bring
                  when applying for benefits.


         4.  D F Malan satellite office


              (a) Findings


                  *    The head of the centre briefed the delegation on  the
                    functions of the office, which included the  processing
                    of applications  for  beneficiaries,  registration  for
                    employment and payouts benefits.


                  *     The  office  rendered  a  service  to  people   from
                    Philippi, Nyanga and Gugulethu. Not  many  people  used
                    this office; they preferred the  Cape  Town  provincial
                    office to collect their benefits. Figures  showed  that
                    very few people visited the office from beginning  2001
                    till the time of the visit:


                    January 2001  252
                    February 2001 234
                    March 2001    245
                    April 2001    219
                    May 2001      173


                  *    The challenge facing the office was capacity.


                  *    The centre lacked sufficient information to  properly
                    inform the public.


              (b) Location of centre


                  *    According to the survey conducted  in  2000,  71%  of
                    clients preferred the office  to  be  moved  closer  to
                    their residences.


                  *    Locations identified included offices in Cross  Roads
                    and Old Cross Roads, but these buildings were not  good
                    in good shape and needed to be renovated. These offices
                    were more secure than  the  one  in  Mitchell's  Plain,
                    being closer  to  the  police  station.  Other  clients
                    identified Brown's  Farm  in  Philippi  as  a  possible
                    location.


                  *    Mr Adams said the decision lay  with  the  Department
                    of Public Works to avail the premises required  by  the
                    Department of Labour.


         5.  Communication


              (a)  The  office  was  running  workshops  as   a   means   of
                  communicating with the public,  and  radio  sessions  were
                  also in the pipeline.


              (b) Six sessions on unemployment insurance were conducted.


              (c) A task team was appointed at head office to conduct a work
                  study.


              (d) It was recommended that each labour centre have  a  client
                  service desk and an  inspection  and  enforcement  service
                  desk to deal with CCMA enquiries.
         6.  Employment placement


              (a) The centre had a 7% placement rate.


              (b) Its challenge was the long queues during payouts.


              (c) Members of the public  queued  outside  the  building  and
                  during  rainy  days  the  situation   became   even   more
                  difficult.


         7.  Working hours


              (a) The office opened at 08:30 and closed  at  15:00,  clients
                  already inside being served till 16:00.


              (b) Services such as the payment of grants  started  at  11:00
                  and continued till 16:00.


              (c) Staff members experienced problems with closing time. They
                  preferred the office to officially close at  15:00,  which
                  would enable them to  finalise  the  day's  administration
                  and process forms timeously so as to avoid backlogs.


         8.  Recommendations


              (a) The office should conduct a survey on the number of people
                  who use the provincial office in Cape Town, who should  be
                  encouraged to use their nearest labour centre.


              (b)  Pamphlets  in  all  languages  should  be  used   as   an
                  alternative way of informing  people  about  the  services
                  offered.  These  pamphlets  must  outline  procedures   to
                  follow from one queue to another, and  must  indicate  the
                  documents to be brought in respect of certain services.


              (c) The closing time of 16:00 should be reconsidered to enable
                  staff members to expedite the processing of applications.


         9. Cape Town - provincial office
              (a) Findings


                  The delegation was  briefed  on  strategic  planning,  the
                  status  of  the  building,  recruitment  plans   and   the
                  province's initiative in supporting Human Rights Day,  May
                  Day and other cultural events in the province.


              (b) Inspection and enforcement


                  Challenges


                  * There was a lack of resources.


                  * Personnel required training.


                  * Incidents of fraud were reported.


                  *    An integrated system needed to be installed.


                  *    Budget cuts affected distribution of resources.
              (c) Discussions


                  Concerns raised:


                  *    Occupational health and safety needed to be  in  line
                    with the mining sector, which gave employees the  right
                    to refuse to work in a dangerous environment.


                  *    The Labour  Relations  Act  was  silent  about  child
                    labour procedures; it only provided information.


                  *    Due to slow  processing  of  applications  after  the
                    lodging  of  a  child  labour  complaint,  farmers  hid
                    children during inspections.


                  *    The restructuring process and the budget  had  to  be
                    tackled simultaneously to  prevent  problems  with  the
                    distribution of resources.


                  *     Another  problem  was  that  of  people  who,  while
                    receiving UIF payouts, did not  report  to  the  office
                    after having found employment.


                  *     Because  of   time   constraints   the   chairperson
                    suggested that questions be submitted to the provincial
                    office and returned to  Parliament  via  the  Committee
                    Secretary.


              (d) Meeting with organised labour


                  *    NACTU  said  the  integration  in  most  institutions
                    (CCMA's ruling) did not affect the  Department  because
                    it was applied differently.


                  *     Staff  lacked  sufficient   information   from   the
                    Department, and training was needed.


                  *    Six specialists in  occupational  health  and  safety
                    were needed to improve conditions in the Department, as
                    this was identified as a national problem.


                  *     FEDUSA  mentioned  that  the  aim  of   the   Labour
                    Relations Act was is to  settle  matters  quickly,  but
                    cases showed that the  Constitution  lacked  precedence
                    and adjudication.


                  *    Section 145 of the Act did not stipulate  time-frames
                    within  which  a  case  would  end.   Employers   could
                    manipulate the process and drag the case to the  labour
                    court, which would then become costly for the employee.


                  *     Exclusion  of  public  servants  from  the  UIF  was
                    unfair. Everyone needed to enjoy security and benefits.


                  *    The fishing industry  requested  regular  inspections
                    for employers who did  not  comply  with  the  relevant
                    legislation.


                  *    The Department needed  to  play  a  visible  role  in
                    terms of inspections in order to address the  needs  of
                    fishermen.


                  *    Fishermen were severly exploited  since  they  worked
                    on commission. People with 30 years' experience in this
                    industry had nothing to fall back on since there was no
                    pension schemes.


                  *    They were not covered  under  the  legislation.  They
                    did not have protective clothing,  and  hours  of  work
                    were not stipulated anywhere.


                  *    SASBO mentioned that payment of UIF cheques took  too
                    long.


                  *    They felt that complaints referred to the  Department
                    took too long to be responded to  and,  when  responded
                    to, the response would not address what was requested.


         10. Recommendations


              (a) With regard to CCMA cases, the Department needs to put  in
                  place a system that will enable it to screen cases  before
                  they get to  the  CCMA,  and  to  select  those  that  the
                  Department can deal with immediately.


              (b) SASBO suggested that if the Department lacked the transfer
                  of skills for its staff members, it should outsource  some
                  of the work to companies with capacity.


         11. Findings


                  *    The layout of the office building was  not  conducive
                    to all the services offered, as clients  have  to  move
                    from one room to another for different services.


                  *    On the system of inspection, a team of six  to  seven
                    inspectors dealt with a case until its  completion  and
                    was given one week in the office and one  week  in  the
                    field. The system showed a high rate of  success  since
                    all team members were accountable for the outcome of  a
                    case.


                  *    The backlog dropped to 42 cases  and  the  number  of
                    lost or missing files decreased.


                  *    The provincial office made use of pamphlets in  three
                    languages (English,  Xhosa  and  Afrikaans)  to  assist
                    clients  with  the  service  rendered   and   documents
                    required for processing.


                  *    In 2001 the number of cases fell to  2Â 300,  compared
                    to 3Â 000 in 2000. A fair  amount  of  duplication  took
                    place in the process, which caused delays.


         12. Further recommendations


                  *    The Mitchell's Plain labour centre and the  satellite
                    office require 18 staff members to  perform  adequately
                    and efficiently.


                  *    An integrated  computerised  system  is  required  to
                    enable the centre  to  revisit  programmes  related  to
                    cases.


                  *    More interaction is necessary between the  provincial
                    labour office and the Portfolio Committee on Labour  to
                    address issues related to the needs of the  centre,  in
                    order to render an efficient service to the public.


                  *     The  Department  needs  to  communicate   with   the
                    Department of Public Works so as to address the problem
                    of location of the centre.


                  *    The  Department  needs  to  test  the  suitable  area
                    identified against the community it is going to serve.
                  *    The director of the provincial office suggested  that
                    the national office handle enquiries, as  these  result
                    in long queues.
                  *    The Department  needs  to  draft  a  form  that  will
                    record a person's address and also state the number  of
                    people assisted in a day in the provincial office.


     L.  West Coast - Vredendal Labour Centre


         1.  Findings


              (a)  Posters  and  pamphlets  were  all  in   English,   while
                  Vredenburg is predominantly an Afrikaans community.


              (b) The centre had a front desk that dealt with enquiries.  If
                  the case was more  complicated,  it  was  referred  to  an
                  inspector at the centre.


              (c) The centre rendered the following services:
                  * Registration for employment


                  * Unemployment insurance benefits


                  * Registration of training projects.
              (d) The centre closed for business at 15:00 and staff finished
                  administrative duties at  16:15.  Each  staff  member  was
                  responsible for dealing  with  clients  application  forms
                  and  cases  until  finalised  and  was  held  responsible,
                  should documentation go missing.


              (e) This centre began  advocacy  work  for  clients,  employer
                  organisations and unions.


              (f) An Employment Services Practitioner (ESP) was situated  at
                  the centre to deal with training and requests for jobs.


              (g) The delegation suggested that the  Department  and  Public
                  Works work together on job creation projects.
              (h) There were 189 vacant posts - 54 them were  funded,  while
                  others were still frozen. This severely  affected  service
                  delivery in the province.


              (i) The province had 12 labour  centres  with  five  satellite
                  offices.


              (j) A labour centre forum was established to discuss and share
                  experiences  about  problems  and  challenges  faced  with
                  other centres.


              (k) A 100% verification target in respect of all  applications
                  was set for all labour centres regarding applications  for
                  unemployment insurance benefits.


              (l) The province established  an  Accommodation  Committee  to
                  look at adequate venues for labour centres  and  satellite
                  offices.


         2.  Challenges


              (a) Budgets at labour centre level were severely  hampered  by
                  the use of vehicles belonging to Imperial  Fleet  Services
                  (IFS).


              (b) The Department signed a contract with IFS and the province
                  paid R4Â 800 per month  for  the  use  of  their  vehicles,
                  excluding petrol.


              (c) An interim measure, whereby clients had to  produce  their
                  last  six  payslips   before   their   applications   were
                  approved, caused problems for them.


         3.  Kaffeskuitjie Farm


              The delegation undertook an inspection of the farm.


         4.  Meeting with stakeholders


              The following concerns were raised:


              (a) The Department needed to market its  services,  especially
                  those around training for the unemployed.


              (b)  The  community  and  the  Department,  along  with  other
                  government departments, needed to  establish  a  forum  to
                  discuss issues of mutual interest.


              (c) Labour inspections should be visible in the area.


              (d) Information sessions should include the vulnerable  worker
                  sector, farmworkers and fishing industry workers.


              (e) Training on how to  tender  should  be  held  as  soon  as
                  possible between  entrepreneurs  and  the  Departments  of
                  Trade and Industry and of Labour.


         5.  Saldanha - garment-making project


              (a) This project was sponsored by the  Department  -  a  joint
                  venture with the local business development centre.


              (b) The Committee visited the site where trainees were  making
                  dresses, shirts and trousers.


              (c) The aim of the project was to  assist  trainees  to  start
                  their own businesses.


     M.  Northern Province


         1.  Lebowakgomo labour centre - findings


              *   The centre  was  located  at  the  Thabamoopo  Magisterial
                Complex, about 52 km south  of  the  Pietersburg  provincial
                office.


              *   Clients interviewed  came  to  the  centre  to  apply  for
                benefits, collect  payouts,  register  as  unemployed,  make
                general enquiries about services rendered by the department,
                etc.


              *   The delegation observed that there were beneficiaries  who
                had  not  received  payment,  although  they  had  submitted
                applications three months previously.
              *   Other clients indicated that cheques did not work well for
                them, as they had to travel to  Pietersburg,  which  is  far
                from the labour centre, to cash them.


              *   Most clients were in favour of cash as an alternative form
                of payment, especially those who received small amounts.


         2.  Findings


              (a) Presentation by Nkuzi Development Association (NDA)


                  *    Key issues raised:


                    - Extreme poverty areas
                    - Inhumane working conditions
                    - Wages range from R120 to R400 per month
                    - Evictions


                  *    The Soutpansberg  area  was  affected  by  immigrants
                    (legal and illegal) who earn low wages and whose rights
                    are not protected.


                  *     South  Africans  were  retrenched  in  numbers   and
                    replaced by Mozambiqans and Zimbabweans.


                  *    Regarding the phase-in/phase-out programme, about  10
                    000 non-South  Africans  are  employed  on  farms.  NDA
                    highlighted that if this number was  covered  by  South
                    Africans citizens, the province would not have  had  an
                    unemployment figure of 46%, where it stood at the time.


                  *     NDA  acknowledged  that  the  Department's  training
                    initiative assisted South African  citizens  to  access
                    employment opportunities.
                  *    There should be no pre-inspection appointments.


                  *    Farmers selected their own people to be interviewed.


                  *    A multi-disciplinary approach  was  needed  from  the
                    government.


                  *     The  Department  lacked   a   follow-up   mechanism,
                    especially on issues of child labour.


                  *     NDA  suggested  adoption  of  a   multi-disciplinary
                    approach on enforcement, to include:


                    - Department of Labour
                    - South African Police Service
                    - Prosecutors (Department of Justice)
                    - Social Services
                    - CCMA


                  *    NDA also suggested that a minimum wage be  introduced
                    for workers.


              (b) Presentations by organised labour (NACTU/COSATU)


                  *    Unions stated that  labour  inspectors  allowed  farm
                    management to choose people to be interviewed and never
                    made the effort to interview other  workers,  of  their
                    choice.


                  *    They indicated that pre-inspection appointments  gave
                    rise to situations where  practices  of  non-compliance
                    were easily swept under the carpet.


                  *    Organised labour recommended legislation to  do  away
                    with pre-inspection appointments.


                  *    NACTU and COSATU suggested  that  the  Department  be
                    represented at Tender Board sessions as  observers,  to
                    signal  to  and  advise  commissioners  during   tender
                    awards.


                  *    NACTU indicated that tenders  were  awarded  to  non-
                    complying firms who continuously exploited workers.


              (c) Presentation by organised business - NOESA


                  *    The presentation focused  on  the  implementation  of
                    the Employment Equity Act and  the  Skills  Development
                    Act.


                  *    NOESA represented a wide  spectrum  -  500  employers
                    and 40 000 employees.  They  indicated  that  employers
                    approached the development and  implementation  of  the
                    Employment Equity Act with suspicion.


                  *    NOESA further  said  that  they  were  assisting  and
                    advising their corporate members  to  comply  with  all
                    labour legislation, including registration with the UIF
                    and the Compensation Fund.
                  *    NOESA said that almost all  employers  affiliated  to
                    them had  already  forwarded  their  employment  equity
                    plans.
                  *     There  was  a  lack  of  advocacy  on   the   Skills
                    Development Act and the Skills Development Levies  Act,
                    that caused businesses to regard them  as  an  indirect
                    form of taxation.


                  *    The migration of employees to other provinces due  to
                    poor  economic  development  discouraged  employers  to
                    train their employees.


                  *     NOESA  appealed  for  learnership   programmes   and
                    visibility of SETAs in provinces.


              (d) Presentation by Northern Province Business Forum


                  *    The Forum fully supported the Skills Development  Act
                    initiative.


                  *    They suggested that exemptions be given to  employers
                    who employed more people, as they reduced unemployment.


                  *    They added that this request should not be seen as  a
                    permanent  measure,  but  as   a   way   of   resolving
                    unemployment.


              (e) Presentation by CCMA


                  The  CCMA  appreciated  the  efforts  of  the   Province's
                  Directorate:  Labour  to  continuously  engage   them   in
                  discussions on possible solutions to problems relating  to
                  service delivery.


              (f) Discussions on skills development


                  *    Skills providers needed to be  given  an  opportunity
                    of training at a higher level.


                  *     SETAs   should   be   launched   in   provinces   to
                    continuously advise  and  support  both  providers  and
                    stakeholders.


                  *    The material produced for training should  reach  the
                    most vulnerable of all and must be user-friendly.


              (g) Discussion on inspection and enforcement


                  *     Pre-inspection  appointments  to  farms  should   be
                    reviewed.


                  *     Co-operation  with  other   government   departments
                    (Labour, Social Development, SAPS) should be embraced.


                  *    A multi-pronged skills  development  approach  should
                    be adopted by looking at the integration of  inspection
                    services.


                  *    In respect of labour  law  amendments,  there  was  a
                    need for mobile labour courts  to  ensure  that  awards
                    were enforced effectively.


                  *    During conciliation by  the  Department,  the  weaker
                    party needed to be given an opportunity to  be  advised
                    by the Department.


              (h) Processing unit


                  *    An automated clearing bureau  payment  method  needed
                    to  be  introduced  for  maternity,  illness,  adoption
                    benefits  and  payments  to  dependants   of   deceased
                    contributors.


                  *     An  Employee  Management   System   needed   to   be
                    introduced.


                  *     Section  38  benefits  (death)  took  longer  to  be
                    finalised.


                  *    The Unemployment Insurance  Board  should  determine,
                    when more than one wife claims benefits from a deceased
                    contributor, whether widows who  were  married  through
                    custom should receive the same recognition  as  legally
                    married widows.


                  *    On the death of both parents, the  office  tended  to
                    receive multiple applications for benefits,  which  all
                    looked  legitimate.  The   process   of   verification,
                    therefore, took longer  to  determine  which  candidate
                    qualified.

                  The officials indicated that they co-operated  fully  with
                  the Department and  experienced  no  major  problems  with
                  payouts.  They  indicated  that  beneficiaries   sometimes
                  reported later than the stipulated and agreed time.

         Interaction with staff on farm


         1. Workers indicated that they were  not  receiving  feedback  from
              labour  inspectors.  Inspectors  tended   to   interview   the
              management and the few workers chosen by management.
         2. Farmworkers' houses were in an appalling condition,  with  smoke
              all over the place. These houses did not  have  doors.  Adults
              and children slept in one room.

4.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Education  on  provincial  visits
     to Mpumalanga and Free State, dated 5 November 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Education reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         Two  multi-party  delegations  of  the   Committee   on   Education
         undertook provincial visits to Mpumalanga and Free  State  from  22
         to 24 July 2002 and to the SABC in Johannesburg on  25  July  2002,
         with the following mandates:


         1. Objectives of visits


              The  Committee  unanimously  agreed   that   two   multi-party
              delegations of five  members  each  undertake  the  visits  to
              schools, including farm schools in  Mpumalanga  and  the  Free
              State, to give focus attention to the following issues:


              (a) Mpumalanga and Free State


                  *    Early Childhood Development (ECD)


                  *    Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET)


                  *    Education for Learners with Special  Education  Needs
                    (ELSEN)


                  *    Further Education and Training (FET)


                  *    Governance in farm schools (School  Governing  Bodies
                    - SGBs)
                  *    Programmes on HIV/AIDS


                  *    Primary Nutrition Programme


              (b) SABC - Johannesburg


                  When SABC Education gave a briefing before  the  Committee
                  on 19 February 2002, Ms Y Kgame invited the  Committee  to
                  visit them to see how they:


                  *    Manage and deliver the SABC's educational mandate


                  *    Provide quality products  and  services,  distributed
                    through differentiated mediums


                  *    Prioritise the diverse  educational  needs  of  South
                    African   audiences,   and   become   an    educational
                    broadcasting partner and a resource throughout Africa.


         2. Delegations
              The multi-party delegation of 10  Committee  members,  divided
              into two groups to visit  the  provinces  simultaneously,  was

     B.     Mpumalanga


         1. Meeting with MEC for Education, Mr C N M Padayachee, on 21  July
              - official view


              The delegation was warmly welcomed  by  the  MEC  and  had  an
              informal meeting to discuss the following matters:


              (a) Learner Support Material (LSM)


                  The  Department's  budget  for  LSM  and  stationery   and
                  textbooks budget has increased by 100%. It  was  allocated
                  R136 million for 2002-03,  compared  to  R68  million  for
                  2001-02.


                  In 2001 all Grade 5 and 9  books  were  delivered  to  all
                  schools. According to  an  audit  conducted,  all  schools
                  received the LSM. Regular visits are made by the  MEC  and
                  his senior officials to verify that schools have  received
                  textbooks.


              (b) Infrastructure


                  In 2001-02 R83 million was spent  on  infrastructure,  and
                  the following was done throughout the province:


                  386 class-rooms, 42 special  rooms,  873  toilets  and  32
                  administration  blocks  were  built;   67   schools   were
                  renovated;  19  schools  were  fenced;  17  schools   were
                  provided with water;  13  schools  were  electrified;  and
                  flood-damaged schools  were  repaired  at  a  cost  of  R3
                  million.


                  Planning was done to  get  quantity  surveyors  and  other
                  people    in    on    the    ground    to    apply     for
                  tenders.Ã¿Approximately 428 class-rooms will be built.  The
                  Japanese Government will sponsor the building of  toilets,
                  special rooms and additional class-rooms. SAPPI will  also
                  build libraries with teacher resource materials.


                  At present there is a shortfall/backlog  of  4Â 000  class-
                  rooms  throughout  the  province.  Most  class-rooms   are
                  overcrowded; some schools are not  conducive  to  learning
                  and teaching, and need major repairs. There is  no  school
                  literally under the tree in the entire province.


              (c) Scholar transport


                  Learners still walk long distances  to  reach  school.  In
                  1994 transport was provided for 400 learners; in 2000  for
                  2Â 700; and in 2001 for 6Â 800. Now  the  number  of  routes
                  has increased from 48 to 102, covering 11 299 learners.


              (d) Teaching posts


                  There are 56 HOD posts to be filled. In 2001  2Â 700  posts
                  were created. 1Â 036 promotional posts need to be filled  -
                  if a teacher is promoted, the post  become  vacant.  There
                  are under-qualified educators in the system; they are  now
                  upgrading their qualification.


              (e) Computers


                  About 130 computers (software) have  been  donated  to  10
                  teacher centres and four  schools.  A  contract  has  been
                  signed with Microsoft to provide software  to  353  public
                  schools and training  centres  in  Mpumalanga.  They  will
                  supply the software as well as the hardware.


                  Training for educators has been done to  enhance  learning
                  and teaching. Computers  not  used  by  state  departments
                  will be upgraded for use in schools.


              (f) Teachers


                  Temporary educators who have in the system for two  years,
                  will be employed permanently.


              (g) Early Childhood Development


                  The conditional grants in 2001  were  not  sufficient.  R6
                  million was used for the introduction of Grade R  classes.
                  221 ECD tutors conducted intensive training.


              (h) School furniture


                  Due to insufficient funding over the past  two  years,  it
                  was difficult for the Department to deliver  furniture  to
                  schools. Furniture to the value of R5Â 275 517,66 has  been
                  procured.


              (i) Farm schools


                  There are 449  farm  schools  in  the  province,  and  112
                  contracts have been  signed  with  farmers.  Some  farmers
                  threaten to close the schools. There  are  no  toilets  in
                  these  schools;  water  and  sanitation   pose   a   major
                  challenge. At present, there is no proper sanitation.


                  Most learners in farm schools benefit from  the  nutrition
                  programme. The SGB handles all logistical arrangements  to
                  pay the person preparing food for the learners.


                  Every circuit  manager  must  visit  the  schools  once  a
                  month, and produce a report thereon to Head Office.


         2.  Visit to Silamba Senior Secondary School on 22 July -  official
              view by principal, Dr M E Mabena


              The school building consists of a brick structure with burglar-
              barred windows, and is properly fenced. Very few  windows  are
              broken.


              The school offers Grades 8 to 12, with 1Â 200 learners  and  35
              educators. To have a full  staff  complement,  they  need  one
              educator for languages and science.


              They are comfortable with the  class-rooms,  but  shortage  of
              furniture poses a serious problem.  Every  year  they  send  a
              requisition to the Department; they have neem waiting for  the
              furniture for more than two years.


              Initially the government did not send enough furniture and the
              quality was not good. More than 78 desks  have  been  repaired
              with the help of SGBs.


              Textbooks are not enough for learners and  educators  for  all
              grades. 80% of the learners do not have textbooks.


              According to departmental official Mr J Molai, there have been
              budgetary problems over the past four years - they have  spent
              R130  million  on  backlogs  and  R100  million   on   current
              deliveries. He  emphasised  that  schools  should  report  any
              oversupply of books so  that  these  can  be  taken  to  needy
              schools.


              Very little learner support materials were  delivered  to  the
              school, and the requisition  dates  back  to  July  2002.  The
              school only received 50 books which they  could  not  give  to
              learners.


              There is a lack of communication between the  school  and  the
              Department; sometimes they receive more, sometimes less,  than
              they have requisitioned for.


              There are Natural Science classes up to Grade  12;  one  class
              for Grade 10, 11 and 12, and one  educator.  According  to  Dr
              Mabena, it is an overload for one educator to teach all  these
              classes. There is  also  a  huge  shortage  of  chemicals  and
              facilities; water taps in the laboratory are not working.


              The condition of toilets constitutes a health hazard; most  of
              the toilet structures are very bad, and  they  are  always  in
              need of repairs. The school has insufficient funds to fix  and
              repair these.


              The educators are of the view  that  once  these  toilets  are
              built and completed by the constructors, the Department should
              come and supervise the work done.


              A Grade 12 pass rate of 33,9%  in  2001  was  not  very  good.
              Learners were without textbooks and a commitment to  do  their
              work; parents lack the  commitment  to  support  teachers  and
              supervise learners - these were major  reasons  for  the  poor
              Grade 12 results in 2001.


              The school sometimes gets feedback from  successful  Grade  12
              students studying at technikons and universities,  but  others
              disappear.


              In respect if lannguages, there are no textbooks for  learners
              to read and no English literature textbooks for Grade  11.  In
              Grade 12 there is a huge shortage. At present there  are  only
              30 copies for 94 learners.


              50 textbooks for 300 learners is seen a  recipe  for  failure.
              The suppliers sometimes send textbooks that do not tally  with
              the delivery note; they rush  to  schools  and  deliver  books
              without invoices.


              According to Mr Molai, if such instances do exist, it is  each
              school's  duty  to  check   on   it,   not   the   Department.
              Nevertheless, the Department will look into a better system of
              delivery of textbooks to schools in 2003.


              Not all educators were workshopped or trained in outcome-based
              education (OBE). OBE was introduced in Grade 8 in  2002;  only
              eight educators were trained.


              Parents do not want  to  support  teachers  to  supervise  the
              learners in their schoolwork and they also do not  participate
              in all school meetings and activities.


              The  school  needs  continuous  assessment  support  from  the
              Department to see how they are coping with their work.  Parent
              support  is  also  crucially  needed  at   the   school,   and
              councillors need to interact with the community  to  sensitise
              parents  to  participate  in   all   school   activities   and
              programmes.


         3. Visit to Makerana Primary School - official  view  by  Mrs  N  G
              Kgosana


              The majority of the class-rooms and the school  infrastructure
              consist of a brick  structure;  it  is  properly  fenced  with
              burglar bars on all doors  and  windows.  The  office  of  the
              principal is properly secured, with security gates inside  and
              outside.


              The school offers Grades R to 7,  with  760  learners  and  19
              educators, including the principal. Grade R was established in
              2002, with 38 learners and one educator.


              There is no shortage of educators. The two class-rooms are not
              enough to  accommodate  all  the  learners.  They  were  built
              through the efforts and initiative of parents  and  educators.
              Due to the shortage of four  class-rooms,  they  use  a  shack
              structure, which is also in a very bad state.


              All learners benefit from a nutrition programme.  There  being
              no resources at the school, the scheme is run  by  the  school
              committee outside the school, non-working  parents  doing  all
              the cooking. The stationery received, was not enough. No  LSMs
              were received in some learning  areas.  The  LSM  shortage  is
              follows:


              Grade 1 - reading books (IsiNdebele)
              Grade 2 - reading books (IsiNdebele); reading books  (Sepedi);
              numeracy learners book (My Clever)
              Grade 3 - reading books for English and Sepedi.


              No reading books for Grade 2 were received since the beginning
              of the year.


              Sanitation and toilets are in good working condition. There is
              not enough furniture for the class-rooms  and  for  educators,
              and no administration block. There is a shortage of desks  and
              chairs, and the furniture quality is very poor. The school has
              put in a requisition to the Department, but nothing  has  been
              received.


              The educators were trained in,  and  numerous  workshops  were
              held on, OBE. The school received all the OBE material.  There
              is  huge  participation  and  support  of  parents  in  school
              activities. Parents, the SGB and educators attend meetings  to
              discuss issues of concern about the school.


              As there are various learners from surrounding areas,  parents
              organise buses and pay for the transport  of  their  children.
              The principal deems it important that the  regional  directors
              and circuit managers monitor the delivery system of resources,
              e.g. LSM and stationery, before  books  are  received  at  the
              beginning of each year.


         4.  Visit  to  Hlonipha  Secondary  School  -  official   view   by
              principal, Mr M S Mabasa


              The school consists of a brick  and  tin  (shack)  structures.
              Some of the windows and doors are burglar-barred.  The  school
              offers Grades 8 to 12, with 795  learners  and  23  educators.
              According to the staff  complement,  there  are  vacancies  in
              respect of the post of school administrator, the HOD post  for
              commerce and two other HODs posts, as well  as  one  owing  to
              promotion. At present there are two acting HODs.


              As enrolment increased, a  need  arose  for  the  creation  of
              posts. In 2001 there was good dispatch of stationery  for  all
              Grades but nothing was received for Grade 8, 10, 11 this year.
              Only Grade 12 received LSM this year. The school has 12 class-
              rooms, including the staff room, and needs eight  more  class-
              rooms, including the administration  block.  Because  of  this
              shortage, they have erected four  additional  shack-structured
              class-rooms,  which  are  not  conducive  for   learning   and
              teaching. Grade 8 is accommodated in these  structures,  which
              are too packed and congested.  During  the  rainy  and  winter
              season, it becomes difficult for learners and educators to use
              these class-rooms. Therefore  the  school  needs  more  class-
              rooms.
              As the school will be phasing in OBE in  2003,  they  did  not
              requisite Grade 10 textbooks. As the school has  only  started
              with Grade 12 last year, it had a 43% pass rate then, but they
              expect an improvement this year. Parents support the school by
              talking to learners. Few Grade 12 learners  give  feedback  to
              the school about their progress in tertiary  institutions.  As
              there is not enough furniture, they take broken furniture from
              other schools and repair these for use.  Parents  also  assist
              the school in  identifying  schools  with  excess  and  broken
              furniture.


              Absenteeism is high on opening day at  the  beginning  of  the
              year; students do not come in numbers. There is also an impact
              on performance when learners have to go to initiation  school.
              School  property  is  vandalised  frequently.  Learners  break
              windows towards the end of the year when  they  receive  their
              end-of-year reports - anger  from  those  who  fail  leads  to
              vandalising of windows and damaging of property.
              Sanitation and toilets pose a serious  problem  and  a  health
              hazard to the school. Both learners and educators  share  four
              toilets. Since the inception of the school in 1994, no  proper
              toilet facilities have been  erected.  Proper  sanitation  and
              toilets are needed as a matter of urgency.


              For OBE, it is difficult to put Grade  7  learners  in  groups
              because each  class  has  about  64  learners.  For  Grade  9,
              educators are not properly trained. According to Mr Molai, the
              process has taken long to develop. The school has no computer,
              but they have tried to acquire  one  through  donations.  They
              bought a copy machine from the school fund.


         5. Visit to Mnyamana Primary School -  official  view  by  Ms  E  B
              Jiyane


              The  school  infrastructure  consists  of  brick   and   shack
              structures, with all windows and doors burglar-barred.  Not  a
              single window is broken. The school offers Grade R to 7,  with
              621 learners (xcluding  47  non-registered  pre-schoollearners
              not formally accommodated) and 16 educators. This  is  one  of
              the schools piloting Inclusive Education.


              There  is  a  shortage  of  educators  according  to   teacher
              development. Due to the shortage  of  four  class-rooms,  some
              operate in the shack structure. The school  has  not  received
              sufficient LSM, textbooks and OBE material. All educators  are
              trained in OBE. OBE materials  are  urgently  needed  for  all
              Grades.


              There is also a shortage of furniture and  no  proper  storage
              room for books. There are five toilets - two  for  girls,  one
              for boys and  two  for  staff  -  they  are  in  good  working
              condition. The school urgently needs ramps, toilets  and  four
              additional class-rooms.


              With regard to Inclusive Education, they involve learners  who
              need help. All the  educators  who  attend  the  workshop  for
              Inclusive Education, give feedback in the form of a report  to
              the school and implement their experiences in the class-room.


              The school admits learners with different problems, and  extra
              attention is given to them twice a week (14:00 to  15:00)  and
              during school holidays. At present there  is  one  learner  in
              Grade 1 who is deaf and dumb; there are also others  in  other
              Grades, and  educators  do  their  utmost  to  help  them.  An
              application has been sent to the Department  to  get  suitable
              facilities for learners in  wheel  chairs.  According  to  the
              principal, the Department had  responded  telephonically  that
              two toilets would be erected and that  other  equipment  meant
              for the disabled learners would be supplied to the school.


              There is no parental relationship with  and  support  for  the
              school. The school also  needs  continuous  support  from  the
              Department, especially from ELSEN officials - to guide them as
              a piloting school and  to  see  that  Inclusive  Education  is
              implemented in a proper manner.

              The school needs major renovations.  Since  its  inception  in
              1986, no renovations have been done.


         6.  Visit  to  Rematlatse  Primary  School  -  official   view   by
              principal, Ms N V Skosana


              This farm school was established in  1996,  and  the  MEC  has
              signed all the contracts with the  farmer  on  behalf  of  the
              school.  The  infrastructure  consists  of  brick  and   shack
              structures.


              The school has Grade R  to  6,  with  82  learners  and  three
              educators, including the principal. Grade R was introduced  to
              prepare learners for Grade 1 - they are  not  registered,  but
              recognised. School fees are R40, 00 per year, and  the  school
              negotiate with those parents who cannot afford it.


              According to post provisioning, two additional  educators  are
              needed at the school. As there are not enough  educators,  all
              the educators are trained  on  how  to  cope  with  multigrade
              classes. More educators are needed to  implement  OBE  in  the
              class-room situation.


              As the school has a transport and feeding  scheme,  attendance
              of learners is very good. All LSMs were received,  except  the
              languages. There are enough  class-rooms  to  accommodate  all
              learners. All that is needed, is  proper  fencing  and  toilet
              facilities. The pit toilets at present in use by both learners
              and educators are a health hazard. According to  Mr  Masombuka
              of the Department, schools  have  never  been  fenced  in  the
              surrounding areas, as there was no programme  to  fence  them.
              Parents are encouraged to view the programme as part of  their
              project.


              The school has no electricity, but when it was  built  cabling
              was done. Funding is needed to  fence  it  and  install  water
              tanks and electricity.  Although  the  school  operates  in  a
              farming community, no child labour has been reported. There is
              an  improvement  in  respect  of  parent   participation,   in
              attending meetings to discuss issues  pertaining  the  school.
              Workshops and training are  conducted  to  train  and  enhance
              skills for the SGB.


              There is no vandalism of school property; not a single  window
              is broken. The SAPS at Enkangala patrol the  school  at  night
              and during school holidays.


         7. Visit to Tetema Primary School - official view by principal,  Ms
              J M Mwenda


              This  farm  school  was  built  in  1996.  The  infrastructure
              consists of a brick structure with five class-rooms, with  all
              doors and windows burglar-barred. There is a telephone but  no
              electricity. The school offers Grade 1 to 7, with 166 learners
              and five educators.


              There are no proper toilet facilities;  the  present  ones  of
              corrugated iron are in poor condition and  are  used  by  both
              learners and educators. LSMs and OBE materials  were  received
              but were not enough. All educators are fully trained  in  OBE.
              There are shortages of furniture - desks, steel cupboards  and
              tables. SGB members assist  the  school  in  repairing  broken
              furniture.


              There are neither sporting facilities nor activities, although
              learners show interest on the  improvised  soccer  fields  and
              netball court. They compete with other farm  schools.  Parents
              are involved in the school nutrition programme. They are  very
              supportive of the school, but when asked for money,  they  are
              unable to give any because most of them are unemployed.


              The school urgently needs electricity, a computer,  water  and
              proper toilets  and  sanitation  facilities,  as  well  as  an
              administrative block. The toilets are a health hazard and  are
              still in use by educators and learners; no request was made to
              the Department for proper toilet facilities. According  to  Mr
              Mabena, there is a  need  for  a  specialist  to  inspect  the
              physical resources. The farmer only provide  water  tanks  and
              taps.


         8. Visit to Sitjhejiwe Senior Secondary School - official  view  by
              principal, Mr D A Dladla


              The school consists of a brick and shack structure,  with  all
              windows burglar-barred. The school offers Grades 8 to 12, with
              792 learners and 24 educators.  With  the  present  enrolment,
              there is no shortage of  educators.  Due  to  vandalism,  some
              class-rooms do not have electricity. They have a  shortage  of
              12 class-rooms, and use the  shack  structure  to  accommodate
              students. A requisition was made to the  Department  to  build
              more class-rooms, and it has promised to  honour  the  request
              soon.


              LSMs and stationery were delivered, but not enough of it.  The
              shortage is caused by increased enrolment.  Because  of  these
              shortages, parents who can afford  it,  buy  items  for  their
              children. Parents support the school in  all  its  activities;
              they  attend  meetings  when  they  are  called.  The   toilet
              facilities are in working condition but need to be  renovated.
              As enrolment grows, more toilets will be needed.


              All the educators attend workshops and  training  sessions  on
              OBE. There is a high failure rate in Grade  12:  1999  -  42%;
              2000 - 62%; 2001 - 49%. Most of the learners decided  to  drop
              out. The principal mentioned the reasons for the failure rate:


              (a) Overcrowding in class-rooms - this prevents educators from
                  attending to each learner


              (b) No dedication and effort from learners,  and  no  guidance
                  from the educator.


              There was no delivery of textbooks for Grade  9.  There  is  a
              laboratory, but it lacks equipment. The school offers a  range
              of subjects, like Economics, Accounting,  Business  Economics,
              Mathematics, Physical Science and Geography.


              Most  learners  live  in  informal  surrounding  areas.   They
              participate in sports (soccer, rugby  and  netball),  but  the
              facilities are not of a good standard. These  facilities  need
              major maintenance work, as in  their  present  condition  they
              hamper  learner  development.  The  school  excels  in   music
              competitions with other schools.


         9. Visit to Siyazama Primary School on 23 July - official  view  by
              principal, Mr J D Dlamini


              This farm school  was  built  in  1988.  The  school  building
              consists of a brick structure, which is properly fenced. There
              is no electricity, and not a  single  window  is  broken.  The
              school spent R600,00 from the school fund to  repair  all  the
              broken windows. Toilet facilities need major maintenance;  the
              flushing system is not up to standard.


              As a combined school it offers Grades 1 to 9, with 96 learners
              and four educators. Guided  by  the  post  establishment,  the
              school is supposed  to  have  three  educators.  Due  to  work
              overload, the educators were unable to cope with the number of
              learners at the  school,  so  Ms  Ngcobo  was  recruited  from
              another school to join as the foundation educator.


              No transport is provided for the learners.  They  travel  long
              distances (about 20 km every day)  to  and  from  the  school.
              According to the principal, all neighbouring farm  schools  do
              have transport. When they made enquiries  at  the  Department,
              they were told the map supplied by them to the Department  was
              too complicated for the officials to understand, and they were
              requested to submit a simpler map. They  are  now  awaiting  a
              response from the Department.


              According to Mr Zikhali, the circuit manager, the routes  were
              submitted  to  the  Department,  but  not  all  of  them  were
              approved. The region  is  now  attending  to  the  request  of
              providing transport to the school. The two neighbouring  farms
              schools have transport although it does not reach everyone.


              The school-feeding scheme is not reliable. It was supposed  to
              have started again on 22 July 2002, but nothing was  received.
              There are serious problems with this feeding scheme programme.
              Parents who assist to prepare food for the learners, have  not
              been paid for the past three months. It seems that  fraudulent
              activities took place during  the  process.  According  to  Mr
              Zikhali, this school faces such problems.


              The LSMs, OBE materials and textbooks were delivered, but  are
              not enough. OBE materials were never received for Grade 7. All
              educators attend workshops on OBE.  The  SGB  attend  training
              sessions to provide them with  skills  to  handle  educational
              matters. For learning to be conducive, additional  class-rooms
              need to be built  as  a  matter  of  urgency.  There  is  good
              involvement between the school, the SGB and the community.


              Of serious concern is the physical structure,  scholar/learner
              transport, electricity  and  the  condition  of  the  toilets.
              According to Mr Dlamini, resources should first  be  given  to
              farm schools because of their geographical location.


         10.      Visit  to  Phumula  Primary  School  -  official  view  by
              principal, Mrs G Nkosi


              The infrastructure consists of  a  brick  structure,  with  no
              windows broken. Doors are burglar-barred, the place is  fenced
              and the grounds are well-maintained. The school offers  Grades
              1 to 4, with 1 215 learners and 33 educators. Grade R attached
              to the school is very limited (most of  these  are  community-
              based). Forms were issued  to  involve  structures  to  apply.
              Those who have submitted  applications,  have  been  receiving
              their subsidies.
              There is a shortage of six class-rooms. The old pre-fabricated
              structures that are used as class-rooms, need renovations  and
              repair. Toilet facilities are in proper working condition. The
              school experiences problems with regard to LSM: requisitioning
              is rushed; late delivery; and educators have to  choose  books
              from a catalogue. In many instances the  school  receives  the
              wrong materials, but because of their need, they end up  using
              the different series delivered.


              Textbooks  were  received,  but  for  Grade  4  they  are  not
              sufficient. For classes with 299 learners they  only  received
              96. There is  also  a  shortage  of  furniture.  All  the  OBE
              materials were received for all Grades  except  for  Grade  4.
              However, these do not cover all the learning areas.  Educators
              are trained in implementing OBE in the class-room. With regard
              to the feeding scheme, they receive all the necessary supplies
              on time.


              There is great parent involvement with  the  school.  As  they
              have more than 1Â 000 learners, parents are called  per  Grades
              to discuss school progress and problems.  The  school  fee  is
              R50,00 per annum.  There is  great  interest  in  sports  like
              soccer, netball, cricket and golf amongst  learners,  but  the
              sporting facilities are not of a good standard, and  there  is
              no equipment. Learners who participate in the go-go golf,  use
              tennis balls instead of golf balls.


              Parents have volunteered to clean up the school, and thus  the
              school needs funds to compensate them. Although the school has
              security staff working 14  hours  a  week,  more  security  is
              needed  to  work  over  week-ends  to  prevent  vandals   from
              destroying school property.


              A day-to-day contractor should visit the school to check  what
              needs  to  be  repaired  and  maintained.  According   to   Mr
              Mathebula, day-to-day maintenance  is  done  once  the  school
              reports  the  problems.  If  the  school  sees  the  need  for
              furniture to be repaired, they can use the school fund to  buy
              the necessary equipment to do the repairs, and  not  wait  for
              the Department.


              Mr J Molai is of the view that electrified schools  should  at
              least have one computer for  administrative  purposes,  should
              they meet certain requirements.


         11.      Visit  to  Ermelo  Primary  School  -  official  view   by
              principal, Mr J L Myburg


              This is a previous model C school, built in 1992  and  located
              in the town of Ermelo. It is a double-storey structure, highly
              secured and fenced, with well-maintained grounds.  The  school
              offers Grade R to 7, with 400  learners  (90%  black)  and  18
              educators.  Seven  educators'  salaries  are   paid   by   the
              government, and the rest by the SGB.


              They have received LSMs for Grades 4, 5 and 7,  and  textbooks
              for Grade 5. They have already bought textbooks to be used  in
              2003, and assist  two  other  farm  schools  (Vulingqondo  and
              Nooitgedacht) with  books.  There  is  no  government  feeding
              scheme, and no computers in the  class-rooms.  The  medium  of
              instruction is English.


              Learners  participate  in  various  sports,  like   athletics,
              cricket, volleyball  and  soccer,  and  compete  with  various
              schools  in  the  Ermelo  region.  The  parents  are  actively
              involved in school activities. Some of them  believe  this  is
              one of the best schools in the world. There are  five  parents
              serving in the SGB, three of them black and all of  them  very
              active. Parents are  very  participative  and  all  programmes
              within the school are  devised  in  such  a  manner  that  all
              parents get involved. Non-working parents assist  in  cleaning
              the school and maintaining the grounds on a regular basis. The
              school fund is R2 000 per year, payable over 10  months  (R200
              per month). The school needs extra educators, and an incentive
              for work done, according to Mr Myburg.
         12.     Visit to Masizakhe Secondary  School  -  official  view  by
              principal, Mr Shange


              Mr Shange mandated one of the staff members, Mr  H  A  Abbott,
              and the Chairperson of the SGB, Mr Z G Dhludhlu, to  introduce
              the staff and SGB members, as he did not know  some  of  them.
              The school consists of a brick  structure,  with  all  windows
              burglar-barred.


              There are 1 250 learners, with 45  educators.  There  are  not
              enough class-rooms, and they need urgent attention. LSMs,  OBE
              material and textbooks were received, but not enough. Numerous
              requests were made to  the  Department  on  behalf  of  senior
              classes, but the Department was always telling them that  they
              would not get books because the system was changing.


              Previously there was no  co-operation  between  educators  and
              parents; there were  very  serious  problems  with  the  scool
              management. At the time of our visit, educators, the  SGB  and
              parents have only been working together for a week  to  manage
              the school.


              According to Dr L H Mathunyane, Regional Director, there  were
              problems with the school management, and no co-operation  from
              educators and parents. The problem was more  than  five  years
              old. The school has been dysfunctional for quite a long time.


              The state of affairs was chaotic, and there was instability in
              the school. The principal was charged with misconduct, but  he
              won his  case.  A  task  team  was  established  and  met  all
              stakeholders to try and put a new management team together. As
              a result, the situation was normalised. An HOD  and  a  Deputy
              Principal were appointed. The new School Management Team (SMT)
              only started working on 16 July 2002. Plans have been made  by
              the new SMT and the SGB to solve all the  prevailing  problems
              in the school.


              According to the Regional Director, the  regional  office  has
              come up with a programme  for  all  dysfunctional  schools,  a
              programme to train principals and LRC, and to capacitate  SMTs
              and SGBs.


              The school was never  renovated.  The  building  needs  urgent
              repairs and renovations, and  there  is  also  a  shortage  of
              furniture.


              Grade 12 results were very poor, below 40% over the  last  two
              years (in 2000 - 25% and in 2001 - 35%).


              There is no transport - some learners  live  as  far  away  as
              Carolina and Hendrina - and they walk to and from school on  a
              daily basis. There was no requisition for transport  from  the
              Department.


              Vandalism of school property occurs regularly and is caused by
              learners themselves, emanating  from  non-cooperation  between
              parents, educators and learners.
         13.     Visit  to  Mkhomazi  Primary  School  -  official  view  by
              principal, Mrs D Mashaba


              This intermediate school was built in 1968, offers Grade 5  to
              7, and has 508 learners and 12  educators.  According  to  the
              staff complement, there is a shortage of two educators.  There
              is a shortage of furniture and  class-rooms.  Requisition  was
              made to the Department and they  promised  to  attend  to  the
              problem. The toilet facilities are not in good condition;  the
              system is very poor.


              There is good parent participation - every three  months  they
              meet with the SGB to decide on a date for a parent meeting for
              that quarter. Although the school fee is R30,00 per year, some
              parents cannot afford it.  All  the  LSMs,  OBE  material  and
              stationary were received on time.


              The Department of Health supplies food for schools. There  are
              serious problems with the feeding scheme; some schools have no
              utensils. All schools, including Mkhomazi, were  told  by  the
              Department of Health to buy other amenities to make  the  soup
              edible. They sometimes take money from the school fund to  buy
              coal, pots and amenities to cook for the learners.


              With regard to the above, Prof Mayatula will take  the  matter
              up with the Minister of Health.


              Parents volunteer to help clean the school  and  maintain  the
              grounds and fence. A budget is needed to renovate ceilings and
              for a proper fence around the school premises. Presently there
              is no security.


              The  school  also  needs  technical   materials   for   skills
              development  classes,  although  there   is   neither   skills
              development in OBE nor modernised teaching  aids  like  a  TV,
              projectors, a video recorder and a computer.


         14.     Visit to Zinikeleni Secondary School  -  official  view  by
              principal, Mr M A Mngomezulu


              The school is a double-storey structure,  burglar-barred;  the
              grounds are well maintained. It offers Grades 8 to 12, with  1
              650 learners and 50 educators, including the principal.  There
              is no shortage of educators.


              The school is overcrowded - it has only 28  class-rooms.  They
              also have a laboratory, which has no equipment.  Equipment  is
              borrowed from the  neighbouring  school  in  order  to  assist
              learners taking chemistry.


              Most toilet facilities are not working, and pipes are  leaking
              and in need of repairs. Regular burglaries result in  woodwork
              and home economics appliances being stolen. The administration
              block has been properly secured with a  security  system,  and
              burglar bars have  been  installed  to  prevent  vandals  from
              breaking in.


              LSMs and textbooks were received,  although  not  enough.  OBE
              materials and copies for educators were also received,  except
              those for Grade 8. All Grade 9 teachers were trained  in  OBE,
              and numerous workshops were held.


              The Department does not always pay the  municipality  for  the
              water and electricity on time. In most  instances,  these  are
              then disconnected,  making  it  difficult  for  educators  and
              learners to proceed with learning and teaching.


              Mainstream subjects offered are: Technical, Commerce,  Science
              and General, and the school excels academically and  in  sport
              and music.  There  is  good  participation  between  the  SGB,
              parents and educators. They  attend  meetings  when  they  are
              called and they participate well.


              Many learners still need transport. Most learners live as  far
              away as 20 km. Due  to  inadequate  transport,  most  hike  to
              school, which is deemed dangerous. The Department has approved
              only two routes. School fees are only  R80,00  per  year,  and
              parents co-operate by paying it.
              In 2000 the pass rate for Grade 12 was 69%, but in 2001 it was
              53%. The cause for this was deemed to be the  leaving  of  the
              old principal and the cutting off  of  water  and  electricity
              because of non-payment  for  these  services.  There  are  two
              security systems at the school - the  Department  employs  one
              day shift while the SGB employs one night shift.


              Absenteeism is due to ill health, suggered by  both  educators
              and learners. When young female learners  get  pregnant,  they
              return to school after six months and expect to write internal
              as well as external examinations. According to  Mr  Molai,  no
              student  can  be  barred  from  returning  to   school   after
              pregnancy.


              The school urgently needs furniture (desks and  cupboards),  a
              library, sporting  facilities,  a  playground,  textbooks  for
              Grade 8 life orientation and arts  and  culture,  and  scholar
              transport.


         15.     Visit to Crocodile Valley  Primary  School  on  24  July  -
              official view by principal, Mr J H Nkosi


              The learners performed traditional dancing and warmly welcomed
              the delegation. For the past four years,  this  combined  farm
              school made of bricks  has  been  attached  to  the  Crocodile
              Estate, on a farm owned by Mr D  Solomon.  The  school  offers
              Grades  1  to  9,  with  184  learners  and  eight  educators,
              including the principal. However, due  to  decreasing  numbers
              caused by residents moving to other  areas,  they  will  start
              with Grades 1 to 7 next year. The  owner  insisted  that  they
              should close Grades 8 and 9.


              The owner of the farm does not want learners from outside  the
              farm  to  attend  the  school.  According  to  the  principal,
              however, to retain the student enrolment the  owner  needs  to
              allow learners from other areas  to  attend  the  school.  All
              learners registered at the school live on the farm; there  are
              no learners from other farms. There is  a  pre-school  nearby,
              but it is not registered and most of  the  educators  are  not
              qualified and registered with SACE.


              All LSMs, OBE material and stationery were received  on  time.
              Mr  Solomon  is  very  helpful  in  respect  of  the  school's
              activities and needs. When there is a shortage  of  textbooks,
              he buys them for the school. They have water, electricity  and
              proper sanitation and toilet facilities, but no computers  and
              no telephone.


              The government supplies maize, beans, soya beans  and  cooking
              oil to the school. The  farm  owner  also  provides  food  and
              cooking utensils. According to the principal, they receive the
              same food every day, and there is a need to change the menu on
              a daily basis. All the food is kept in a storage facility  and
              kitchen built by the owner.


              There is good working relationship with the parents. They  are
              very supportive and attend meetings when they are  called  and
              co-operate fully on discussions about the school. The learners
              also participate in sports like soccer, netball and athletics,
              as well as in cultural activities. The school needs furniture,
              renovations to the second block and 12 additional class-rooms.
              A requisition has been submitted to the Department.


         16.      Visit  to  Tekwane  Primary  School  -  official  view  by
              principal, Ms N D Maphanga


              The school consists of  a  brick  structure,  with  all  doors
              burglar-barred. It offers Grades 1 to 7, with 320 learners and
              eight educators, including the principal. There is no shortage
              of educators. There are not enough class-rooms, and  therefore
              the three classes are literally conducted  under  a  tree.  In
              rainy and very hot seasons, no teaching take  place.  Children
              learn when the weather is favourable.


              The land on which the school is built, used to be a farm,  but
              now it belongs to the Mpumalanga government,  who  has  bought
              it. As it is now a public school, no person shows interest  to
              the  school.  The  school  will  be  transferred  to  the  new
              settlement and a site has  been  identified  to  erect  a  new
              school building. According to the  principal,  the  Department
              needs to speed up this process.


              All the educators have  been  trained  in  OBE.  Grade  4  OBE
              materials were not  received.  LSMs  were  received,  but  not
              sufficient for Grade 6, and nothing for Grade 5. They  have  a
              feeding programme running Mondays to Fridays, but  the  supply
              is not enough for all learners to be fed.  The  Department  is
              still using the 1999 enrolment data. If there is  no  food  at
              home, learners come to school knowing that the school runs the
              feeding programme.


              Parents have bought  utensils  and  the  Department  pays  the
              helper. There is good working relationship between parents and
              learners.  Learners  are  very  disciplined.   There   is   no
              transport, and learners walk to school every day. The majority
              of learners live near the school. An application was  made  to
              the Department in 1999, but up to there has been no response.


              During the time of the visit, UK  volunteer  students  working
              for the Tenteleni Project were at the school. They  help  with
              sports, fundraising, the  feeding  scheme  and  HIV  and  life
              orientation programmes. They also render services  to  schools
              all over Mpumalanga during school holidays. This  year  43  of
              them are scattered throughout 18 primary schools.


         17.     Visit to  Tenteleni  Primary  School  -  official  view  by
              principal, Mrs G S Maseko


              The school consists of a brick structure,  which  is  burglar-
              barred and fenced. It offers Grades 1 to 7, with 1136 learners
              and 27 educators. According to  the  post  establishment,  the
              school needs  an  additional  educator.  There  is  a  serious
              problem of overcrowding and a class-room  shortage.  Presently
              there are 16 class-rooms on the main campus and  five  on  the
              satellite campus. They need 12 additional class-rooms, but the
              Department  will  only  provide  six.  As  a  result  of  this
              shortage, two store-rooms had  to  be  converted  into  class-
              rooms. Through fundraising, the SGB has managed to  build  two
              class-rooms. Overcrowding is caused by parents  preferring  to
              send their children to the school  because  of  the  level  of
              education and the school's reputation.


              Stationery was delivered and received on time last year.  LSMs
              were also delivered, but very  late.  OBE  materials  for  the
              foundation phase were received, but for the intermediate phase
              in Grades 4 and 6, nothing was received. A computer is used by
              the educators and SGB members. The school has  electricity  in
              the library and the computer room. There are  no  offices  for
              the principal and staff.


              The toilets are a health hazard, and due  to  an  increase  in
              student enrolment, the toilets are always in a state of repair
              and in need of renovating. Additional toilets should be  built
              to service the large numbers of learners and educators.  There
              is no feeding scheme programme for learners. According to  the
              principal, it is needed because there are learners who need to
              be fed. Aa application has been submitted to the Department to
              assist the school to feed hungry children.


              According to Mr Khoza, schools in the townships were  excluded
              from the programme - a decision of  the  provincial  nutrition
              committee. Parents from the townships were seen as better  off
              than those from rural  communities.  The  decision  was  being
              reviewed, because of those children in township schools who do
              need to be fed. A request was made to those schools to  submit
              applications and motivations.


              There is no transport. Some learners live far away and have to
              walk as far as 10 km every day. The Department runs  workshops
              on HIV/AIDS, as there is an urgent  need  to  educate  parents
              about the disease. According to the principal, the  Department
              should cluster schools to provide  counselling  to  educators.
              The disease causes a lot of absenteeism. Educators need to  be
              trained in counselling skills to deal with learners  who  lose
              parents because of HIV/AIDS. Educators need to  be  given  all
              the resources and necessary documents free of charge.


              Parents are very supportive of the  school  and  the  SMT  and
              participate in  all  school  activities.  The  Department  has
              workshopped them to define their roles and  duties.  There  is
              massive support and co-operation. The school fee is  R100  per
              year, but not all parents can afford to pay.


         18.     Visit to Lekazi Central High  School  -  official  view  by
              principal, Mr F J H Siboza


              The school consists of a  brick  structure,  and  is  properly
              fenced. As the central high school, they have Grades 8 to  12,
              with  1Â 160  learners  and  33  educators.  According  to  the
              principal, there are enough class-rooms and no  problems  with
              water and sanitation. Toilets do not function  well  and  need
              constant repair.
              The school used to be vandalised in the past, but due  to  the
              efforts  of  parents,  security   personnel   were   employed,
              unfortunately  on  insufficient  salaries.  Now  vandalism  is
              minimal. There is a computer, acquired  through  hardship  and
              efforts of parents. Streams of subjects offered are:  Science,
              General and Commerce. LSMs and stationery were  received,  but
              nothing for Grade 11. OBE materials were also not received for
              all Grades. Only Grade 12 textbooks were received; nothing for
              Grades 8 and 9.


              The Department subsidises water and electricity - no  pressure
              yet from the municipality about  monthly  accounts  not  being
              paid. The Grade 12 pass rate in 2000 was 78%, but in 2001 only
              67%. This was caused by the fact that the system of  half-year
              examination is different from one province to another. In this
              school, this is not taken very seriously. Another contributing
              factor is the lack of parental involvement with  the  learner.
              Also, learners not showing commitment is  seen  as  a  serious
              problem.


              All educators encourage learners towards more  commitment,  as
              the mission of the school is to produce learners who  will  be
              marketable in the outside world. The educators  are  qualified
              and happy with the present SMT and SGB. However, the SGB power
              is  seen  to  block  transformation  in  the  appointment   of
              educators (appointment is based on being a son of  the  soil).
              Training  of  the  SGB  is  not  sufficient,  not   with   the
              responsibilities it has to carry. When there are problems with
              student structures, meetings are held  to  discuss  and  solve
              those problems.


              Parents and educators agreed to a school fee of R100 per year.
              Although most learners are from poor families, there are  very
              few cases of parents who cannot afford to  pay  the  fee.  The
              principal needs computers for the school, even  though  it  is
              perceived to be  difficult  to  meet  this  requirement  as  a
              historically disadvantaged school. There is  office  furniture
              for educators, and no laboratory.


         19.     Visit to Lekazi Primary School -  official  view  by  HODs,
              Mrs N B Hlabangane and Mrs Z L Mhlanga


              During the visit to the school, the principal, Mrs Mabuse, was
              not present, as she was  attending  a  workshop  on  Inclusive
              Education/ELSEN in Badplaas, while the deputy principal was in
              a workshop in Pretoria.


              This is the school piloting inclusive education.  It  consists
              of a brick structure, with  all  doors  and  windows  burglar-
              barred. They have Grades R to 7, with 850  learners;  Grade  R
              has 20 educators. There is a serious shortage  of  class-rooms
              and furniture. As a result, a staff room  has  been  converted
              into a class-room.


              Presently, there is one learner in a  wheelchair.  The  toilet
              facilities are not suitable for this learner, and an  educator
              assists him everyday when he has to use  the  facilities.  The
              school is not accessible enough to accommodate  the  learners'
              requirements; more resources are needed. Educators are trained
              and then return to the school to train other educators.


              All the LSMs and OBE material were received and delivered last
              year, except those  for  Grade  6.  There  is  a  shortage  of
              stationery and textbooks. Parents assisted the school  to  buy
              textbooks for needy learners. All educators  are  OBE-trained.
              The school has a good relationship with parents. Although  the
              school fee is only R80  per  year,  unemployed  parents  still
              cannot afford to  pay.  As  this  is  a  township  school,  no
              nutrition/feeding  scheme  programme  is  provided   for   the
              learners.


              Most learners live as far as  10  km  away  from  the  school.
              Transport is not provided for  them.  Parents  pay  for  their
              transport. The school needs a media centre, additional  class-
              rooms, an administration block and one educator.
         20.     Visit to Khaliphani  Senior  Secondary  School  -  official
              view by principal, Mr B B Gwambe


              The school consists of  a  brick  structure,  with  doors  and
              windows properly burglar-barred. They offer Grades  8  to  12,
              with 907 learners and 24 educators.  According  to  the  staff
              formula, there is shortage of one educator. Because  of  this,
              the SGB saw the need to hire an educator, whose salary is paid
              by the parents. According to  the  circuit  manager,  Mr  S  S
              Khoza, the school needs three additional educators.


              There is water and electricity and no problems of  non-payment
              for these services by the Department.  Because  of  vandalism,
              plugs in most of the class-rooms have been damaged and are not
              working. There are two security guards employed at the school.
              Presently the school lacks the funding to keep on paying their
              salaries. The parents assist in this regard.


              The school fee is R80 per year.  For  those  parents  who  are
              unemployed, it is difficult to pay. LSMs,  OBE  materials  and
              stationery were received for all  Grades.  For  the  last  two
              years, there was poor performance in Grade 12,  theexamination
              success rate being below 30%. In 2001 the pass rate  was  only
              18%. A contributing factor, according  to  the  principal,  is
              poor deployment of good educators. There is also no commitment
              from the learners - only a few  attend  winter  school  during
              holidays (organised by the school).


              Discipline is part of  the  programme.  There  is  a  Students
              Representative Council (SRC), but the learners do not  respect
              them  in  the  class  situation,   only   during   extra-mural
              activities.  There  is  also  escalating  drug   abuse   among
              learners. The school needs additional staff,  a  well-equipped
              laboratory and a mid-year  examination  paper  for  the  whole
              circuit.

              This diagramme shows the  critical  shortage  of  class-rooms,
              toilets and furniture and the insufficient provision of  LSMs,
              OBE material and transport at most of the schools  visited  by
              the delegation.
              Of great concern was the apparent  ignorance  of  departmental
              officials of the state of affairs in  these  schools.  Schools
              were  crying  out  for  help,  without  any  assistance   from
              officials.


              On the last day of the visit, the delegation met the  MEC  and
              highlighted some of the issues, especially the health  hazards
              brought about by the lack of proper toilet facilities at  many
              schools. Some of the issues, for example, LSMs and  substitute
              teachers, have already been attended to.


     C.     Free State


         1. Meeting with MEC, Mr P Kganane, on 21 July -  official  view  on
              challenges facing Department


              (a) Farm schools


                  Most of the schools are farm schools, and  it  has  always
                  been a struggle for learners living on the  farms  to  get
                  access to quality education. They travel  long  distances,
                  sometimes under very harsh conditions, which  expose  them
                  to various forms of abuse. A a  number  of  learners  from
                  farm schools live alone, away from home, just to  be  near
                  the school. This exposes them to  all  sorts  of  societal
                  ills.


                  The Department took the initiative  to  establish  hostels
                  for these children's safety and also to enable them to  be
                  close to school. It also came up with the  alternative  of
                  offering transport for learners. Bicycles were offered  to
                  learners, as it is expensive to bus  learners  to  school.
                  The Department's goal is  to  establish  two  hostels  per
                  district by 2005.


                  Most educators teaching  in  farm  schools  are  not  from
                  those farms and have to travel long distances  to  school.
                  They  sometimes  arrive  late  and  knock  off  early   on
                  Thursdays. It is difficult to monitor them - most  of  the
                  schools are one-teacher schools.


              (b) Urban schools


                  Educators  performing  well  assist  those  that  do   not
                  perform well. The Department has  ensured  that  textbooks
                  are delivered on time and has a programme  to  acknowledge
                  district excellence.


              (c) Further Education and Training (FET)


                  The Department  disagreed  with  the  national  Department
                  when requested to appoint many FET Directors, as there  is
                  no budget or funds to remunerate them at  director  level.
                  Financing of FET  institutions  is  difficult  because  no
                  budget is allocated to  those  who  will  be  teaching  in
                  those institutions.


              (d) Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET)


                  Every town  has  at  least  one  ABET  institution.  First
                  preference in  employment  of  ABET  tutors  is  given  to
                  qualified unemployed educators. There is, however, a  high
                  rate of drop-outs in these institutions.  In  winter  most
                  students tend to attend irregularly and  end  up  dropping
                  out.


              (e) Education provision for learners  with  special  education
                  needs


                  This  issue  has  not  been  addressed  as  well  as   the
                  Department  would  have  liked.  Previously  disadvantaged
                  schools are not as  integrated  as  the  Department  would
                  have preferred.


              (f) HIV/AIDS


                  In 2002 the Department  held  a  conference  to  encourage
                  HIV/AIDS-positive educators to disclose  their  status  so
                  as to ensure that when they are absent  from  school,  the
                  principal is aware of their health  status  and  wiil  not
                  assume that they have absconded.


              (g) Letsema campaign


                  For the first four months of this year, there  was  a  lot
                  of activity around the Letsema  campaign.  Many  educators
                  volunteered for and participated  in  assisting  with  the
                  building of schools. Most of the participation took  place
                  during the winter holidays, as most of  the  schools  were
                  renovated during this campaign.


              (h) Capital expenditure


                  The Department has signed a performance contract with  the
                  Department  of  Public  Works  to  ensure  that  they  are
                  treated like any other service provider.


                  Challenges


                  *     It  is  difficult  for  the  Department  to  monitor
                    primary  school   performance,   unlike   high   school
                    performance, where matric results are used.


                  *    It is difficult to get CEOs who  think  beyond  being
                    school principals.


         2. Meeting with departmental officials on 22 July


              (a) EMIS


                  There are 2 355 schools in the Free State; -  60%  (1Â 380)
                  are farm schools, and 909 are independent  schools.  Seven
                  per cent of learners are  farm  school  learners.  Between
                  1998 and 1999, learner numbers in the  province  declined.
                  868 schools have fewer than 31 learners,  532  fewer  than
                  21 and 267 fewer than 15. In 2001, the  Department  signed
                  723 agreements; in 2002, 714 agreements were signed.


              (b) Percentage difference between 2001 and 2002 per grade


                  The number of learners decreased  by  3,3%.  However,  the
                  number of Grade 7 learners has increased  since  1994,  as
                  follows: 1994 - 71 000; 1996 - 96  080;  1997  -  88  837;
                  1998 - 79 578; 1999 - 70 132; 2000 - 62  256;  2001  -  55
                  364; 2002 - 44 805.


                  The educator/learner ratio in 1998 was 28:1;  in  2002  it
                  is 22:1.


              (c) Reasons for decline in number of learners


                  *    There has been a decline in the  birth  rate  in  the
                    province.


                  *    Over-age learners who fail Grade 12,  do  not  return
                    to the mainstream schooling system.


                  *    There are fewer learners in the rural areas.
                  *    HIV/AIDS and other related illnesses.


                  *    Decline in mining practices in Free State.


                  The Department planned for farm schools to  link  up  with
                  mother schools. Farm school learners now use schools  with
                  hostels that are not full.


              (d) Antenatal clinic attendance


                  There is a 27% infection rate. The learner mortality  rate
                  in 2001 was as follows:


                  Male illness - 127
                  Female illness - 201
                  Male accident - 95
                  Female accident - 45
                  Male suicide - 15
                  Female suicide - 9
                  Male violence homocide - 23
                  Female violence homocide - 7


              (e) Orphans


                  The total number of schools with orphans is  1Â 072.  There
                  are about  21  219  orphan  learners  in  schools  in  the
                  province.


         3. Life skills and HIV/AIDS education  programme  for  primary  and
              secondary schools


              (a) Primary schools - objectives of Department


                  *    The Department is engaged in  raising  awareness  and
                    the level of knowledge of  HIV/AIDS  among  principals,
                    parents and community leaders so  as  to  establish  an
                    abling environment for  trained  educators  responsible
                    for facilitating the Life Skills and HIV/AIDS Education
                    Programme.


                  *    The Department aims to train educators of  Grades  4,
                    5, 6 and 7, who constitute 40% of primary schools,  and
                    thus  ensure  curriculum  implementation  of  the  Life
                    Skills and HIV/AIDS Education Programme in those Grades
                    in all public primary schools.


              (b) Secondary schools - objectives of Department


                  *    To raise awareness and  the  level  of  knowledge  of
                    HIV/AIDS  among  principals,  parents   and   community
                    leaders, thus establishing an enabling environment  for
                    trained educators responsible for facilitating the Life
                    Skills and HIV/AIDS Education Programme.


                  *    To train Educators of Grades 8 and 9, who  constitute
                    40% of secondary schools.


                  *    To  ensure  curriculum  implementation  of  the  Life
                    Skills and HIV/AIDS Education Programme in Grades 8 and
                    9 in all public secondary schools.


              (c) Challenges faced by Department


                  *    Training manuals: A tender  for  the  duplication  of
                    learner materials was awarded fairly late and therefore
                    not all schools  received  all  learning  and  teaching
                    materials at the beginning of 2002. Material  was  made
                    available for distribution to the relevant  schools  in
                    March  and  all  schools  were  to  receive  the   full
                    complement of materials required.


                  *    The Department of Education  is  not  satisfied  with
                    the quality of service received and decided to consider
                    placing future orders  with  the  Government  Printers:
                    Regarding primary  schools,  Educator  Resource  Guide,
                    Grades 4 to 7  Educator  Manuals  and  Grades  4  to  7
                    Learner  Activity  Books   (English   and   Afrikaans);
                    regarding secondary schools, Grades 8  and  9  Educator
                    Manuals and Learner Guides.


                  *     The  nomination  of   officials   from   the   ELSEN
                    subdirectorate to other tasks instead  of  focusing  on
                    monitoring the Life Skills Programme  in  both  primary
                    and secondary schools is a major stumbling area.  These
                    officials are  expected  to  support  and  drive  other
                    projects and do not always have  the  time  to  conduct
                    support visits to schools that have received training.


                  *    Delays caused by the late transfer of funds  as  well
                    as a late  appointment  of  the  co-ordinator  impacted
                    negatively on planning of  the  training  of  educators
                    that should have been conducted in 2002.


                  *     Some  learners  do  not  have  birth   certificates,
                    especially orphans.


              (d) Successes


                  *     Educators  in  all  primary  and  secondary   public
                    schools  have  been  trained.  2Â 400   primary   school
                    educators  and  800  secondary  school  educators  were
                    trained.
                  *    Programme implementation has  started  in  more  than
                    60% of primary schools.


                  *    Invitations were extended  to  private  schools  -80%
                    accepted the offer and have been trained.


                  *     Seven  districts  held  successful  peer   education
                    seminars during school AIDS week.


                  *    A booklet containing questions and answers from  oral
                    sessions as well as resolutions taken at  the  HIV/AIDS
                    Learner Conference in  April  2001  was  published  and
                    distributed to all secondary schools.


                  *    An Educator Conference, "Beyond Advocacy",  was  held
                    in March 2002.


                  *    The Free State Department  of  Education  would  have
                    completed  all  proposed  activities  set  out  in  the
                    Business Plans for 2000-01 and 2001-02 by end of  March
                    2002.


              (e) Further challenges


                  The  Department  does  not  have   adequate   funding   to
                  translate learner material into all languages.


                  ABET


                  According to Census 1996 Statistics,  14,1%  of  the  Free
                  State population  is  illiterate.  The  solution  to  this
                  problem is to build adult learning centres in  every  town
                  in the province.  The  Department  has  been  co-operating
                  with   the   Departments   of   Social   Development,   of
                  Correctional Services and of Justice as well as  the  SAPS
                  to address illiteracy.


                  It has also engaged in strategies to fight  illiteracy  by
                  establishing   the   South   African   National   Literacy
                  Initiative  (SANLI)  and  the  Ikhwelo  Project   (poverty
                  relief  initiative).  SANLI  co-ordinates   the   national
                  literacy campaign and the  Ikhwelo  Project  will  enhance
                  ABET provisioning. The Ikhwelo Project  will  be  launched
                  at six ABET centres and will  ensure  that  educators  are
                  paid on a monthly contract basis.


                  All ABET institutions have principals and SGBs.


                  The private sector does provide ABET in the workplace  and
                  the Department encourages them by  sharing  its  expertise
                  with  them.  Departmental  officials  often   visit   ABET
                  centres to assess  and  monitor  whether  they  offer  the
                  training frequently.


                  Educators access their salaries electronically, but  there
                  are delays in payment, as they have to submit  proof  that
                  they have taught in these centres before  they  get  paid.
                  This could be rectified by improving the system,  but  the
                  Department is struggling to address this.


                  Educators travel long distances  to  ABET  centres,  which
                  makes it difficult for them to attend classes  frequently.
                  This result in learners dropping out.


         4. Education for learners with special education needs


              (a) Primary School Nutrition Programme (PSNP)


                  Background


                  In a meeting held on 29 August  2001,  the  Department  of
                  Health made a presentation to  senior  management  of  the
                  Department of Education.  They  decided  to  have  a  PSNP
                  District  Management  Committee  to  facilitate  the   co-
                  management of the programme.


                  Procurement through a tender system  was  piloted  in  two
                  districts, Xhariep and Thabo Mofutsanyana, during 2001.


                  The programme is offered to 29 006  farm  school  learners
                  and 140 692 town school learners. There now  exist  tender
                  specifications  to  ensure  that  parents  assisting  with
                  distribution are remunerated.


                  Challenges


                  *    The criteria for targeting  schools  has  to  change.
                    The Department  has  proposed  that  provision  of  the
                    programme should be such that it caters  for  learners'
                    different needs.


                  *    Some schools do not inform the Department  about  the
                    poor quality of food they receive.


                  *     There  are  discrepancies  in  respect  of   learner
                    numbers between the Department's records and reality.


                  *    Some schools do not have proper storerooms for food.


                  *    Some educators eat the learners' food.


                  *    Some schools do not stamp invoices.


                  *    Some farm school educators are absent  when  food  is
                    delivered.


                  *    There is no proper monitoring of delivery and of  how
                    and when food is distributed.


                  The schools should include women  from  the  community  to
                  assist with the provisioning of food, and they  should  be
                  remunerated.


              (b) Early Childhood Development (ECD)


                  Focus area
                  The main focus of ECD is to put systems in place  for  the
                  implementation  of  Grade  R  as  a  compulsory  year   of
                  education. This entails many different facets, phases  and
                  consultations.


                  Implementation plans


                  It is envisaged that Grade R will be a compulsory year  of
                  schooling in the Free State by 2008. The Department  would
                  prefer the process to be completed by the end of 2006.


                  The  Department,  at  the  moment,  is  concentrating   on
                  including 285 community-based sites in the  public  school
                  system by the end of  2003.  These  sites  will  focus  on
                  bringing the service to the poor as well as  bringing  the
                  service closer to learners, especially those who  are  not
                  close to public schools. The next phase  will  be  putting
                  systems in place to enable all public schools  to  provide
                  for Grade R. Public schools are permitted to  offer  Grade
                  R at this stage, but they will  not  receive  any  funding
                  from the Department of Education. They are  not  permitted
                  to employ a departmentally-paid educator in  the  Grade  R
                  class as from January 2002.


                  Progress to date


                  160  of  the   285   community-based   sites   have   been
                  identified. They were selected  from  all  over  the  Free
                  State.  Farm  schools  are  catered  for  as  one  of  the
                  categories that  qualify  for  the  programme.  From  July
                  2002,  the  site  management  committee  will  receive   a
                  quarterly  subsidy  based  on  the  number  of   Grade   R
                  learners.  The  funding  is  there  to  pay  the  Grade  R
                  practitioner and  to  upgrade  the  Grade  R  facility.  A
                  further 125 sites will be identified during this year  and
                  they will receive funding from December 2002.


              (c) School governance in public schools  on  private  property
                  (farm schools)


                  Governance


                  There are about 552 farms schools with 29Â 006 learners  in
                  the Free State. Most farm schools are primary schools  and
                  have fewer than 300 learners. The  SGBs  consist  of  only
                  the principal and two parents.


              (d) Challenges faced by SGBs


                  *    Due to parents' low income, it is difficult to  raise
                    funds to develop schools.


                  *     Enrolment  is  never  stable  due  to  the  constant
                    migration of parents to towns/townships (and  back,  in
                    some cases).


                  *     Power  struggle  and  contesting  of  turf   between
                    parents (SGBs) and farm owners about who is  in  charge
                    of managing and governing farm schools.


                  *    Capacity building is hindered by:


                    -  The level of literacy of parents


                    -  Non-attendance of capacity-building workshops due to
                       long working hours  by  parents  as  farmworkers  and
                       failure to secure  leave/non-approval  to  attend  by
                       employers


                    -  SGBs  not  understanding  their  critical  role  and
                       functions  in  accordance  with  the  South   African
                       Schools Act.


              (e) Primary School Nutrition Programme (PSNP)


                  *    There  are  discrepancies  between  the  Department's
                    records and reality as to the number  of  children  who
                    are supposed to be beneficiaries.


                  *    The Department  has  not  received  reports  of  poor
                    quality of food received.


                  *     The  Department  has   not   received   reports   on
                    unhygienic preparation of food,


                  *    Some schools do not have adequate  storage  room  for
                    food received.


                  *     Reports  have  been  received  of  educators  eating
                    learners' food.


                  *    Some schools do not stamp the invoices when  food  is
                    delivered.


                  *    Sometimes educators are  not  present  when  food  is
                    delivered.


                  *     Personnel  assisting  with  food   preparation   are
                    sometimes not remunerated.


                  *    Criteria for targeting schools is not clear.


         5. Visit to Maboloka Primary School


              Establishment of school


              The school started at Strydom College and was housed there. It
              was a community school before it was registered  as  a  public
              school. The school is situated near an informal settlement and
              experiences vandalism and burglary.  No  security  guards  are
              employed to curb  these  crimes.  The  school  does  not  have
              adequate administration space to  accommodate  the  principal,
              HODs and staff.


              There are 880 learners and 26 staff members  -  24  educators,
              including the principal and four HODs, of whom one is a female
              and two are administration clerks. Except for  two  volunteers
              from the community, there are no cleaners in the  school.  The
              teacher/learner ratio is 1:40.


              Needs of school


              An alarm system needs to be installed to prevent burglaries.


              Vacant posts


              The school has had one post vacant since 1 June 2002.


              PSNP


              Nutrition is not offered in the  school;  it  was  stopped  in
              2000. Previously, an annual application  form  was  submitted,
              but in 2001, they were  informed  that  only  two  schools  in
              Bloemfontein would be catered for.


              Professional support by Department


              The last time subject advisers visited the school was in 2000,
              when the school requested them.


              School fees


              Most parents are unemployed and cannot afford  to  pay  school
              fees, which is R30 per year. Learners  are  not  discriminated
              against or punished for parents' inability to pay the fee.


              Corporal punishment


              The principal has  attended  a  workshop  on  alternatives  to
              corporal punishment, but has not cascaded this down.


              Corporal punishment is not  implemented  in  the  school,  and
              educators  feel  it  should  be  reinstated.   Educators   use
              alternative punishment such as after-school detention.


              HIV/AIDS


              The school has an HIV/AIDS  programme  and  an  HIV/AIDS  task
              team. Four  educators  have  attended  an  HIV/AIDS  workshop.
              Learners have been made aware of the virus through dramas  and
              puppet shows.  Debates  on  HIV/AIDS  take  place  with  other
              schools. No provision has been made  for  stand-in  educators,
              should one be infected and be unable to attend school.  It  is
              difficult for learners and educators to disclose their status.


              Twining of schools


              The school works with another farm school, S Eunice  Secondary
              School, which is well-resourced. It also works with  Botlehadi
              School - both engage  in  debates  on  OBE.  Botlehadi  offers
              computer training to the educators of Mabaloka Primary School.


              Initially the school was not aware of the  twining  programme,
              hence they did not initiate it.


              Educator discipline


              No problems are experienced with absenteeism, late-coming  and
              overall discipline of educators.


              Clustering of schools


              There  is  clustering  of  educators  from   both   previously
              advantaged and  disadvantaged  schools.  Educators  from  both
              sectors attend workshops and share information.


              Sharing of information


              Some schools are willing to offer learners training,  such  as
              computer training.


              OBE


              The  Department  does  not  offer   adequate   workshops   for
              educators, but educators are doing their best to learn.


              LSMs


              Stationery and books were received at the end of November 2001
              and  were  distributed  as  soon  as  school   reopened.   The
              stationery received was, however, not enough for all learners.
              Some learners have to sacrifice their stationery for  learners
              in other grades.


              Educators need good quality photocopying machines as presently
              the school has only one small photocopier.


              Disability


              Disabled children who want to register are referred to schools
              better equipped to cater for their special needs.


              Child abuse


              Educators do not engage in improper sexual relationships  with
              learners. Some learners have reported incidents of abuse  from
              family members. The Child Protection Unit  offers  support  by
              visiting affected learners and makeing  follow-ups  to  ensure
              that perpetrators are brought to book.


              Capacity-building programme for SGBs
              Only two workshops were held for SGBs in the past  year.  SGBs
              feel they need to be enabled to effectively govern schools.


              Training of educators as counsellors


              One educator has attended a course to  equip  her  to  counsel
              learners that have been abused.  Three  educators  attended  a
              special  remedial  workshop  but  they  feel  they  need  more
              training.


              Challenges


              Some parents are unemployed and cannot take responsibility for
              their children, e.g.  they  cannot  afford  school  books  not
              provided by the Department and school uniforms.


              There are orphan learners in the school, as well  as  children
              who were abandoned by their parents and who live in a place of
              safety. These children need to be  offered  parental  guidance
              and rehabilitation.


         6. Visit to Schreiners Claim Combined School - 23 July


              Background


              The school stands on a piece of land donated by Mr Hercules de
              Jager in 1988. Land was donated to the former manager, who was
              interested in building in the area. The school  was  built  in
              1988,  and  started  with  eight  educators,   including   the
              principal,  two  temporarily  deployed   educators   and   174
              learners.


              They  have  two  computers,  one  fax  machine,  two  overhead
              projectors  and  a  telephone  installed  by  the  Department.
              Amanziwethu Rand Water donated one computer and  one  overhead
              projector.


              The clerk and one teacher who are  computer-literate  use  the
              computers. The teacher will soon provide computer training for
              learners.


              The school has one HOD recently  appointed  from  outside.  He
              started on 22 July 2002. The school offers Grades 1 to 12.


              Grades 1 to 3 are clustered in one  class  with  22  learners;
              Grades 4 to 6 are clustered in one  class  with  27  learners;
              Grades 7 to 8 are clustered in one  class  with  55  learners;
              Grades 9 to 12 are in separate classes, with 70 learners.  The
              principal teaches Grades 8, 11 and 12.


              School fees


              Fees for Grades 1 to 6 are R35. The principal withhold  school
              reports of learners who  do  not  pay  school  fees,  as  some
              learners do not pay the school fees when in fact their parents
              had given them the money.


              Pass rate


              In 2001, the school had 12 learners in Grade 12, of whom  only
              four learners passed. Those who failed, could not  repeat  the
              grade as they were over age. The pass rate  for  Grade  12  in
              2001 was about 39,5%, in 2000 it was 40% and in 1999 50%.  The
              reason for the low pass rate in 2001 was  that  the  principal
              went on maternity leave. Another teacher was ill from July  to
              October 2001 and subsequently passed away.


              OBE


              OBE makes it difficult to teach multi-grade classes.


              Distances travelled


              The longest distance walked by learners to and from school  is
              34 km. Some learners use bicycles to travel to school but when
              there is snow they do not come as  it  becomes  difficult  for
              them to cycle.


              Six teachers live in the teachers' quarters, which are made of
              mud. Water is available from two water tanks.
              Playgrounds


              There are open playgrounds at the school, but  the  facilities
              are not adequate. Two  learners  of  the  school  are  in  the
              provincial netball team.


              The school has  an  outside  auditorium,  built  by  the  farm
              manager and used for concerts, cultural functions  and  parent
              meetings.


              The private sector has contributed towards the development  of
              the school infrastructure. It is very  difficult,  though,  to
              maintain the school  buildings,  because  of  parents'  income
              level and little or no  prospects  of  successful  fundraising
              opportunities.


              School hostel


              The self-catering school hostel accommodates 20 learners -  10
              girls and 10 boys.


              Stationery and books
              Books are normally received in the second month of  the  year.
              For 2001, stationery was received in  November  and  textbooks
              were received in February  2002.  The  school  does  not  have
              enough textbooks for Geography - two learners  have  to  share
              one textbook.


              Corporal punishment


              The school does not practise corporal punishment and  involves
              parents when disciplining learners.


              PSNP


              The school has a feeding scheme for learners; delivery  is  on
              Mondays and Wednesdays.


              SGB


              A meeting with SGBs is rarely scheduled,  as  there  are  some
              parents who work till late and far away.


              Workshops


              In 2001, educators and learners  attended  workshops,  but  in
              2002 the educators could not attend.


              Parent/school relations


              Meetings with parents are held every term,  but  most  parents
              are unable to make it as they work long hours.  The  principal
              still has to meet with parents' employers to request  them  to
              allow parents to attend school meetings.


              The school is in  a  good  condition,  and  there  are  public
              telephones and a library.


              Challenges


              (a) Late-coming of learners due to long distances they have to
                  travel.


              (b) Sometimes the woman who assist  with  the  preparation  of
                  food does not come to school  because  of  non-payment  or
                  late payment by the service provider.


              (c) The school needs water taps to be installed,  toilets  and
                  new educators' quarters.


              (d) From 2003, the new school manager does not want the hostel
                  to operate, because 30 of his sheep have been  stolen  and
                  slaughtered and he believes that boys from the hostel  did
                  it.


              (e) There was no written agreement between the former  manager
                  that donated the farm and the Department,  hence  the  new
                  manager is able to close the hostel.


         7. Visit to Bethlehem Comprehensive School


              Background


              The school started in  1986  as  a  primary  school  with  400
              learners. In 1989  it  moved  to  a  new  building,  with  900
              learners.


              The school has three Heads of Department and  one  vacant  HOD
              post, which has been advertised. At management level there are
              six males and one female.


              Vacant posts


              There are 37 educators. The school needs only 27 educators, so
              10 have to be redeployed.


              The school is in need of educators for  Woodwork,  Typing  and
              Accounting. The Woodwork post has been advertised.  Volunteers
              teach Typing and Accounting, and the Department pays them R300
              a month.


              Pass rate


              The  Grade  12  pass  rate  started  declining  in  1994   due
              deterioration of learner discipline: 1991 - 61%; 1993  -  50%;
              1994 - 34%; and 1995 - 30%.


              In 1996 the Congress of South  African  Students  (COSAS)  was
              engaged more in political  activities  than  concentrating  on
              their studies. In 2000 the school had  an  8%  pass  rate  and
              learners were engaged in  gangsterism,  but  this  was  curbed
              through the assistance of the police. In  2001  the  Grade  12
              pass rate was 24%.


              The school was meant to be a comprehensive school - there  was
              a lot of confusion as to what  it  was  intended  to  be.  All
              pupils were forced to take Mathematics, which also contributed
              to the high failure rate.


              Teachers


              Educators have been supplied with  SACE  documentation  on  an
              Educators' Code of Conduct  and  disciplinary  procedures  and
              policies, but this has not improved their commitment  to  work
              and has not eradicated late-coming and bunking of  classes.  A
              laissez faire attitude prevails among educators.


              PSNP


              There is no feeding scheme at the school.


              Orphans


              The  principal  has  not  consolidated  the  exact  number  of
              orphans, but there are more than four.  Social  workers  visit
              the school.


              Corporal punishment


              Corporal punishment is no longer used in the school. Educators
              punish learners by giving them manual work after school.


              SGB


              The SGB was democratically elected and is very active  in  the
              school. It has assisted in ensuring that  the  environment  is
              conducive for learning by installing new doors and a  gate  at
              the school. The Department was requested to install  an  alarm
              system to assist in curbing vandalism at the school.


              Parents have attended  five  days  of  training  on  financial
              management. A two-day workshop was  held  and  all  programmes
              were dealt with there.


              HIV/AIDS


              No-one  has  disclosed  their  status  in  the  school.   Both
              educators and learners have attended workshops and training on
              HIV/AIDS, and learners are taught about HIV/AIDS.  The  school
              has invited people who are HIV-positive to  talk  to  learners
              about their experiences.


              Absenteeism and late-coming


              According to the principal, the school is managing absenteeism
              well and mechanisms are in place to detect it. Some  educators
              gave a different view to the delegation.  According  to  them,
              some educators have arrived late on numerous occasions.


              Relations between educators and learners


              Parents are complaining about the relations between  educators
              and learners. For example, educators use abusive language when
              communicating with learners, and learners are  scared  to  ask
              for explanations and questions of clarity, as  educators  take
              offence when asked to explain something.


              Subject committees


              Subject committees do not exist in the school.


              School fees


              The school fee is R100, adopted by  the  SGBs  from  different
              schools in the area,  because  learners  started  demanding  a
              farewell function for Grade 12 learners. SGBs  are  scared  to
              raise the fees because if they do, it may result in a drop  in
              learner enrolment.


              Relations between school and community police forum (CPF)


              Educators are not part of the CPF.  The  school  has  its  own
              newly  established  security  committee,  which  consists   of
              educators.


              Challenges


              The  school  premises  is  situated  opposite  a  tavern.  The
              Department has recommended that the management should  have  a
              discussion with the tavern owner about the problems the school
              has, but up to now the principal has  not  yet  met  with  the
              owner.


              75% of learners do not live with their parents, and a lack  of
              parental  support  results  in  behavioural  and  disciplinary
              problems.


              Some educators are reluctant to teach learners, are often late
              for their classes and do  not  teach  learners  for  the  full
              duration of the class. Heads  of  Department  do  not  conduct
              regular class visits and some educators do not meet deadlines.


              Most learners need specialised stationery and study  material.
              A meeting with parents was organised by  the  school  to  urge
              them to buy support material for learners. Most parents cannot
              afford to buy their children stationery and study material.


              The SGB is not aware of its role and  the  powers  it  has  in
              assisting with the functioning of the school, and hence it  is
              not functioning properly.


              The management  operates  as  it  wishes.  It  does  not  meet
              regularly, only when there  is  a  crisis.  There  is  a  year
              programme with dates for meetings, but everything is not  done
              according to the programme.
              Educators are demotivated and not proud of the work  they  do.
              In staff meetings they do not air  their  views,  even  though
              they are not satisfied with how the school is managed.


              According to one educator,  some  educators  sometimes  arrive
              late at the school and behave and act as  they  please.  There
              are also educators who come to school under the  influence  of
              alcohol. Educators experience problems with regard to phase  3
              of OBE.


              The Department does not appoint  educators  immediately  after
              interviews have been conducted and a  suitable  candidate  has
              been recommended.


              The school is satisfied with the conduct  of  volunteers,  but
              requests  that  the  Department  accordingly  compensate  them
              properly.


              Resolutions taken and recommendations made  by  educators  are
              rarely implemented, and they feel it is a  waste  of  time  to
              participate in staff meetings.


              The SMT excludes educators from decision-making; decisions are
              forced upon educators. Some  educators  are  favoured  by  the
              principal, while others are harassed by him and are forced  to
              redo assignments or paper work already completed.


              Some subjects are not taught at the school as  there  are  not
              enough educators to teach them. Learners who have  failed  the
              previous year, are promoted the next year,  because  educators
              feel it was not their fault that a  certain  subject  had  not
              been taught due to  a  lack  of  educators.  This  results  in
              learners failing the next grade they are promoted to.


              Charges against an educator are dropped after six months;  six
              months are not sufficient to address a problem and to  consult
              relevant stakeholders.


              Some educators are not teaching in the medium  of  instruction
              (English), they teach in Sotho. Learners are  only  interested
              in practical  courses;  they  feel  that  Mathematics  is  not
              interesting and that they cannot apply  it  practically.  They
              are not interested in languages, as they feel these  will  not
              take them far.


              Learners find it difficult to deal with examination questions,
              as these are difficult compared with class tests.  This  shows
              that the standard of examinations is higher than the  standard
              set in class-rooms.


              The Department of Education, together with the  Department  of
              Safety and Security, should see  to  it  that  the  tavern  is
              closed. The Department has to provide study material  for  the
              pupils.


              Intervention is needed to address educators' demotivation.


         8. Visit to Hou Ann Combined School - 24 July
              Background


              The school was established in September 1969. Mr  CronjÃ©,  who
              was and still is the owner of the farm, was the first to  open
              a secondary school in the Free State. The  Department  and  Mr
              CronjÃ© have now signed a contract.


              The school has seven educators, a clerk and 205 learners.  The
              school offers Grades R to 10 and has seven class-rooms. Grades
              3 and 4 are combined. The  school  combined  two  Grades,  but
              intends to combine three Grades next year.


              School equipment


              The school has two photocopiers,  that  were  donated  by  the
              Department of Education. They also  have  a  telefax  and  one
              public phone. Typing is one of the  subjects  offered  at  the
              school. All Grade 10 learners have access to typewriters.


              Distance travelled
              The longest distance travelled  by  learners  is  40  km;  one
              educator travel 45 km to the school. This makes  it  difficult
              for learners who are behind to attend afternoon  classes.  The
              farm manager (owner)  assists  in  transporting  some  of  the
              learners to and from school (20 km).


              School building


              The farm owner  built  one  school  building,  and  it  has  a
              laboratory and a typing room. Although there  is  electricity,
              it is not yet  connected  in  the  laboratory.  There  are  no
              precautionary measures in respect of the typing room,  because
              the Department refused to approve the installation of  burglar
              bars.


              The school garden is not in a good condition, as  animals  are
              grazing in the yard. The school has not received furniture for
              the new block; old furniture is still used.


              HIV/AIDS


              The Department has offered courses and training on HIV/AIDS.


              Vacant posts


              Two posts need to be filled. The SMT consists of the principal
              and a Head of Department.


              PSNP


              The school  has  two  volunteers  who  prepare  food  for  the
              learners. They only receive light meals;  the  Department  has
              promised warm meals but has not yet fulfilled the promise.


              School toilets


              The toilets are in a good  condition  and  have  a  waterborne
              sewerage. There are three toilets  for  girls  and  three  for
              boys.


              The principal is of the view that the Department  still  needs
              to solve the transport problem.  The  Department  proposes  to
              demolish the old building, but the school  proposes  that  the
              building be renovated and utilised as an administration block.


              Mr CronjÃ© proposes  that  the  Department  take  into  account
              learners with skills such as art and woodwork, so  that  those
              who cannot make it through Grade 12, can develop basic  skills
              to contribute to South Africa's economy.


         9. Visit to Bultfontein HoÃ«rskool


              Background


              This is a former model  C  religious  school,  established  in
              1886. A new administration block was built in  1978.  In  2001
              parents decided to build a sports ground, as the stadium  that
              was used for sports had collapsed.


              There are 12 white educators, including  the  principal,  with
              302 learners. The SMT consists of the principal and two  HODs,
              all white males. 30% of the learners in the school are black.
              SGB


              The SGB has six members, all of them white.  Before  the  last
              elections in 2000 there was one black parent.


              To operate efficiently, the  school  requires  R800  000;  the
              Department allocated R20 000 to the school.


              School fees


              Learners pay R200 a month. The reason for  the  school's  high
              budget is OBE requirements. For example,  the  overnment  does
              not offer free books to the school. The school offers Grades R
              to 12, Afrikaans being the medium of instruction.


              Parent/school relations


              Black parents are involved in school  activities.  Most  black
              learners do not come from disadvantaged families, 30%  of  the
              white pupils come from disadvantaged families. The school does
              not offer a nutrition programme.


              Corporal punishment


              Corporal punishment is not applied, even though educators feel
              it is necessary to discipline learners who do not  listen  and
              that shouting at learners affects them mentally. The  document
              on alternatives to corporal punishment has not  been  sent  to
              the school.


              OBE


              Educators complain that OBE is time-consuming; it  takes  time
              for information and facts to be absorbed by learners. It  also
              takes a lot of educators' time to plan for these classes.


              Subject committees


              Educators  of  different  subjects  are  members  of   subject
              committees in different schools. They often  meet  with  other
              educators to discuss the content of the subjects they teach.


              LSM


              The school  has  no  computers  accessible  to  learners.  The
              computer programme at the school is outdated and learners  are
              not allowed to use those computers.


              School languages/medium of instruction


              The medium of instruction used in  the  school  is  Afrikaans;
              English is used in classes to assist black  learners  as  they
              have to write their examinations in English. Sotho  is  taught
              as a third language by a white educator for Grades 4 to 9.


              Pass rate


              In 2001 the pass rate was 90% - three  black  learners  failed
              and all white learners passed the Grade  12  examinations.  In
              2000, four black learners failed. The language barrier is  the
              reason for black learners' failure.  Learners  are  taught  in
              Afrikaans and have to write examinations in English.


              Six learners have competed in interprovincial athletics.  Only
              five Grade 12 learners are studying  Accounting  and  Physical
              Science.


         10.     Visit to Bonong Primary Farm School


              Establishment


              The school was established in 1987, and at the time had  three
              educators and 136 learners. Presently there  are  66  learners
              and three class-rooms.


              Grades are combined: Grades 1 to 3; Grades 4 to  6;  Grades  6
              and  7.  The  longest  distance  travelled  by  learners   and
              Educators is eight km. Food  is  sometimes  not  delivered  on
              time.


              Learners drop out of school for  various  reasons.  There  are
              adults who are prepared to learn but do  not  have  access  to
              ABET. The nearest school that provides ABET  is  about  25  km
              away from the farm.


              The school is not ready to offer the ECD programme as learners
              do not have access to it. The SGB is  functional  and  parents
              are involved in school activities. Parents have not attended a
              training course, only a two-day orientation course.


              There is no high school within a radius of  25  km;  a  school
              close by offers up  to  Grade  9.  This  results  in  learners
              dropping out as their parents cannot afford to  send  them  to
              schools far away. The school fee is R12 per year.  The  school
              has no  electricity,  no  telephone,  no  photocopier  and  no
              computer. LSM is received on time, before reopening of  school
              in January.


              The owner of the farm, Mr D Ferreira, has offered land to  the
              Department to build another school, because the land on  which
              the school is built, is not  condusive  for  proper  learning.
              Next to the school, the farmer has  planted  some  crops.  The
              Department is now unable to build another school because of  a
              lack of funds. There are however, two schools,  one  three  km
              and the other five km away.


              The farm owner prefers that one school for all grades be built
              next to Banong, as that area is central and can cater for  all
              the children who live in the area. The  delay  in  building  a
              central school will result in learners dropping out because of
              the long distances they have to travel.


              Clustering of schools


              Within the Banong District, there is another school  with  one
              class-room that is not being utilised.


              Challenges


              (a) The school building is not in a  good  condition.  It  has
                  structural defects and the walls are about to collapse.


              (b) There are no  water  taps  in  the  schoolyard.  Water  is
                  accessed from a borehole and is not always clean.


              (c)  The  school  has  only  two  pit  toilets,  which  cannot
                  adequately cater for everyone.


         11.     Visit to Sello Intermediate School - 24 July


              Mr Le Roux, the farm owner, also met with  the  delegation  at
              Bonong Primary School.


              Farmer grievances


              Farmers in the area are committed into ensuring  that  schools
              are built. Mr Le Roux has built the school at a cost  of  R180
              000 and proposes that agricultural courses be taught.


              (a) The Department does not inform the  farm  owner  when  new
                  educators are appointed.


              (b) Grades 8 and 9 did not write their June examinations  this
                  year.


              (c) Learners are forced to chop wood -  the  farmer  does  not
                  condone child labour.


              (d) The principal does not communicate  with  the  owner.  For
                  example, the water tap was broken but the farmer  was  not
                  informed, and the rubbish tank was  full  but  the  farmer
                  was not informed to drain it. When it was  drained,  there
                  were condoms found, and learners do not use condoms.


              (e) Parents in the SGB are not involved in the shortlisting of
                  candidates and in the school activities in general.


              (f) The educator  locks  the  toilets  and  learners  are  not
                  allowed to use them.


              (g) Inspectors do not visit the school, even when requested  -
                  the last time they did, was two years ago.


              (h) For the past three months, learners have not been taught.


              The Department should  inform  farmers  of  new  appointments,
              should ensure that  schools  built  are  utilised  and  should
              address issues affecting learners immediately.


         12.     Visit to Sekweng Combined School


              At Sekweng Combined School, the delegation met with  educators
              from both Sekweng Combined School and Hanover Combined School.


              Establishment


              The school was established in 1962, and was  moved  to  a  new
              site with five class-rooms in 2000. There  are  six  educators
              and 169 learners.


              Distance travelled


              The longest distance learners travel to school is 20 km.  Some
              learners travel to school by public transport; the  school  is
              8,5 km from town.


              School Nutrition Programme


              As regards the feeding scheme,  sometimes  delivery  does  not
              take place. The school would  prefer  to  manage  the  feeding
              scheme to ensure that learners are fed daily. The  parent  who
              has been assisting with  preparing  the  food,  is  no  longer
              willing to help, as she is sometimes not  reimbursed  for  her
              services.


              OBE


              Educators were offered 40 hours training  and  a  workshop  on
              OBE. The school does not have adequate resources for learners.
              For example, there is no library, and learners have to  go  to
              the town library. The town is 8,5 km from the  school,  so  by
              the time they arrive there, the library is closed.  There  are
              noy enough educators employed in the school;  those  that  are
              there, are struggling  to  teach  OBE.  Grades  6  and  7  are
              combined, and OBE is not taught in Grade 6.


              Drop-outs


              This  year  there  have  been  few  drop-outs,  but  they  are
              expecting more in the second semester.


              SGB


              The SGB is functional and has been  involved  in  shortlisting
              and interviewing of candidates.  Parents,  however,  have  not
              received any formal training from the Department.  A  workshop
              was arranged by the Department, but it  did  not  take  place.
              SMTs were not invited to the workshop. The school is going  to
              be involved  in  fundraising  projects,  among  other  through
              stokvels. Engen has promised to sponsor the school.
              After graduating from  the  school,  some  learners  enrol  in
              Bloemfontein High Schools  and  some  enrol  in  the  township
              school. Most of the learners who enrol in the township school,
              drop out.


              The farm owner does offer some assistance to the  school.  For
              example, he assists by mowing the grass in the schoolyard  and
              by supplying water. The Department has promised to supply  the
              school with water, but so far nothing has happened.


              LSM


              The Department has delivered LSM  for  the  foundation  grades
              once this year. For senior grades it has not been delivered.


              School fees


              School fees are R40 per year; some learners'  fees  are  still
              outstanding for 2001. Almost half the learners have  not  paid
              school fees. The Department has promised to build toilets, but
              so far has not.


              Challenges


              There is a lack of communication between the  school  and  the
              Department. For example, when  workshops  are  conducted,  the
              Department fail to inform the school.


         13.     Hanover Combined School - 24 July


              The school is about 30 km from town  and  was  established  30
              years ago. There are 14 educators and 365 learners. The school
              offers Grades 1 to 12.


              Distance travelled


              The longest distance travelled by learners is about 20 km.


              Corporal punishment


              Corporal punishment is  not  practised  in  the  school.  Most
              educators do not have a copy of the document  on  alternatives
              to corporal punishment.


              School Nutrition Programme


              There are parents who offer their services and who  assist  in
              preparing meals for learners. There are,  however,  delays  in
              their remuneration; the last payment they had received, was in
              April 2002. They are now reluctant to offer their services.


              OBE


              The school has no library and the one in  town  is  far  away,
              which makes it difficult, if not impossible, for  learners  to
              get access to  one.  Training  in  OBE  has  been  offered  to
              learners, even though it is not easy for them to practise.


              Pass rate
              The pass rate for Grade 12 has been decreasing over  the  past
              four years. In 1998 it was 75%, in 2000 17% and in  2001  13%.
              This is because of a lack of educators for  certain  subjects.
              Most of the educators who are trained for primary teaching end
              up  teaching  up  to  Grade  12.  Most  of  the  learners  are
              demotivated and do not see themselves  studying  further  than
              high school. They feel they cannot afford to study in tertiary
              institutions and are not informed of NSFAS.


              The school building is dilapidated and some class-rooms do not
              have roofs. The walls  have  holes  in  them,  in  which  bees
              sometimes build a hive. In summer the bees sting the learners,
              which makes it difficult for learners to concentrate.


     D.     Recommendations


         1. Mpumalanga


              (a)  The  Department  of   Education   should   delegate   the
                  appropriate functions and powers to the  district  offices
                  within the applicable legal framework  so  that  they  can
                  take full  responsibility,  thereby  promoting  governance
                  matters such as accountability,  transparency,  efficiency
                  and the flow of information.


              (b)  Communication  between  the  MEC's  Office  and  district
                  offices as well as between district  offices  and  schools
                  needs drastic improvement.


              (c) Farm schools need a special  dispensation  in  respect  of
                  post provisioning.


              (d) The  newly  established  inclusive  schools  need  special
                  attention,  especially  in  terms  of  ramps  and   toilet
                  facilities.


              (e) There is a need for a special programme to provide  toilet
                  facilities in most of the schools,  as  the  current  ones
                  constitute a health hazard.


              (f) The Department should supervise repair work which  it  has
                  commissioned,  given  the  shoddy  construction   of   the
                  flushing mechanisms of most toilets.


              (g) The distribution of LSMs, OBE  materials,  stationery  and
                  textbooks         needs         special         attention.
                  Procurement/provisioning processes  of  LSM  needs  to  be
                  tightened  up  so   that   financial   accountability   is
                  enhanced.


              (h) The programme of providing scholar transport needs  to  be
                  fast-tracked.


              (i) The provision of substitute teachers needs to be improved.


              (j) Reliance on parents to provide pots and other  necessities
                  for  the  provision  of  school  nutrition  needs  to   be
                  reviewed. The exclusion  of  townships  schools  from  the
                  programme also needs to be reviewed.


              (k) Greater emphasis urgently needs to be placed  on  HIV/AIDS
                  awareness,  in  the  form  of  workshops  and  counselling
                  programmes.


         2. Free State


              (a) The Department of Education should  liaise  with  relevant
                  departments  to  ensure  that  no  taverns  are  permitted
                  within a legally defined radius from schools.


              (b) The effectiveness of the PSNP should be closely  monitored
                  to ensure that targeted  learners  are  reached  and  that
                  mismanagement and corruption are curbed. As  part  of  the
                  government's    poverty    alleviation    strategy,    the
                  participation  of  women  groups  in  the  form   of   co-
                  operatives should be explored.


              (c) The Free State Education Department  should  intervene  in
                  the non-payment/delayed payment of  women  assisting  with
                  the provision of feeding scheme at schools.


              (d) The partnership and co-operation between farmers  and  the
                  Free  State  Education  Department  should   be   nurtured
                  through the creation of a unit to focus  on  liaison  with
                  farmers on a regular basis.


              (e) The Free State Education  Department  should  improve  its
                  communication with schools and  other  stakeholders,  e.g.
                  letters received should be promptly responded to.


              (f) The farm schools' clustering  hostel  model  of  education
                  provisioning, piloted in the  southern  districts,  should
                  be extended, where possible, as  it  eliminates  transport
                  problems,   late-coming,    multi-grade    teaching    and
                  transforms farm schools  into  well-resourced  centres  of
                  excellence.


              (g) The  clustering  of  schools  and  the  exploration  of  a
                  twinning  arrangement  should  be  considered  to   assist
                  schools  with  little  or  no   prospect   of   successful
                  fundraising opportunities.


              (h) To improve the monitoring and  evaluation  of  programmes,
                  circuit managers should visit schools on a  regular  basis
                  to give professional support and guidance.


              (i)  The  Department  should  consider  extending  performance
                  contracts to district  managers  in  order  to  hold  them
                  accountable  for  service  delivery  rendered  at  circuit
                  level.


              (j) The functionality of SGBs needs to be monitored to  ensure
                  that they perform the roles  and  functions  allocated  to
                  them in terms of the South African Schools Act.


              (k) The Free State Education Department should  give  priority
                  to the expansion of ABET to rural communities, as well  as
                  to the provision of ELSEN, its location and programmes.
              (l) Adequate resources need to be allocated to  eliminate  the
                  shortage of textbooks in schools.


              (m) The Free State Education Department  should  conclude  the
                  process of written agreements between it and farmers.


              (n) The redeployment process  should  be  finalised  to  bring
                  stability to schools. The Free State Education  Department
                  should  speed  up  the  appointment  of  educators   after
                  interview processes are concluded by SGBs.


              (o) The Free State Education Department should discourage  the
                  teaching   of   African   languages   by   inappropriately
                  qualified   white   educators   and   instead    encourage
                  integration  at  the   level   of   teaching   staff   and
                  governance.


              (p)  Learning  area  managers  should  ensure  that  heads  of
                  department  at  school  level   establish   and   maintain
                  functional   subject   committees   to   develop   subject
                  policies,   discuss   problematic   subject   areas    and
                  familiarise educators  with  curriculum  changes  and  the
                  exchange of ideas/teaching techniques/methods.


              (q) The MEC for Education should initiate a process to  review
                  the language policy at Bultfontein HoÃ«rskool to prevent  a
                  situation where black learners are taught in  English  and
                  are expected to write examination in Afrikaans,  resulting
                  in a high failure rate among these black learners.


              (r) The policy socument - Alternatives to Corporal  Punishment
                  -  should  be  widely  distributed  and  workshopped   for
                  educators.


              (s) The provision of water and sanitation at schools should be
                  prioritised.


              (t) The Free State Education Department should co-operate with
                  the Department of Labour and organised farmers  unions  to
                  eradicate child labour in farming communities.


              (u) Information on the National Student Financial  Aid  Scheme
                  should be provided to all secondary schools.


              (v) Information regarding the National Student  Financial  Aid
                  Scheme should be provided to all Secondary Schools.


              (w) The Free  State  Education  Department  should  discourage
                  clustered school fee determination, as each school  should
                  have its own school development plan.


              (x) The training model for SGBs should be reviewed, as two-day
                  crash courses are inadequate to empower  school  governors
                  to perform their functions.


              (y) SMTs should be empowered to implement an  Educators'  Code
                  of Conduct and disciplinary procedures and processes.
              (z)  Circuit  managers  should  develop  programmes  to  visit
                  schools  regularly  and  to  ensure  that   schools   have
                  management plans and that SMT meetings and staff  meetings
                  are held regularly.


              The implementation of OBE in multigrade classes  brings  about
              enormous difficulties and needs to be reviewed.


              The following are the issues for immediate  attention  by  the
              MEC for Education in the Free State:


              (i) Withholding of reports due to non-payment and  closure  of
                    hostel at Schreiners Claim.


              (ii)      Learners  forced  by  educators  to  chop  wood  and
                    allegation that learners have not been taught for three
                    months at Sello Intermediate School.


     E.     Conclusion
         The delegation has managed to attain  all  the  objectives  of  the
         visits,  but  was  only  able  to  visit  a  few  schools  in  both
         provinces.


         This Report will be debated in the House early in  2003,  and  both
         MECs for Education (of Mpumalanga and of the Free  State)  will  be
         called  to  appear  before  the  Committee  to  respond  to  issues
         reflected in the Report.


         The Minister will invite some invidual farmers,  to  be  identified
         by the Free State delegation in  consultation  with  the  MEC,  for
         commendation during the Education budget speech.

     Report to be considered.

5.    Report of the Portfolio  Committee  on  Education  on  Study  Tour  to
     Thailand, dated 5 November 2002:


     The Portfolio Committee on Education reports as follows:


     A.  Introduction


         At its meeting held on 12 March  2002,  the  Committee  unanimously
         agreed to visit Thailand and India. While making  preparations  for
         the trip, the Committee was informed by the  High  Commissioner  in
         India that it would not be advisable to visit India  at  the  time,
         due to prevailing tensions between Pakistan and India.


         A delegation from the Committee undertook a study tour to  Thailand
         from 29 June to 7 July 2002.  During  this  period,  the  education
         system in Thailand was in the process of transition.


         1.  Objectives of tour


              The Committee  agreed  that  a  multi-party  delegation  visit
              Thailand to learn more about:


              (a) Primary School Curriculum


              (b) Policies on literacy and their successful campaigns


              (c) Higher Education Policies


              (d) Non-Formal Education (NFE)


              (e) Thai Education Reforms (1996-2007).
         2.  Delegation


              The  multi-party  delegation,  under  the  leadership  of  the
              Chairperson,  Prof  S  M  Mayatula  (ANC),  included  Mr  S  D
              Montsitsi (ANC), Ms E Gandhi (ANC), Mr A M  Mpontshane  (IFP),
              Mr R S Ntuli (DP), Mr T A Abrahams (UDM) and Ms  N  C  Manjezi
              (Committee Secretary).


              An attempt was made to obtain a balanced view, with input from
              various sources, like officials of the Ministry of  Education,
              directors, school directors and teachers.


              On arrival on 30 June 2002 at Bangkok  International  Airport,
              the  delegation  was  warmly  welcomed  by  First  Secretaries
              (Political) Mr T Furter and Mr  X  L  Nofukuka  of  the  South
              African Embassy in Bangkok.


     B.  Education system in Thailand


         The earliest form of education in Thailand was established  in  the
         13th century, and the  Department  of  Education  became  a  fully-
         fledged Ministry of Education in 1892.  The  country  launched  its
         first education plan in  1898  and  adopted  the  6-3-3  system  of
         education, which consists of six years at primary  level,  followed
         by three  years  at  lower  secondary  and  three  years  at  upper
         secondary level, prior to tertiary level.


         From 1977, all efforts made  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  were
         focused on providing educational services as  a  way  to  a  better
         quality of life and a better society.


         Section 43 of the Thai  Constitution,  1997,  stipulates  that  all
         Thai  citizens  shall  enjoy  at  least  12  years'  free,  quality
         education, provided by the government. Learners and  families  take
         responsibility for other expenses related to education.


         The National Education Act,  1999,  extended  compulsory  education
         from six to nine  years.  Primary  education  has  been  compulsory
         since 1921. It is the country's goal  to  develop  education  in  a
         manner conducive to the development of the nation. This is in  line
         with the Eighth National Economic and Social Development Plan.


         Administrative structure of education


         The National Education Act provides  for  the  establishment  of  a
         system divided into formal and non-formal or lifelong education.


         Formal education


         It is categorised as basic  education  consisting  of  pre-primary,
         primary and  secondary  as  well  as  higher  education.  The  Thai
         government spends most of its education funds  on  pre-primary  and
         primary education. In the 1999-2000  financial  years,  expenditure
         for  pre-primary  and  primary  education  was  43%  of  the  total
         education budget. Expenditure for higher education was 57%.


         Primary school curricula focus on:


         *  Basic skills, which consist of Thai and Mathematics


         *  Life experiences,  which  deals  with  the  process  of  solving
           social and daily life problems, with an emphasis  on  scientific
           skills


         *  Character development, which  deals  with  activities  necessary
           for developing desirable values, attitudes and behaviour


         *  Work-oriented experiences,  which  focus  on  general  practical
           work experiences and basic knowledge for career preparation


         *   Special  experiences,  which  deal  with  activities  based  on
           learners' interests (provided in Grades 5 and 6).


         NFE


         It is provided for those who missed the opportunity  to  enroll  in
         formal education. There is no age restriction for learners in  this
         category, which enables learners to learn by  themselves  according
         to their interests, potential and readiness.


         Government departments dealing with education


         The Ministry of Education and the Office of National Education  are
         the agencies responsible for the provision  of  education  and  the
         formulation of education policy and planning, as well  as  for  the
         provision  of  pre-school,   primary   and   secondary   education,
         including vocational and technical education. There  are  currently
         about 15,7 million children, youths and adults  who  are  receiving
         educational  services  within  either  the  formal  or   non-formal
         systems.


         Agencies under jurisdiction of Ministry


         *  Office of the National Primary Education Commission


         *  Department of General Education


         *  Office of Private Education
         *  Department of Formal Education


         The major task of the National Education Commission is to  consider
         and propose to the  Cabinet  the  National  Education  Scheme,  the
         National Development Plan, policy  guidelines  and  recommendations
         for educational development. It is also responsible for  monitoring
         and evaluating the implementation of educational development  plans
         in accordance with the  National  Education  Scheme,  the  National
         Education Development Plan and government policies.


         Higher education


         The Ministry of  Higher  Education  is  responsible  for  providing
         tertiary  education  under  the  supervision  of  the  Ministry  of
         Education.


     C.  Visit to Thai Parliament - official view by  Prof  Dr  V  Srisaant,
         Chairperson:   Standing   Committee   on   Education,   House    of
         Representatives, and Committee Members


         The Chairperson warmly welcomed the delegation, and  the  Committee
         Expert, Mr C Phumiratana, gave an official view  on  the  following
         matters:


         1.  Background


              Thailand has had a constitutional  monarchy  since  1932.  The
              population is about 63 million, and the number of  females  is
              slightly more than the males.


         2.  Education system and learning process


              Educational provision is currently based on the  principle  of
              lifelong learning, with three types of education: formal, non-
              formal and informal. According to the National Education  Act,
              formal basic education is divided  into  two  levels  -  basic
              education and higher education. Basic education comprises pre-
              school education, primary education, lower secondary education
              and upper secondary education.


              (a) Pre-primary education
                  It is in the form of child care and readiness  development
                  in    physical,    psychological,    mental,    emotional,
                  personality and social aspects of children  between  three
                  and five years of age. It is organised in the form of day-
                  care centres.


                  The proportion of the three-to-five  age  group  increased
                  from 90,8% in 1997 to 95% in 1999. It was  estimated  that
                  more  of  this  group  will  have  access  to  pre-primary
                  education in 2001.


              (b) Primary education


                  It is compulsory for children between  six  and  11  years
                  old, and requires six years of study. The  enrolment  rate
                  for the six-to-eleven age group was  90,7%  in  1997,  and
                  increased to  101.2%  in  2000.  The  enrolment  ratio  at
                  primary level is more than 100% because of  repetition  as
                  well as under-age and over-age learners.


                  There are still children not enrolled in  primary  school,
                  particularly  those  living  in  remote  areas   and   the
                  handicapped. In 2001 it was projected that  99,6%  of  the
                  six-to-eleven age  group  would  have  access  to  primary
                  education.


              (c) Secondary education


                  It is divided into two parts: lower  secondary  education,
                  which enables children from 12 to  14  to  identity  their
                  needs and interests, to be aware  of  their  aptitude,  in
                  both general and  vocational  education,  and  to  develop
                  their  ability  for  work   and   occupational   practices
                  relevant to their age. Upper secondary education  aims  to
                  enable learners from 15 to 17 to acquire the basis  either
                  for going on  to  higher  education  or  for  working  and
                  pursuing  a  career  suitable  for  their  aptitude.  Each
                  requires three years of study.


                  Enrolment in secondary education has gradually risen  from
                  59,8% in 1997 to 68,2% in 2002. However, about 30% of  the
                  12-to-17 group still have difficulty in  participating  in
                  secondary education.


                  Although  greater  efforts  have  been  made  to  increase
                  participation in secondary education, the transition  rate
                  of students completing primary  education  and  proceeding
                  to lower secondary education  showed  a  slight  decrease,
                  from 90% in 1997 to 88%  in  2000;  it  was  estimated  to
                  remain the same in 2001.


                  In the vocational  stream,  in  particular,  there  was  a
                  significant decrease in the transition  rate,  from  41,4%
                  in 1997 to 32,5% in 1999, as  a  result  of  the  economic
                  crisis. It rose to 36% in 2000.


                  To enhance people participation, all schools  have  school
                  committees that play a vital  role  in  policy  guidelines
                  and are highly trained to do the job.


              (d) Higher education


                  It is divided into three  levels:  lower  than  bachelor's
                  degree level, bachelor's degree level and graduate level.


                  In 1998 and 1999 there were sharp decreases in the  number
                  of upper secondary graduates who continued studying  at  a
                  higher level.  However,  the  transition  rate  at  higher
                  education level rose to 89% in 2000; it was  projected  to
                  be 92,6% in 2001. However,  only  23,6%  of  the  18-to-21
                  group have access to formal education at this level.


                  At  present  there  are  24  public  universities  and  50
                  private  universities,  and  they  cover   programmes   in
                  Science,  Medicine,  Humanities,  etc,  from  bachelor  to
                  masters degrees.


                  Government universities  are  still  unsure  whether  they
                  will work on autonomy - a  decision  has  not  been  taken
                  yet.


                  Universities  enjoy  academic  freedom  under  control  of
                  university councils and have to  comply  with  all  higher
                  education policies. There is  a  central  committee  which
                  looks at planning and policy, chaired by the  Ministry  of
                  University Affairs.


                  They also have six  joint  programmes  with  international
                  universities in the UK  and  Australia,  as  there  is  no
                  international university operating in the country.


                  They have branches on  each  campus  doing  research,  and
                  this practical endeavour benefits the communities.


              (e) Vocational education


                  There are 413 vocational colleges throughout the  country;
                  40% of students undergo vocational education.  They  offer
                  upper secondary subjects, provided in two levels:


                  Educational progress


                  Since education is  seen  as  a  mechanism  of  instilling
                  democratic values  as  well  as  a  means  for  developing
                  productive and social capacity of  the  people,  increased
                  access  to  participation  in  all  types  of  educational
                  activities has been a major goal of the government.


              (f) Increasing educational attainment


                  Greater efforts  by  all  agencies  towards  expansion  of
                  educational services have resulted in a  higher  level  of
                  educational attainment. It  was  found  that  the  average
                  years of educational attainment of  Thai  people  aged  15
                  and over rose from 6,6 in 1996 to 7,1 in 1999.


                  However, total  student  enrolment  in  formal  education,
                  including graduate students, decreased from  14,4  million
                  in 1997 to 14,3 million in 1999, because of a  decline  in
                  the student intake due  to  the  impact  of  the  economic
                  crisis.  In   2000,   the   total   number   of   students
                  participating in formal schooling was about 14,2  million;
                  it was projected to be 14,1 million in 2001.


              (g) Participation of private sector


                  Among the total student enrolment in 2000, about 15%  were
                  in private  institutions.  The  private  sector  plays  an
                  important role in providing  greater  access  to  children
                  and youths, particularly at  vocational  upper  secondary,
                  higher and pre-primary education levels.


              (h) Participation in NFE


                  NFE has increasingly provided a second chance to  a  large
                  number of the out-of-school population. Starting with  the
                  first national campaign in  1938,  it  has  now  become  a
                  diversified  further  education  programme,   encompassing
                  general and vocational education.


                  In  1999,  the  total  number  of  participants   in   NFE
                  activities under the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE),  the
                  Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and the Ministry of  Labour
                  and Social Welfare was about 3,8 million. The majority  of
                  activities were provided by  the  MOE,  with  95%  of  the
                  total  participants.  Over  50%  of  the  activities  were
                  general education programmes provided  by  the  Department
                  of Non-Formal Education (DNFE) and the Office  of  Private
                  Education   Commission   (OPEC)   to   the   out-of-school
                  population.


              (i) Quality education


                  One of the most  important  measures  of  the  outcome  of
                  education is students' examination result. The  assessment
                  of  primary  school  students'  knowledge  in   the   Thai
                  language, English, Mathematics, Social  Studies,  Science,
                  Work-Oriented   Education,    Physical    Education    and
                  Management revealed that the quality of primary  education
                  was satisfactory in all subjects.


                  The achievement of lower secondary students in Grade 9  in
                  the Thai language, Thai writing, English and  Science  was
                  favourable,   most   students   meeting   the   assessment
                  criteria. The achievement of upper secondary  students  in
                  Grade 12 was rather unfavourable;  a  high  percentage  of
                  students had to improve their performance  in  nearly  all
                  the subjects.


              (j) Internal efficiency


                  Major indicators used to reflect  internal  efficiency  of
                  the educational system,  are  the  student-teacher  ratio,
                  retention rates and drop-out rates.
         2.  Progress of educational reform


              Following the promulgation of the National Education Act  (the
              Act), all agencies are required to do educational reform along
              the lines stipulated by that Act, which  include  eight  major
              areas:


              (a) Ensuring basic education for all


                  The Constitution and the Act  declare  that  at  least  12
                  years of basic education, with quality of service free  of
                  charge, will be provided equally to  all  Thai  people  by
                  October 2002. These include:


                  Action plan for basic education


                  The action plan for 12 years'  basic  education  has  been
                  formulated in line with policy guidelines approved by  the
                  Council of Ministers  since  March  1999.  Since  it  will
                  require  considerable  financial  resources,  the   fiscal
                  impact in providing basic  education  has  been  estimated
                  carefully and submitted to the Council  of  Ministers  for
                  approval.


                  Education for disabled, disadvantaged and gifted


                  Policy guidelines and strategies have been  formulated  to
                  provide educational services.


              (b) Reform of educational system


                  The educational  system  needs  improvement  to  meet  the
                  demands  of  a  knowledge-based   economy   and   on-going
                  economic  and  social  development.  To  enhance  people's
                  potential and competitiveness in the international  arena,
                  the reform of vocational education  and  training  and  of
                  higher education has been initiated.


                  Vocational education and training reform


                  Vocational education and  training  will  be  provided  in
                  accordance with the Vocational Education Act and  relevant
                  laws. This provision leads to the enactment of  a  special
                  law for vocational education and  training  (VET)  in  the
                  near future.


                  Higher education reform


                  Higher education is currently  the  responsibility  of  10
                  ministries and an independent agency. Key factors  driving
                  the reform of higher education in Thailand are:


                  *    An increase in the number of students


                  *    The demand of pursuing higher education


                  *    Advancement in information technology


                  *    Social expectations of  higher  education  as  a  key
                    instrument for capacity development of human resources


                  *    Mismatching of graduate profiles  and  labour  market
                    requirements


                  *    Budgetary limitations form the economic downturn.


                  Higher  education  reform  is  based  on  unified   policy
                  formulation and diversity of practice.


                  Reform of learning


                  Learning reform is at the heart of  education  reform,  is
                  aimed at providing  the  highest  benefits  for  all  Thai
                  people and is implemented through  various  efforts,  from
                  policy level to institutional or grass-roots level.


                  Recognition  and  reward  of  outstanding   teachers   and
                  administrators


                  This is an important strategy for promoting  reform.  Many
                  educational organisations have  made  significant  efforts
                  in selecting outstanding teachers based  on  the  criteria
                  of a student-centred approach, and rewarded then as  model
                  National Teachers, Master  Teachers,  Spearhead  Teachers,
                  Thai Wisdom Teachers and as model Administrators.


                  Reform of administrative structure


                  Administrative structure reform is based on the  principle
                  of unity in policy and diversity in implementing, as  well
                  as decentralisation of authority  to  educational  service
                  areas, educational institutions and  local  administration
                  organisations.


                  System of educational quality assurance


                  A new system of quality assurance has  to  be  established
                  by setting  up  the  Office  of  Education  Standards  and
                  Evaluation, and also developing a system of  internal  and
                  external evaluation. Every  educational  institution  must
                  receive the first round of external evaluation by 2005.


                  Enhancing quality of teaching profession


                  Improvement of teaching quality is central to  the  reform
                  of learning. The Act stipulates the development of  a  new
                  system for  management  of  teachers,  faculty  staff  and
                  educational   personnel   with   a   view    to    enhance
                  professionalism and quality of  the  teaching  profession.
                  This reform is composed of four subsystems:


                  *    Production system


                  *    Development and promotion  system  for  teachers  and
                    educational personnel


                  *    Professional control system


                  *    Personnel management system


                  One major movement in teaching profession  reform  is  the
                  introduction  of  teaching  profession  licences.  In  the
                  initial period,  there  will  be  two  types  of  teaching
                  licences:


                  -    Teaching licences for all  basic  education  teachers
                    and educational supervisors


                  -    Professional licences for  directors  of  educational
                    institutions and administrators of the Office  of  Area
                    Commission for Education.


                  All teachers should have professional  licences  to  raise
                  the professional  standard.  This  has  been  planned  for
                  529Â 000 teachers.


                  Assessment is required  for  licence  renewal  every  five
                  years.


                  Mobilisation of resources and investment for education
                  The  reform  proposal  include  demand-side   finance   of
                  education - financing will shift from providing  resources
                  through the supply-side (providers of  education)  to  the
                  demand-side (parents and students).  They  have  37  pilot
                  schools in nine provinces.


                  ICT for education


                  Technology is  a  crucial  way  of  improving  quality  of
                  teaching and learning, so major activities are  production
                  and refinement of educational media  and  the  development
                  of learners' and staff's ability  to  use  technology  for
                  education, research and development.


                  Some  arrangements   have   been   made   prior   to   the
                  implementation of the master plan, which covers:


                  *    Infrastructure and education network system


                    The National Education Network Project was approved  by
                    the Council of Ministers on 18 September 2001. It  aims
                    to distribute information technology equitably  to  all
                    educational institutions and to allow joint utilisation
                    of educational  information  resources,  with  the  co-
                    operation  of  Thailand's  Telephone  Organisation  and
                    Communication Authority.


                    It is expected that all educational  institutions  will
                    be provided with telephones by the fiscal year 2002.


                  *    Development of software, media and learning content


                    Teachers and faculty staff are  encouraged  to  produce
                    software for learner support. Educational  institutions
                    and learning centres will be supported  to  create  web
                    sites to exchange of knowledge and information.


                  *    Procurement of hardware, computers and equipment


                    Guidelines have been set with regard to two  aspects  -
                    computers and equipment used for teaching and learning;
                    computers  used  for  administration,  which  will   be
                    distributed in response to  the  needs  of  educational
                    institutions and the working systems of each agency.


                  *    Personnel development


                    The  MOE  will  provide  six  training  programmes  for
                    194Â 883 teachers and educational personnel  which  will
                    cover a wide range - basic computers and the  Internet,
                    network administration, advanced programme  application
                    and development of learning media.


              (c) Key success factors


                  In moving  towards  success  of  reform  along  the  lines
                  stipulated by the Act, the most effective strategies  are,
                  firstly,   building   partnerships   and   networks   and,
                  secondly, encouraging people participation.


                  Significant progress has been made since the enactment  of
                  the Act, particularly the reform of learning, which is  at
                  the heart of educational reform and can be implemented  at
                  all    levels.     Teachers,     learners,     educational
                  administrators and parents are urged  to  be  appreciative
                  of and involved in learning reform, based  on  a  learner-
                  centred approach, so that  learning  will  be  focused  on
                  real life.


         3. Budget


              The budget for educational activities is allocated to  schools
              and institutions according to their plans  and  policies.  The
              government creates moral competitive education, in  the  hands
              of the people.
              The budget is very limited; 70% is for salaries.


         4. University entrance


              The government would like to  abolish  the  national  entrance
              examination and come up with  a  different  assesment  system,
              because   most   universities   administering   the   national
              examination consider secondary school achievement  at  90%  in
              the examination. It was noted with great concern that all high
              school teachers are teaching  with  the  purpose  of  entering
              learners in the national examination, but the government needs
              to do away with this system and approach.


         5. HIV/AIDS


              There  are  successful  campaigns  in  schools  and   at   all
              universities in understanding the pandemic of HIV/AIDS. It  is
              not serious among students  and  learners,  but  is  with  the
              people at large.
     D.     Tour of Parliament


         After the meeting with the Standing  Committee  on  Education,  the
         delegation  was  given  an  opportunity  to  tour  Parliament   and
         attended a sitting of  the  House  of  Representatives,  where  the
         National Assembly was debating administrative reform.


         The delegation was also shown a  video  on  Parliament,  containing
         the following information:


         Thailand is a democracy with a constitutional monarchy.  The  power
         of government belongs to the people of the nation, as  approved  by
         the King, through the institutions of the  National  Assembly,  the
         Council  of  Ministers  and  the  Courts,  as  stipulated  by   the
         Constitution.


         National Assembly


         This   bicameral   institution   consists   of   the    House    of
         Representatives and the Senate.


         House of Representatives
         It has 500 members elected in one of two ways: 100 are  elected  on
         a party-list basis, and 400 are elected on  a  constituency  basis.

     E.     Visit to SA Embassy in Bangkok - official view by Mr T N Furter,
         Charge'd Affaires & First Secretary (Political)


         The delegation visited the South African Embassy  in  Bangkok,  and
         Mr Furter informally introduced all staff members  working  in  the
         Embassy.


         During the delegation's visit the Ambassador, Mrs B  M  Pheto,  was
         not present, as she was on holiday in  South  Africa.  Her  apology
         was acknowledged by the delegation.


     F.     Courtesy  call  on  Permanent  Secretary  for  Education,  Dr  C
         Shoolap, and senior officials of MOE  -  official  view  by  Mrs  K
         Pompreeya, Director: Policy and Planning


         Thailand has a land area of 513Â 115,02 square km and  a  population
         of 61,8 million people, 30,7 million being male  and  31,1  million
         female.


         Vision


         Thai people are fully developed to be  good,  skillful,  happy  and
         self-reliant citizens. They are  also  cultivated  to  realise  the
         importance of their national identity, to be moral and to be  aware
         of their culture as a good way of  life.  They  are  encouraged  to
         participate and build Thai society and the world  community  to  be
         happy and peaceful. They are promoted to create a learning  society
         with quality,  morality  and  unity  based  on  both  national  and
         international wisdom to support a knowledge-based economy.

         Education reforms


         Section 81 of  the  Constitution  provides  that  the  State  shall
         provide and promote the private  sector  to  provide  education  to
         achieve knowledge  alongside  morality,  provide  law  relating  to
         national education, improve education in harmony with economic  and
         social change, create and strengthen knowledge and  instill  rights
         awareness with regard  to  politics  and  a  democratic  regime  of
         government with the King as Head of the State, support  researchers
         in various sciences, accelerate  the  development  of  science  and
         technology  for  national   development,   develop   the   teaching
         profession, and promote  local  knowledge  and  national  arts  and
         culture.


         Section  43  provides  for  every  citizen  to   enjoy   an   equal
         opportunity to receive fundamental education for a duration of  not
         less  than  12  years,  which  shall  be  provided  by  the   State
         thoroughly, qualitatively and without charge.


         According  to  the  Act,  educational  reform  consists  of   eight
         components:


         *  Ensuring basic education for all (Chapter 2)


         *  Reform of education system (Chapter 3)


         *  Learning reform (Chapter 4)


         *  Reorganisation of administrative system (Chapter 5)


         *  Introducing a system of education quality (Chapter 6)


         *   Enhancing  professionalism  and   quality   of   the   teaching
           profession (Chapter 7)


         *  Mobilisation of resources and investment for education  (Chapter
           8)


         *  Technology for educational reforms (Chapter 9)


         (The Constitution and the Act  are  available  at  the  Library  of
         Parliament.)


         The national economic and social development  plan  advocates  four
         approaches:


         *  Empowerment of people  to  cope  with  change  -  education  and
           learning processes should be geared towards development of human
           potential


         *  Improvement of social protection systems  -  they  should  cover
           bigger segments of the population


         *  Prevention and suppression of drug abuse  and  increased  public
           security (to be improved through increased participation)


         *   Promotion  of  development  partnerships  with  family-oriented
           institutions, religious organisations, schools, NGOs,  voluntary
           organisations and mass media.


         The main points of education reform are:


         1. Learning reform


              The learner-centred approach - they have established  learning
              centres all  over  the  country  (self-learning  and  lifelong
              learning).


         2. Basic education for all


              This entails 12 years  of  basic  quality  education  free  of
              charge, according to an education plan which the  Cabinet  has
              approved.  An  operation  plan  is  provided  for  pre-primary
              education and for study costs per head.


         3. Education quality assurance


              This includes improvement of the educational quality  standard
              system, internal and external  evaluation  and  evaluation  by
              standardised test.


         4. Curriculum development


              This  was  launched  on  September  2001,  and  includes  core
              curriculum provided by the State (all studies should be  based
              on its curriculum, and also on local  curriculum  provided  by
              the institutions).


              In 2002 there will be  a  pilot  project  for  1Â 582  schools,
              developing  4Â 500  trainees,  who  will   be   monitored   and
              evaluated.


              Teaching and learning are important  aspects  of  reform,  and
              encourage students to study subjects relevant to their needs.


         5.  Special education


              There  are  two  kinds:  Education  for  handicapped  learners
              (166Â 478), and education for the disadvantaged. Provision  has
              been categorised as follows:


              (a) Special schools- 13Â 839 learners


              (b) Integrated schools - 130Â 000 learners


              (c) NFE - 22Â 633 students


              Special education centres will be provided for  76  provinces;
              they will also develop  sign  language  for  the  deaf  and  a
              braille alphabet.
              Communities  take  part  in  educational  and  school   reform
              processes.


              Manpower requirement by State at universities


              Almost all government universities  are  government  agencies,
              autonomous to a certain extent. In  terms  of  manpower,  they
              fall under the National Socio-Development Board. They need  to
              follow a manpower development plan every five years, which are
              controlled by the budgetary system.


              Religion and culture


              These are responsibilities of two Ministries:  Education,  and
              Religion and Culture. In  Thailand,  there  is  no  change  in
              religion, even when the administrative structure changes.


              Student funding


              The government has allocated R20  000  million  for  education
              loan scheme programmes, which will  benefit  and  assist  only
              students whose parents cannot afford university fees.  Certain
              criteria apply - those who qualify, should not have an  annual
              income of more than 15 000 baht.


              For a student to qualify, he  or  she  must  have  be  a  Thai
              citizen with a track record of achievement in studies.


              Computers in schools


              There are more than 30Â 000 schools, and 22Â 000 to 23Â 000  have
              computers. They have  been  computerised  recently,  and  most
              teachers are well-trained and computer-literate. Although  the
              computer must be part of the learning process  in  respect  of
              all subjects,  there  are  not  enough  English  and  Computer
              teachers to pursue this; as  a  result  they  are  taught  the
              English method of teaching.


              The government has a five-year plan to solve these problems.


              Education plans


              Every school has  a  two-year  education  plan.  Stakeholders,
              parents and students participate in the plan within  a  three-
              year  budget.  Schools  decide  how  to  use  their  allocated
              budgets.


              As the government has  very  limited  funding,  schools  raise
              funds and collect money from stakeholders and the community to
              increase their budgets.


              Schools have trust in the communities.


              Quality assurance


              This ensures  quality  of  total  delivery  of  the  education
              system. Input is not only from the government, but  also  from
              parents, communities, stakeholders and learners,  who  aim  to
              prepare class-room activities.


              Parents on committees


              Education committees comprise 15 members,  including  parents,
              teachers  and  stakeholders,  and  are   chaired   by   school
              principals. Students are represented in all the committees.


              30% of the parents are poor, while 70% are  very  co-operative
              and understand their responsibilities.  Wealthy  parents  take
              minimal responsibility to participate in these committees,  as
              most of them are engaged in their businesses.


              Parents are always in support of projects to develop  students
              and schools.


              Expenses paid for students


              The government provides the  following:  School  uniforms  for
              needy students, textbooks, stationery, 3Â 000 baht per year for
              primary  students  and  4Â 000  baht  per  year  for  secondary
              students.


     G.     Briefing by Minister of Education  -  official  view  by  Hon  S
         Khunkitti


         Although the Minister was not part of the programme  of  our  visit
         to  Thailand,  he  warmly  welcomed  the  delegation  and  gave  an
         overview  of  the  education  system  and  its  reforms.  He   also
         mentioned that he has been in politics for more than 20 years.


         He views  education  as  very  important  and  also  as  the  basic
         fundamental for national development. Keeping students  with  their
         families is good for them, and if power  is  decentralised  to  the
         local people, education becomes important.


         National standards are  also  important:  All  students  should  be
         given a standard  education,  and  learn  local  wisdom  and  local
         standards.


     H.     Briefing by Department of Curriculum and Instruction Development
         - official view by Director-General, Dr P Senarith


         It is the first time they have  the  process  of  education  reform
         based  on  the  Constitution,  and  every  department  within   the
         Education Ministry has to conform to and follow the law.


         Structural reform aims to combine  all  Education  Ministries  into
         one Ministry of Education.


         Basic education aims at full development of the Thai people in  all
         aspects: Morality, intellect,  happiness,  Thainess,  potential  in
         further education and securing careers. To implement these  ideals,
         the following goals and standards are stipulated:


         *  Self-esteem, self-discipline,  strict  observance  of  religious
           teaching and practice, morality, correct behaviour and desirable
           virtue


         *  Creative thinking, a  thirst  for  knowledge  and  learning  and
           acquiring reading, writing and research habits


         *  Universal knowledge, keeping pace with changes  and  advancement
           in the academic world, skills and  potential  for  communication
           and technology management, adjustment of  thinking  and  working
           processes to cope with changing situations


         *  Skills and learning processes in mathematics, science,  thinking
           skills, generating intelligence and quality of life skills


         *  Physical exercises for good health and personality


         *   Efficiency  in  producing  and  consuming  (a  preference   for
           producing rather than consuming)


         *  Knowledge of Thai  history,  pride  in  being  a  Thai,  a  good
           citizen who strictly observe democratic ways of  life,  under  a
           regime of constitutional monarchy


         *  Consciousness in the preservation of  the  Thai  language,  art,
           culture, custom, sport,  local  wisdom,  natural  resources  and
           environmental development


         *   Love  for  and  dedication  to  the   country   and   community
           (contributions to society's prosperity).


         To  implement  principles,  goals   and   learning   standards   at
         educational institutions, and  for  those  formulating  educational
         institution  curricula,  the  structure  of  the  basic   education
         curriculum is:


         1. Grade levels: There shall be four grade  levels,  in  accordance
              with learners' development, in only 2Â 000 schools: first level
              - primary education, grades 1 to 3; secondary level -  primary
              education, grades 4 to 6; third level -  secondary  education,
              grades 7 to 9; fourth level - secondary education,  grades  10
              to 12.


         2. Substance: The  substance  consists  of  a  body  of  knowledge,
              skills or learning processes, values or virtues, morality  and
              correct  behaviour.  This  substance  is  assembled  in  eight
              groups: Thai language, Mathematics, Science,  Social  Studies,
              Religion and Culture,  Health  and  Physical  Education,  Art,
              Career  and  Technology  and  Foreign  Languages.  This  is  a
              fundamental substance for all learners.


         Ms K Ranatasing is  responsible  for  technical  aspects  of  Basic
         Education and Training up to  Grade  12,  the  curriculum  process,
         textbook development and the  evaluation  process.  All  these  are
         developed by the central government  (Ministry  of  Education)  and
         the  policy  is  put  into  place  at  all  schools,  primary   and
         secondary. Private and public  schools  have  to  follow  the  same
         curriculum.  They  have  now  moved  to  a  higher  degree  of  the
         decentralised system.


         According to Ms Ranatasing, it is difficult for one  curriculum  to
         cover different localities. As a result, they have developed a  new
         curriculum framework for school level. It will be  the  first  time
         that all schools will have the same  curriculum  level.  This  will
         begin in 2003 with 2Â 000 schools, and then nation-wide.


         Since May 2002, some of the 2Â 000 targeted schools (out of  30  000
         schools) have started using the new curriculum for Grades 1,  4,  7
         and 9, and they  have  been  given  three  years  to  complete  the
         implementation cycle.  Since  this  is  the  new  challenge,  every
         school  will  start  with  a  three-year  phasing-in  period.   The
         implementation stage will start in 2003. The Minister of  Education
         will give the mandate and instruction.


         Learning standards


         For the standard-based  curriculum,  the  government  set  learning
         standards for curriculum  development  at  school  level.  Learning
         standards stipulated for eight subject groups  in  basic  education
         curriculum define learners'  qualities  in  respect  of  knowledge,
         skills, procedures, morality, correct behaviour and value for  each
         subject  group.  These  are  aimed  at   developing   a   desirable
         character. Standards are divided into two categories:


         *  Standards for basic education: These are for each subject  group
           in basic education learning results after graduation


         *  Standards for each grade level  learning:  These  are  for  each
           subject group after graduation from each grade level  -  primary
           level 3 and 6, secondary level 3 and 6


         Standards are stipulated specifically for application  of  subjects
         related to learners' quality development. Educational  institutions
         may  set  standards  for  solving  a  community's   and   society's
         problems,  local  wisdom,  desirable   qualifications   of   family
         members, a community, society at large and the country, as well  as
         standards  for  strengthening  learner   capacity,   aptitude   and
         interests, where necessary.


         Training of teachers


         All teachers are trained in all levels; teacher  manuals  are  used
         and supervisors at regional, provincial  and  district  level  work
         closely  with  them  during  school  holidays.  They  network  with
         teacher colleges and institutions in the regions.


         Schools draw up their own curriculum - how to evaluate


         They test all levels nationwide; staff  in  every  school  conducts
         such tests at all levels. A school has to  conduct  its  own  tests
         but at national level the Department conducts the tests.


         There is a curriculum document to suggest the content.  As  regards
         the curriculum framework, there  is  only  a  standard  which  will
         guide the content. Schools can add their own content,  as  long  it
         meets the standard.


         Textbooks


         For the past 10 years private book development took place, but  now
         the government and  publishers  supervised  in  the  various  areas
         produce  all  the  textbooks.  Teachers  and  publishers  can  also
         publish  textbooks.  They  must  employ  methodology  for  material
         development and give teachers more  opportunity  to  develop  their
         own books.


         Capacity  development  to  develop  standards   and   benchmarking:
         Documents are developed in more detail, but the final  decision  is
         made by schools. They now want teachers to develop  the  curriculum
         to meet local needs  and  provide  three-year  intervals  for  each
         level.


     I.     Visit to Rachawinit Primary School, Bangkok - official  view  by
         Director,  Mr  C  Punyasavasti,  and  Assistant  Director,  Mrs   C
         Neuykaew


         History


         This is one of the best schools in Bangkok.  King  Rachawinit  gave
         it its name, meaning a place to  educate  younger  generations  and
         instill a good moral code.


         Rachawinit was founded in 1964  under  the  King's  Patronage.  The
         King presided over the grand opening ceremony on 18 June 1968,  and
         donated 100Â 000 baht for the  King's  scholarship  foundation.  The
         general public also donated to the foundation.


         Each  year  many  qualified  students  are  selected   to   receive
         scholarships. The school has provided  learning  facilities  and  a
         suitable curriculum for primary school Grades 1 to  6.  It  has  77
         class-rooms and a study room to support learning activities.


         The philosophy of the school is to  unite,  discipline  and  learn.
         The first director was Khunying Puangrat Wiwaganon, and  now  Mr  C
         Punyasavasti is the director.


         Vision of school


         The vision is to develop its students to be  leaders  of  tomorrow.
         They intend to educate and develop their learners so that they  can
         acquire  the  qualities  possessed   by   learners   in   developed
         countries, but at the same time keeping  their  true  identity  and
         Thai culture.


         Organisation chart
         A director is head of the  school  and  is  assisted  by  assistant
         directors  in  Administration,  Discipline,  General  Service   and
         Finance and Academic. The Discipline Section deals with  all  areas
         relating to discipline of teachers, learners  and  staff.  Learners
         are not punished, instead teachers talk to  them;  those  who  need
         counselling, are given that support.


         Development of curriculum


         They have set up a new curriculum and introduced new subjects  such
         as Music and Computers. They have also introduced some  changes  in
         the old curriculum in respect of subjects  such  as  Thai  Dancing,
         Physical  Education,  Swimming,  Home  Economics,   English,   Art,
         Mathematics and Science.

         There are 2Â 870 learners ranging from Grades 1  to  6  (1Â 816  boys
         and 1Â 054 girls). The learner/teacher ratio is 1:19.


         Every year they admit learners from other provinces;  as  a  result
         there are more boys than girls. The learner is registered in  Grade
         1 at age the age of six.


         There are 151 teachers - 112 permanent (nine  male  &  103  female)
         and 39 temporary (18  male  and  21  female).  Temporary  teachers'
         salaries are paid through fund-raising.


         Each Grade has  12  normal  classes  and  one  special  class.  The
         special  classes  are  sometimes  mixed,  as  they   take   similar
         subjects, like Music and Art.


         All learners are encouraged to take  English  and  Computers  as  a
         compulsory subject from Grade 1.


         School fees


         Each learner pays 12Â 000 baht (R3Â 000)  per  year,  which  includes
         lunch. If a learner brings lunch to school,  he  or  she  will  pay
         less.


         Selection of learners


         Anyone can apply  to  be  admitted  to  the  school.  There  is  an
         entrance examination and learners who score high are admitted.  The
         committee selects learners for admission.
         Budgeting


         The government allocates an annual budget  of  35  million  baht  -
         12Â 000 baht per learner x 2Â 780 learners per  school.  This  covers
         salaries for teachers and permanent staff  and  teaching  materials
         (desks and furniture), equivalent to 200 baht  (R50)  per  learner.
         Additional to the 35 million baht comes money from fund-raisers.


         The  government  provides  curriculum  material  free  of   charge;
         learners buy textbooks from the bookshop  for  additional  tuition.

     J.     Visit to Matayom Wat Makut Kasat School - official view by Vice-
         Assistant-Director, Mrs J Caowachote


         There are two levels, with 1Â 299 learners: 725  learners  in  lower
         and 574 learners in higher education. There are 40  classrooms:  19
         for lower and 21 for higher education.


         Matoyom refers to Secondary, Wat refers to the temple (because  the
         school is in a temple), Makut Kasat refers to King MongKut or  King
         Rama the Fourth, who gave birth to Wat Makut Kasatariyaram.


         This is a secondary school attached to the Department of  Education
         under the Ministry of Education.  It  was  established  on  7  June
         1951.


         The colours of the school are yellow and  pink  -  yellow  for  the
         colour  of  the  Buddish  (in  this  case  it   means   Wat   Makut
         Kasatariyaram); pink for Tuesday, King Rama the Fourth's  birthday.
         The symbol of the school is Crown.


         The  school  is  divided  into  four   parts:   Academic   Affairs,
         Discipline, Office of Management  and  School  Service.  Since  its
         establishment until 2001, it was a boys' school, but now  they  are
         now allowed to admit girls too. At  present  there  are  96  girls.
         Their Motto is: "Where there's a will, there's a way".


         The vision is to manage education to  develop  learners  to  obtain
         knowledge,  including  morals  and  discipline.  Learners  and  the
         organisation must get satisfaction. To properly administrate,  they
         have an academic standard and  a  standard  in  managing  Education
         Reformation.


         School management team and staff


         *  School Director: Mr T Niyonmthong is  in  charge  of  everything
           pertaining the school. He is good at administration.


         *  Assistant Director of Academic Affairs: Mr C Keawleg is good  at
           Academic Affairs and an expert in computers and IT.


         *  Assistant Director of Discipline: Mr P Treethepa is  responsible
           for student behaviour and  keeps  learners  in  compliance  with
           school rules.
         *Assistant Director of Office Management: Mrs  C  Watjanarat  takes
           care of school management, such as student fees and salaries  of
           teachers.


         *  Assistant Director of School Services: Mr S Peandee  takes  care
           of the school buildings and managing the school janitors.


         There  are  103  personnel  officers,  three  administrators,   100
         teachers and 10 workers. They  also  hired  a  foreign  teacher  to
         teach English for  all  Grades.  Eight  teachers  assist  with  the
         administration.


         They  manage  their  education  by  using  the  curriculum  of  the
         Department of Academics under the MOE. Learners have  to  study  at
         each level for three years, with 40 learners  in  each  class.  The
         more they realise the importance of children,  the  more  they  use
         child-centred methods. Learners can tell teachers  what  they  want
         to know in a subject.


         Learning management


         For lower education, learners' lessons are  from  08:00  to  14:50.
         They have to be in school for eight  hours.  For  upper  education,
         they begin lessons at the same  time  but  finish  at  15:40.  They
         study  Thai,  social  subjects,  Science,   Mathematics,   English,
         physical subjects, Arts and Computers.


         Child Centre learning process


         Teachers teach learners using the CIPPA Model:


         C (Construct) - learn by themselves after class
         I (Interaction) - relationship with each other
         P (Process/Performance) - method of teaching
         P (Product) - do work related to studies
         A (Application) - after class, apply knowledge daily.


         Information and Communication Technology in Teaching


         Learners receive modern teaching methods. They  have  accessed  new
         technology for themselves, for  example  the  Internet,  Multimedia
         laboratories such as the  English  Sound  Laboratory,  the  Science
         Laboratory,  the  Sound  Library,  the  Resource  Centre  and   the
         Computer Zone.


         Evaluation


         A year is divided into two semesters, the first from 17 May  to  13
         September and the second from 1 November to 31 March.  In  mid-July
         and mid-January learners are assessed by  writing  mid-term  tests,
         and in mid-September and  at  end  of  February  they  write  final
         examinations. During normal semester time there are tests in  which
         learners can collect points. The school uses  Authentic  Assessment
         to evaluate learners. Each school  sets  its  own  examination  for
         Grade 12.


         A student must obtain a 50% pass  rate  for  each  subject.  For  a
         student to be admitted to public or  private  universities,  he/she
         has  to  write  two  different  entrance  examinations.  Once  they
         acquire  42%,  they  are  admitted  to  a  public  or   a   private
         university. Those who acquired 40%, go to private university.
         Any student who intends to go to university, must pass the  central
         examination. If they fail, they cannot be admitted  to  university,
         and have to find work or undergo vocational education.


         Computer facilities


         Grades 7 to 12 have access  to  all  computer  facilities.  In  the
         resource centre, students  are  taught  to  communicate  with  each
         other via computer and to  use  the  Internet  to  access  research
         information.


         Budget


         In Grades 7 to 9 (lower education) a student pays 700  baht  (R175)
         per year; Grades 10 to 12 (upper education) pay 1Â 400 baht  (R350).
         The government pays teachers' salaries. Parents must buy books  for
         their children; the government allocates funds  to  buy  books  for
         the library.


         View on education reforms


         According to the Assistant Director, the  teachers  will  be  ready
         for the new curriculum and will  be  trained  to  implement  it  in
         class.  Students  are  able  to  do  whatever  they  want   to   by
         themselves. Although the old curriculum worked, the new one  brings
         the students happiness. And teachers will prepare for this  student
         happiness.


         As a form  of  appreciation  and  honour,  delegates  were  awarded
         certificates for visiting the school.


     K.     Visit to Science Centre for Education and Bangkok NFE  Centre  -
         official view by Science Education Specialist, Mr Y Piriyakul,  and
         NFE Specialist, Dr P Chariyavidhayamont


         Background


         Mr Y Piriyakul, who has been at the centre for more than 25  years,
         welcomed the delegation. This visit was the first one in 35  years;
         no Member of the Thailand Assembly has visited the Centre.


         The Centre was  established  in  1952,  and  opened  the  doors  of
         discovery to students and the general public with a wide  range  of
         exhibits designed to excite and educate. People come to the  centre
         with the mind prepared to "wonder". There are hands-on  educational
         resources in the fields of Science and  Technology,  Astronomy  and
         Space Explorations, Natural Science and the Environment.


         There  are  16  campuses  around  Thailand,   the   largest   being
         Shukhumuit in Bangok. The  purpose  of  its  establishment  was  to
         reduce superstitions of Thai  people  and  to  let  students  study
         Science from a textbook. Students are encouraged to study  Science,
         to have knowledge of it and to have  a  scientific  attitude.  They
         also work with school learners.


         The DNFE  was  established  in  the  MOE  on  24  March  1979.  The
         Department was firmly upgraded from  Adult  Education,  which  goes
         back to the late 1930's, when the government  began  to  realise  a
         need for other  types  of  education  with  the  aim  of  elevating
         nation's literacy rate. At the time the literacy rate of  those  20
         and older was a mere 32%. The Centre  teaches  illiterates  and  is
         seen as a basis of improving quality of life. It is  encouraged  to
         inhance skills needed by the people of Thailand.


         For the past  23  years,  the  Department  has  managed  to  reduce
         illiteracy. It followed the curriculum of formal schooling,  making
         learners read and write, focusing on women who have left school  at
         an early age.


         Main tasks of DNFE


         NFE is regarded as a vital tool which people use to  improve  their
         quality of life. The important mission  of  the  Department  is  to
         provide various models of NFE, responsive to individual  needs  and
         opening up opportunities to acquire  knowledge,  at  any  stage  of
         people's lives, by emphasising principles of freedom,  justice  and
         equal opportunity to learn or study.


         The main tasks of the DNFE are:


         *   Organisation  of  NFE:  Provides  basic   education   for   the
           disadvantaged  to  make  them  literate,  provides  general  NFE
           programmes at primary, lower and  upper  secondary  levels,  and
           provides  various  vocational  education  and  skills   training
           programmes according to a variety of NFE curricula.


         *  Support of and co-operation with formal school system:  Provides
           learning and teaching activities,  for  those  attending  formal
           schools,  in  respect  of  educational  technologies,  such   as
           educational radio and television programmes, satellite  distance
           education programmes and science and technology exhibitions,  to
           enable them to gain knowledge and to achieve learning goals.


         *  Organisation  and  promotion  of  informal  education:  Aims  to
           provide  people  with  up-to-date  knowledge   and   information
           necessary for earning a living and improving quality of life, as
           well as to enable them to catch up  with  current  news  and  to
           adapt themselves to rapidly changing technology. They have to be
           able to learn by themselves throughout  their  lives,  and  from
           various sources,  such  as  ther  public  library,  the  village
           reading centre, the science centre for education and educational
           radio and TV programmes.


         All these have been implemented to provide basic  education  skills
         training  and  up-to-date  information  for  all  (in  and  out  of

         Laboratory School - official view by President, Dr  B  Watana,  and
         Vice-Director, Mrs S Pattamatin


         The President of the Institute and her staff  warmly  welcomed  the
         delegation and introduced her staff.


         His Majesty, King Bhumibhol Adulyadej, gave  the  prestigious  name
         "Rajabhat  Institute"  to  all  36  former  teacher   colleges   in
         Thailand. "Rajabhat" literally means "the King's men".


         The emblem consists of five colours:  Blue,  which  represents  His
         Majesty the King; green, which  represents  the  locations  of  all
         Rajabhat  Institutes  (situated  in  a  variety  of   natural   and
         beautiful environments); gold,  which  represents  the  wisdom  and
         success of all Rajabhat  students,  lecturers  and  staff;  orange,
         which represents the proliferation of local art, culture  and  folk
         wisdom of the Institute;  and  white,  which  represents  the  pure
         thoughts of His  Majesty  the  King's  wise  men.  The  Institute's
         colours are yellow and red.


         This higher education institute under the MOE  was  established  in
         1905.  Although  it  is  still  a  college,  it  offers  university
         degrees, and it will  be  officially  converted  to  a  university.
         Recently they started offering masters' degree  programmes;  to  be
         admitted, a student has to pass the central examination.


         There are almost 7Â 990 students,  full-  and  part-time,  with  250
         staff members. One has to study for four years to obtain a  degree.
         There  is  a  library  (with  Internet),  which  all  students  and
         teachers access and use free of charge.


         Students pay school fees, and the  Institute  assists  and  support
         those from poor families who cannot afford the fees.


         Mission of Institute


         The   main   mission   of   the   Institute,    academically    and
         professionally, is  to  provide  society  with  education,  conduct
         research, provide academic services to the community,  improve  and

         Tourism Industry and Business Administration. All  courses,  except
         minor ones, are taught in English.


         Academic Service and IT Centres provide both information  resources
         and services. A number of  reference  works,  journals,  magazines,
         newspapers and audio-visual aids are available, as well as  various
         types of services.


         The Language Centre offers tuition  in  five  foreign  languages  -
         English, French, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.  There  are  also  a

         practiced - teachers assisting learners to work as a team.


     M.     Visit to Ayatothaya Historic World Heritage site


         The Wat Chaiwattanaram (Temple) was built in 1630  by  King  Prasat
         Thong to commemorate his mother's home town and  to  celebrate  his
         coronation. Important edifices  are  the  Prang,  surrounded  by  a
         number of minor Prangs pointing in eight different  directions.  It
         is believed that the main  Prang  contains  relics  of  Buddha  and
         other idols.


         The temple was also built to commemorate  victory  over  the  Khmer
         Rouge; that is why it was built in Khmer architectural style.


         Pictures of the temple are available at the Library  of  Parliament
         of South Africa.


     N.     Visit to National  Science  Museum  (NSM)  -  official  view  by
         Director: Office of the President, Mr T Palachai, and Ms G Chen


         The NSM is a  State  enterprise  under  the  Ministry  of  Science,
         Technology and Environment. It was established  in  1995  by  royal
         decree to commemorate  the  60th  birthday  of  Her  Majesty  Queen
         Sirikit.


         The NSM aims to be recognised as one of Asia's leading science  and
         technology museums. Administration is under  the  guidance  of  the
         NSM committee, appointed by Cabinet.


         There are four museums in one  building:  Science  Museum;  Natural
         History Museum; Environment and Ecology Museum;  and  Aviation  and
         Telecommunication Technology Museum.


         There are six exhibition floors, each  covering  different  aspects
         of   science   and   technology,   like   ticketing    information,
         information, the Internet and temporary exhibition  space,  history
         of  science,  basic  science  and  energy  resources,  science  and
         technology in Thailand, science and technology  in  everyday  life,
         and traditional Thai technology.


         Mission
         The  mission  is  to  enhance  public  understanding  of   science,
         technology and  environmental  issues  by  developing  a  range  of
         science museums, both in  the  technopolis  complex  and  in  other
         regions of Thailand.  Activities  will  be  designed  to  make  the
         public more aware of the importance of science and  technology  and
         of caring for the environment.


         It will also seek to encourage active participation of  individuals
         in developing science and technology to  support  and  sustain  the
         development of the nation.


         All people of Thailand, including the illiterate and students,  are
         encouraged to study science and to  get  to  know  about  processes
         regarding science and technology.


         Infrastructure


         The first NSM building is a unique construction,  which  in  itself
         reflects a fascination with science and  technology  -  three  huge
         cubes standing on edge in  the  technopolis  complex,  forming  the
         most spectacular building so  far  constructed  on  the  site.  The
         external faces of the cubes are covered with  white  ceramic-coated
         steel plates, which do not need paint. The angled white  reflecting
         surfaces minimise the transfer of external  heat  to  the  building
         and reduce the cost of air conditioning.


         This building, one of the most  attractive  in  Thailand,  has  the
         facilities to accommodate 2Â 000 visitors  a  day.  Half  a  million
         people are expected in the first year.


         The government spent 400 million baht to build it and  700  million
         baht for the exhibition centre. Thailand is famous for this  unique
         and beautiful structure. (Visit internet to view the  building,  at
         www.nsm.or.th).


         Budget


         The budget comes from the government and  from  State  enterprises.
         In 2001 it was allocated 82,937 million baht, and in  2002  it  was
         allocated 92,445 million baht.


         Tour of NSM


         The delegation noted with great enthusiasm and  excitement  one  of
         our pioneers of science - scientist of the "heart transplant",  the
         late Dr Christiaan Barnard - displayed in  the  exhibition  showing
         achievements in the field of science.


     O.     Comments


         Main lessons to be drawn from the visit:


         1. A common ownership of parliamentary governance by all  political
              parties.


         2. Big involvement of the private sector in the education system.


         3. Private schools' fees are  determined  by  the  State,  and  the
              system of funding is the same,  irrespective  of  whether  the
              school is private or public. All schools follow the same  core
              curriculum to promote equality.


         4. Institutions of higher learning are not autonomous.


         5. Accelerated rural development stabilises family structures.


         6. Work-oriented Learning and  Vocational  Education  ensures  that
              the curriculum fits neatly in the working environment.  Theory
              and practice work together.


         7. School committees/SGBs  give  meaningful  input  in  respect  of
              policy-making.


         8. Partnerships between private and public sectors  are  common  in
              higher education.


         9. In-service training programmes for teachers  in  OBE  and  other
              teacher development  programmes  during  school  holidays  are
              common.


         10.     Clear-cut standards and benchmarks  exist  for  schools  to
              build core curricula.


         11.     Thailand has a decentralised curriculum. The  principle  of
              decentralisation should  be  responding  to  the  capacity  of
              people.  The  Department   of   Curriculum   and   Instruction
              Development  has   distinguishing   features   in   curriculum
              development.


         12.     NFE is well-structured.


         13.     Religious education is  taken  into  consideration  in  the
              education system.


         14.     There is a strong emphasis on sport and  culture  in  rural
              communities.


         15.     There is good teacher/pupil ratio (20:1).


         16.     Volunteerism makes NFE operational and functional.


         17.     As there are NFE centres in all provinces,  the  programmes
              reach unemployed people in rural areas and cities, as well  as
              other special groups with social  problems,  especially  those
              unable to speak Thai. As their needs are different,  they  are
              treated differently  and  need  special  programmes.  Literacy
              forms part of the assistance to people to sustain  themselves.
              As a result, illiteracy has been reduced from 7% to 4,5%.


         18.     Museums are daily resource centres  for  learners;  schools
              are encouraged to make full use of museums for  any  field  of
              study.


         19.     Museums are comprehensive - they  cover  the  interests  of
              the young and of adults, for life-long learning.

     The following letter has been received by the Office of the Speaker:


     Dear Madam Speaker


     Proposed Amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa
     Fourth Amendment Bill, 2002 [B 69 - 2002].


     You are no doubt aware that recent discussions between the ANC and  IFP
     led to an agreement to withdraw the  "reinstatement-provision"  in  the
     above Bill, which  is  presently  being  considered  by  the  Portfolio
     Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development. I am  consequently
     in the process of approaching Cabinet with a recommendation that clause
     6 of the Bill be amended by the deletion of the following subitem:


         6(3) Any person who, subsequent to 20 June 2002  has  been  removed
         from membership of a legislature by reason directly  or  indirectly
         of anything done by such person in the belief that he  or  she  was
         lawfully  acting  in  accordance  with   provisions   substantially
         similar in content to this Schedule, is  hereby  restored  to  such
         membership with all rights and privileges  attaching  thereto,  and
         any person who  has  replaced  such  person  as  a  member  of  the
         legislature hereby ceases to be a member of such legislature.


     I will be submitting a formal amendment to the Portfolio  Committee  as
     soon as possible, in order to ensure that the passing of  the  Bill  is
     not unnecessarily delayed.


     With kind regards




     Dr P M Maduna, MP
     MINISTER


     Referred to the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development.

     (1)    Letter dated 29 October 2002 from the Minister in the Presidency
         to the Speaker, tabled in terms of section 65(2)(a) of  the  Public
         Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1  of  1999),  explaining  the
         delay in the tabling of the Annual Report and Financial  Statements
         for the Presidency and the National Youth Commission:


         Dear Dr Ginwala


         I hereby would like, in terms of section 65 of the  Public  Finance
         Management Act (1999), to furnish you  with  information  regarding
         the delays in the publication and tabling of the Annual Report  and
         Financial Statements for the  Presidency  and  the  National  Youth
         Commission for 2001/2 financial year.


         The Presidency's Financial Statements and Annual  Report  for  this
         period have been completed, but due to unfortunate  delays  in  the
         printing processes, will be tabled in the National Assembly  during
         the first week of November 2002.


         With regard to the Financial Statements and Annual  report  of  the
         National Youth Commission  (NYC)  for  this  period,  I  have  been
         notified by the Commission that the Accounting  Authority  withdrew
         the 2001/2  financial  statements.  This  was  done  to  allow  for
         corrections in the VAT positions of the NYC.  The  NYC  is  of  the
         view that the audit opinion on the NYC would be incomplete  in  the
         absence of incorporating these corrections.


         Your kind understanding in this regard is appreciated.


         Regards




         Essop Pahad, MP

         not tabled within the timeframes provided in the  PFMA  Act,  1999.
         The report was due on 30 September 2002 and  my  department  tabled
         the report on 22 October 2002. The late tabling was due  to  delays
         in the editing and printing of the report.


         I sincerely apologize for the delay.




         Yours sincerely




         Mr Alec Erwin
         MINISTER

                          TUESDAY, 4 FEBRUARY 2003

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson report to their respective Houses:


     A serious allegation was made against the  Presiding  Officers  at  the
     meeting of the Joint Rules Committee on Tuesday, 4  February  2003.  In
     terms of Joint Rule  30,  as  this  allegation  was  made  against  the
     Presiding Officers, it is being reported directly to the House for  its
     attention.


     The unrevised transcript of the relevant proceedings is as follows:
         Mr J H DE LANGE: Thank you. I want to address just  one  issue  and
         that is the so-called "critical issue" raised  by  Minister  Manuel
         in b). We all know that it was not Minister Manuel who  raised  the
         point. We know that the Presiding Officers hold that view, which  I
         think is rather - factually and legally ...


         The SPEAKER: Sorry, could you speak into the microphone?


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Sorry?


         The SPEAKER: Could you speak into the microphone. You do  not  need
         to look at us.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Must I start again?


         As I said, I am addressing the second  so-called  "critical  issue"
         that Minister Manuel raises, and which  we  know  is  not  Minister
         Manuel's issue. It is the issue of the Presiding Officers,  because
         that is the view they hold ...


         The SPEAKER: I am sorry. Could you explain that?


         Mr J H DE LANGE: We know that the two of you,  Presiding  Officers,
         hold this view and we know how you feel on these matters.  Clearly,
         you raised it with Minister Manuel and now it is  given  to  us  in
         the form of them wanting to raise it with us.


         I do not think we should beat about the  bush.  We  all  know  that
         this is the point of view you hold.  Of  course,  the  rest  of  us
         disagree  totally  with  that  and  that  is  why  the  rules   are
         different, as Mrs Seaton has spoken.


         I want to make the point here that,  factually  and  legally,  this
         position is wrong. Firstly, not the Joint Rules  Committee  or  any
         committee  in  Parliament  makes  decisions.  You  yourself,  Madam
         Speaker, remind us of that all the time.  You  remind  us  that  no
         committee, and that includes the Joint  Rules  Committee,  has  any
         power in terms of the Constitution to make decisions. We  know  how
         it works. This Rules Committee decides on matters  and  then  there
         is a clause in the ATC which says that this is a  report  from  the
         Rules Committee. The House adopts it and  if  the  House  does  not
         raise any issue, it is the position of the House, not of the  Rules
         Committee or of any committee of Parliament.  So  it  is  factually
         incorrect to say that.


         Secondly, factually the legal position is also incorrectly  stated.
         All that has happened through the Rules Committee -  we  have  said
         this many times, but clearly there is a difference  of  opinion  on
         this - is that  we  have  created  a  process  whereby  members  of
         Parliament can participate in a process of  having  a  say  in  the
         running of their own Parliament. That is all we have  done.  At  no
         stage  do   we   make   decisions   as   subcommittees.   We   make
         recommendations to the Rules Committee. At no stage does the  Rules
         Committee  make  decisions.  It  is  Parliament  that  makes  these
         decisions.


         Secondly, the Rules do not change the position in  the  Powers  and
         Privileges of  Parliament  Act.  Legally  that  is  the  situation.
         Legally - and Madam Speaker and the Chairperson know  this  -  that
         Act stands and it  makes  the  Secretary  the  accounting  officer,
         subject to being  overruled  by  the  Presiding  Officers,  and  in
         particular Ã¿.Ã¿.Ã¿. In the Act the word  is  "the  Speaker".  Legally
         the situation is that ultimately  the  accounting  officer  remains
         the Secretary, with the Presiding Officers  having  the  overruling
         power.


         The processes that we participate in through  the  Rules  Committee
         and the subcommittees is, of course,  that  we  in  Parliament  say
         what we want, but ultimately  the  Speaker  and  the  Secretary  to
         Parliament put forward the budget. It is very  clear  legally  that
         that is the situation. Of course, you can ignore what we  tell  you
         in the Rules Committee. You can ignore that,  because  legally  you
         have the power to be the accounting officer in the  manner  that  I
         have spelt out.


         I think, firstly, that we can have differences of opinion. That  is
         no problem. But let us at least take the thing  factually.  I  know
         this type  of  thing.  You  keep  raising  it  as,  "Well,  now,  a
         committee is not an executive authority". It is  done,  of  course,
         to be quite emotional about the thing and  say,  "Well,  how  is  a
         committee an executive authority?" A  committee  can  never  be  an
         executive authority, and we know  that.  Legally  it  is  not  like
         that, until the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act changes.


         But what we have done, through  changing  the  Rules,  is  that  it
         cannot be that the Speaker herself just decides what  the  policies
         of Parliament are.  We  have  created  a  process  whereby  we  can
         participate,  but  of  course  the  Presiding  Officers  ultimately
         decide how to do that. Of course, if they want to  ignore  it  they
         can, but there are things that can happen then. So, really, let  us
         have this difference of opinion if we want to, but let us not  deal
         with it in this way.


         This is really unfortunate ... to raise it with  the  Minister  and
         then the Minister telling us to fix it up. It is just  not  ...  It
         is actually just ... Well, let me rather not  say  it.  I  want  to
         make the point that the two of you have that position, and that  is
         fine. The rest of us disagree.


         The SPEAKER: Mr de Lange, before I give the floor to  anyone  else,
         you have alleged that  this  was  raised  with  Mr  Manuel  by  the
         Presiding Officers. You will either substantiate that  or  withdraw
         it. You are entitled to your opinion. I do not have a problem  with
         that. But to make an allegation like that in  this  committee,  you
         will have to withdraw or substantiate it.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Well, I will speak to Mr Manuel  and  I  will  see
         what he ...


         The SPEAKER: No! You will do it here.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: No, I will not do it now, because I have to  speak
         to Mr Manuel. I am not going to withdraw anything  that  I  do  not
         have proof of.


         The SPEAKER: This meeting is adjourned. I will not preside  over  a
         meeting in which that kind of allegation is made.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Well, fine!

         explaining the delay in the tabling of the  Annual  Report  of  the
         South African Sports Commission:


         Dear Madam


         In your "Special Report on the delays  in  the  tabling  of  annual
         reports for the financial year 2001-2002" the SASC  was  cited  for
         tabling their annual report late. As such, it is required of me  as
         the Executive Authority to provide  an  explanation  for  the  late
         submission of such reports by entities under my jurisdiction.


         I have requested the  CEO  of  the  SASC  to  provide  me  with  an
         explanation for the late submission of their report. I  received  a
         letter from Dr. M J Phaahla, CEO of the SASC, on the matter,  which
         I am attaching herewith for your information.


         Dr Phaahla, as you will note in his correspondence,  indicate  that
         the main reason why the report was  tabled  late  was  due  to  the
         inability of the printers that  they  commissioned  to  deliver  on
         time. You will  also  note  that  Dr  Phaahla,  on  behalf  of  the
         chairperson of the SASC, Mr Gideon Sam,  and  the  members  of  the
         SASC Board, apologise for the unfortunate delay and  express  their
         assurance that in future they will avoid this  kind  of  unforeseen
         embarrassment.


         Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate  to
         contact my office.


         Kind regards

     Letter dated 12 February 2003 from the Minister of Minerals and  Energy
     to the Speaker, tabled in terms  of  section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public
     Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining  the  delay
     in the tabling of the Annual Financial Statements of the South  African
     Diamond Board:
     Dear Madam Speaker


     Please be advised that the Annual Financial  Statements  of  the  South
     African Diamond Board for the year ending on 31  March  2002  were  not
     submitted to the Department for tabling  in  Parliament  in  compliance
     with Section 40(1)(e) of the Public Finance Management Act,  1999  (Act
     No 1 of 1999) due to delays caused by structural changes such as:


         1. The sudden resignation of the financial manager a  month  before
              the Financial Year End.
         2. The absence of the financial accountant due to ill  health  from
              February to April 2002.
         3. The suspension of the Chief Executive Officer.


     As a result the Chairman of the Board requested for  the  extension  of
     the Audit from 31 May 2002 to 31 July 2002, which led to the issuing of
     the Audit Report a month after the official due date of 31 August 2002.
     This letter, therefore, serves to request for the tabling of the Annual
     Financial Statements of the South African Diamond Board  in  Parliament
     without further delay.
     Please accept my sincere apology for the delay  and  the  inconvenience
     this may have caused.

     South Africa, dated 4 February 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Communications,  having  considered  the
         matter  of  the  filling  of  a  vacancy  on  the  Council  of  the
         Independent Communications Authority of South Africa,  referred  to
         it, reports as follows:


         The  Committee  invited  the  public  to   nominate   persons   for
         consideration and recommendation to the  President  for  filling  a
         vacancy.  Nominations  and  applications  were  received  from   24
         candidates. Some of them were not considered as they did  not  meet
         the requirements as prescribed by law, and  as  stipulated  in  the
         advertisements.


         The Committee met on 21 January 2003 to consider the nominees,  and
         agreed unanimously that the following persons  be  shortlisted  and
         interviewed on 4 February 2003:


         *  Ms T Cohen
         *  Dr B Dumisa
         *  Mr A H A Karrim
         *  Mr G Petrick


         Mr Karrim withdrew his nomination.


         After having considered the shortlist and after having  interviewed
         the remaining three candidates, the Committee recommends  that  the
         House,  in  accordance  with  section  5  of  the  Act,   makes   a
         recommendation to the President that Mr G Petrick be  appointed  as
         councillor to Icasa.


         The Committee also discussed section  9(2)(b)  of  the  Independent
         Communications Authority of South Africa Act, No 13 of 2000,  which
         provides that  "Any  councillor  appointed  under  this  subsection
         holds office for the rest of the period of the  predecessor's  term
         of  office,  unless  the  National  Assembly  directs   that   such
         councillor holds office for a longer period which  may  not  exceed
         four years".


     Report to be considered.

     MEMBERS' STATEMENTS AND NOTICES OF MOTION
     Introduction


     The Rules Committee, at its  meeting  on  14  August  2002,  agreed  to
     operationalise  the  Rule  on  members'  statements  (Rule  105),  with
     amendments as required. The Chief Whips' Forum was requested  to  agree
     on the wording of the Rule and to propose implementation guidelines for
     members statements and notices of motion, which would be  restored  for
     their specific purpose of enabling members  to  initiate  business  for
     consideration or decision by the  House  where  that  was  the  express
     intention.


     In its report to the Programme Committee on 14 November 2002, the Chief
     Whips' Forum presented  guidelines  for  members'  statements  and  for
     notices of motion, and proposed that -


         -   members'  statements  be  introduced  for   a   trial   period,
              commencing with the first term of 2003;
         -  the process be monitored in terms of the  identified  objectives
              by a small committee of the Chief Whips' Forum; and
         -  following a final review at the end of the first term, the  Rule
              be appropriately adjusted and put to the House for adoption.


     These proposals were approved by the Programme Committee and it  agreed
     that the  guidelines  would  be  published  in  the  ATC  for  members'
     information.


     Implementation of members' statements


     1.     The order of party rotation will be  the  same  as  the  current
         order of rotation for notices of motion. That order  is:  ANC;  DP;
         IFP; ANC; New NP; UDM; ANC; smaller party; smaller party, ANC,  DP,
         etc.


     2.     The sequence will start  at  the  beginning  on  each  day  that
         members' statements are made.


     3.     Notices of motion and motions without notice will be called  for
         daily at the start of proceedings, except for  question  days  when
         they are taken  at  the  conclusion  of  questions.  They  will  be
         followed by members' statements  on  the  days  on  which  members'
         statements are made.
     4.     The actual amount of time allocated to members' statements is as
         follows:


         a. Fourteen (14) members' statements will  be  accommodated  at  1Â½
              minutes per statement.
         b. A maximum of five (5) Ministers will be given an opportunity  to
              respond for 2 minutes each. The opportunity for  Ministers  to
              respond will follow after the expiry of members' time.


     5.     Statements will regularly be taken on  Tuesdays  and  Thursdays,
         and on Fridays when the House sits on a  Friday.  On  certain  days
         members' statements can be  dispensed  with  by  agreement  in  the
         Programme Committee.


     Guidelines on members' statements


     1.     Members' statements may cover any subject which a member  wishes
         to raise relevant to the national sphere of  government,  including
         topical  international  and  national  issues   and   constituents'
         matters.


     2.     The normal rules of debate apply, including -


         a. Unparliamentary language.
         b. Sub judice rule.
         c. Reflections on judges and other specified public  office-bearers
              (Rule 66).
         d. Allegations against other members require a substantive motion.


     3.     Statements need not be submitted in writing and are recorded  in
         Hansard.


     4.     As with speeches, a member's statement is concluded when his/her
         time expires.


     Restoring notices of motion


     1.     The Rules provide for two types of motion  to  come  before  the
         House:


         a. Subjects for discussion (debate only).
         b. Draft resolutions for consideration (decision  with  or  without
              debate).


     2.     Most motions require advance notice, except  for  a  few  formal
         ones for which the Rules specifically provide.


     3.     To restore notices of motion to  their  original  purpose,  they
         will be required to comply with agreed guidelines or  criteria,  as
         set out below.


     4.     The Rules provide an additional safeguard in that  they  provide
         that the Speaker may amend or otherwise deal  with  any  notice  of
         motion which offends against the  practice  or  these  Rules  (Rule
         100).


     Guidelines for notices of motion


     1.     Notices of motion should be limited  to  matters  which  members
         specifically intend should be brought before the House  for  debate
         or decision.


     2.     Notice can be given verbally in the House or in writing.


     3.     Subjects for discussion
         The wording of a  subject  for  discussion  should  be  limited  to
         identifying the topic. The topic  should  be  clearly  established.
         The wording determines the scope and focus of the debate.  A  topic
         that is too vague or broad will lead  to  an  unstructured  general
         debate.


     4.     Draft resolutions


         Generally, draft resolutions  should  be  short  and  succinct  and
         framed so as to express  with  as  much  clarity  as  possible  the
         distinct opinion or decision of the House.


     5.     A draft resolution must deal with matters within the  competence
         of the National Assembly.


     6.     It should deal with only one substantive matter.


     7.     It must consist of a clear and succinct proposed  resolution  or
         order of the House. Any  extraneous  matter  meant  to  motivate  a
         decision should be omitted, and can be put forward when the  member
         introduces the motion in the House.
     8.     It must not contain statements, quotations or other matters  not
         strictly  necessary  to  make  the  proposed  resolution  or  order
         intelligible.


     9.     The Rule of Anticipation will apply. A notice of motion  on  the
         Order Paper on a particular topic will therefore  block  all  other
         notices on substantively the same topic.


     10.    It may not be the same in substance as a draft  resolution  that
         has been approved or rejected during the same session (Rule 95).


     11.    It may not contain unbecoming or offensive expressions.


     12.    It may not issue an instruction to the executive.


     13.    It should observe  the  principles  of  co-operative  government
         (Chapter 3 of the Constitution).


     14.    A signed written copy must be handed to  the  Table  immediately
         after notice has been given in the House.
     Scheduling motions in the programme


     1.     Notices of motion, once given, are printed on  the  Order  Paper
         under "Further Business." The  Programme  Committee  considers  all
         business  on  the  Order  Paper  and  decides  which  business   to
         schedule. Parties can therefore seek to have  a  notice  of  motion
         scheduled through their party representatives on that committee.


     2.     The Chief  Whips'  Forum  provides  a  further  opportunity  for
         parties to canvass support to have a notice of motion scheduled  by
         the Programme Committee.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Mr G Q M Doidge and  Ms  S  N  Ntlabati,  as  Acting  Co-Chairpersons,
     presented the First Report  of  the  Joint  Rules  Committee,  dated  5
     February 2003, as follows:


     The Joint Rules Committee at the request of parties met on Wednesday, 5
     February 2003, after it was adjourned before concluding its business on
     4 February when the hon Adv J H de Lange  made  an  allegation  in  the
     Committee against the  Presiding  Officers  which  he  did  not  either
     substantiate or withdraw when called upon to do so.


     The Speaker and the Chairperson of the National Council  of  Provinces,
     as Co-Chairpersons, took the chair whereupon the Speaker requested  the
     Committee to elect chairpersons  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  the
     meeting. Mr G Q M Doidge and Ms S  N  Ntlabati  were  duly  elected  as
     Acting Co-Chairpersons.


     The hon Adv De Lange was then given an opportunity to make a statement,
     and did so in the following terms:


         Mr J H DE LANGE: I would like to make a statement dealing with  the
         retraction of those remarks  made  by  me  at  that  joint  meeting
         yesterday, 4 February. I would like to say  that  I  regret  having
         made  those  remarks  and  I  withdraw  them   unconditionally.   I
         obviously apologise to this Committee for any inconvenience that  I
         may have caused in the process.


     The Committee accepted the statement and agreed that it be published in
     the next Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports.


     In response to an invitation by the Chair to comment on the  statement,
     the Speaker indicated that she would be reporting on the matter to  the
     National Assembly and  the  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
     Provinces noted that the apology was not also specifically directed  at
     the affected members.


     The Committee resolved that the issue had been disposed of.
