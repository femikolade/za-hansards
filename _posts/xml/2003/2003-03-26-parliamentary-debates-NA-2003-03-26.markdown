                    SERIOUS FLOODING IN THE LITTLE KAROO

                             (Notice of Motion)

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, I hereby move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the serious flooding in the  Little  Karoo  ad  Southern  Cape,
       particularly in Montagu and Ashton.


  (2) further notes the loss of  life  and  serious  damage  to  homes  and
       infrastructure; and


  (3) expresses its condolences to the families of those who have died  and
       who have suffered grievous loss.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Lee, was that a  motion  without  notice?
We have called for Notices of  Motion.  Can  we  record  that  as  a  motion
without notice? Is there any objection to that motion without notice?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, there is  an  established
procedure, as well as a Rule in terms of which motions  without  notice  are
dealt with. We cannot be surprised and be staged upon by  a  motion  without
notice in this particular Chamber that is not dealt with  according  to  the
Rules. For that reason, procedurally, we object.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mr Lee, would you  like  to  put  that  as  a
notice of motion?

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, a motion without notice. Could I  respond?  It  was
circulated yesterday and this morning. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Lee, the procedure is that  if  there  is
an objection, the motion cannot be proceeded with. You  can  liaise  between
parties and resolve the matter.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That, notwithstanding Rule 106, the  following  times  be  allocated  for
  party responses to the statement by the Minister of Sport and Recreation:


  African National  Congress:  5  minutes;  Democratic  Party:  4  minutes;
  Inkatha Freedom Party: 4 minutes; New National Party: 3  minutes;  United
  Democratic Movement: 2 minutes, and all other parties: 1 minute each.

Agreed to.

                        WORLD CUP CRICKET TOURNAMENT

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Chairperson,
the ICC Cricket World Cup for 2003 has drawn to a close after 44 days of  at
times pulsating, crowd-pleasing and even frustrating cricket.  As  the  host
nation, we have set benchmarks that will have to be met or improved upon  in
future tournaments of this magnitude.

As a country and continent, we have sent a message to the  global  community
that South Africa is out there with the best with regard to the  hosting  of
major international events. We  have  effectively  debunked  the  myth,  the
mistaken notion, that world-class events cannot be staged in the  developing
world. With our co-hosts, Zimbabwe and Kenya, we have staged an  event  that
has been precise in its planning, superb in its splendour, efficient in  its
execution and unprecedented in its magnitude.
It is to the credit of our country that we could host an event of such  long
duration without a single significant security breach; with more than 1  000
accredited journalists lauding our communication expertise that  made  their
jobs  a  joy  to  carry  out;  with  volunteers  who   carried   out   their
responsibilities and functions with pride, efficiency and courtesy; with  an
organising  committee  that   displayed   dedication,   commitment   and   a
determination  to  succeed  and  a  policy  committee  that  gave  able  and
competent leadership; with tens of thousands of spectators and  millions  of
supporters who opened their hearts and homes to 20 000  visitors;  with  the
United Cricket Board  of  South  Africa  and  its  affiliates  taking  every
conceivable step to ensure the comfort of teams,  officials  and  spectators
at all  our  stadia  and  venues;  with  service  providers  and  government
structures that provided efficient, consistent and top  class  support;  and
with an opening ceremony  that  reflected  our  continent  and  our  people,
driven by thousands of volunteers who offered their time,  skills  and  even
resources simply because of their love for their country. To Dr  Bacher,  to
Malcolm Grey, to Malcolm Speed, Percy Sonn and Gerald Majola, enkosi,  thank
you, Realeboga, baie dankie.

The decision of the ICC to award the Cricket World Cup to us has  been  more
than vindicated and it has set the  scene  for  South  Africa  to  host  the
Soccer World Cup in 2010 and even the Olympic Games in years  to  come.  The
economic benefits for the country have  been  tremendous  and  their  impact
will filter through in the months and years to come.  Both  SA  Tourism  and
the International Marketing Council have been very  prominent  in  promoting
our country and the Cricket World  Cup  has  given  our  blossoming  tourism
industry another major boost.

Of course, we cannot overlook the fact that our national  cricket  team  did
not live up to expectations, but they still remain  our  team.  But  despite
the disappointment in their performances, they  added  to  the  overwhelming
success of the event and they can only be spurred on  by  the  support  that
they received from millions of South Africans.

During the early days of the tournament difficulties were  experienced  with
teams such as England and New Zealand, who  were  reluctant  to  meet  their
obligations  outside  the  borders  of  our  country,  but  the   leadership
displayed by the ICC and their support for  Zimbabwean  and  Kenyan  cricket
meant that scheduled matches could go ahead with minimum disruptions.

It is to the credit of the South African  Police  Service  that  they  could
assist their counterparts in Zimbabwe and in Kenya in  putting  in  place  a
safety and security plan of the highest international standards,  comparable
to our own safety and security plan. The tireless work of the women and  men
of the SAPS ensured an event that was not only safe, but also a pleasure  to
attend and to be part of. The services provided by other security  agencies,
our traffic officers and  our  intelligence  officials  contributed  to  the
overall success of a safety and security plan that will  stand  us  in  good
stead in our bid to host the 2010 Soccer World Cup.

Chairperson, I have already given notice that  I  will  present  this  House
with comprehensive detail of Government's role in staging the Cricket  World
Cup. This will include information  about  the  resources  provided  by  all
three tiers of government.

I would, however, want to extend my gratitude to President Thabo  Mbeki  and
my Cabinet colleagues, especially the  Cricket  World  Cup  Interministerial
Committee, for the unstinting support that they have given  in  staging  the
tournament. The involvement of various  government  departments,  provincial
governments and municipalities has demonstrated the undoubted value  of  co-
operative governance. The role of parastatals  and  other  institutions  has
been phenomenal and  the  collective  efforts  of  all  South  Africans  are
recognised, acknowledged and appreciated. It is appropriate to  mention  the
roles  played  by,  amongst  others,  the  Treasury,  Trade  and   Industry,
Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,  Foreign  Affairs,   the   GCIS,   the
Presidency, Health, Home Affairs, Transport, Arts and Culture, the  National
Intelligence Agency and, of course, the Department of Sport  and  Recreation
South Africa. Without the support and assistance of these departments it  is
almost unthinkable to imagine that such events can be  hosted  independently
of Government. Cabinet took the lead in  ensuring  Government  participation
and these levels of co-operation augur well for future initiatives  of  this
nature.

My personal appreciation is also extended  to  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Sport and Recreation under the  leadership  of  Sis  Ruth  Ntshulana-Bhengu,
also  the  Select  Committee  on  Education  and  Recreation  and  the  MECs
responsible for sport and  recreation  for  their  significant  support  and
involvement throughout the event.

It is now important that the gains of the Cricket World Cup be  consolidated
to serve as a springboard for  taking  the  game  to  every  corner  of  our
country and our continent. We are once again presented with a  vehicle  that
would  ensure  that  every  South  African  will  have  the  opportunity  to
participate in cricket, and all  its  related  activities.  In  addition  to
that, economic benefits derived from staging such major sporting events  are
no longer in question. It is imperative that we not only  host  such  events
successfully, but also that we take full  advantage  of  the  socio-economic
spin-offs in building a better South Africa.

On behalf of Government, I wish once more to  say:  Congratulations  to  all
South Africans on this magnificent achievement. We are a nation  alive  with
great  possibilities,  creating  a  new  dawn  every  day.  I   thank   you.
[Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Mr Chairman, the Cricket World Cup  proved  to  be  a  financial
success. In large part it was due to  the  generous  support  of  the  South
African public, who  backed  the  tournament  all  the  way,  despite  South
Africa's early exit. We should also thank and  applaud  the  volunteers  for
their selfless contribution.

Unfortunately, though, it has become  second  nature  to  the  ANC  and  the
Minister of Sport and Recreation to try to gloss over  the  shortcomings  of
our sporting administration by looking in the wrong direction. The  fact  of
the matter is that history will remember this World Cup  for  good  cricket,
yes, but also for political interference,  bad  judgment  and  the  shocking
behaviour of a very senior cricket administrator.

Indeed, since the ANC came to power, political wrangling  and  mismanagement
has come  to  define  South  African  sport.  And  this  continues,  to  our
detriment.

The United Cricket Board's decision not  to  send  the  Proteas  to  Sharjah
should be commended.  As  with  any  regulating  sporting  body,  the  UCB's
priority is to look  out  for  the  safety  and  security  of  our  players.
However, when the English and New Zealand cricketing boards raised the  same
concerns, the ANC's response was to attack those countries' governments  and
their motives.

President Mbeki described  the  decision  to  boycott  games  in  Kenya  and
Zimbabwe as ``political'' and he said it had nothing to  do  with  security.
Once again the ANC managed to  turn  a  sporting  matter  into  a  political
catfight.

The Minister of Sport and Recreation and the  ANC  Youth  League  were  very
quick to jump on the bandwagon and also accuse those countries of  promoting
a hidden agenda. [Interjections.] That is what  you  said!  [Interjections.]
With the decision to miss the Sharjah competition, perhaps the ANC will  now
understand once and for all that sport is best left in the hands  of  sports
administrators. South Africa's unfortunate run in the World Cup was  a  blow
to the country, but South Africans need to look no further  than  the  ANC's
entirely  political  agenda  of  transformation  for  the  reason  for  that
failure.

It was President Mbeki himself who  said  last  year,  ``for  two  or  three
years, let us not mind losing international  competitions,  because  we  are
bringing our people  into  those  teams''.  All  I  can  say  is:  Well,  Mr
President, you have got your wish. How does it feel?

Under the ANC, sport has become another political tool. In  marked  contrast
with the efficient, well-run Australian set-up, our administration,  led  by
the Minister of Sport and  Recreation,  is  defined  by  mismanagement,  bad
judgment and interference. Politics has no place in  sport!  Until  the  ANC
learns this, South African sport will continue to suffer. I thank you.

Mr B W DLAMINI: Chairperson, hon members, according to  a  survey  conducted
in 2000, there was an increase in the contribution of sports and  recreation
to the GDP from 1,9% to 2%. Its estimated worth was about R15 million.
According to the same survey, sports and recreation  provided  34 000  full-
time jobs and 16 000 part-time jobs, and made use of 8 000  volunteers.  The
Cricket World Cup Organising Committee expected to create 6 000 jobs  during
the World Cup.

In October 2001 the United Cricket Board of South  Africa  and  its  project
partners, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of Sport  and
Recreation, South African Breweries, Standard Bank and PPC  Cement  launched
the biggest sports development project ever seen  in  this  country,  namely
the Cricket Legacy 2003 project.

The project involved more than R25 million in  50  projects  throughout  the
country. At each oval involved some 50 jobs were created  for  a  period  of
four months. All  these  jobs  were  to  be  filled  by  local  communities,
including that of a full-time  curator  after  completion  of  the  project.
Government contributed R12 million to this project.

I want to say to the Minister of Sport and Recreation  and  other  Ministers
that the legacy of Cricket World Cup should carry on,  because  the  problem
with creating future Smiths and Cronjés lies with access  to  facilities.  I
think the Department of Sport and Recreation and  the  Department  of  Local
Government  should  sit  down  and  look  at  the  issue   of   access,   at
developmental level, to facilities, because it hinders development  at  that
level.

This illustrates that the hosting of major sports events in our  country  is
not only about entertainment  but  also  about  economic  benefits  for  our
people. Therefore, the IFP wishes to thank and congratulate  the  organising
committee, the police, the  volunteers  and  the  relevant  departments  for
making  this  Cricket  World  Cup  a  success.  Viva  South  Africa,   viva!
[Interjections.]

We are also taking this opportunity to plead that the Soccer World  Cup  bid
for 2010 should not be politicised. Let all of us, as South Africans,  rally
around the bid so that we succeed.  The  success  of  the  bid  is  not  for
political party A or B but for all of us as South Africans. [Applause.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Chairperson, participation  in  sport  is  one  way  to  unify
communities and build a united South Africa, and  also  to  break  down  old
outdated discriminatory practices.

But, as regards returning to the past old laagers and apartheid  formations,
the present crop of New NP MPs who crossed the floor to the almost  entirely
white DA opposition is clearly an indication that the DP/DA is returning  to
the past, and is  on  the  same  dead-end  road  as  Ian  Smith's  party  of
Zimbabwe. And the same will happen that happened to Ian Smith's party  which
is no  longer  in  existence:  short-term  successes,  but  total  long-term
oblivion. Co-operation is the only successful way  available  for  a  united
and successful South Africa.

The New NP also has a young, vibrant, visionary captain like  Graham  Smith,
the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk, whose  vision  includes  short-term  goals,
but whose vision also  stretches  far  beyond  the  2004-05  elections.  The
electorate cannot always  be  fooled  with  fight-back  strategies.  ``Fight
back'' against whom? Does it refer to the masses that represent 66%  of  the
electorate, and whose leaders are governing this country?

The New NP supports most of what the hon Minister  has  said.  South  Africa
has already benefited hugely, both economically and  through  the  fantastic
global awareness that has been created for South Africa by  the  hosting  of
the World Cup Cricket tournament.  Spin-offs  include  the  vast  number  of
international tourists and supporters who came to  South  Africa,  amounting
to approximately 25 000 people, who will also be our  ambassadors  on  their
return to their respective countries.

Millions of rands of profit were made from hosting the Cricket World Cup  in
South Africa, and will be partially be  directed  to  those  cricket  unions
which are currently struggling financially, in so doing empowering  them  to
improve cricket facilities such  as  pitches  and  to  employ  good  cricket
coaches, to name but two benefits.

I also want to congratulate the United Cricket Board of South Africa on  the
successful World Cup Cricket  tournament,  and  the  hon  Minister  and  his
department for their role and contribution to the success of the World  Cup.
It has shown, as the Minister has said, that  South  Africa  is  capable  of
hosting any big sporting event, like the World Cup Soccer tournament or  the
Olympic Games, to name but a few.

The only sad part of the World  Cup  Cricket  tournament  was  when  cricket
teams did not see their way clear to playing in  Zimbabwe  and  Kenya.  This
resulted in a skewed  final  section,  which  has  shown  that  as  soon  as
politics  creeps  into  sport,  you  can  expect  negative  results.   [Time
expired.]

Mr C T FROLICK: Chairperson and hon members, despite our general  dismay  at
the South African cricket team not performing up to their  standards,  there
is much value, Mr Minister, we can take away from this event.

Indeed, thousands of visitors and billions of television viewers  have  seen
various South African, Zimbabwean and Kenyan cities,  towns  and  landscapes
in all their splendour. They have witnessed the  dedication  and  spirit  of
our people, as was especially illustrated by  the  thousands  of  volunteers
who made this event happen. We applaud these South  Africans.  The  combined
result is that Africa has been showcased on a never-before-seen scale  as  a
premier and diverse tourist destination.

We must also acknowledge the organisers, under the leadership of Dr  Bacher,
for demonstrating that South Africa has the  know-how,  the  facilities  and
the management to stage a large international event spanning many weeks  and
numerous venues.

The Minister and the Government need to be supported and  congratulated  for
the splendid role you played in containing and resolving  management  issues
which arose during the course of the event. It is no longer a case of  South
African bids having to claim on paper that we can host these events. Now  we
have once again impressively and unequivocally proven our abilities.

Mr Minister, even in the face of  adversaries,  as  we  heard  earlier,  the
groundwork has been laid for the Soccer World Cup and many other  events  to
come to these shores. As Malcolm Grey, the president of  the  ICC,  said  at
the closing ceremony of the World Cup: ``The world called and  South  Africa
responded.''

Lastly, Mr Minister, I had the  opportunity  to  visit  one  of  the  legacy
projects last Saturday, when the Motherwell Cricket Club played  a  game  on
one of these grounds that were left behind  and  splendidly  developed.  You
could see that indeed a permanent  legacy  has  been  left  behind  for  the
disadvantaged people of this country. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Deputy Chairman and hon Minister, the ACDP  wishes  to
congratulate Dr Bacher and the ICC for making South Africa proud of a  well-
managed and successful World Cup. This event has placed South  Africa  among
the big contenders in hosting any  world  event,  as  we  have  proven  this
through our strong  administrative  and  organisational  skills.  The  tight
security plan for this World Cup, even amid serious international  setbacks,
was able to secure the safety of all players and tourists.

The level of competition  among  the  international  sides  was  of  a  high
standard and the fighting spirit of the Kenyan side, which ended up  in  the
semi-final, entertained the spectators. May I say that it  was  not  because
of the Duckworth-Lewis system, but because they got there  on  merit.  Most,
if not  all,  of  the  matches  were  well  supported  and  this  definitely
contributed positively to the economy.

The conduct of  our  President  of  the  UCB,  however,  brought  shame  and
disrepute. Fortunately the  success  of  the  World  Cup  overshadowed  this
negativity. We in the ACDP  hope  that  this  will  be  dealt  with  at  the
appropriate level.

The ACDP congratulates Shaun Pollock ... [Time expired.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, daar is  'n  Afrikaanse  spreekwoord
wat lui: ``Een vrot appel in 'n kas  maak  die  hele  kas  vrot''.  Die  agb
Minister kom spog hier met die pragtige beeld  wat  Suid-Afrika  geskep  het
met hierdie kriekettoernooi. Hy is reg, maar  die  een  vrot  appel  is  die
President van die Verenigde Krieketraad van Suid-Afrika, Adv Percy Sonn.  Sy
optrede het die hele beeld van Suid-Afrika skade gedoen. Hy is  nie  net  'n
skande vir homself nie, maar ook vir Suid-Afrika en  vir  krieket  in  Suid-
Afrika.
Die agb Minister is altyd so lief om in te meng met sport uit  'n  politieke
perspektief. Dit is tyd dat die Minister dan  ook  hierdie  Adv  Percy  Sonn
aanspreek en van hom ontslae raak, want hy is die vrot appel in die kas.  Hy
het nie net skandelik opgetree deur besope te wees  nie,  hy  het  nog  gaan
vloek op toeskouers ook, wat graag wou gesien het dat dit goed gaan  in  die
Wêreldbeker.  Dit  is  onaanvaarbaar.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   speech
follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairman, there is an Afrikaans  saying  which  goes:
``One bad apple in a crate infects the whole crateful''.  The  hon  Minister
has been bragging here about the wonderful image South  Africa  has  created
with this cricket tournament. He is right, but the  one  bad  apple  is  the
President of the United Cricket Board, Adv  Percy  Sonn.  His  actions  have
damaged South Africa's image altogether. He  is  a  disgrace,  not  only  to
himself, but to South Africa and to cricket in South Africa.

The hon Minister always  loves  to  interfere  in  sport  from  a  political
perspective. It is time the Minister spoke seriously to this Adv Percy  Sonn
and got rid of him, because he is the bad apple in the crate.  He  not  only
acted disgracefully by being drunk, he also went and  cursed  at  spectators
who would have liked to see that all is well  in  the  World  Cup.  That  is
unacceptable.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Chairperson, it is the Cricket World Cup  that  was.
National teams came, saw, but only the Australians won.  Congratulations  to
them.

We may have lost in the competition, but we have  made  a  statement.  South
Africans showed beyond doubt that the rainbow nation pulls in tandem.  There
were some hitches during the games, such as the inebriated behaviour of  the
likes of the UCB President, Percy Sonn. Our team,  the  Proteas,  seemed  to
have been dogged by misfortune by having two of their matches not played  to
the end, but with the results being declared draws owing to the rain.

The performance of the security officers was exquisite. The  men  and  women
in blue showed that they have gone through the mill. They have  proven  that
there is nothing to beat experience. No rank amateurs could  have  contained
the situation like Deputy  Commissioner  Pruis  and  his  men  did.  We  are
greatly indebted to them.

South Africa may have lost the match, but we have won a  greater  battle  in
that we have friends across the globe. We have won the respect  of  doubting
Thomases who thought the games would fail. A big cheer  to  Dr  Ali  Bacher,
executive director of the ICC Cricket World Cup.

The success of the tournament should serve as  a  yardstick  for  Fifa  when
considering the host for the 2010 Soccer World Cup. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chair, the  MF  would  firstly  like  to  thank  and
congratulate the South African team  on  their  admirable  performance.  You
have played well, in the spirit of your people. We  are  proud  of  you  and
wish you every success in your preparation for the challenges that the  team
shall face in the forthcoming year. Your are our team and we support you.

To the department and all who  were  involved  in  hosting  this  auspicious
event, the MF congratulates you on a superb event that  has  uplifted  South
Africa's status globally.  Having  hosted  the  event  without  hiccups  and
having attracted tourists from around the globe, the event is sure  to  have
raised revenue. The success of this event has also shown ours to be  a  safe
country with beauty that must be seen by  tourists.  To  everyone  who  came
from far, the MF bids you a safe journey home. It has indeed been an  honour
and privilege to have you visit our country.

We congratulate the Australians, who have taken the cup, on a  superb  game.
The MF applauds the hon the Minister, the volunteers and Dr  Bacher  on  the
success of this event. [Time expired.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, on  8  February  President  Mbeki  started  the
World Cup when he said: ``Let the games begin.''  I  think  that  six  weeks
later we can look back on a successful tournament.

Daar was teleurstellings, en ek vereenselwig my met diegene wat hul  misnoeë
uitgespreek het met adv Percy Sonn. Dit is ook jammer  dat  Suid-Afrika  nie
kon deurdring nie, maar dit is nie die Minister se skuld  as  Shaun  Pollock
nie kan tel nie. Daar is die probleme met Zimbabwe en Kenya en ons moet  dit
rêrig oorweeg of dit die risiko werd is.

Tog, dink ek, kyk ons terug en sal  die  Wêreldbeker  2003  uitstaan  as  'n
baken. Waar al daardie spanne nou ook al in die  wêreld  terugry  huis  toe,
dink ek hulle sê vir mekaar Suid-Afrika is 'n bakgat plek. Waarom  moet  ons
dan met mekaar baklei oor 'n suksesvolle toernooi wat verby is?

Die Nasionale Aksie glo nie aan die groot katastrofeteorie nie. Ons glo  nie
dat alles moet platval nie. Ons soek die sukses van Suid-Afrika en ons  wens
almal wat betrokke was baie geluk. Mag dit ook dien as 'n basis dat ons  die
toernooi van 2010 in Suid-Afrika kan  aanbied.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows)

[There were disappointments, and I can identify myself with those  who  have
expressed their displeasure with Adv Percy Sonn. It  is  also  a  pity  that
South Africa was unable to go through, but it is not  the  Minister's  fault
if Shaun Pollock cannot count. There are  the  problems  regarding  Zimbabwe
and Kenya and we will really have to consider whether it is worth the risk.

Still, I think, we can look back and World Cup 2003  will  stand  out  as  a
beacon. Wherever in the world all those teams  may  be  on  their  way  home
right now, I think they are telling each other that South Africa is a  great
place. Why  should  we  then  argue  with  each  other  about  a  successful
tournament that has ended?

The National Action does not believe in the great catastrophe theory. We  do
not believe that everything has to collapse.  We  are  searching  for  South
Africa's success and we wish everyone involved well. May this also serve  as
a basis to present the 2010 tournament in South Africa. [Applause.]]

Asikho-ke   isidingo   sokuzozenza   iqhalaqhala   lapha   ukhulume   izinto
esizozikhuluma sihlezi phansi, singabantu baseNingizimu Afrika.

Abantu  baseNingizimu  Afrika  kanye  nabantu   basemazweni   angomakhelwane
okuyiKenya neZimbabwe basebenze ngokukhulu ukuzinikela,  benzela  ukuthi  le
ndebe  ibe  yimpumelelo.  Ukusebenza   ngokubambisana   kwezinhlanga   zonke
zakuleli zwe ekwenzeni ukuthi le ndebe ibe  yimpumelelo  kugcwalisa  umbhalo
okusoMqulu weNkulukelo  i-Freedom  Charter,  othi  iNingizimu  Afrika  eyabo
bonke abahlala kuleli  zwe.  Ukudlalwa  kwale  ndebe  kwenze  ukuthi  abantu
abahlala  emakhaya   nasemalokishini   babe   nothando   olukhulu   lomdlalo
weqakamba. Bewuthola ogogo abadala bebonisa  ukuthi  sebeyaqonda  ukuthi  lo
mdlalo udlalwa kanjani.

Sebeyakwazi ukubona ukuthi kunemidlalo yendabuko edlalwa ngohlobo  olufanayo
nalo mdlalo weqakamba. Sebeyakwazi ukuthi i-Wicket bayifanise  nokuwisa  u-3
tin okuwumdlalo esiwudlalayo. I-Run  bayifanisa  nokugijima  kuthiwe  wafika
ekhaya.  I-Catch  bayifanisa  nokuthi  ubanjiwe,  sewufile  kumele  uphumele
ngaphandle.  I-Bowl  bebeyifanisa  nokuthi  uyashubhesha.  Lokho  kubonisile
ukuthi indlela abasakazi  abawusakaze  ngayo  lo  mdlalo  ngolimi  oluqondwa
ngabantu, kwenze nogogo  nabantu  abahlezi  emakhaya  bakwazi  ukuwubona  lo
mdlalo bawujabulele bakwazi nokuwulinganisa bawufanise neminye.

Abadlali   abavelele   bamaqembu   ahlukene   bebewundabuzekwayo   emakhaya,
begagulwa ngamagama abo.  Ezinye  izingane  bezize  zithi:  ``qhashi  qhashi
owami uBrian Lara''. Omunye athi: ``Owami uSteven  Tikolo''.  Angikhulumi-ke
ngoSachion noRicky  ungathi  bahlala  kuleli  zwe  ngendlela  abaziwa  ngayo
yintsha yasemakhaya neyasemadolobheni. Lokhu kubonisa  ukuthi  laba  badlali
babe  yisibonelo  esihle  kwintsha  yaleli  zwe  nokuthi  imidlalo  ineqhaza
elingakanani ekushintsheni  izimilo  nendlela  yokuziphatha  kwabantu  ngoba
abanye sebefisa ukuthi bazisondeze kubona bafane nabo.

Emakhaya sibone kuvuseleleka ukudlalwa  kwemidlalo  yendabuko  ecishe  ifane
nebhola leqakamba.  Sekuzoba  sezandleni  zezakhiwo  zemidlalo  nemiphakathi
esivela kuyo ukwenza ukuthi  izinga  lokuthanda  umdlalo  weqakamba  ligcine
liphezulu.  Izivakashi  nezethameli  ebezivela  kwamanye  amazwe   aziwuvali
umlomo ngendlela eziphathwe kahle ngayo lapha ekhaya. Bekuthi  lapho  bebuza
indlela, abantu bakithi  bangabakhombisi  nje  ngokukhomba  ngomunwe  ukuthi
hamba ushone le. Bebengabayaleli  futhi  ukuthi  uzojika  ngala  uthi  uthi.
Bebethi woza ngihambe nawe ngikuyise lapho. Lokhu-ke  kukhombise  inhlonipho
ephezulu  kwizivakashi  nobuntu  baseNingizimu  Afrika.  Siyabonga  kakhulu.
[Kwaphela isikhathi.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Ms N R NTSHULANA-BHENGU: Chairperson, the hon  Lee  has  clearly  shown  in
this House that the DP is a desperate political party because  he  fails  to
deal with the issue on the table. Instead he chooses to fight  the  Minister
and the politics of South African sports.  Hon  Lee,  we  are  talking  here
about the successful games which were hosted by South Africa  and  which  we
should all be proud of.

It is the same thing with hon Mulder over there;  he  is  not  even  in  the
committee on sports. Hon Mulder, we have ways through  which  we  deal  with
some unacceptable things that have happened. The  committee  will  sit  down
and hold a short session. We agreed on  this  with  the  cricket  committee.
Therefore, there is no need for you to arrogantly show off  and  talk  about
things that we will discuss in a meeting as South Africans.

The  people  of  South  Africa,  together  with  people  from   neighbouring
countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe, worked with great dedication in order  to
make these games a success. The working  together  of  people  of  different
races in order to make these games  a  success  is  the  fulfilment  of  the
clause in the Freedom Charter, which says that South Africa belongs  to  all
those who live in it. These  games,  as  they  were  played  here  in  South
Africa, have given people in townships and in the rural areas a  great  love
of cricket.

One found grannies showing how these games were played. They  are  now  able
to see that there are African  games  which  are  played  the  same  way  as
cricket. They can to relate wicket to 3-tin, a game that we  Africans  play.
They compare ``run'' to a game where you run and  other  people  would  say:
``Now you have arrived `home'.'' The ``catch'' is being compared to  a  game
where people say: ``Now you have been captured, you  are  dead.  Get  out.''
The ``bowl'' is compared to a game where one finishes all one's ``cows''  in
a circle on the ground.

This shows that the way media  announcers  have  broadcast  these  games  in
people's languages has made grannies and people in  the  rural  areas  watch
and enjoy them, and even compare them to other games.

Outstanding players are very popular in the  homes  of  our  peoples.  These
players were called by their names. Some children said: ``Hey, Brian  is  my
favourite.'' Others said: ``My favourite is Steven Tikolo'', not to  mention
Sachin and Ricky. One might think that they live in  this  country  the  way
they are so popular in the rural areas and  in  the  townships.  This  shows
that these players were good examples to the youth of this  country  and  it
also shows  how  big  a  role  is  played  by  sport  in  changing  people's
behaviour, because some now wish to be like these players.

In the rural areas we saw the renewal of traditional games like  soccer  and
cricket. Now it is going to be for the sport structures in  our  communities
to raise the standard at which cricket is supported.

Visitors and spectators from other countries  greatly  appreciated  the  way
they were treated here at home. If one needed  directions,  our  people  did
not just show the person by pointing with a finger,  saying:  ``Go  there''.
They also did not say: ``Turn there and there''. They said: ``Come,  I  will
take you there''. This showed a great level of respect to our  visitors.  It
also showed ubuntu in South Africa. We thank you very much for  this.  [Time

                  THE CONTRIBUTION OF WOMEN TO THE ECONOMY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Thank you, Chairperson and hon members. I am  very
honoured to be participating in this debate on the best ways to account  for
women's contribution to the economy and the general welfare of society,  and
to assess its full value.

Addressing the Commission on the Status  of  Women  as  it  began  its  47th
session, Mr Desai stressed that the commission has a special  role  to  play
in reaching gender equality and a responsibility to developmental issues  as
a whole. He emphasized the link between the commission's work and  the  work
covered by such major conferences as the Second  World  Assembly  on  Aging,
the  Monterey  World  Conference  on  Financing  for  Development,  and  the
Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development.

Echoing Mr Desai's  sentiments,  Angela  King,  special  adviser  to  United
Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan on gender issues  and  the  advancement
of women, said the goals were mutually reinforcing,  with  progress  towards
one affecting any headway towards the others. The  theme  for  international
Women's Day, ``Gender  Equality  and  the  Millennium  Development  Goals'',
aimed to create an awareness of gender equality  with  respect  to  all  the
goals, and to stress the importance of  gender  dimensions  in  poverty  and
hunger eradication. It is obvious that the new century  has  to  bring  back
the people in the  processes  and  institutions  of  democratic  governments
through the feminisation of the  political  space.  Making  our  democracies
increasingly inclusive and genuinely representative is the  basic  task  for
the new century.

Only after bringing  back  the  people,  particularly  the  women,  we  will
succeed in saving democracy from the forces of terror. It will also make  us
more effective in eliminating three major challenges of our  times:  hunger,
violence and war. All three have devastating effects in every  society,  but
they hurt the women more.

Mahatma Gandhi, in his observation in the then young India  in  1918,  said,
and I quote:


  Woman is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental  capacities.  She
  has the right to participate in the minutest details of activities of man
  and she has the same right of freedom and liberty as he. By  sheer  force
  of a vicious system and custom even the most ignorant and  worthless  men
  have been enjoying superiority over women, which they do not deserve  and
  ought not to have.

Women matter in the  affairs  of  human  society.  Our  struggle  for  equal
representation in politics and decision-making is a  response  to  the  most
critical need for creating human social order free of hunger,  violence  and
conflict. With the eradication of poverty as our urgent  task,  we  must  at
the same time advance continuously towards social transformation.

Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration  in  2000,  the  Millennium
Development Goals now stand  at  the  centre  of  international  development
corporations and national agendas. Of the eight goals, goal  3  specifically
addresses gender equality and empowerment of women. While  it  is  important
to develop innovative and feasible  strategies  to  realise  this  goal,  we
firmly  believe  that  gender  equality  concerns  are  highly  relevant  to
achieving  all  the  other  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  should   be
effectively incorporated. Our important task now in  the  implementation  of
these goals is how we engender all processes of implementation and adopt  an
integrated and gender- mainstreaming approach to attaining  all  the  goals.
This task confronts us and we must deal with it effectively.

The Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action adopted  unanimously  at
the Fourth World Conference of Women in 1995  by  representatives  from  189
countries reflect a new international commitment to the goals  of  equality,
development and peace for all women everywhere. The platform  identifies  12
areas of concern, considered to represent  the  main  obstacles  to  women's
advancement. One such obstacle is  the  best  way  to  account  for  women's
contribution to the economy and the  general  welfare  of  society,  and  to
assess it at its full value.

Women contribute significantly to economic life everywhere. Their  share  in
the  labour  force  continues  to  increase.  Their   income   is   becoming
increasingly necessary to all households. However, women are largely  absent
from economic decision-making. They face low wages, poor working  conditions
and  limited  employment  and  professional  opportunities.   Though   women
contribute to development through paid and unpaid work, their  unpaid  work,
such as domestic and community work, is not measured in  quantitative  terms
and not valued in national accounts.

Discrimination in education and training, remuneration,  and  promotion,  as
well  as  inflexible  working  conditions,  lack  of  access  to  productive
resources and inadequate sharing of family  responsibilities  contribute  to
restricted employment, economic and professional opportunities for women.

Chapter 6 of the Beijing Platform for Action identifies 12 focus  areas  for
action, and women and the economy is  one  of  them.  This  focuses  on  the
following: the  promotion  of  women's  economic  rights  and  independence,
access  to  employment  and  appropriate  working  conditions;  facilitating
women's equal access to resources, employment markets and  trade;  providing
business  services,  training  and  access  to  markets,   information   and
technology,  particularly  to  low-income   women;   strengthening   women's
economic  capacity  and  commercial   networks;   eliminating   occupational
segregation  and  all  forms  of  employment  discrimination;  and  finally,
promoting the harmonisation of work and family  responsibilities  for  women
and men.

Women work more hours than men. They are responsible  for  between  51%  and
53% of the workloads all around the world.  Nevertheless,  their  income  is
lower. The higher their  qualification  and  their  occupational  rank,  the
higher also is the salary gap, a  phenomenon  which  therefore  affects  not
only the poorest women, and those from Southern  countries  like  ourselves,
but also qualified and higher-income women in the Northern countries.

Gender inequality is evidenced more harshly and clearly in  education.  Even
though there has been relative progress in schooling and  retention  in  the
entire world, two thirds of the estimated 876 million illiterate people  are
women.

We must develop research on women's input into the economy. There is a  need
for appropriate statistical tools and sex-desegregated data  to  assess  and
value women's unpaid work. Men and women alike must ensure  that  women  are
part of economic decision-making, as they already are  the  building  blocks
of economies; fight inequality of working conditions and  advantages;  fight
abusive behaviour towards women; and strengthen women's access  to  training
and technology.

To strengthen our democracies in the world, we need to advocate  for  strong
institutions and supporting social equality of opportunities  for  both  men
and  women,  in  other  words,  equality  of  gender  with  a  great  social
foundation and without exclusions.

In that context,  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  constitutes  a
challenge of high priority in which it is crucial to provide a central  part
for women in the elaboration of the strategies and the development of  their
capacities, as well as the execution of policies and programmes designed  to
that end. We must continue to support the execution of such  programmes  and
projects in order to improve the skills  and  abilities  of  women  who  are
already contributing a lot towards the economy. Without these  skills,  they
live in situations of poverty, and yet their contribution to development  is
immense. They need the skills.
Governments and other stakeholders should provide the  necessary  conditions
to ensure women's equal access to information  and  knowledge,  as  well  as
their equal role as producers and decision-makers in all aspects related  to
the shaping of information technology policies and frameworks.

The convening of the World Summit on the Information Society,  or  WSIS,  by
the United Nations is a unique opportunity to focus global attention on  the
building of an information  society  that  is  based  on  goals  of  social,
political and economic justice, sustainable human development,  support  for
democracy,  participation  and  empowerment,  and  gender  equality.   Equal
partnerships of governments, United Nations  agencies,  the  private  sector
and civil society can make  a  meaningful  contribution  to  achieving  this
goal.

I met with a number  of  women  in  New  York  a  few  weeks  ago,  as  they
celebrated their achievements. I remarked how  lucky  I  was,  because  what
they were celebrating, I celebrate tenfold or  hundredfold  in  my  country.
I'm proud to be a South African.

In Bahrain, the women told us that eight women stood for elections. None  of
them won, but they were celebrating that two  managed  to  make  it  to  the
second round. It's so touching. In Djibouti, this year in January  they  had
an election and for the first time they managed to produce seven women  MPs,
and they were celebrating. This happened in January 2003.

Sometimes  religion  and  culture  are  used  as  impediments   to   women's
development. Some Arab countries were celebrating. Morocco  was  celebrating
because for the first time  10,3%  of  members  in  parliament  were  women.
Algeria has 24 women MPs and they had  every  reason  to  celebrate  because
before they had only 12 women MPs. Jordan had to amend its  laws  to  create
six seats for women. You look at these women who are  celebrating  something
that for a South African is  nothing  to  be  celebrated,  and  you  say  to
yourself: ``Am I not proud to be a South African?''

I was actually happy that I was representing  the  Interparliamentary  Union
so I had no reason to speak about South Africa, because it would  have  come
across as if I was bragging if I told  them  how  many  women  Ministers  we
have, how many women Deputy Ministers, and how many  women  chairpersons  of
Parliament. Because I had a certain mandate, I felt  that  I  would  not  be
bragging; otherwise it would have come across as if I was bragging.

And yet we know that it is still not enough.  I  happen  to  be  part  of  a
delegation that met with women from Saudi Arabia. These are women who  don't
even  choose  their  partners  because  of  arranged  marriages   in   their
countries. These are women who do not choose what they want to wear. When  I
go to shop, I choose what I want and nobody tells  me  to  cover  a  certain
part of my body. But they have to cover themselves. Men choose whether  they
may go to school or not. They obey their father,  their  husband  and  their
son, and only then do they come into the picture.

These are the women who came to meet us as the IPU  executive,  to  ask  for
inclusion of Saudi Arabia at the IPU. Of course we  refused  to  have  Saudi
Arabia as a member of the Interparliamentary Union because the statute  says
very clearly that if women are not allowed to  vote  in  your  country,  you
should not even think of becoming a member  of  the  IPU.  You  cannot  talk
about democracy when you leave the majority of people outside.

I want to thank the ANC-led Government and all of you  for  being  vocal  on
gender issues. We are a shining star. Let us go out there  and  teach  other
people that by having women in their rightful  places,  you  can  only  make
things better. [Applause.] I still have to see a group of  people  who  will
say that if you have  a  woman  in  a  decision-making  position,  she  will
disappoint you. [Applause.]

Only yesterday we met with a group from the fishing companies. They had  the
men talking to me for two and a half hours. We could not  get  any  solution
and I said: ``You better go away and we will meet  some  other  time.''  But
they went away and came back with a different strategy. They had  two  women
to speak on their behalf and the meeting lasted thirty  minutes!  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member. You  were  able
to say all that and save ten seconds!

Mrs G M BORMAN: Deputy Chairperson, Carol Burnett said:  ``If  it  were  not
for women, men would still be wearing last weeks' socks!'' [Laughter.]

It is widely recognised today that women fulfil much  more  important  roles
than merely sweetening up men's socks. Firstly, what is  not  recognised  is
that women who choose to be homemakers and  family  nurturers  make  a  huge
indirect contribution to the economy in these roles.  A  woman  invests  her
time in the training of her children and the managing of her  home.  Despite
all the social changes of the last few decades, the nuclear family is  still
the basic unit of society. Families grow people. Families consume goods  and
services.  Families  inculcate  values,  maintain  traditions  and  engender
awareness of culture. Women are the engines of these family units.

Secondly, as consumers women make  another  very  big  contribution  to  the
economy. It is they who are the objects of mass  marketing.  Women's  tastes
influence the kinds of goods that manufacturers produce. Food  manufacturers
target women in their advertising because they  appreciate  the  nutritional
value of different products. Pharmaceutical companies know  that  women  are
the  guardians  of  their  families'  health   and   beam   their   messages
accordingly.

Women balance the housekeeping budgets and it is just as well that they  do.
Let a women take her husband shopping at the supermarket and she soon  finds
the trolley filling with luxury foods and the bill going through the roof.

The third way in which women contribute to the  economy  is  by  working  in
industry, business, the professions and government.  Women  are  putting  on
the yellow helmets and competing in traditionally male fields.  The  Sowetan
yesterday carried the headline ``Woman contractor in major prison revamp'':


  The Government's women empowerment drive bore fruit when Minister  Stella
  Sigcau visited Johannesburg's Leeukop Prison, where a R19 million  revamp
  project  by  black  woman  contractor  Stephina  Moloko  has  just   been
  completed.

The report went on to say that Moloko is one of the women making up  10%  of
the country's more than 3 000 registered emerging contractors in  the  male-
dominated R37 billion a year industry. We as women  parliamentarians  salute
all the Molokos out there. There is an increasing  number  of  them  in  all
fields of human endeavour. [Applause.]

In the textile industry, women make up 80% of the workforce. They work  long
hours.  They  do  repetitive  work,  frequently  under   difficult   working
conditions. In the field  of  health  care,  women  run  hospitals,  perform
highly skilled professional nursing and ensure  that  other  workers  return
speedily to the coalface after illness. In the  field  of  education,  women
fill a high percentage of teaching positions in schools, thus  training  the
nation's workforce to make its contribution to the economy.

We can never mention the contribution  of  women  without  highlighting  the
role of domestic servants. This workforce is a million strong. It  is  often
underpaid and  cruelly  exploited.  Nevertheless,  it  generates  some  R800
million  a  month,  which  provides  income  in  the   poorest   households.
Furthermore, these women  release  hundreds  of  thousands  of  skilled  and
highly trained women to enter the labour market. In reality,  they  are  the
unsung  heroines  of  the  South  African   economy,   notwithstanding   the
difficulty of finding one because, as Pieter-Dirk Uys says, they are all  in
Parliament.

Many women face the continuous challenge of having to balance  homelife  and
being out in the workplace - running a home, bringing up children,  managing
the budget, feeding the family, doing the shopping, being a wife.  Balancing
all that against a full  day's  work,  often  very  demanding,  helps  women
become multitaskers, says Kim McFarland  of  Investec.  But  the  challenges
facing women in making their contribution to the economy are enormous.

Women will continue to make an even bigger contribution to  the  economy  in
the future. How significant that contribution will be, will  depend  on  how
they themselves define it and equip themselves for it. I thank you.
Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Deputy Chairperson, hon  members,  the  IFP  expresses  its
support for this debate, as we live  in  a  society  where  male  chauvinism
constantly rears its ugly head, especially in the workplace.  We  have  made
real progress in empowering women in the economy, but there is  much  to  be
done.

Women's economic history in South  Africa  tells  a  sad  tale  of  economic
exclusion, isolation and exploitation. However,  we  need  to  take  another
step forward and look at the many women who are in  the  invisible  economy,
those women who are responsible for human production, the nurturing of  life
and the care of others. It is these women who protect life,  and  this  work
is unpaid and goes unnoticed.

Of course, there  have  been  achievements  for  women,  such  as  maternity
benefits, UIF, family responsibility rights and equity legislation. But  the
real crunch is  that  unemployment  is  growing  like  an  annoying  fungus.
Yesterday Statistics SA released findings that unemployment was  rising.  In
a separate report it was found that women  workers  tend  to  have  a  lower
absenteeism rate and lower levels of alcohol abuse at work.

There are also too many locked gates keeping women out of employment. It  is
explicit that any economic policy needs to be hypersensitive  to  the  needs
of women. But women also need to  act,  experiment,  implement  and  develop
initiatives. It is the IFP who has  steadfastly  called  for  self-reliance,
constantly urging women to take bold and new approaches.  The  IFP  believes
that there needs  to  be  an  impact  study  on  Government's  macroeconomic
strategy and its impact on the empowerment of women.  As  I  understand  it,
empowerment is about developing mechanisms,  pathways  and  people  so  that
access to the mainstream economy is a real possibility.

Financial institutions need to do more. Women need more access  to  capital.
Coupled  with  this,  there  needs  to  be  an  equitable  evaluation  using
yardsticks other than money, like promotion and ownership  of  companies.  A
quick glance at the Public Service exhibits that there  are  still  too  few
women in top management levels.

So, the picture is really simple. Males still have a disproportionate  share
of the wealth and females a  disproportionate  share  of  poverty.  But  the
larger  picture  becomes  even  more  complex.  How  does  one  classify  an
investment fund or a listed company in terms of race and gender,  especially
when online facilities make selling and exchange of ownership so  easy?  How
do you enact or transfer ownership without discouraging  foreign  investors?
How do you avoid enriching a select  few?  How  do  you  ensure  that  women
become part of the mainstream economy? How do you ensure the empowerment  of
poor women and not just the intelligentsia? These are some of the  important
issues we as parliamentarians constantly have to grapple with.

For all my male colleagues  who  seem  to  think  that  there  is  too  much
emphasis and debate on women's issues, I would like  to  leave  you  with  a
quote by Nancy Reagan, who once said that a woman is like a tea bag  -  only
when she is in hot water does she realise how strong she is. And to all  the
women  I  want  to  say:  Halala,  mantombozana!  [Congratulations,  girls!]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, and I hope more women  will
be in hot water. It appeared to me that the hon  Borman  was  in  hot  water
with the hon  Ellis,  but  the  Chair  will  provide  the  hon  Borman  with
protection if that is the situation.

Mev ANNA VAN WYK: Mnr die Voorsitter,  eerder  as  om  die  statistieke  oor
vroue in die ekonomie aan te haal, wil ek net enkele punte  beklemtoon.  Die
verwydering  van  diskriminasie  teen  die  vrou  staan  nog  maar   in   sy
kinderskoene, en die armste van armes is vroue.
Baie van die vrou se deelname in die ekonomie  word  onderskat,  indien  nie
heeltemal geïgnoreer nie, want dit kan  nie  maklik  gemeet  word  deur  die
gebruiklike dataversamelingstelsels nie. Werk  soos  die  instandhouding  en
bestuur van die  tuiste  en  huishouding,  kinderopvoeding,  versorging  van
bejaardes en siekes, die haal van  water  en  brandhout,  én  die  kweek  en
voorsiening van voedsel, sowel  as  informele  handel  en  ruilhandel,  word
merendeels nog nie as ekonomiese aktiwiteite beskou  nie  en  kan  nie  deur
ongenuanseerde meetinstrumente bepaal word nie.  Sonder  hierdie  onbetaalde
werk kan 'n gemeenskap egter nie oorleef nie.

Buigsaamheid in die arbeidsmark is een van  die  onvermydelike  gevolge  van
globalisering en dit lei  enersyds  tot  mededingende  omstandighede  waarin
geleenthede tot onregverdige uitbuiting volop voorkom,  maar  andersyds  ook
daartoe lei dat vroue 'n meer integrale en toenemend onmisbare deel van  die
globale ekonomie word.

Die ekonomiese  bemagtiging  van  vroue  vind  'n  onmiddellike  en  direkte
neerslag tot die voordeel van die gesin en die gemeenskap,  terwyl  dit  nié
in dieselfde mate die geval is met betrekking tot mans nie.  Waar  spesifiek
vroue nie verseker is van 'n volhoubare minimum inkomste nie, dra hulle  die
armoede aan hul  kinders  oor,  wat  lei  tot  die  chroniese  of  endemiese
armoedeverskynsel.  Maatreëls  om  armoede  te  bestry,  lewer   die   beste
resultate waar vroue in die  eerste  instansie  benader  word  as  ekonomies
aktiewe deelnemers en nie passiewe ontvangers nie.

Terwyl die nie-formele  ekonomie  'n  reuse  groeisektor  in  die  opkomende
wêreld is, is die deelname van  vroue  besuide  die  Sahara  in  dié  sektor
groter as die van die man.  Daar  is  'n  groter  gebrek  aan  opleiding  en
geletterdheid onder vroue  as  onder  mans.  Dít  is  die  breë  agtergrond.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Mr Chairperson, rather than quoting statistics  on  women
in the economy, I just want to  emphasise  a  few  points.  The  removal  of
discrimination against women is only in its infancy, and the poorest of  the
poor are women.

Female participation in the economy is largely undervalued, if  not  totally
ignored, because it is not  easy  to  measure  when  employing  conventional
systems of data collection. Jobs such as the maintenance and  management  of
homes  and  households,  child-rearing,  care  of  the  aged   and   sickly,
collection of water and firewood,  and  the  cultivation  and  provision  of
food, as well as informal trade and barter, are mostly  still  not  regarded
as economic activities  and  cannot  be  determined  by  ungraded  measuring
instruments. Yet without this unpaid work a community cannot survive.

Flexibility in the labour market is one of the unavoidable  consequences  of
globalisation, leading to competitive circumstances in  which  opportunities
for unfair exploitation abound on the one hand,  but  which  lead  to  women
becoming a more integral and increasingly indispensable part of  the  global
economy on the other.

The economic empowerment of women does have an immediate and  direct  impact
to the advantage of the family and the community,  while  this  is  not  the
case to the same degree in respect of men. Where women, in  particular,  are
not assured of a sustainable minimum wage, they  transfer  this  poverty  to
their children,  which  leads  to  the  phenomenon  of  chronic  or  endemic
poverty. Measures towards poverty alleviation yield the best  results  where
women are approached, firstly, as economically active participants  and  not
as passive recipients.

While the informal economy is an enormous growth sector in  the  new  world,
the participation of women south of the Sahara  in  this  sector  is  bigger
than that of men. There is a greater lack of training and  literacy  amongst
women than amongst men. This is the general background.]

One of the principles contained in  the  Constitutive  Act  of  the  African
Union is the promotion of gender equality, and included  under  the  section
``The new political will of African leaders'' in Chapter III  of  the  Nepad
programme, it says:


  To  achieve  these  objectives,   African   leaders   will   take   joint
  responsibility for the following ...

And then a list follows, including:


  Promoting the role  of  women  in  social  and  economic  development  by
  reinforcing their capacity in the domains of education and  training;  by
  the development of  revenue-generating  activities  through  facilitating
  access to credit; and by assuring their participation  in  the  political
  and economic life of African countries.

Sectoral Priorities lists among its objectives: ``To give special  attention
to the reduction of poverty among women''.

It is to the  credit  of  our  country  that  much  has  been  done  through
legislation and various other measures to give flesh  to  this  undertaking.
Here I would like to acknowledge  particularly  the  role  played  by  black
women in South Africa to achieve this. They are indeed  the  forerunners  on
the continent in the emancipation of  African  women,  and  their  expertise
needs to be  deployed  far  more  actively  and  extensively  to  assist  in
attaining the objectives of the AU and Nepad, for much still remains  to  be
done here, as well as to  the  north,  in  respect  of  the  liberation  and
empowerment of women. Through them could  come  the  emancipation  of  whole
nations in Africa.

Dit moet egter gesê word dat die bemagtiging van vroue  vir  baie  mans,  en
selfs hele kulture, as  'n  bedreiging  ervaar  word,  en  die  reaksie  van
verontwaardiging  en  argwaan  dan  in  'n  verskeidenheid  van  maatskaplik
negatiewe gevolge neerslag vind. Dat dit op die ou end ten  nadele  van  die
hele gemeenskap en streek strek, weeg nie op  teen  'n  onderliggende  vrees
vir magsverlies nie.

Ek hoop hierdie boekie - en ek het hom 'n vorige keer  ook  vir  u  gewys  -
word iewers in leerplanne ingewerk, selfs op laerskoolvlak al. Dit sal  help
om die konsensus waaromheen alle burgers in hierdie land moet  saamwerk,  te
motiveer, bekend te maak en om aanvaarding daarvoor te kry. Suid-Afrika  het
mos eenvoudig geen keuse as om mense opgehef te kry nie, en daarvoor is  die
vrou sy mees direkte instrument. Dit geld in 'n nog groter mate in  die  res
van Afrika. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It must be said, however, that the empowerment of women is  experienced  by
many men, and even whole cultures, as a threat, and  that  the  reaction  of
indignation and mistrust then  has  an  impact  upon  a  range  of  socially
negative consequences. That this can, in the long run, be to  the  detriment
of the whole community and region does not weigh up  against  an  underlying
fear of loss of power.

I hope that this booklet - and I have shown it  to  you  once  before  -  is
added to the curricula somewhere, even already at primary school  level.  It
will help with the motivation  and  introduction  of,  and  the  gaining  of
acceptance for, the consensus on which all citizens  in  this  country  must
work together. Surely South Africa  has  simply  no  option  but  to  uplift
people, for which the woman is its  most  direct  instrument.  This  applies
even more to the rest of Africa.]

And may I say, just on a lighter note, that our  Parliament  looks  a  great
deal better for the presence of so many women. Just  generally  speaking,  I
find them much prettier, I think, than most men.

There is  another  action  that  this  Government  and  Parliament  need  to
undertake expeditiously, and that is, in line with  the  stipulations  under
Poverty Reduction on page 119, to establish -


  ... a gender task team to ensure that the specific issues faced  by  poor
  women are addressed in  the  poverty  reduction  strategies  of  the  New
  Partnership for Africa's Development.

I stand to be corrected, but as far as I know this has not  been  done  yet.
In my  view  such  a  task  team  should  not  be  lumped  under  the  usual
politically correct heading of ``gender issues'', but should include,  among
others, people who have real  power,  political  will  and  economic  clout.
Thank you.

Ms N C NKABINDE: Deputy Chair, hon members, the  contribution  of  women  to
the economy can be distilled into two simple questions.  Firstly,  are  jobs
created for women? And secondly, are opportunities  provided  for  women  to
create jobs?

In this country we often speak about equality and the will of the  majority.
Women are the majority of the population, yet they do not have equal,  never
mind proportional, access to jobs or economic participation.

Women are still  excluded  through  institutional  and  cultural  practices,
despite the laws that are passed. Women are still expected to  be  primarily
responsible for tasks which limit  their  time  and  skills  development  to
noneconomic or informal activities.  Even  where  women  are  considered  as
economic participants it is often  within  strongly  demarcated  boundaries.
For instance, women are commonly  encouraged  to  become  nurses  or  social
workers, but not to become surgeons. Or women may become secretaries or tea-
ladies, but not the director of finance. Every profession and  position  has
its virtue, and there is no shame in being a  nurse,  but  we  should  never
blindly assume that  women  should  have  their  economic  choices  limited,
irrespective of the individual woman's capacity and interests.

It is not all doom and gloom. Yes, despite the  barriers,  many  women  have
reached the highest levels in many sectors of the economy,  but  sadly  they
are a small minority among millions of women who continue to be excluded.

If we acknowledge that the role of women in the economy is about jobs,  then
we must also acknowledge that the employment of women is still  unacceptably
low. Even the  Government  itself  does  not  have  a  public  service  that
adequately represents women across all post levels.

Jobs and job-creating opportunities for women are  often  mentioned  in  the
same breath as small business development. The UDM fully endorses  the  view
that small business is a major key to job and wealth creation.  However,  we
must look at the reality on the ground and  recognise  that  specific  steps
will have to be taken in order to provide fair and equal access for women.

According  to  the  1999  statistics  of  Ntsika,  Government's  enterprise-
promotion agency, self-employment  for  women  across  all  sectors  of  the
economy is low. On average, women constitute only 41% of  all  self-employed
people in the formal economy. In specific economic  sectors  self-employment
by women is very low. For instance, it is 25% in  finance,  insurance,  real
estate and business  services,  and  only  11%  in  transport,  storage  and
communication.

It is fine and well for us to speak eloquently about economic  opportunities
for women, but in the end we have a duty to recognise the barriers,  and  to
actively remove them. I thank you.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Deputy Chair, the hallmark of a truly democratic  society
is that it is one where women play an active role in shaping the destiny  of
their nation. South Africa is such a nation. Women from all  walks  of  life
and  cultures  are  weaving  their  inherent  strength  of  character   into
business, politics and the social fabric of this nation. Women  have  always
been hard workers. Families rely  on  the  maternal  strength  of  a  woman.
Society in general relies on the sensitive powers of women's  authority.  In
business, women enhance the quality of client relations. These are  some  of
the contributory factors which women provide and that a  democratic  society
can ill afford not to possess.

There are many women who successfully manage companies  today  that  provide
incentives to others  to  follow  suit.  Every  effort  should  be  made  by
Government to support women's empowerment in business.  Women  are  just  as
successful in business as men, not because they are in opposite  camps,  but
essentially since they complement each other  in  their  distinct  views  on
business operations.

Every year we celebrate women's  achievements  in  business.  At  all  those
occasions we enjoy the great  business  character  that  women  add  to  the
economic model of this nation. In this light, I would like  to  pay  tribute
to Ursula Fredericks - one of the many women who has found a  niche  in  the
motor  industry  amidst  huge  obstacles  such  as  racism,  chauvinism  and
discrimination by financial institutions. She has proven to  be  a  valuable
asset and contributor to our economy.

There are still certain constraints that reduce the effectiveness  of  women
in business. I would just like to mention a few: a cultural perception  that
women are nonviable as  an  economically  active  group;  limited  education
opportunities  focusing  on  women's  business   programmes;   and   limited
financial access to banking institutions. We need to do more  as  Government
to create an environment where young people,  especially  young  women,  are
encouraged to enter in disciplines that will empower  their  entrepreneurial
capacity.

To all women who wish to enter business: We encourage you to seize the  day.
Carpe diem! [Time expired.]

Mr M M CHIKANE: Chairperson ... [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The  hon  member  appears  to  be  the
second most popular person in Parliament.

Mr M M CHIKANE: Chairperson, especially with women.

Women's contribution to social welfare and economic progress in  society  is
incalculable but often largely invisible. The assessment of the  full  value
of women's contribution to the economy and the general  welfare  of  society
is extremely difficult, because much  of  their  contribution  is  generally
undervalued and unacknowledged. Overwhelmingly, their  contribution  is  not
visible to society at large, because  it  takes  place  outside  the  formal
economy and often within the confines of the family unit.

Regarding  the  assessment  of  the  full  value  of  women's  socioeconomic
contribution in general, society does not give  proper  recognition  to  the
social and economic contribution of  women,  as  much  of  women's  work  is
unpaid. Instead, society attaches a superior value to  women's  contribution
as part of the paid workforce. As a consequence,  the  social  and  economic
value of the following contributions generally have low  value  attached  to
them: within a family - as primary caregiver to minor  children,  especially
orphans;  as  caregiver  to  aged  relatives;  as  caregiver   to   disabled
relatives; as caregiver to relatives suffering from chronic illness such  as
TB and so forth; and as provider of domestic labour.

In addition to the  fact  that  these  forms  of  unpaid  labour  are  often
undervalued and unacknowledged by  society,  the  economic  value  of  their
contribution is generally not officially  acknowledged  by  governments.  In
rural areas women's social and economic contributions include the  following
roles: collector of dung or wood for fuel; collector  of  water  for  family
use; gatherer of wild plants for consumption, for purposes of  medicine  and
other use; contributor to agricultural development and  food  security;  and
manager and protector of the natural environment.

As a result of this unpaid contribution by  women,  women  shoulder  burdens
which in many cases would have been the responsibility  of  Government.  For
example, women's role as  unpaid  caregivers  enables  many  governments  to
evade their responsibility with regard to health and  social  welfare.  This
applies particularly to developing  countries  where  women,  in  particular
rural women, play an important role as producers of  food  and  contributors
to food security. They also spend a large part of their day  gathering  wood
and fetching water from sources that are often a great distance  from  their
homes.

With regard to access to water,  it  should  be  noted  that  in  Africa  14
countries are subject to water stress or water scarcity, and  a  further  11
will join them by 2025. The implications of  this  situation  for  all  poor
people in Africa, but especially for women, are obvious, since it  is  their
unpaid work which ensures that  these  basic  needs  are  met  and  services
provided.

While it is as a result of women's contribution that  many  governments  are
able to avoid spending  on  the  financial  resources  required  to  provide
access to a  range  of  socioeconomic  services  to  alleviate  poverty  and
hunger, their contribution is  seldom  acknowledged  or  given  an  economic
value. Thus, women in subsistence agriculture are not even included  in  the
South African workforce figures.

Women make a significant contribution to  the  informal  economy,  often  as
sellers of  goods  which  they  either  produce  themselves  or  which  they
purchase and resell. Women tend  to  be  concentrated  in  the  home  crafts
trade, hawking and personal services industries.  Women  are  active  within
the informal sector because its unregulated nature enables them to enter  it
with  great  ease.   Working   within   the   informal   sector   is   often
disadvantageous to women, as they are often constrained by factors  such  as
harassment by officials, difficulties in accessing the marketplace and  lack
of access to capital.

It is difficult to assess  women's  contribution  to  the  informal  economy
precisely  because  of   its   unregulated   nature.   Nevertheless,   their
participation in this sector is often  all  that  stands  between  them  and
poverty. It is the mechanism that enables many women and their  families  to
survive.

Within the formal economy, historically men  dominate  the  more  profitable
sectors of finance, construction and value-added  manufacturing.  Women  are
found at  the  lower,  subordinate  end  of  the  enterprise  spectrum.  For
example, women are concentrated in the soft  goods  sector,  with  a  strong
presence of 50% in the textile and clothing sector, and 35% in the food  and
beverage sector. Women have a 5% presence in the construction  industry  and
a 10% presence in manufacturing of metal products and machinery. Within  the
small, medium, and micro enterprise spectrum, women are concentrated in  the
survivalist sectors, totalling 42%. In the rural areas the gender  disparity
is even greater.
The contribution of women within the formal economy is  characterised  by  a
number of factors. Firstly, they tend to congregate in  the  orphan  sectors
of the economy, for example in service  rather  than  production.  Secondly,
women tend to congregate in certain jobs within each  sector.  But  in  both
instances women find themselves accorded less value,  lower  pay  and  fewer
benefits.

The most important distinguishing characteristic about the participation  of
women in the economy, however, is  that  they  operate  under  a  number  of
constraints. The most obvious of these  constraints  is  the  discrimination
which exists against women. Even where women perform  the  same  task,  they
often receive  lower  pay  and  fewer  benefits  than  men.  Throughout  the
economy, women are most likely to be employed in temporary, casual or  part-
time positions. It may therefore be said that discrimination  against  women
and their exclusion from the economy have  hampered  their  contribution  to
the economy.

Other constraints include the following: lack of mobility in the economy  as
a result of no access to capital; lack of technical and  managerial  skills;
and lack of access to the  credit  market,  raw  material  and  the  service
necessary to grow and expand. It is little wonder therefore that  male-owned
and -controlled enterprises outnumber those owned and  controlled  by  women
by more than three to one.

In conclusion, given the context of this discrimination, numerous  obstacles
in the path of women regarding the  economy,  and  the  lack  of  value  and
recognition for their unpaid contribution to the welfare of society,  it  is
clear that the conventional method of assessing will not reveal  the  extent
and nature of their contribution. The only way to assess the full  value  of
women's contribution to the economy and the general welfare of  society  is,
firstly, for the real economic value of their unpaid work to  be  recognised
by society and, secondly, for their participation in the informal sector  to
be taken into account.

In order to bring this  about,  the  following  proposals,  which  encourage
societal acknowledgement and official recognition of  women's  socioeconomic
contributions,  are  put  forward.  Improve  the  quality   of   information
available and women's socioeconomic contribution by identifying  information
gaps; collect and expand information;  update  databases;  generate  gender-
specific information and sexually aggregated data;  disseminate  information
on gender issues as widely as possible; utilise the mass media to  highlight
women's position in society; support women's positive  contribution  in  the
management and safeguarding of the natural environment; and  promote  gender
awareness amongst role-players in development  both  in  Government  and  at
nongovernmental levels.

Effective implementation  of  legislation  around  employment  equity  would
greatly enhance women's  participation  in  both  the  formal  and  informal
sectors and by so doing also enhance the  contribution  of  women.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Chairperson, gone are the days when people used  say
that the place of the woman is in the  kitchen.  Women  have  room  anywhere
under the sun. In fact, Ron Hubbard put it succinctly when he said:


  A society in which women are taught only the management of a family,  the
  care of men and the creation of the future generation is a society  which
  is on the way out.

Women are known to be good at saving for  the  family  and  hence  they  are
called ministers of finance in their homes.  They  keep  the  family  budget
intact and most women's leagues have more  capital  than  even  the  parties
they are affiliated to. Women have a role to play  in  the  economy  of  the
country. We have so many women  executives  in  both  the  private  and  the
public sectors. Dr Mokgokong,  the  businesswoman  and  chairperson  of  the
Unisa Council, is one of a young breed of women who are taking the  economic
world stage by storm.

The role of women in the church has become such a great challenge that  even
the most conservative of denominations are  beginning  to  ordain  women  as
preachers.

Most family businesses are successful for  as  long  as  wives  are  around.
Experience has taught that if a wife dies before  her  spouse  the  business
crumbles. Women have that necessary finesse.

In trying times, when the family goes without food, it is always  the  woman
who has ways and means of finding food for the family, thus displaying  that
rare economic power.

A good number of prominent people owe it  to  their  mothers  who  contrived
plans to see them through their schooling. It may have been through  working
as domestics to save for their education, or by joining Mokgodisano [a  type
of stokvel]. In fact,  most  entrepreneurs  these  days  who  conduct  their
businesses at schools, taxi ranks  and  elsewhere,  are  women.  Thank  you.
[Time expired.]
Dr S E M PHEKO: Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me honour all the  mothers
of this nation and of Africa. Let me remind  members  that  they  constitute
54% of our population. Without them there would be no nation.

Unfortunately,  in  Africa,   for   many   years,   women   were   neglected
educationally. Time has proved, however, that when they are given the  tools
of education they excel in almost every sphere  of  life.  The  PAC  affirms
that  women  are  the  backbone  of  our  economy.  Women,  under  Gear  and
globalisation and the privatisation of public  services,  are  the  economic
safety net.

Women's unpaid work and labour continues to fill the  gap,  particularly  at
this time when the  state  is  duplicating  its  responsibilities  to  small
business. Women's contribution in taking care of  HIV/Aids  sufferers  saves
the state billions of rands. Women contribute in the  formal  economy  under
increasingly difficult conditions. They are subjected to forced removals  on
the streets and there is no infrastructural  support  from  Government.  The
agricultural economy would not survive without women in this country.  Women
farmworkers are still subjected to the worst working  conditions,  that  are
also exploitative.

Despite women's unaccounted contribution in our public  accounts,  they  are
experiencing increased poverty yearly and more  are  becoming  the  head  of
their households without  recognition  for  being  the  engine  of  economic
growth of our country.

The PAC appeals that  the  black  economic  empowerment  strategy  that  was
debated yesterday be focused on assisting our women  to  play  an  increased
role in the economy of our country and become the backbone  of  the  economy
of this country. I thank you. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I  think  everyone
knows that I don't have  a  cellphone,  but  someone  has  kindly  left  one
behind. Whether it's for me, or whether you want to claim it, it's  a  Nokia
telephone. Thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chair. We, the  mothers  of  the  nation,
produce lawyers, doctors, plumbers, workers, even presidents. Women  provide
the economy with the manpower to sustain itself.

But that's not all we do. Shifting from  the  patriarchal  society  that  we
previously had been barred to, we have more  and  more  women  entering  the
global   market   as   contributive   competitors   alongside   their   male
counterparts. Though tradition and culture are still maintained  and  upheld
women have, to a large degree, been liberated from  domestic  positions  and
introduced to previously male-dominated positions.

However, it has been made the norm of so many centuries that women  mentally
still fall into the trap of sheltering  behind  the  male.  Those  who  have
escaped this must be  given  their  due,  but  in  more  African  and  Asian
traditions where  women  are  modelled  to  be  subservient  to  their  male
counterparts, breaking away from this system is hard.

Nonetheless, it has been realised that, no matter what culture or  tradition
we descend from, we have the ability to contribute to the state's  wellbeing
in a greater way than we already are doing. Beyond being a wife and  mother,
we are capable of attaining the skills that would be able to incorporate  us
into some field or another  in  the  economy  and  thus  contribute  to  the
sustainable development of South Africa.

The sole demarcation of women into domesticated fields  should  be  shifted.
Though educational institutions show a large percentage of females in  their
attendance, criteria should be inculcated to influence a  greater  magnitude
of females from more rural areas.
We at Parliament have a percentage of women that, though we should be  proud
of it, is not enough to maintain or ensure equal gender representation.  The
hammered rand, poverty and large percentage of unemployment are not easy  to
overcome.

Women of South Africa, the MF salutes you. Malibongwe  igama  lamakhosikazi!
Phambili boomama, phambili! [Praise  the  name  of  women!  Forward,  women,
forward!] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Geagte Voorsitter, wanneer ons praat oor  die  bydrae  van  die
vrou tot die ekonomie, is ons geneig om te kyk  na  statistiek,  om  te  kyk
hoeveel persent van direkteure is vrouens, hoeveel persent van die mense  in
die Parlement is vrouens. Ek wil 'n bietjie verder gaan. Ek wil my  praatjie
toewy aan 'n spesiale spesie van vrouens, wat  almal  besturende  direkteure
is, wat almal besig is met 'n ingewikkelde besigheid - dié van 'n  daaglikse
huishouding.

Meneer, kry 'n bietjie vir jou  'n  kwotasie  vir  iemand  wat  tegelykertyd
sekretaresse, kok, skoonmaker, ontvangsdame, chauffeur, algemene  bestuurder
en sommer nog minnares ook moet wees en kyk wat gaan dit jou kos per  maand.
Kort-kort spog ons: soveel persent van ons LPs is  vrouens,  soveel  persent
van DGs en van besturende direkteure. Die dag as ons  kan  spog  met  soveel
persent van  ons  kinders  in  Suid-Afrika  word  tuis  deur  hulle  eie  ma
grootgemaak en onderrig, dan kan ons sê, het ons gevorder.

Die bydrae van die vrou: sy sorg vir 'n stabiele  huis,  vir  die  opvoeding
van die geslag van môre, vir koers en rigting. Maar  ons  kan  verder  gaan.
Die  advertensiewese  is  in  hoofsaak  op  die   vrou   afgestem.   Hoekom?
Huisvrouens is die grootste aankopers. In die verkoopswêreld  is  dit  hulle
wat die besteding moet doen, wat die geld wat moet inkom moet aanwend.

Ek het geen beswaar dat ons vrouens uitmunt op  alle  vlakke  van  die  lewe
nie, sowel ook vrouens in die Parlement. Ons  kan  selfs  'n  vrouepresident
kry, net nie die een wat mnr Geldenhuys gister genoem het nie. Maar ons  wil
dit ook nie verdoem dat vrouens orals in die lewe hulle plek  volstaan  nie.
Ons salueer die vroue in die sakewêreld, in die Kabinet, in  die  akademiese
wêreld - ek vra net vandag in hierdie debat, kom ons haal ons  hoed  af  vir
'n spesiale spesie. Hulle waarde is ver bo korale. Ek dank  u.  (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, when we talk  of  the  contribution  made  by
women to the economy, we tend to look at statistics in  order  to  see  what
percentage of  directors  are  women,  what  percentage  of  the  people  in
Parliament are women. I would like  to  go  a  little  further.  I  want  to
dedicate my talk to a  special  species  of  women,  who  are  all  managing
directors, who are all engaged in a complex  business  -  that  of  a  daily
household.

Sir, get yourself  a  quotation  for  someone  who  will  simultaneously  be
secretary, cook,  cleaner,  receptionist,  chauffeur,  general  manager  and
lover as well, to boot, and see how much  that  will  cost  you  per  month.
Every now and again we boast: such and such a percentage  of  our  MPs,  and
such and such a percentage of DGs and managing  directors,  are  women.  The
day that we can boast that a certain percentage of  our  children  in  South
Africa are being raised and educated at home by their  own  mother,  is  the
day that we can say we have made progress.

The contribution of the woman: she provides  for  a  stable  home,  for  the
education of the generation of tomorrow, guidance and direction. But we  can
go further. The advertising industry is mainly directed at the  woman.  Why?
Housewives are the  major  purchasers.  In  the  sales  world  they  do  the
spending; they must spend the money that comes in.

I have no objection to the fact that our women excel in all areas  of  life,
including women in Parliament. We can even have  a  female  president,  only
not the one that Mr Geldenhuys indicated yesterday. But we do  not  want  to
condemn the fact that women are fully represented in life. We  salute  women
in business, in the Cabinet, in the academic world -  I  only  want  to  ask
today in this debate that we take our hat off to a  special  species.  Their
price is far above rubies. I thank you.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Deputy Chairperson, I firmly believe that if  it  wasn't  for
women and their contribution to the economy, there would be no economy.  And
I have to agree with hon Moss Chikane that their  wages,  whether  they  are
paid or unpaid, are inestimable in terms of the economy.

Many women have no other choice but to run small business ventures or  micro
enterprises which require little start-up capital and  usually  involve  the
marketing of homemade foodstuffs and handicrafts. Though women's  restricted
access to capital leads to high rates of return on their  tiny  investments,
the extremely low capital-labour ratios confine  women  to  low-productivity
undertakings.

It might surprise some of the men here, particularly in  my  own  party,  to
know that studies in Latin America and Asia have found that where credit  is
available to women with informal sector micro enterprises,  repayment  rates
have been as high or higher than those for men. And because women  are  able
to make more productive use of capital, their rates of return  often  exceed
those for men.

One of the economic sectors in which South African women have  led  the  way
is in housing. Not only is the department headed by a woman,  the  director-
general is a woman and there is at least one woman director and 40%  of  the
middle-management positions are held by women.  [Applause.]  The  department
also has an official policy on the acceleration of equality between men  and
women.

The Housing Act of 1997  promotes  the  active  participation  of  women  in
housing and creates opportunities for women to participate in  the  industry
by granting them bridging finance. Women, through their nurturing role,  are
by nature homemakers, but in the South African environment,  especially  the
rural areas and informal settlements, they are also the home builders.  Many
female contractors had to subcontract because  of  the  lack  of  access  to
finance.  They  also  lacked  skills  in  terms  of  finance   and   project
management.

The executive director of the  National  Urban  Reconstruction  and  Housing
Agency, Nurcha - a woman, of course - tells of  how  she  took  an  emerging
housing contractor, Irene Mahlangu, to a bank  in  Mpumalanga  to  obtain  a
loan. Irene had no collateral and in the end the loan was granted purely  on
the good name of the  representative  from  Nurcha.  Needless  to  say,  the
project was completed on  time  and  within  budget.  [Applause.]  The  bank
manager asked for more female clients and Irene  has  gone  on  to  build  a
further project of 500 units. [Applause.]

A high proportion of  women-led  housing  companies  received  support  from
Nurcha itself in the form of their guarantee programmes with  4  442  houses
being built, with a value of nearly R80 million. These women's  contribution
to the economy is not only in terms of capital, but also in  employment  and
the creation of other small enterprises related to the building industry.

Another Nurcha beneficiary, Granny Seape, has completed housing projects  in
Gauteng and Limpopo, creating close to 1 500 jobs and as a result  of  these
projects small entrepreneurs such as cupboard fitters,  glaziers  and  brick
makers have also started their own businesses.

The contribution of South African  women  to  the  housing  sector  and  its
direct benefits to the economy is but one illustration  of  what  women  can
do. Given the same opportunities, training  and  education,  and  access  to
finance as are given to men,  women  can  do  the  job  just  as  well,  and
probably even better. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Hon Chairman, thank you very much for relieving me  in  order
that I could participate in this debate. I want to say  to  you  loudly  and
clearly that when it comes to the international forum, South  Africa  has  a
very high standing thanks to the  hon  Gwen  Mahlangu.  [Applause.]  She  is
received in the whole of world  politics  as  an  inspiring  leader  who  is
contributing to  the  development  of  politics  in  which  women  begin  to
participate in meaningful numbers. And I think you should know that  and  we
should all  be  congratulating  her  for  the  role  that  she  is  playing.
[Applause.]

But let it also be known that I have a distinction also in  Africa  in  that
amongst the male politicians I am willing to stand up and speak  loudly  and
boldly and clearly on behalf of women.  [Applause.]  I  do  this  because  I
think any society which has a large number of  women  participating  in  the
economics and the politics is inherently a good, just and moderate  society.
It is a society in which the prospects of war and conflict  recede  and  the
prospects of negotiation come to the fore.

South Africa is also unique when we look at the figures, and I'm looking  at
the  figures  as  of  December.  Forty  per  cent  of  all  those  who   are
economically active in  South  Africa  are  women  and  that  constitutes  7
million women in this country. And they do not only now  occupy  the  lowest
positions. The latest figures are startling in what they reveal. In  respect
of professionals in South Africa, believe it or not, 55% of  those  who  are
active in  professions  are  women.  [Applause.]  And  this  trend  is  also
shadowed in our universities and in our technikons, so  it  is  quite  clear
that the brains of this nation will be the women of this  nation.  They  are
providing the impulse for education and for professionalism.

Sixty-nine per cent  of  all  the  clerks  in  our  country  are  women  and
therefore the records of the nation are kept, by and large, by  women.  When
it comes to community and social services, women again dominate with 54%  of
them being active in that field. In  the  all-important  financial  field  -
insurance, real estate and business - women might have been  far  behind  in
the past, but as of December 2002 43% of those who are active in this  field
are women. And even in manufacturing the figure is 34%. And, believe  it  or
not, in what used to  be  an  exclusive  male  area,  the  technical  field,
colleagues, you'd be surprised to know that the number  of  women  that  are
engaged in the technical field is not in the  least  bit  insignificant.  In
fact, women are poised to overtake men  in  this  respect,  because  48%  of
those that were active in South Africa in the technical field are women.

So South Africa is indeed a wonderful model, a role model, for the  rest  of
Africa and for the rest of the world. We should therefore be  congratulating
the women because they have now begun to come  into  their  own.  More  than
that, they are beginning to dominate in a number of fields and all  of  this
basically means that the kind  of  democratic  society,  the  kind  of  free
society, the kind of society in which we will have kindness  and  tenderness
is likely to emerge here on the southern tip of Africa.

Well done to all the women. I hope that indeed we continue to encourage  all
our daughters and all our sisters  and  even  our  mothers  to  continue  to
study, to continue to take positions in all  spheres  of  society  in  order
that we can become an atypical society  in  which  the  women  play  a  very
dominant role. Such a period is not even on the horizon;  it's  closer  than
the horizon.

So I want to take this opportunity  of  congratulating  the  women  for  the
enormous role that they are playing in our economy and hope that  this  will
continue to strengthen. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Chairperson and hon members, let me start  by  declaring,
on behalf of the women of South Africa, our solidarity and support  for  the
people of Iraq, in particular the women and  children  ...  [Applause.]  ...
who are confronted by an invasion and aggression that the  world  has  never
witnessed before. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  women  of  Iraq  at
this moment.

The ANC Women's League, in particular, is  saying  enough  is  enough.  This
illegal and illegitimate war that is killing and brutalising men, women  and
children must come to an end.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  Of  particular
concern was the incident of horror that was reported  in  the  news  at  one
o'clock today, of a guided missile that hit the market place in Baghdad,  in
a shopping  area.  Fifteen  people  were  reportedly  dead  immediately  and
hundreds more were injured. I do not understand what we mean by targets  and
precise, or whatever it is, weapons.  If  those  are  not  weapons  of  mass
destruction, I don't know what they are. The ANC Women's  League  is  saying
the men who started this senseless  and  selfish  war  must  come  to  their
senses and stop the war.
An HON MEMBER: Do you support polygamy?

Ms  L  M  T  XINGWANA:  Are  you   interested   in   polygamy?   Go   ahead!
[Interjections.]

Our topic for today is the contribution of women to  the  economy.  How  can
women contribute to the economy in the midst of a war that we all know  will
affect not only two or three countries, but  entire  continents,  especially
the African continent and all developing  countries  economically.  What  is
most vulgar and immoral about this war is  that  the  greedy  and  powerful,
like some of those on my left, are already  fighting  about  who  gets  what
stake in the reconstruction of a postwar Iraq. [Interjections.]

Noxa kunjalo ke. [Be that as it may.]

We have a one-eyed giant on my left who can only see Zimbabwe in  the  whole
world.

Noxa kunjalo ke malungu ahloniphekileyo  mandibuyele  emxholweni.  [However,
hon member, let me come back to the subject matter.]

First of all, our Government has played a leading role  in  the  empowerment
of women. The Government has signed and ratified most of  the  international
instruments that protect human  rights,  including  women's  and  children's
rights. In particular, Cedaw  and  the  Beijing  Platform  for  Action  were
signed as early as 1995, a year  after  the  new  democratic  nonracial  and
nonsexist South Africa was established and the ANC  elected  to  Government.
Also, the SADC Declaration on Gender and Development was signed in 1997.

All these instruments promote the rights of  women  as  human  rights.  They
promote the elimination of all forms of  discrimination  and  abuse  against
women. In particular, they provide for equal  opportunities  and  access  to
education and employment opportunities for women and girls. They  also  call
for macro- and microeconomic policy programmes,  which  our  Government  has
already prioritised. We also need to take account of their impact  on  women
and rural development.

I want to dwell on the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of
Discrimination  Against  Women,  which  was  adopted  by  the  UN's  General
Assembly in 1979, and is aptly described  as  the  ``International  Bill  of
Rights for Women'', consisting of a preamble and  30  articles.  It  defines
and explains what constitutes discrimination against women, and sets  up  an
agenda for international action to end such discrimination.

The convention defines discrimination against women as -


  ... any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the  basis  of  sex
  which  has  the  effect  or  purpose  of  impairing  or  nullifying   the
  recognition, enjoyment  or  exercise  by  women,  irrespective  of  their
  marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human  rights
  and fundamental freedoms in the political,  economic,  social,  cultural,
  civil or any other field.

By accepting the convention, states commit themselves to undertake a  series
of measures to end discrimination against women in all its  forms.  It  also
promotes the incorporation of the principle of equality  of  men  and  women
into the legal system,  abolishing  all  discriminatory  laws  and  adopting
appropriate  ones  which   prohibit   discrimination   against   women.   It
establishes tribunals and other public institutions to ensure the  effective
protection of women against discrimination, ensuring the elimination of  all
acts  of  discrimination  against  women  by   persons,   organisations   or
enterprises.

The  convention  is  the  only  human  rights  treaty  which   affirms   the
reproductive  rights  of  women  and  targets  culture  and   tradition   as
influential forces shaping gender roles and  family  relations.  It  affirms
women's rights to acquire,  change  or  retain  their  nationality  and  the
nationality of their children. State parties also agree to take  appropriate
measures against all forms of  trafficking  in  women  and  exploitation  of
women.

Countries that have ratified and  acceded  to  the  convention  are  legally
bound to put its provisions  into  practice.  They  are  also  committed  to
submitting national reports at least every four years on measures they  have
taken to comply  with  the  treaty's  obligations.  This  applies  to  South
Africa, as the country has ratified the convention.

The Beijing Platform for Action was adopted by the fourth  World  Conference
of Women in 1995 and recognises that in order to successfully  mainstream  a
gender perspective in support of gender equality, the generation  of  gender
statistics must be institutionalised. It referred to  the  need  to  measure
and reflect the participation of women and men in the economy. The value  of
unpaid  labour  has  already  been  mentioned  by  speakers  before  me,  in
particular the  so-called  domestic  work  which  is  usually  ignored.  The
Beijing Platform for  Action  demands  that  this  work  be  recognised  and
declares  that  this  is  a  major  misrepresentation  of  the   value   and
contribution of women to the economy.

The gender mainstreaming mandate of the Beijing Platform for  Action  states
that governments should, as appropriate, ensure that women's priorities  are
included in public investment programmes for  economic  infrastructure  such
as water  and  sanitation,  electrification  and  energy  conservation,  and
transport and road construction, and that they promote  greater  involvement
of women as beneficiaries in projects such as road construction as  well  as
access to jobs. Government should also integrate a gender  perspective  into
all economic restructuring and the design of programmes for  women  who  are
affected by economic restructuring.

With regard to the progress which we have made in South  Africa,  the  South
African Government has placed a high priority  on  poverty  eradication.  To
this  end  its  anti-poverty  strategy  includes  meeting  basic  needs  and
developing human resources. Consequently, the approach  of  most  Government
departments to poverty eradication has shifted from a welfare approach to  a
social developmental approach.

According to South Africa's  progress  report  in  respect  of  the  Beijing
Platform for Action, an enabling environment for overall transformation  and
gender equality has been created.  Specifically,  policies  and  legislation
have been adopted and passed which support the development  of  an  enabling
environment. These include our  very  Constitution,  which  was  adopted  in
1996,  the  affirmative  action  policy  adopted  by  our  Government,   the
Preferential Procurement  Policy  Framework  Act  of  1999,  the  employment
equity policy, and the  Promotion  of  Equality  and  Prevention  of  Unfair
Discrimination Act of 2000, to mention but a few.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  you  are  causing
the speaker to strain her voice now because of  the  volume  of  noise.  Hon
member, you can now proceed.

Ms L M T XINGWANA: In addition, equity considerations have  been  pronounced
by the President in  all  his  state  of  the  nation  addresses,  which  is
indicative of a  political  will  to  address  gender  inequalities  in  the
country.

Key  gains  directly  related  to  the  gender  programme  have   been   the
development of a comprehensive national gender  machinery,  the  development
of key  programmes  which  respect  the  integrated  programmes  to  address
poverty, HIV/Aids  and  rural  development,  which  all  have  clear  gender
implications. There is also a development  programme  for  unemployed  women
with children under the age of five years.

Some of these gains have been the development of selective  learning  areas,
such as in agriculture and tourism. We also have the  Abet  programme  which
focuses on women and ensuring that they get literacy  and  numeracy  skills.
We have the Municipal Infrastructure Programme and also the Expanded  Public
Works Programme, the beneficiaries of which are mostly women  in  the  rural
areas.

Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture and Land  Affairs  has  initiated
various programmes to train women, especially in the rural areas. They  have
set up co-operatives and small businesses and trained women to  be  able  to
run their agricultural businesses. Women are also trained by the  Department
of Labour to ensure  that  they  can  initiate  small  businesses.  We  have
initiated many of these programmes in our rural areas,  such  as  piggeries,
poultry and other food production projects.

We also have projects that empower poor unemployed women  in  our  townships
and informal  settlements.  For  instance,  in  Gauteng  the  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs has trained  women  to  produce  vegetables  on
small plots in the townships. This has gone a long  way  towards  addressing
the question of unemployment, hunger and poverty. The women have  been  able
to sell and also to address the important question of food security.

In the Department of Minerals and Energy we have Sawima, which was  launched
to assist women to get access to the mining industry that has for  centuries
been the monopoly of white males in this country. [Applause.] We  have  also
had opportunities created by the  department  for  accessing  the  jewellery
industry, especially by women. So we will not  only  be  the  customers;  we
will be the owners of these industries. We also  have  special  projects  in
the Department of Minerals and Energy that will assist women to  access  the
oil and energy sector.

Ngoko ke, kukuthi makhosikazi. Amasi abekwe elangeni  ngulo  Rhulumente  we-
ANC. Sithi ekumele siphume, sisukume, siye kusela. Nango amasi.  [Therefore,
it's up to us women. The ANC-led Government has put the ball back  into  our
court. We are the ones who have to get up and get things going. That is  the
challenge.]

I also want to applaud the Ministry of Housing. I will not  dwell  too  much
on this one. I agree with every word my colleague Janet Semple said.

I want to mention the cultural industries which have been initiated  by  the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. I  think  they  provide
great opportunities for giving our women, especially  in  the  rural  areas,
home-based industries.  The  department  also  provides  export  and  import
opportunities  and  the  opportunity   to   be   involved   in   sustainable
development.

The Department of Correctional Services has done  a  great  deal  to  ensure
that female inmates - and male inmates, but I am interested  in  the  female
inmates - are trained in different skills, so  that  at  the  end  of  their
sentences they are able to go out and contribute  to  the  economy  of  this
country, and train other women and create jobs in the community  where  they
came from. This is a very good example of rehabilitation and  reconstructing
people's lives and our communities.

In conclusion, with regard to the challenges that we face concerning  unpaid
labour, we recommend that the Government set up a  special  fund,  like  the
Umsobomvu Fund, that  will  assist  the  women  of  this  country  who  have
contributed so  much  to  our  economy,  to  start  more  rural  development
programmes, home-based industries  and  other  small  businesses  that  will
empower them economically. We also need more Abet programmes  in  the  rural
areas  and  financial  schemes  to  assist  our   women.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.
