                                    ____

                        PROCEEDINGS AT JOINT SITTING
                                    ____

Members of the National Assembly  and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces
assembled in the Chamber of the National Assembly at 2003.

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

                          CALLING OF JOINT SITTING

The Speaker announced that the President had  requested  that  in  terms  of
section 42(5) of the Constitution a Joint Sitting of the  National  Assembly
and the National  Council  of  Provinces  be  convened  to  afford  him  the
opportunity to address Parliament on the  Final  Report  of  the  Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission.

       ADDRESS ON FINAL REPORT OF TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION

The  PRESIDENT  OF  THE  REPUBLIC:  Madame  Speaker  and   Deputy   Speaker,
Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson  of  the  Council  of  Provinces,  Deputy
President, Chief Justice and members of the  judiciary,  former  members  of
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers,
distinguished  Premiers,  honoured  traditional  leaders,  leaders  of   the
Chapter Nine institutions,  hon  leaders  of  our  political  parties,  your
excellencies ambassadors and high commissioners, hon members,  distinguished
guests, fellow South  Africans,  we  have  convened  today  as  the  elected
representatives of the people of South Africa to reflect on the work of  the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to examine its recommendations  and  to
find answers, in practical terms, to the question: Where to from here?

We wish to acknowledge the presence of commissioners of the  erstwhile  TRC,
who took time off their busy schedules to join us in commending  the  report
to our national Parliament.
I am confident that I speak on behalf of all  hon  members  when  I  say  to
these commissioners and, through them, to Archbishop Desmond  Tutu  and  the
other commissioners not present  here  today  that  South  Africa  sincerely
appreciates the work that they have done. Our thanks also go  to  the  staff
of the commission and all who contributed to the success of the work of  the
TRC, which we are justified to celebrate today. [Applause.]

They did everything humanly possible to realise the objectives of a  process
novel in its conception, harrowing in its execution and, in  many  respects,
thankless in balancing expectation and reality.

I must recognise the presence in the House of Minister Dullah Omar, who  was
at the very beginning of this process. [Applause.]

Our assessment of the TRC's success cannot, therefore, be based  on  whether
it has brought contrition and forgiveness, or whether, at  the  end  of  its
work, it handed us a united and reconciled society. For  this  was  not  its
mandate. What the TRC set out to do, and has  undoubtedly  achieved,  is  to
offer us the signposts in the long march to these ideals.

What it was required to do, and has accomplished, was to  flag  the  dangers
that  can  beset  a  state  not  premised  on  popular  legitimacy  and  the
confidence of its citizens, and the  ills  that  would  befall  any  society
founded on prejudice and a belief in a master race.

The extent to which the TRC could identify and pursue  priority  cases;  its
ability to bring to its hearings all relevant actors; the attention that  it
could pay to  civil  society's  role  in  buttressing  an  illegitimate  and
illegal state; and the TRC's  investigative  capacity  to  pursue  difficult
issues with regard to which the actors had decided to spurn its call for co-
operation - all these weaknesses were those of society and not  the  TRC  as
such. And we make bold to say that all these complexities make  the  product
of the work of the TRC that much more outstanding and impressive.

The pain and the agony that characterised the conflict among South  Africans
over the decades, so vividly relived in many  hearings  of  the  commission,
planted the seed of hope - of a future bright in its  humanity  and  in  its
sense of caring.

It is  a  future  whose  realisation  gave  life  to  the  passion  for  the
liberation  of  our  people  of  Oliver  Tambo  and  Chris  Hani,  the  10th
anniversary of whose passing away we mark this month. This  includes  others
such as Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe and Steve Bantu Biko, who  passed  away  25
years ago this year and last year respectively. They joined and  have  since
been joined by many other patriots to whom freedom meant life itself.

We are indebted to all of them, and we  shall  work  to  ensure  that  their
memory lives on in the minds of generations to come, inspired by our  common
determination that never again should one  South  African  oppress  another!
[Applause.]

At a critical moment in our history, as a people, we came to the  conclusion
that we must, together, end the killing. We took a deliberate decision  that
a violent conflict was neither in the interest of our country nor  would  it
solve our problems.

Together, we decided that in the search for  a  solution  to  our  problems,
nobody should be demonised or excluded.  We  agreed  that  everybody  should
become part of the solution, whatever they might have done  and  represented
in the past. This related both to negotiating the future of our country  and
to working to build the new South Africa we had all  negotiated.  We  agreed
that we would not have any war crimes tribunals  or  take  to  the  road  of
revenge and retribution.

When Chris Hani, a great hero of our  people,  was  murdered,  even  as  our
country was still governed by a white minority regime,  we  who  represented
the  oppressed  majority  said:  "Let  those  who  remain  in  positions  of
authority in our country carry out their responsibility to bring  those  who
murdered him to book." We called on our people neither to take the law  into
their own hands nor to mete out blind vengeance against those they  knew  as
the beneficiaries of apartheid oppression.

We imposed a heavy burden, particularly on the millions  who  had  been  the
victims of this oppression, to let bygones be bygones. We said to them:  "Do
not covet the material wealth of those who benefited  from  your  oppression
and exploitation, even as you remain poor."

We walked among their ranks saying that none among them should  predicate  a
better future for themselves on the basis of  the  impoverishment  of  those
who had prospered at their expense. We said to  them  that  on  the  day  of
liberation, there would be no looting; there would be no  celebrations  that
would result in chaos, and there would be no chaos.

We said that as the majority, we had a responsibility to  make  our  day  of
liberation an unforgettable moment of joy, with none condemned  to  remember
it forever as a day of bitter tears.

We said to our people that they should honour the traditions they had  built
and entrenched over centuries, never to hate people because of their  colour
or race, always to value all human beings, and never to turn their backs  on
the deeply entrenched  sentiment  informed  by  the  spirit  of  ubuntu,  to
forgive, understanding that the harm done yesterday cannot be  undone  today
by a resolve to harm another.

We reminded the masses of our  people  of  the  values  their  movement  for
national  liberation  had  upheld  throughout  a   turbulent   century,   of
everything they had done to defend both this movement  and  its  values,  of
their obligation never to betray this noble heritage. Our people heeded  all
these calls, even as many lives were being lost in continuing violence.

By reason of the generosity and the big hearts of the masses of our  people,
all of us have been able to sleep in peace, knowing that there  will  be  no
riots in our streets. Because these conscious  masses  know  what  they  are
about, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission  was  able  to  do  its  work
enjoying the co-operation of those who for ages had upheld the vision  of  a
united humanity in which each would be one's brother and sister.  These  are
an heroic people whose greatest reward is the liberation of  their  country.
Of them, the TRC says:


  Others did not wish to be portrayed as  a  "victim".  Indeed,  many  said
  expressly that they regarded  themselves  instead  as  soldiers  who  had
  voluntarily paid the price of their  struggle  ...  Many  have  expressed
  reservations about the very notion of a "victim", a term which is felt to
  denote a certain passivity and helplessness ...  Military  operatives  of
  the  liberation  movements  generally  did  not  report  violations  they
  experienced  to  the  Commission,  although  many   who   were   arrested
  experienced severe torture. This is in all likelihood a result  of  their
  reluctance to be seen as "victims", as opposed to combatants fighting for
  a moral cause for which they were prepared to suffer such violations. The
  same can be said for most prominent political  activists  and  leadership
  figures ... The Commission did not, for example, receive a  single  Human
  Rights Violation statement from any of the Rivonia trialists.

Some of these, who had to go through the torture chambers of  the  apartheid
regime to bring us our liberty, are with us in  this  Chamber  today.  There
are others, who sit on the balcony as visitors, who lost  their  loved  ones
whom  they  pride  as  liberators,  and  others  who  also   suffered   from
repression.

Surely all of us must feel a sense of humility in the face of such  selfless
heroism and attachment to principle  and  morality,  the  assertion  of  the
nobility of the human spirit that would be demeaned, denied and degraded  by
any suggestion that these heroes and heroines  are  but  mere  victims,  who
must receive a cash reward for being simply and deeply human.

I know there are some in this House who do not  understand  the  meaning  of
what I have just said. They think I have said what I have said to avoid  the
payment of reparations to those whom the TRC has  identified  as  "victims",
within the meaning of the law.

Indeed, the TRC itself makes the gratuitous comment (para 16, p 163, Vol  6)
that:


  Today, when the government is spending so substantial a  portion  of  its
  budget on submarines and other military equipment, it is unconvincing  to
  argue  that  it  is  too  financially  strapped  to  meet  this   minimal
  (reparations) commitment.

Apart from anything  else,  the  Government  has  never  presented  such  an
argument. It is difficult to understand why the commission decided  to  make
such a statement.

Elsewhere in the same volume, the Rev  Frank  Chikane,  Director-General  in
the Presidency and former General Secretary of the SA Council  of  Churches,
is falsely reported as having made a presentation to the Amnesty  Committee,
which he never did.
He is then said to have told this committee  that  he  had  participated  in
killing  people.  We  do  not  understand  how  this  grave  and   insulting
falsification found its way into the report of the TRC. We  are  pleased  to
report that Archbishop Tutu has written to  Rev  Chikane  to  apologise  for
this inexplicable account.

The poet Mongane Wally Serote teaches us: ``to every birth its blood''.  And
so, today we acknowledge the pain that attended the struggle to  give  birth
to the new life that South Africa has started  to  enjoy.  In  this  era  of
increased geopolitical tension, we dare celebrate as South Africans that  we
have found home-grown solutions that set us on a  course  of  reconstruction
and development, nation-building, reconciliation and peace among ourselves.

At this time, when great uncertainty about the future of  our  common  world
envelops the globe, we dare stand on mountain tops to  proclaim  our  humble
contribution to the efforts of humanity to build a stable, humane and  safer
South Africa and, by extension, a more stable, more humane and safer world.

If we should find correct answers to the question, "Where to from here?"  we
will need to remind ourselves of the objectives of the  TRC  from  its  very
inception, so aptly captured in the preamble to the  Promotion  of  National
Unity and Reconciliation Act:


  ... the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,  1993,  provides  a
  historic  bridge  between  the  past  of   a   deeply   divided   society
  characterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and  a
  future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful
  co-existence for all South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, class,
  belief or sex;


  ... the Constitution states that the pursuit of national unity, the well-
  being of all South African  citizens  and  peace  require  reconciliation
  between the people of South Africa and the reconstruction of society;


  ... it is deemed necessary to establish the truth  in  relation  to  past
  events as well as the  motives  for  and  circumstances  in  which  gross
  violations of human rights have occurred, and to make the findings  known
  in order to prevent a repetition of such acts in future;


  ... the Constitution states that there is a need  for  understanding  but
  not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a  need
  for ubuntu but not for victimisation ...

I am certain that we are all of us at  one  that  the  pursuit  of  national
unity, the wellbeing  of  all  South  African  citizens  and  peace  require
reconciliation among the people of South Africa and  the  reconstruction  of
our society.

These are the larger and fundamental objectives that should  inform  all  of
us as we work to give birth to the new South Africa.  The  occasion  of  the
receipt of the report of the TRC should give us an  opportunity  to  reflect
on these matters.

Both singly and collectively, we should answer the question:  How  far  have
we progressed in the last nine years towards the achievement  of  the  goals
of national unity,  national  reconciliation  and  national  reconstruction?
Both singly and collectively, we have to answer the question: What  have  we
contributed to the realisation of these goals?

These larger questions, which stand at the heart of what  our  country  will
be, did not  fall  within  the  mandate  of  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission. The TRC was  therefore  but  an  important  contributor  to  the
achievement of the larger whole, occupying an important  sector  within  the
larger process of the building of a new South Africa.

As stated in the Act, the TRC had to help  us  to  establish  the  truth  in
relation to past events as well as the  motives  for  and  circumstances  in
which gross violations of human rights occurred, and to  make  the  findings
known in order to prevent a repetition of such acts in future.

It had to help us to promote understanding and avoid  vengeance,  to  extend
reparation to those who had been harmed and discourage retaliation, to  rely
on the spirit of ubuntu as a deterrent against victimisation.

The TRC has done its work as was required. As stipulated in the TRC Act,  we
are here  to  make  various  recommendations  to  our  national  Parliament,
arising out of the work of the TRC.

As hon members are aware, there is a specific requirement in  the  law  that
Parliament  should  consider  and  take  decisions   on   matters   relating
particularly to reparations. It would then be the task of the  executive  to
implement  these  decisions.  The  law  also  provides  that  the   national
legislature may also make recommendations to the executive on other  matters
arising out of the TRC process, as it may deem fit.

Let us now turn to some of the major specific details that the  TRC  enjoins
us to address. The first of these is the matter of reparations.

First of all, an integrated and comprehensive response  to  the  TRC  report
should be about the continuing challenge of reconstruction and  development:
deepening  democracy  and  the  culture  of  human  rights,  ensuring   good
governance and transparency, intensifying economic growth  and  development,
enhancing our social programmes, improving  citizens'  safety  and  security
and contributing to the building of a humane and just  South  Africa  and  a
humane and just world order.

The TRC also argues for systematic programmes to project  the  symbolism  of
struggle and the ideal of freedom. This relates to such matters as  academic
and informal records of history, the remaking of  cultural  and  art  forms,
erecting symbols and monuments that exalt the  freedom  struggle,  including
new   geographic   and   place   names.   The   Government   accepts   these
recommendations.

Special  emphasis  will  continue  to  be  paid  to  the  rehabilitation  of
communities  that  were  subjected  to  intense   acts   of   violence   and
destruction. Experience gained with the projects in Katorus in  Gauteng  and
Mpumalanga in KwaZulu-Natal demonstrates that great progress can be made  in
partnership between communities and government.

Further, with regard to specific cases of individual victims  identified  by
the TRC, the Government has put  in  place  and  will  intensify  programmes
pertaining to medical benefits, educational  assistance,  the  provision  of
housing and so on. From time to time, Ministers  have  elaborated  and  will
continue to expatiate on the  implementation  of  these  and  other  related
programmes.

The TRC has reported that about 22 000  individuals  or  surviving  families
appeared before the commission.  Of  these,  about  19 000  required  urgent
reparations, and virtually all of them, where the necessary information  was
available, were attended to as proposed by the TRC with  regard  to  interim
reparations.

With regard to final reparations, the Government  will  provide  a  once-off
grant of R30 000 to those individuals or survivors designated  by  the  TRC.
This is over and above other  material  commitments  that  we  have  already
mentioned.

We intend to process these payments as  a  matter  of  urgency,  during  the
current financial year. Combined with community reparations, and  assistance
through opportunities and services we have  referred  to  earlier,  we  hope
that  these  will  offer  some  relief  for  the  harm   these   individuals
experienced.

We do so with some apprehension, for as the TRC has underlined, no  one  can
attach monetary value to life and  to  suffering.  [Applause.]  Nor  can  an
argument be sustained that the efforts of  millions  of  South  Africans  to
liberate themselves were for monetary gain. We are convinced  that,  to  the
millions who spared neither life nor limb in struggle, there  is  no  bigger
prize than freedom itself and the continuing  struggle  to  build  a  better
life for all. [Applause.]

The second of the specific details in the TRC  recommendations  pertains  to
the issue of amnesty. A critical trade-off contained in the TRC process  was
between normal judicial processes on the one hand, and the establishment  of
the truth, reparations and amnesty on the other.

Besides  the  imperatives  of  managing   the   transition,   an   important
consideration that had to be addressed when the  TRC  was  set  up  was  the
extent to which the new democratic state could pursue  legal  cases  against
perpetrators of gross human rights  violations,  given  the  resources  that
would have to be allocated to this, the  complexities  of  establishing  the
facts beyond reasonable doubt and the time it would take to  deal  with  all
the cases, as well as the bitterness and instability  that  such  a  process
would wreak on society.

The balance that the TRC  Act  struck  among  these  competing  demands  was
reflected in the national consensus around the provision  of  amnesty  -  in
instances where perpetrators had provided the true  facts  about  particular
incidents - and restorative justice which would be effected in the  form  of
reparations.

Given that a significant number of people did not apply  for  amnesty,  what
approach does Government place  before  the  national  legislature  and  the
nation on this matter?

Let us start off by reiterating that there shall be no general amnesty.  Any
such approach, whether applied to specific categories of people  or  regions
of the country, would fly in the face of the TRC process and  subtract  from
the principle of accountability, which is vital not  only  in  dealing  with
the past, but also in the creation of a new ethos within our society.

Yet we also have to deal with the reality that many of the  participants  in
the conflicts of the past did not take part in the TRC process. Among  these
are individuals who were misled by their leadership  to  treat  the  process
with disdain. Others calculated that  they  would  not  be  found  out,  due
either to poor TRC  investigations  or  to  what  they  believed  and  still
believe is too complex a web of  concealment  for  anyone  to  unravel.  Yet
other  operatives  expected  the   political   leadership   of   the   state
institutions to which they belonged to provide the overall  context  against
which they could present their cases: and this was not to be.

All of this reality cannot be avoided. Government is of the firm  conviction
that we cannot resolve  this  matter  by  setting  up  yet  another  amnesty
process, which in effect would mean suspending the constitutional rights  of
those who were at the receiving end of gross human rights violations.

We have therefore left this matter in the hands of the National  Directorate
of Public Prosecutions, for it to  pursue  any  cases  that,  as  is  normal
practice, it believes deserve prosecution and can be prosecuted.  This  work
is continuing.

However, as part of this process and in the national interest, the  National
Directorate of Public Prosecutions, working with our intelligence  agencies,
will leave its doors open for those who are prepared to divulge  information
at their disposal and to co-operate in unearthing the  truth,  for  them  to
enter into arrangements  that  are  standard  in  the  normal  execution  of
justice, and which are accommodated in our legislation. [Applause.]

This is not a desire for vengeance, nor would it compromise  the  rights  of
citizens who may wish to seek  justice  in  our  courts.  It  is  critically
important that, as a government, we should continue to establish  the  truth
about the networks that operated against the people. This is  an  obligation
that attaches to the nation's security today, for  some  of  these  networks
still  pose  a  real  or  latent  danger  against  our  democracy.  In  some
instances, caches of arms  have  been  retained  which  lend  themselves  to
employment in criminal activity.

This approach leaves open the possibility for individual  citizens  to  take
up any grievance related to human rights violations with the courts.

Thirdly, in each instance where any  legal  arrangements  are  entered  into
between the NDPP and  particular  perpetrators  as  we  have  proposed,  the
involvement of the victims will be crucial in  determining  the  appropriate
course of action.

Relevant departments are examining the practical modalities of dealing  with
this matter, and they will also establish whether  specific  legislation  is
required in this regard.

We shall also endeavour  to  explain  South  Africa's  approaches  on  these
matters to  sister  governments  across  the  world.  Our  response  to  any
judicial matters from these countries will be handled  in  this  spirit  and
through the legal system. In this regard, we wish to reiterate our  call  to
governments that continue to do so, that the maltreatment  of  former  anti-
apartheid fighters, based on the legal  definitions  of  an  illegal  regime
characterised by the United Nations as  a  crime  against  humanity,  should
cease.

In the recent  past,  the  issue  of  litigation  and  civil  suits  against
corporations that benefited from the apartheid system  has  arisen  sharply.
In this regard, we wish to reiterate that the South  African  Government  is
not and will not be party to such litigation. [Applause.]

In addition, we consider it completely unacceptable that  matters  that  are
central to the future of  our  country  should  be  adjudicated  in  foreign
courts which bear no responsibility for the wellbeing  of  our  country  and
the observance of the perspective  contained  in  our  Constitution  of  the
promotion of national reconciliation. [Applause.]

While Government  recognises  the  right  of  citizens  to  institute  legal
action, its own approach is informed by the  desire  to  involve  all  South
Africans, including corporate citizens,  in  a  co-operative  and  voluntary
partnership to reconstruct and develop South African  society.  Accordingly,
we do not believe that it would be correct for us  to  impose  the  once-off
wealth tax on corporations proposed by the TRC. [Applause.]

Consultations  are  continuing  with  the  business  community  to   examine
additional  ways  in  which  they  can  contribute  to  the  task   of   the
reconstruction and development of our society, proceeding from  the  premise
that this is in their own self-interest. In addition  to  intensifying  work
with regard to such tasks as poverty eradication,  and  programmes  such  as
black economic empowerment, encouraging better individual  corporate  social
responsibility, implementing equity legislation and taking advantage of  the
Skills Training Levy, we intend to improve the work of the Business Trust.

In this context, we must emphasise that our response to the TRC  has  to  be
integrated within the totality of  the  enormous  effort  in  which  we  are
engaged, to ensure the fundamental social  transformation  of  our  country.
This requires that at all times we attain the necessary  balance  among  the
various goals we have to pursue.
The TRC also recommends that what  it  describes  as  the  beneficiaries  of
apartheid  should  also  make  contributions  to  a  reparations  fund.  The
Government believes that all South Africans should make such  contributions.
In the pursuit of the goal of  a  nonracial  society,  in  which  all  South
Africans would be inspired by  a  common  patriotism,  we  believe  that  we
should begin to learn to  work  together,  uniting  to  address  the  common
national challenges, such as responding to the  consequences  of  the  gross
violations of human rights of which the TRC was seized.

In this regard, I am certain that members of our Government  will  be  among
the first to make their contributions to the reparation  fund,  despite  the
fact that they stood on  one  side  of  the  barricades  as  we  engaged  in
struggle to end the apartheid system. [Applause.]

Many  in  our  country  have  called  for  a  national  day  of  prayer  and
traditional sacrifice to pay tribute to those  who  sacrificed  their  lives
and suffered during the difficult period of oppression and repression  whose
legacy remains with us. The Government  accepts  this  suggestion  and  will
consult as widely as possible to determine the date and form of such  prayer
and traditional  sacrifice.  This  is  consistent  with,  and  would  be  an
appropriate response to, the proposals made by the TRC  for  conferences  to
heal the memory and honour those who were executed, as well  as  to  cleanse
the living.

We shall also  continue  to  work  in  partnership  with  countries  of  the
subcontinent, jointly  to  take  part  in  the  massive  reconstruction  and
development effort that the SADC has identified as critical  to  building  a
better life for all. The peoples of Southern Africa, including the  majority
in South Africa,  endured  untold  privations  and  were  subjected  to  the
destabilisation and destruction  of  property  and  infrastructure  and  the
taking away of lives. They all deserve the speeding up of the programmes  of
integration, reconstruction and development that governments of  the  region
have agreed upon.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has made many detailed  observations
and recommendations on structures and systems, which will be dealt  with  by
relevant Ministers and departments.

For the purposes of reparations, the Government has already established  the
President's  Fund,  which  is  now  operational,  and  has,  as  we  earlier
indicated,  successfully  dealt  with  the  matter  of  the  urgent  interim
reparations. Like the TRC, we do hope that citizens from  all  sectors  will
find it within themselves to make a contribution to this fund. Most  of  the
resources  that  have  been  allocated  for  the  individual  and  community
reparations that we referred to will be sourced from  this  fund,  over  and
above the normal work of the relevant departments.

We concur with the TRC that intensive  work  should  be  undertaken  on  the
matter of monuments as well as geographic and place names. A trust with  the
requisite infrastructure, headed by Mongane Wally Serote, has  been  set  up
to implement the main project in this regard, which is the  construction  of
the Freedom Park, whose constituent parts are the memorial,  the  garden  of
remembrance and the museum. This should start by  the  10th  anniversary  of
freedom in 2004.

The National Directorate of Public  Prosecutions  and  relevant  departments
will be  requested  to  deal  with  matters  relating  to  people  who  were
unaccounted for, postmortem records and policy with  regard  to  burials  of
unidentified persons. We would like to encourage all persons who might  have
any knowledge of people still  unaccounted  for  to  approach  the  National
Directorate  of  Public  Prosecutions,  the  SA  Police  Service  and  other
relevant departments with that information.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development  will  monitor  the
implementation of all of these programmes, and it will report to Cabinet  on
an ongoing basis.

What we have identified today, arising out of the report of the  TRC,  forms
part of the panoply of programmes that define the first steps in  a  journey
that has truly begun. South African society is changing for the better.  The
tide has turned and the people's contract for a better  tomorrow  is  taking
shape.

The goals we defined for ourselves a decade ago, as we adopted  the  interim
Constitution - to pursue national unity, to secure peace and  the  wellbeing
of all South African citizens, to achieve national  reconciliation  and  the
reconstruction of our society - have not been fully  realised,  despite  the
progress we have made.

The situation we face demands that none of us should succumb  to  the  false
comfort that now we live in a normal society that has  overcome  the  legacy
of the past, and which permits us to  consider  our  social  tasks  as  mere
business as usual.

Rather, it demands that we continue to be inspired by the determination  and
vision that enabled us to achieve the transition from apartheid  rule  to  a
democratic order in the manner that we did. It demands that we act  together
as one people to address what are truly national tasks.

We have to ask ourselves and  honestly  answer  simple  questions:  Have  we
succeeded in creating a nonracial society? The answer to  this  question  is
no. Have we succeeded in building a nonsexist society? The  answer  to  that
question is no. Have we succeeded fully in addressing the needs of the  most
vulnerable  in  our  society  -  the  children,  the  youth,   people   with
disabilities and the elderly? Once again the answer to this question is no.

Without all this, it is impossible for us to claim  that  we  have  met  our
goals of national reconciliation and reconstruction and development.  It  is
not possible for  us  to  make  the  assertion  that  we  have  secured  the
wellbeing of all South African citizens.

 The road we have travelled and the advances we have made  convey  the  firm
message that we are moving towards the accomplishment of the  objectives  we
set ourselves. They tell us that, in the  end,  however  long  the  road  we
still have to travel, we will win.

In the larger sense, we were all victims of the system  of  apartheid,  both
black  and  white.  Some  among   us   suffered   because   of   oppression,
exploitation, repression and exclusion. Others among us suffered because  we
were imprisoned behind prison walls of fear, paralysed by inhuman belief  in
our racial superiority and called upon to  despise  and  abuse  other  human
beings. Those who do such things cannot but diminish their own humanity.

To be true to ourselves as human beings demands  that  we  act  together  to
overcome the legacy of this common and terrible past. It demands that we  do
indeed enter into a people's contract for a better tomorrow.

Together we must confront  the  challenge  of  steering  through  a  complex
transition that demands that we manage the historical  fault-lines,  without
papering over the cracks, moved by a new and common patriotism.
It says to all of us that we must honour those who shed their blood so  that
we can sit together in this Chamber by doing all the things that  will  make
it possible for us to say that  this  South  Africa  that  we  have  rebuilt
together truly belongs to all who live in it.

Madam Speaker, I am  honoured  to  commend  the  report  of  the  Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission to our national Houses of Parliament  and  to  the
nation. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: We  thank  you,  Mr  President.  Hon  members,  the  Houses  of
Parliament will now begin  the  national  debate  on  the  report  in  joint
session.

        DEBATE ON FINAL REPORT OF TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG: President of the  Republic,  Deputy  President,  hon
Speaker, Chairperson of the NCOP, premiers  and  hon  members,  today,  just
over a year before we complete the first decade of freedom and democracy  in
our country, we are gathered in this House  as  representatives  and  humble
servants of the people of South Africa, to finally put behind  us  the  ugly
and unpleasant past that was characterised by  gruesome  violations  of  the
rights of the overwhelming majority of our people.

This House in 1995 passed a law providing for the establishment of the  TRC,
so that all South Africans could know what happened  in  the  past,  why  it
happened, and agree on the steps that need to be taken to  ensure  that  the
evil deeds of the past are never repeated.

Through its  investigation  into  gross  human  rights  violations  and  the
information gathered at many of the public hearings it  conducted,  the  TRC
uncovered a lot of gruesome human rights violations that had been  committed
in defence and furtherance of apartheid. The TRC confirmed  the  point  that
we have always made: that apartheid was  a  deliberate  policy  on  which  a
system of  government  was  built  where  the  rights  of  the  overwhelming
majority of South Africans, but mainly the black community and  women,  were
trampled upon and security considerations ruled the roost.

The finding that there were groups of people and individuals  who  benefited
materially from apartheid does not come as a surprise. We have always  known
that the majority of whites and businesses, partly because of  the  material
benefits and privileges they enjoyed from  apartheid,  also  contributed  to
the  oppression  and  exploitation  of  black  people  through  the   active
promotion of discriminatory measures.

State  corporations  were  formed  but  primarily   to   create   employment
opportunities for white people and direct  public  resources  to  the  white
minority.  Vacancies  were  created,   especially   in   senior   management
positions,  not  because  they  were  required  for   the   efficiency   and
effectiveness  of  the  corporations,  but  simply   to   create   sheltered
employment for white people.

The regime saw it as one of its  primary  responsibilities  to  ensure  that
every white person was given a stake in the system. It created  a  situation
that no white person should feel that, in the  event  of  abolition  of  the
apartheid system, they had nothing to lose. Consequently, many  among  white
South Africans were actively engaged in defending the system that gave  them
special privileges and oppressed the black people.

 So there is no debate about whether or not white people benefited,  whether
or not businesses benefited. The question for us is: How do we respond as  a
nation in a manner that ensures that we are able to move forward?

Some of the victims and surviving family  members  had  the  opportunity  to
relate their suffering and came face to face with the perpetrators. Some  of
the perpetrators came forward to tell the  truth  about  their  actions  and
were truly remorseful for the pain and suffering that they had inflicted  on
their victims.

All of us understood from  the  onset  that  the  truth  and  reconciliation
process, while it had to ensure  that  to  the  extent  possible  there  was
justice, was not about revenge or retribution.  We  knew  that  restoration,
restitution and reparations would be important  outcomes  of  this  process.
Today, on the basis of the work of the TRC, which made it  possible  for  us
to know more about our country's unpleasant past, we can all say that  never
again  should  South  Africans  be  subjected  to  gruesome   human   rights
violations. We are now better able to march together to  the  new  peaceful,
just and prosperous South Africa in which all citizens live in  harmony  and
are treated equally.

The question that all of us must now grapple with is: What needs to be  done
to alleviate the plight of victims, to help restore their dignity and  their
humanity, and make them feel that reconciliation and justice have  not  been
at their expense?

We know that justice demands  that  the  concerns  of  victims  should  take
centrestage in the process of reconciliation. In this  context,  all  of  us
need to be creative in identifying ways in  which  the  Government  and  the
people can together participate in the  process  of  effecting  restitution,
restoration and reparation, and move closer towards a  better  South  Africa
for all.

To do so will require a common understanding  of  victims  of  apartheid  as
going beyond those who went before the TRC to tell their stories.  We  think
it will be wrong to define victims, and therefore people on whom we need  to
do more work, as only those who had the opportunity to go in  front  of  the
TRC.

Since 1994 the Government has been implementing policies aimed at  improving
the lives of millions of South  Africans  whose  conditions  were  inflicted
upon them by many years of neglect, repression  and  injustice.  Significant
progress has been recorded. Many South Africans  have  experienced  a  great
deal of improvement in their quality  of  life.  We  continue  to  implement
policies and  programmes  aimed  at  improving  the  lives  of  our  people,
especially the victims of apartheid.

In Gauteng, the work that we are doing in  Alexandra,  Kliptown,  Bekkersdal
and other areas that  have  been  severely  ravaged  by  apartheid-inflicted
poverty   will   contribute   towards   reparation,    reconciliation    and
transformation. We intend to ensure that by the time the  country  is  ready
to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the adoption of  the  Freedom  Charter,
we are able to ensure that those who live in Kliptown will  themselves  also
be able to say that they can see reconciliation and  reparation,  through  a
monument in the area named after Walter Sisulu. [Applause.]

But as we are all aware, it will take a considerable amount of  time  and  a
lot more resources will be required to wipe out the legacy of  centuries  of
colonialism and  apartheid  neglect  and  injustice.  The  scars  that  were
inflicted upon our people as a result of  the  implementation  of  apartheid
policies are still there for all to see. Our country continues  to  be  seen
as a country of two nations - one extremely  wealthy  and  skilled  and  the
other living in conditions of abject poverty. We need to do more  to  change
that reality.
The overwhelming majority of black people still participate in  the  economy
as no more than labourers and consumers of goods and services.  We  need  to
do more to change that situation.

This work of removing the apartheid  legacy  and  building  a  better  South
Africa can therefore not be left to Government  alone.  Without  seeking  to
apportion blame to anybody for their role  in  apartheid,  we  call  on  all
historically privileged South Africans,  including  business,  to  recognise
that  genuine   reconciliation   requires   addressing   the   inequalities,
iniquities and developmental backlogs that the apartheid system, from  which
they benefited to varying degrees,  has  left  as  a  heritage  of  our  new
democratic order.

A new commitment is required  from  all  of  us,  as  Government,  business,
professionals and other stakeholders, to work together to overcome  problems
of inequality and underdevelopment, and build a new nation.

The TRC has made findings and recommendations which create  the  possibility
for all of us to take action to heal the wounds of the past and move  faster
towards a better South Africa for all. The time to act is now.  Let  us  act
to ensure that, as we said  at  the  beginning  of  the  TRC  process,  what
happened in the past is never repeated. Let this be the  commitment  to  the
new  dispensation  for  which  many  paid  the  ultimate  price,   the   new
dispensation which many of us today enjoy, and let us also begin  to  honour
those who have long passed.

Let me conclude by saying that one of the issues often raised out  there  is
that today no one acknowledges ever having supported apartheid, ever  having
benefited from apartheid. The question arises: How was such a  system,  with
no support from anybody, ever able to survive? [Applause.]

It is true that we must acknowledge that the  fact  that  apartheid  existed
for so long was because it had  supporters.  The  challenge  for  those  who
supported apartheid is not to continue to wallow in  guilt,  but  rather  to
say what commitment they make to the building  of  this  new  South  Africa,
which was made possible  by  those  that  they  oppressed  for  many  years.
[Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE  OPPOSITION:  Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President,  colleagues,
South Africa's peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy was  not  the
consequence of a miracle, but the product of the  innate  decency  and  good
sense of the majority of the people of South Africa,  black  and  white.  We
negotiated a democratic settlement that is admired  around  the  world,  but
the constitutional accords  of  1993,  and  again  in  1996,  which  laid  a
foundation for the future, were not enough. The  past  had  to  be  laid  to
rest.

The horror  and  the  grief  of  the  apartheid  years,  the  pain  and  the
humiliation, and the questions that persisted about the  fate  of  the  dead
and the missing, all required settling. There was, in the words of the  1993
Interim Constitution, from which the  President  quoted  this  afternoon,  a
need for understanding, but not for vengeance; a need  for  reparation,  but
not retaliation; a need for ubuntu, but not victimisation. And again,  South
Africans decided upon  a  sensible  remedy:  The  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission or the TRC.

The TRC, as  we  see  from  its  many  volumes,  provided  victims  with  an
opportunity to tell their own stories. It offered, as well, perpetrators  of
human rights violations a chance to disclose and an opportunity to  confess.
And, in a carefree  delimited  departure  from  the  usual  requirements  of
justice,  it  made  provision  for  amnesty  for  those  same  perpetrators,
provided - and the provisos were absolutely crucial  -  that  they  disclose
their deeds in full, and that they could show that their  actions  had  been
politically motivated and were proportional to the objective being pursued.

The DA, and the parties which comprise it, supported the idea  of  the  TRC.
We supported its mandate, which is why we  occasionally  objected  when  the
TRC strayed beyond its mandate, and we supported  the  manner  in  which  it
conducted  its  work,  by  and  large.  It  deserves,  in  the   main,   our
congratulations.
Yet, sometimes, we hear it is said that we should forgive and  forget,  move
on, stop wallowing in the past. In our respectful view, that  is  profoundly
mistaken. We must never forget,  Madam  Speaker.  We  must  not  forget  one
single murder, nor one single act of torture.  Every  police  assassination,
every illegal abduction, every burning to death, and  every  explosion  that
killed innocent people, should be  remembered.  The  moral  reason  for  not
forgetting is that, by doing so, we dishonour  the  victims.  The  practical
reason is that, by safeguarding the future, we require an  understanding  of
the failures of the past.

Over and over again, the  TRC  points  to  one  outstanding  cause  for  the
atrocities and the suffering it disclosed: The abuse of power.  Perpetrators
of crimes, on all sides, rightly stand condemned. But  those  who  committed
crimes supporting apartheid were agents of the state, and  the  state  which
had, and has today, a lawful monopoly on force has a solemn contract to  act
responsibly, and on behalf of the people. This the  National  Party  of  the
apartheid state did  not  do.  It  acted  first  on  behalf  of  the  racial
minority, and finally on behalf of a small ruling elite. It  undermined  the
institutions of democracy. It removed many of the checks and  restraints  on
state power. It subverted  good  governance.  It  reduced  Parliament  to  a
rubber stamp of the Executive. It passed acts  that  violated  the  rule  of
law.  It  mischaracterised  opposition  as  unpatriotic,  and  banned   many
opposition parties. It depicted criticism as  treasonable,  and  it  bullied
newspapers. It began to see the party as the state, and then  the  state  as
the nation, and, finally, the party as the nation.

The results, terrible and tragic, Madam Speaker, were displayed  before  the
hearings of the TRC. The moral of the story is that the  rule  of  law,  the
right to opposition, the independence of the judiciary, the  sovereignty  of
Parliament, and the freedom of the press, are  not  ornaments  of  a  modern
society, they are fundamental safeguards of liberty. The  TRC  has  produced
thick files of torture, terror, mutilation and death, which are a  grim  and
vivid testament on the abuse of power. They must be kept for  ever,  and  we
must never forget.

Forgiveness is a different matter entirely,  because  it  lies  outside  the
realm of the state and outside the realm of  this  Chamber.  It  is  in  the
private realm of the heart. None of us here  can  advise  the  mother  of  a
child, who has been murdered, whether she should  forgive  the  killer.  She
must look inside herself and answer. If she decides to  forgive,  we  salute
her; if she decides not to forgive, we understand.

But, if the state does not have the power  to  forgive,  it  does  have  the
power to pardon. The TRC's terms of  amnesty  were  wise  and  sensible.  To
obtain amnesty, perpetrators had to make full disclosure, they had to  prove
that their deeds were politically motivated, and  they  had  to  file  their
applications by a date set in law.  Let  us  not  forget  that  the  amnesty
provisions, contained in the Promotion of National Unity and  Reconciliation
Act of 1995, represent a significant, and potentially  dangerous,  departure
from the most basic demand  of  justice,  which  is  that  criminals  -  all
criminals - should pay for their crimes.

We justified our compromise on this principle of  justice  by  arguing  that
amnesty was necessary for reconciliation. But  we  made  sure,  even  as  we
privileged the need for reconciliation over the  demands  of  justice,  that
the amnesty process would carefully  be  circumscribed  by  law,  and  would
apply for a limited time, and in  a  defined  manner.  Any  attempt  now  to
extend the amnesty provision in that Act, or worse, to provide  any  general
amnesty, or worse still, any form of back-door amnesty,  would  violate  the
demands of justice, rubbish our commitment to  reconciliation,  and  make  a
mockery of the entire TRC process. Most damning of all: It  would  dishonour
the dead.

That is why I believe the announcement that the President made today,  is  a
very welcome one.  Because  those  who  failed  to  take  advantage  of  the
generous period of amnesty, under the TRC, must now face the possibility  of
criminal action. Today's announcement, by the President, of a  new  approach
by  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  in  respect  of  certain  acts,
particularly  those  which  he  described  as  potentially  undermining  our
democracy, need to be treated with the utmost circumspection, but also  with
due  consideration.  As  a  minimum,  we  surely  cannot  deviate  from  the
constitutional   and   legislative   requirements   of   full    disclosure,
proportionality and the judicial determination  of  whether  an  offence  is
motivated by so-called political reasoning, or not.

Madam Speaker, the Act, which established the TRC, was very properly  narrow
and precise in the definition of both gross human rights  violation  and  of
victim: Anyone  who  suffered  harm  as  a  result  of  killing,  abduction,
torture, or severe ill-treatment. Only victims thus  defined  were  eligible
for reparation. We therefore  welcome  the  fact,  at  long-last,  that  the
victims are going to receive, as defined, a  once-off  financial  grant,  as
required by the Constitution, and as compelled by our  national  conscience.
The President's announcement is a welcome first  step,  but  the  devil,  as
always, will be in the detail and in the delivery.
In the light of the careful  framing  of  the  TRC  Act,  and  the  dreadful
suffering of its defined victims, it is quite wrong to alter and  widen  the
notion of reparations in such a way so as to  include  almost  any  real  or
imagined misfortune occurring during  the  period  under  consideration.  We
agree with the President and the Government, and not with the TRC,  in  this
regard.

The idea that companies, operating under apartheid, should  pay  reparations
because their workers were treated less well  than  workers  in  some  ideal
system, is misguided and an insult to  the  people  who  were  tortured  and
killed.  I  believe  the  Government  is  correct  not  to  palm   off   its
responsibilities onto business, because  we  already  expect  business,  and
business in South Africa, to do a great deal. It is at the  forefront  of  a
massive programme of redistribution through  economic  empowerment,  through
employment equity, through the  skills  levy,  through  the  demutualisation
levy, and through social investment.

Madam Speaker, in  conclusion,  the  TRC  has  done  a  magnificent  job  in
exposing the atrocities of the apartheid era. We must never forget them.  We
must work to ensure that their like never happens again.  For  the  work  it
has done, we give the TRC our thanks. And the work that Parliament  will  do
must continue. Thank you.

The  MINISTER  OF  EDUCATION:  Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President,   Mr   Deputy
President, former members of the Truth and  Reconciliation  Commission,  hon
members of the national Parliament, we have  arrived  at  a  truly  historic
moment, long-delayed, some might say,  but  certainly  a  moment  worthy  of
celebration. The importance of this moment is that it  constitutes  the  end
of the beginning of a process that Parliament initiated seven years ago.  It
signifies the end of a particularly intense searching and sometimes  painful
process in our country's history. But  as  much  as  it  is  the  end  of  a
process, it also points to the dawning of a new chapter  for  our  democracy
and the national development and reconstruction needed to fully achieve  the
ideals we set for ourselves.
In pursuit of our goals, it is important to recall that the work of the  TRC
was intended to be one initiative among many designed to  bring  healing  to
our nation in the wake of the evil years of apartheid. As we today face  the
closing phases of the TRC, we  need  to  recall  the  overall  mandate  that
governed its work: It is to reconcile, it is to heal, and it is  to  repair.
The time has therefore come to build a national consensus on how to do so.

Given its importance, we in this Parliament need to treat this  moment  with
the dignity it deserves. Vaclav Havel, the former  President  of  the  Czech
Republic, speaks of the need for what he  calls  ``non-political  politics''
in dealing with matters of national interest. This involves every member  of
the community seeking to complement one another in pursuit of  a  goal  that
is greater than any of us.

Therefore, we need to rise above our political  differences  in  pursuit  of
national inclusivity, redress and restoration  that  will  finally  take  us
across the historic bridge which  our  legislation  refers  to,  between  an
unjust and violent past, and a future founded on the  recognition  of  human
rights and peace,  which  enables  us  to  take  forward  the  challenge  of
building a united and thriving nation.

May I say that this  is  a  very  important  year.  It  marks  the  sixtieth
anniversary of the adoption by any liberation movement of  a  complete  Bill
of rights. The African claims  a  document  -  it  is  a  document  that  is
precocious in  its  contents  -  four  years  before  the  adoption  of  the
Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  which  is  the  basis  for   all
subsequent development. It goes far beyond that in its  references  to  one-
person-one-vote or opposition to racialism and, particularly, the  insertion
of economic and social rights. It is very important that we have carried  on
the tradition of the invocation of human  rights  in  the  struggle  and  it
remains necessary to ensure its protection.

So, the TRC has played an important role, as we  have  noted,  in  espousing
and emphasising the moral significance of  democracy  in  South  Africa.  In
doing so, it has engaged in the work of memory dedicated  to  the  struggle,
in Milan Kundera's familiar phrase of ``memory  against  forgetting''.  This
work of memory was important. Although we should be critical of attempts  to
turn memory into myth-making, especially if such  myths  are  only  ways  of
avoiding historical accountability, the TRC was  responsible  for  important
memory work. To create a future, we must therefore  take  into  account  the
past.

In doing so, the TRC recognised that a wishful and forgetful approach  would
simply  serve  to  entrench  past  inequities,  as  they  would  not  simply
disappear of their own accord. They must be actively  dismantled.  In  doing
so, it acknowledged that to avert our eyes from the past is to  tolerate  it
as a continuing phantom chauffeur  on  a  seemingly  new  journey.  The  TRC
enabled us to come to a reckoning of our past, which is crucial in  ensuring
that the corrective action processes, which flow from its work, do not  lose
their historical moorings and condemn us to moral and political drift.

Indeed, the TRC recognised that for genuine  and  meaningful  reconciliation
to take place, we must ensure moral and political restitution in  the  sense
of what the Germans call ``wiedergutmachung'', which means  ``to  make  good
again'' or, as we say in South Africa, ``ukubuyisana'', ``to return to  each
other''. [Applause.] We cannot really enter into the process of making  good
the history of South Africa unless we acknowledge precisely  the  bad  there
is  to  undo.  We  cannot  enter  upon  the  rich  and  nuanced  process  of
reconciliation armed only with mumbled banalities about the  past  being  an
innocent mistake and - I am very pleased to say  -  as  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition has said, we must not close the door into the past.

What kind of memory of the past do we need to build a new South  Africa?  We
need a memory based not on the bitter resentment of the past as is  in  fact
laid down in the African  claims  document,  but  on  the  possibilities  of
reconciliation for the future. In doing so, we have followed the  advice  of
that great Chilean member of  the  truth  commission,  Jose  Zalaquett,  who
insisted that a society ``cannot  reconcile  itself  on  the  grounds  of  a
divided memory. Since memory is identity, this would  result  in  a  divided
identity''.

Memory, I should say, needs a place, a  habitation  and  a  name.  Whilst  a
truism that those who forget  their  past  are  doomed  to  repeat  it,  the
reverse comfort does not necessarily hold. A society may remember  its  past
and  nevertheless  repeat  it,  or  even  surpass  it  in  its  cruelty.  So
Afrikaners suffering at the hands of British imperialism, awful as  it  was,
early this century, actually fuelled the  racial  oppression  of  apartheid,
rather than serving as an admonition against it.

Therefore we must, as part of  the  healing  process,  identify  the  common
bonds that hold us together as a  nation.  The  Constitution,  for  example,
provides us with the basis for nation-building. In this way, we can in  fact
carry out ``ukubuyisana'' in practice.

Since the devil can quote history to  his  or  her  own  purpose,  a  simple
factual record of the apartheid past, devoid of an ethical basis,  would  be
of little value. What matters is  not  merely  the  fact  that  we  remember
history, but the way in which we remember it - in this  context,  one  where
we take full measure of the past. Our country can become a safer  place  for
idealism, the sort of place that Seamus Heaney had in mind when he wrote  of
those rare times and places ``when hope and history rhyme''.

It is between our divided past and our hopes for  the  future  that  we  can
only build such bridges, as anticipated in the TRC report, in  the  present.
As we receive the Final Report of the  TRC,  we  find  another  occasion  to
recommit ourselves to a central message that  we  need  to  acknowledge  the
ongoing efforts to bridge-building that will provide the moral and  material
basis for ensuring such a past is never again repeated.

In doing so, we should remember that the focus is on building,  and  not  on
restoration; of imagining afresh and starting anew.  We  are  not  restoring
what was lost, as  if  we  are  returning  to  some  golden  age,  prior  to
apartheid, of tolerance,  understanding  and  multiculturalism.  If  we  are
going to fight back, what are we going to fight back about? Some  return  to
some rights and ideals and some kind of requirement  that's  vital  for  the
maintenance of our democratic order? [Interjections.]

As Antjie Krog has noted, is reconciliation or restoration  the  right  word
in a country where there is nothing to go back  to,  no  previous  state  or
relationships one would wish to restore? Or is it, as she  intimates,  about
the recovery of a lost humanity squandered on the violent pursuit of  racial
purity and ethnic self-interest?

As the TRC has revealed, we have been a wounded, divided and deeply  scarred
society. It would therefore be extremely foolish to remain complacent  about
the deep suspicions that continue to exist in the country,  as  exemplified,
ironically, in some of the opposition to the inception of the  TRC  and  its
continued work. It would be foolish to expect that the severe  corrosion  of
our human dignity would heal quickly  and  without  purposeful  effort.  So,
active  reconciliation  and  focused  attention  to  developing  the  values
necessary to support our democracy are needed.

We cannot afford the amnesia out of any alleged fatigue about the  past.  We
cannot afford to be fatigued about the past. So, in  this  work  of  bridge-
building, we affirm  that  reparations  must  take  the  form  not  only  of
monetary compensation, but also other forms of redress. We were  all  struck
by how often victims told the TRC that what  they  wanted  was  their  loved
ones to be found to be commemorated by a marker, a  plaque  or  a  memorial.
The work of memorialisation, from shared monuments such as Freedom  Park  to
individual grave markers,  is  a  significant  aspect  of  reparations.  The
issuing  of  death  certificates,  the  expedition  of  reburials,  and  the
facilitation of outstanding legal matters  also  respond  to  the  needs  of
victims.

Financial reparation, therefore, is part of the redress, so funds have  been
set aside for reparations and other forms of reparations, and the  President
has referred to the Government's obligation under section 27(1) of  the  TRC
Act. The TRC, however, was mandated to deal with individual reparations  for
victims of gross violations, but we must also remember  that  the  real  and
offensive gross violations affected  over  35  million  people  through  the
policy of apartheid. Their suffering must also be  addressed.  It  would  be
extremely insensitive and absurd to suggest that the  victims  of  apartheid
can be limited to only 22 000 people. Therefore, the class actions,  as  the
President  mentioned,  currently  being  considered  in  the  United  States
against multinational corporations that  did  business  with  the  apartheid
government are completely  inappropriate  as  the  assumption  continues  to
individualise claims when the real crime against  humanity  was  against  an
entire people whose right to self-determination was abolished.

South Africa must settle the issue for itself, and does not  need  the  help
of ambulance chasers and contingency operators, whether in Switzerland,  the
Netherlands or the United States of America.  As  South  Africans,  we  have
effectively dealt with our own historical challenges, and we  will  continue
to do so. It is part of our sovereign right. And companies and  individuals,
I know, as part of  this  consensus,  will  have  to  deal  with  their  own
responsibility about what happened in the past,  and  the  need  to  provide
redress. This is the South African way of doing  things,  and  we  will  not
take any lessons from any courts from outside South Africa.

In this spirit, Parliament was directed  by  the  interim  Constitution,  in
terms of the TRC Act, to adopt a law providing  for  amnesty  and  which  is
introduced  by  the  words  ``  in  order  to  advance  reconciliation   and
reconstruction''.  This  unique  association  between   reconciliation   and
reconstruction and of amnesty and  reparation  was  a  truly  South  African
solution which  has  drawn  the  praise  of  the  rest  of  the  world.  So,
reconciliation is intrinsically linked to and part of the reconstruction  of
our country. Otherwise, as we have been warned  by  Archbishop  Tutu,  there
will never be peace in our country.

This is because we recognise that the criminal act of apartheid was  in  and
of itself the most fundamental violation of human  rights,  which  permeated
all parts of our society. We therefore cannot simply limit our  response  to
that of individual reparations. Instead, we will do better  to  continue  on
our path to achieve sustainable  collective  redress  through  socioeconomic
programmes that invest  in  people,  eradicate  poverty,  create  employment
opportunities and redress the legacy of exclusion. This is the real task  of
reconciliation.

My task is a simple one: Individual healing ultimately requires  a  restored
and healthy society within which the aggrieved person  can,  to  the  extent
that is possible, get on with his or her life. This  requires  the  creation
of a society within which victims and  survivors  of  past  atrocities  have
reason to hope, and beyond hope, to expect to be able  to  find  employment,
to obtain adequate schooling for their children, and  a  decent  roof  under
which family cohesion and respect  can  be  generated.  The  creation  of  a
balanced, stable and just society within which there  are  adequate  social,
education and health services for all must surely be  the  moral  foundation
for any reparations policy.

To suggest, therefore, that a monetary payment  is  all  that  a  victim  or
survivor of a gross violation of human rights requires  is  insensitive.  It
smacks of ignorance and indifference. We must provide a policy that is  more
reasonable and more sensitive to the needs of our people than that. It is  a
policy that involves the need to heal the often haunting memories  of  those
who have suffered. It involves access to  social  and  health  services.  It
involves time and, above  all,  space  within  which  to  remember  and  pay
respect to those who have fallen in pursuit of democracy.  It  involves  the
public spaces where we, as a nation, can commit ourselves to remember  as  a
basis for ensuring the atrocities of the past do not reoccur in the future.

Therefore, for true reconciliation, we must acknowledge  the  necessity  for
redress, best explained  in  the  Afrikaans  words  ``regstellende  aksie'',
which  requires  the  need  for  corrective  action  by  the  state  and  is
guaranteed by the Constitution.

In the end, we say we mark the contribution  of  the  TRC  as  part  of  the
process of learning about the past, part of that process which history  will
complete. Let us not forget that we have changed because of  the  work  that
South Africans undertook.

I end by referring to  the  prophetic  call  of  our  great  leader,  Albert
Luthuli, who, almost 60 years ago, expressed the hope that ``here  in  South
Africa, with all our diversities of colour and race, we will show the  world
a new pattern for democracy and set a new example for the world.''

We have met the great Albert Luthuli's wishes of 40 years ago. [Applause.]

Mr M A  MNCWANGO:  Madam  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  of  the
Republic of South Africa, Chairperson of the National Council of  Provinces,
Ministers and hon members, at the outset, I must express the  IFP's  concern
about the fact  that  the  National  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  has
already directed that prosecutions should begin regarding those  alleged  to
have committed political crimes associated with the conflicts  of  the  past
but who did not apply for amnesty within the TRC process. If we are  serious
about closing the book of the past conflict,  we  need  to  let  bygones  be
bygones, otherwise our future will continue to be bedevilled  by  our  past.
[Interjections.] A decision must be made to either not prosecute or  promote
an amnesty which will be administered by the judiciary.

As this Parliament considers the report  of  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission, we ought to debate it without approving it.  It  is  tragic  for
democracy  when  any  parliament  or  government  adopts  a  document  which
purports to describe our past. Any government-endorsed  version  of  history
is an attack on the truth and an act of autocracy. We must merely  note  the
report of the TRC and give it no status or special recognition.  Its  status
and value will be determined  by  history  as  future  historians  tear  its
shortcomings apart and rewrite a more balanced  and  analytical  account  of
our recent history.

Our Parliament should not become the object of  the  same  criticisms  which
our posterity will undoubtedly  level  against  this  report  and  therefore
contaminate ourselves by lending it the  credibility  of  our  approval.  In
fact, the TRC report is a flawed product of a flawed process conducted  with
flawed motives. [Interjections.] In  the  law  which  was  adopted  by  this
Parliament, the only statutory purpose of the  TRC  was  that  of  promoting
national reconciliation. To achieve that end and fulfil  its  sole  purpose,
the TRC was mandated to do three things:  firstly,  to  undertake  a  truth-
finding exercise; secondly, to administer amnesty; and, thirdly, to  provide
reparations. The TRC has abysmally failed to achieve its goal  of  promoting
reconciliation. In fact, as this very debate  incontrovertibly  proves,  its
final report is a major setback on the path of reconciliation.

The IFP is fully committed to continuing to promote  reconciliation  at  all
costs and at all levels. For this reason, we must call upon  all  people  of
goodwill to be united in rejecting the TRC report, which has  little  to  do
with either truth or justice. [Interjections.] The TRC was  foreshadowed  in
the interim Constitution which was finalised at the World Trade  Centre  and
was the product of a bilateral political accommodation reached  between  the
then ruling NP  and  ANC  alliance.  Both  political  forces  had  a  vested
interest in reducing the conflicts of the past  into  a  bilateral  paradigm
which obliterated the role played, in our struggle for  liberation,  by  the
IFP and its leader, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. [Interjections.]

The TRC was conceived, staffed and provisioned within the cultural  paradigm
of a bilateral conflict and the promoters of the  armed  struggle  portrayed
as the sole and authentic expression of the will of the  oppressed  majority
on the one  hand,  and  on  the  other  hand  the  oppressor.  There  is  no
recognition that the liberation of all South Africans would  not  have  come
about without the relentless political on-the-ground  work  of  Inkatha  and
the efforts made by its leader, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to  secure  the
release of all political prisoners and the unbanning of  political  parties.
[Interjections.]

The many lies which were employed in the '80s and the early '90s  to  vilify
Inkatha and its leader have yet to be expunged from the record  of  history,
and they are at the basis of the  TRC  mindset  in  many  of  its  findings.
Accordingly, the TRC report may be valuable in increasing the  understanding
of the dynamics of black-on-white and white-on-black conflicts. However,  it
shows how clueless the  TRC  was  in  understanding  and  dealing  with  the
dynamics, causes and episodes of the black-on-black conflict.  The  TRC  was
never staffed and equipped  to  adequately  investigate  the  black-on-black
conflict and expose the culpability of those  who  generated  it.  The  best
example of many of its shortcomings  lies  in  the  cavalier  attitude  with
which it dealt with one of South Africa's greatest tragedies which  was  the
targeted  killing  of  about  400  IFP  leaders  and  office-bearers  in   a
systematic plan of mass assassinations in their houses,  public  places  and
in their workplaces.
Ngifuna ukuthatha leli thuba ngikhumbule  ngokuhlonipha  ubaba  uMnu  Sabela
owabulawa   eMlazi;   futhi   ngikhumbule   ngokuhlonipha   uBaba    uSibiya
owayeyinduna eWema, e-S J  Smith  Hostel,  owabulawa  kabi  kanjalo.  Ngithi
angihloniphe kakhulu uMnu  Moses  Khumalo  owayengusihlalo  weziko  leNkatha
eMeadowlands; ngikhumbule uNksz Maki Sikhosana owaba  ngowokuqala  ukubulawa
nge-necklacing; ngikhumbule nekhansela uDlamini waseVaal owabulawa ngayo  le
ndlela. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to  father  Mr  Sabelo
who was killed at Mlazi. I also pay tribute to father Mr Sibiya  who  was  a
headman in S J Smith Hostel in Wema, who was also brutally killed.

I would like to honour Mr Moses Khumalo  who  was  the  chairperson  of  the
iNkatha branch in Meadowlands. I pay tribute to Ms Maki  Sikhosana  who  was
the first person to be necklaced. I also pay tribute to  Councillor  Dlamini
of the Vaal who was also killed in a similar way.]
The TRC findings about Inkatha and its leader, Prince Mangosuthu  Buthelezi,
remain outlandish and preposterous. To mention but  a  single  example,  the
TRC failed to appreciate the fundamental element of law and  fact  that,  as
the former Minister of Police of the erstwhile  KwaZulu  government,  Prince
Mangosuthu Buthelezi had no operational control whatsoever over the  KwaZulu
Police which  was  effectively  directed  by  a  commissioner  appointed  by
Pretoria in a system analogous to the present status  of  police  forces  in
our provinces. [Interjections.] Therefore, holding him accountable  in  that
representative capacity for action taken outside any  chain  of  command  by
people loosely affiliated with the KwaZulu Police, as the TRC has  done,  is
nothing short of outright bad faith.

The TRC was charged with the task of reconstructing the  truth  but  it  was
not held to the standard of truth itself, nor was it equipped with any  tool
by means of which,  through  time  immemorial,  the  truth  is  ascertained.
Actually, in respect of the TRC, this Parliament has suspended  the  law  of
defamation which applies to all of us and  all  organs  of  state.  The  TRC
enabling statute has allowed the TRC to make false findings which could  not
be challenged in court on the basis of their being untrue. It  could  do  so
for as long as someone gave false information  to  the  TRC.  There  was  no
mechanism to expunge out of  the  TRC  report  such  false  information  and
ensure that the TRC findings  were  based  only  on  information  which  had
passed the scrutiny of a true-or-false test.

In fact, the TRC collected its information by means of statements  of  self-
confessed murderers who were motivated to  make  such  statements  by  their
desperate need  to  receive  amnesty  for  their  crimes.  They  gave  their
evidence in a context in which no effective mechanism existed to verify  the
truthfulness of their statements such  as  cross  examination,  rebuttal  of
evidence or independent verification of facts and  circumstances.  Moreover,
amnesty applicants were induced to embroider  upon  their  stories  because,
under the law  governing  the  TRC,  their  confessions  of  all  the  facts
relevant to their applications and descriptions of  their  crimes  were  not
sufficient.
They were required to do much more without a clear indication of  what  that
``much more'' was. Many  applications  were  declined  because  such  ``much
more'' was not volunteered. They were required to make a full disclosure  in
respect of anything else which might have been relevant to  the  TRC's  task
to reconstruct the conflicts of the past. Effectively, they knew  that  they
had to please the TRC. Even that  was  not  enough  for  people  to  receive
amnesty. They also had to prove a connection between  their  heinous  crimes
and the political leadership of a party or organisation. They had  to  prove
that what they did was part and parcel of an authorised political course  of
action.

It was extremely difficult for IFP applicants and many other  applicants  to
meet those requirements in the light of the fact that the stated  policy  of
the IFP and the millions of written and recorded pronouncements made by  its
leader, Prince Mangosuthu  Buthelezi,  always  rejected  violence  and  only
allowed  for  the  exercise  of  the  common  law  right  of   self-defence.
[Interjections.] Therefore,  amnesty  applicants  outrightly  invented  that
their crimes were ordered by the  IFP  leadership  or  that,  in  their  own
minds, they thought  that  they  might  have  pleased  the  IFP  leadership.
However, even in this context, not one single witness could  state  that  at
any  level  of  the  IFP's  governing  structures  any  gross  human  rights
violation was ever authorised. None of such  dubious  witnesses  could  ever
state that at any juncture of history the Inkatha leader, Prince  Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, ever authorised or ordered any  gross  human  rights  violations.
[Interjections.] He is the only leader involved in the conflict of the  past
who never ordered or authorised violence. [Interjections.]

It is significant ... [Interjections.] Members should listen to this: It  is
significant that the top ANC leadership applied for  blanket  amnesty  which
covered  27  of  its  highest  ranking  leaders  who,  by  virtue  of   such
application, admitted under oath that they were guilty of  gross  violations
of human rights. [Interjections.] It is also significant that the  President
of the Republic of South  Africa  admitted  before  the  TRC  that  the  ANC
leadership had  been  involved  in  plotting  the  assassination  of  Prince
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. [Interjections.] This is in the very same report.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, would you please take your seat.

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, will you please ask the House  to  listen  to
our speaker. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! [Interjections.] Order! Hon members, I  have  repeatedly
called for order. You will not serve the debate by  drowning  out  speakers.
Please proceed.

Mr M A MNCWANGO: Madam Speaker, I want to repeat this  because  members  did
not  quite  get  it.  [Interjections.]  It  is  also  significant  that  His
Excellency the President of the Republic of  South  Africa  admitted  before
the  TRC  that  the  ANC  leadership  had  been  involved  in  plotting  the
assassination of the hon Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. [Interjections.] I  am
not even mentioning the gross human rights violations which  were  committed
by  apartheid  and  the  NP  because,  in  that  respect,  the   report   is
sufficiently revealing. Yet, the political party which became the victim  of
both the violence of the armed struggle and the  violence  of  apartheid  is
portrayed in this report as the major promoter of violence. And, its  leader
is held politically  accountable  for  the  violence  directed  against  its
followers. That defies any logic.

The TRC's bias is exposed in its pathetic scramble for any pretext  to  hold
Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi accountable for the violence and real  onslaught
which was directed at Inkatha. The TRC found one  single  public  speech  of
Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi out of millions of documents of written  private
and public addresses in which he  constantly  upheld  nonviolence.  In  that
single 20-page document, the TRC found a single sentence  which  it  twisted
and turned around to indicate that  Prince  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi  supported
violence when he had, indeed, merely indicated that the IFP had  to  oppose,
at the political level, the ANC violence with all  possible  means.  In  the
TRC's  pathetic  mind,  this  was  the  smoking  gun  on  which  its  entire
preposterous reconstruction of history seemed to hinge.

 As the IFP predicted, the entire TRC process was such that the  combination
of these various elements proved to be ideal to prompt  people  to  lie  and
prepared the TRC to become a receptacle of discredited clichés of  political
propaganda and old lies used to vilify Inkatha and its leader. Like in  many
other inquisitions of which history bears memory, the supplicants  ended  up
telling the inquisitors what they thought the  inquisitors  wanted  to  hear
and regurgitated old lies and propaganda. Those who were confronted  by  the
Spanish Inquisition confirmed doubtful sexual  intercourse  with  the  devil
himself. Those who gave evidence to the TRC did not wish to  antagonise  the
new  ruling  party  and  teamed  up  in  the  Buthelezi-and-Inkatha  bashing
exercise which the TRC was more than culturally and politically prepared  to
accept without any criticism.

The proof of that assertion is also found in the TRC's  reckless  breach  of
section 30 of its governing statute which required it to give notice of  its
contemplated findings to those adversely affected by them, and to give  some
consideration to any objection or evidence that it received from them.  This
was the only means and available mechanism  to  correct  errors  and  ensure
some balance and impartiality in the report. But, in the  case  of  the  IFP
and its leader, in respect of most of its findings the TRC  failed  to  give
such notice and when it gave  it,  it  maintained  its  findings  completely
unaltered in spite of well-documented evidence produced to rebut that.

The TRC chose not to listen and did not want facts to get in the way of  its
propaganda. In truth, not one single fact alleged by the TRC  detracts  from
the fundamental statement that at no time did  Prince  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi
ever authorise, order, condone or ratify any gross human rights  violations.
Similarly, nothing can detract from the fundamental  historical  truth  that
the IFP was the victim of  the  armed  struggle  waged  against  it  by  the
combined forces of the ANC, MK and the UDF because of our  stand  in  favour
of passive  resistance  and  nonviolence,  and  our  rejection  of  military
action.

Once the history of South Africa is properly written  in  a  more  objective
manner it will emerge that, had  Prince  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi  and  Inkatha
embraced the armed struggle, the whole  of  South  Africa  would  have  been
reduced  to  ashes  leaving  no  spoils  of  war  for  the  liberation  day.
[Interjections.] When history is properly rewritten,  it  will  also  emerge
that Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi has been  the  great  unsung  hero  of  our
liberation struggle. [Interjections.] He always  advocated  the  path  of  a
negotiated solution which,  in  the  end,  triumphed.  He  was  offered  the
opportunity of drafting a democratic constitution on a bilateral basis  with
the NP which would have provided democracy  and  universal  suffrage  before
political prisoners were released and the prohibited  parties  unbanned.  He
refused to negotiate until all political parties were unbanned.

Whilst others were abroad,  he  mobilised  our  oppressed  people  by  their
millions and created bridges across the divide of apartheid. He created  the
basis on which the new South Africa was shaped. He really does  not  deserve
the humiliation of the TRC's slanderous publications. Since the beginning  -
members should listen  to  this  -  the  IFP  and  its  leader  opposed  the
appointment of Archbishop Desmond Tutu as the Chairperson of TRC because  of
his inherent bias. Why? He was the official patron of the UDF - one  of  the
major participants in the conflicts of the past on  which  the  TRC  had  to
shed light. [Interjections.] From the very beginning the TRC was  biased  on
its  intended  purposes.  For  this  reason,   for   me,   the   Truth   and
Reconciliation  Commission  remains  a  sensationalist  circus  of   horrors
presided over by some people who craved the centre-stage spotlight. I  thank
you.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Madam  Chairperson,  President,  Deputy
President, representatives of the TRC, my colleagues in  this  House,  there
are moments in all our  lives  that  are  poignant  -  in  this  case  sadly
poignant. There are moments that condense emotion, intellect  and  strategic
need in a very perplexing manner. They stretch our capacity to  define  what
is right and wrong, what is wise and what is convenient.

This is such a moment for me. This debate is in itself a  testimony  to  our
endeavour and sacrifice. As I prepared my input, painful  memories  came  to
the surface. Around 21:00 many years ago in Pietermaritzburg we  assured  an
old man that he was safe, even though he  had  given  us  vital  information
about the events in the misty hills around that  town.  Bullets  ripped  him
apart less than 12 hours later.  Lubovski,  an  advocate  and  Makathini,  a
trade unionist, were present then but are dead now.  Their  deaths  occurred
in different ways at different times. Whilst we  tried  to  protect  her  we
failed, and Bheki's mother died. Senseless acts that walk ghost-like in  our
memories.

What we are about now is to lay these ghosts to rest  with  dignity  and  to
build something new and valuable on these ashes. I survived  and,  like  all
of us who did, why we survived is never quite clear. What is clear  is  that
as survivors our responsibility is to build and to  reconcile.  We  remember
not to revenge, but to honour and to draw the strength we need to carry  out
the reconstruction and development of our beloved land. [Applause.]

As we now consider the historic  output  of  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission we must do so with circumspection and consideration of  where  we
stand more than eight years after the first  democratic  election.  What  is
now wise and just?

In considering the Government's response  to  proposals  for  some  form  of
reparation from the business sector, the Government must take  into  account
the wider context of our  economic  transformation,  as  our  President  has
outlined. The TRC had to look at actions to establish what had happened  and
to consider the reparations for victims of these past events. As  Government
we have to balance the need for reparations to persons  with  the  necessary
economic growth and development that will provide a  structural  redress  to
an iniquitous past. A structural redress  is  not  the  same  as  individual
compensation, although the latter can be achieved to  a  greater  or  lesser
extent within the former. However, what is  critical,  colleagues,  is  that
the  means  of  achieving  structural  redress,  in  essence   an   economic
revolution,  are  distinct  from  the  more  limited  actions  required  for
individual compensation.

The approach of Government - my President has outlined this -  has  been  to
provide compensation to a  limited  number  of  individuals  who  have  been
identified, and for this considerable resources have  been  made  available.
For the millions of persons who were  involved  in  the  struggle  with  its
hardship and sacrifice we need to take a different approach. Here our  focus
has been on achieving structural redress and bringing about  greater  equity
as a basis for a growing economy that provides a better  life  for  all.  In
this endeavour we are able to involve all citizens  and  thereby  contribute
to reconciliation through a common endeavour  to  achieve  greater  economic
justice.  This  approach  does  take  time  and  is  complex.  It  is   even
inconvenient from the point of view of linking cause and effect.

This approach was first  set  out  in  the  Reconstruction  and  Development
Programme and has been implemented in various phases over the last eight  to
nine years. This is a consistent and  managed  process  of  economic  reform
that is designed to meet basic  needs;  develop  all  our  human  resources;
rebuild our economy to make it competitive in  a  global  economy;  increase
the level of participation by all in our institutions  in  the  economy  and
society; coordinate our actions at all three spheres of  Government  and  to
retain macroeconomic stability so as to allow  for  certainty  and  economic
predictability.

The achievements of this approach are growing with time. At  the  centre  of
our approach is to increase the levels of investment,  economic  and  socio-
economic in nature, so as to create jobs within a  competitive  economy  and
to ensure greater racial and geographic equality  of  economic  opportunity.
Within this process there has been a growing level  of  partnership  between
the public and private sector. After the Job Summit  the  formation  of  the
Business Trust with specific joint objectives was part of this  partnership.
More  recently  the  introduction  of  the  Strategy  for   Black   Economic
Empowerment is another comprehensive process to achieve redress of the  past
structure of racial inequality. Further  areas  of  common  action  will  be
identified in the Growth and  Development  Summit  to  be  held  within  two
months. In major charters, such as that in the mining industry,  many  other
actions to develop communities are identified.

The question Government had to ask is, what would be the purpose of a  once-
off wealth tax or some other form of financial reparation from the  business
community? And secondly, if we adopted it, what would its impact be  on  our
growth and development, which is the basis for a more prosperous future  for
all?

Would this reparation be designed to make resources available  or  is  it  a
form of recompense or penance by white persons, specifically  white  persons
who were part of the business community of the past? If the intention,  even
in part, is to raise funds, then we  do  not  believe  it  is  an  advisable
instrument. The success of our macroeconomic reform has eased the  financial
constraints we experienced earlier. And as the President indicated, we  have
never argued that finance is the obstacle.

The  key  consideration  now  is  the  efficacy  of  expenditure   and   the
opportunity cost of  any  one  form  of  expenditure  against  another.  The
Government is of the  view  that  we  have  made  funds  available  for  all
feasible forms of sustainable expenditure. We do  not  need  to  impose  new
taxes to spend  on  social  areas,  although  obviously  we  can  build  new
partnerships to do this. This does not mean  of  course  that  any  possible
situation can be financed. There are  always  constraints  and  limitations.
What is considered is the efficacy of the  expenditure  within  the  overall
objective of growth and development.

Any form of reparation should be lasting and  extensive.  From  an  economic
and fiscal point of view, therefore, it is not prudent or even necessary  to
try and finance such lasting programmes from a once-off  tax.  The  existing
tax level can provide for social needs, whilst not acting as a  disincentive
for saving, investment or enterprise development. It should be  pointed  out
that in order  to  normalise  asset  holdings  and  capital  movements,  the
recently announced amnesty on illegally transferred funds  will  make  funds
available for black economic empowerment. As we reform the mining  industry,
the royalty on mining is in a sense a further form of redress, if  you  take
it in that context.  So  further  levies  of  any  form  is  not  considered
necessary or wise.

If the purpose is to be recompense or penance, then the Government does  not
believe that this is a move that will enhance reconciliation  at  this  time
in our new democracy. We must now close this past as we build a  future.  As
we have spelt out in the Strategy on Black Economic Empowerment,  it  is  in
the interests of every citizen that we achieve our objectives in this  area.
We need to act together, and white business  is  being  called  upon  to  go
beyond the perceived scope of day-to-day  business  in  order  to  ensure  a
prosperous future.

Reparations are being made in a challenging and exciting  common  action  to
build our economy for all so as to release its  full  potential  for  growth
and development. Imposing a levy on business may have had a  rationale  when
funds were short or common programmes  non-existent,  but  its  effects  now
will be counterproductive to what we are achieving. We  cannot  afford  this
in our economy as we drive to higher levels of  growth  and  development  on
the basis of our successful economic reform.  We  also  need  to  take  into
account that the process of black economic empowerment has already begun  to
meld black and white business interests and their collective future.

The practicality of a levy is complex and there can  be  no  useful  purpose
served by adding a new levy to the  emerging  melding  of  black  and  white
economic enterprise. To compensate individuals but to  reduce  our  capacity
for growth and development is not a wise choice and we need to  stay  within
the approach that compensates a limited group and  then  drives  for  common
action to improve the lives of all.

These are not easy balances to decide on and there are elements  of  justice
in all possibilities. As a nation we have to find that balance  that  builds
our future, but it is not easy. The considered opinion of the TRC  certainly
carries weight. However, the wider context and trajectory  of  our  economic
transformation  that  Government  has  to  take  into  account  must  inform
Government's decision. We are sure that the business community  will  accept
the challenge of working together to erase the divisions of our past and  to
build a collective future based on prosperity and justice for all.

It is for all the above reasons that we are opposed to -  as  the  President
has indicated - and indeed contemptuous of attempts to  use  unsound  extra-
territorial legal precepts in the USA to seek  personal  financial  gain  in
South Africa. Whilst individuals have an  inviolate  right  to  recourse  in
law, and this is firmly entrenched in South Africa, it is an  abuse  to  use
the law, unsound law at that, of another land  to  undermine  our  sovereign
right to settle our past and build our future as we see fit. South  Africans
involved in this break that indefinable collectivist identity that  was  the
origin of  our  strength.  The  Government  rejects  the  actions  of  legal
practitioners in the USA to exploit our  history  and  will  not  allow  any
judgement made in the USA or elsewhere to be carried out in South Africa.

The spirit of the TRC must now guide us as we  work  together  to  reconcile
and to bring about growth and development. Together we  have  come  to  know
what is right and our common reflection will guide us as to  what  is  wise.
Our greatest reparation for the  realities  of  our  past  is  to  become  a
prosperous, peaceful and humane nation.

To the honourable member who spoke before me: I applied for  amnesty  and  I
got it. And I did it because I  believe  it  is  the  best  way  to  make  a
contribution to the future of our society.
[Applause.].

The PREMIER OF THE WESTERN CAPE: Chairperson, in many respects the  TRC  has
straddled the historical divide between the old and the  new  South  Africa.
With its feet firmly rooted in our past, and its gaze fixed on  our  future,
it has been one of the defining features of our first decade  of  democracy.
As a country  we  have  been  sometimes  outraged,  sometimes  shocked,  and
sometimes shamed by the evidence we  have  heard.  We  have  wept  with  the
victims and their families, and we have marvelled at  the  strength  of  the
human spirit.

Although we are today closing the book on the proceedings of  the  TRC,  and
considering its final recommendations, we  should  also  pause  to  make  an
honest evaluation of its work. It was always too high a standard  to  expect
from the Commission to achieve 100% truth or 100%  reconciliation.  Yet,  it
did play a critical  role  in  normalising  our  approach  to  life  in  our
country. It provided a release valve for much of the hurt, pain,  anger  and
anguish which resulted from the injustices and the oppression of apartheid.

Die werklike betekenis van die WVK  lê  nie  net  in  sy  bevindings  en  sy
aanbevelings nie, maar ook in die feit dat die kommissie  daartoe  in  staat
was om sy loop te neem. Hoewel dit nie 'n volmaakte proses was nie, was  die
WVK-proses  net  so  nodig  soos   die   aanvanklike   onderhandelinge   wat
uiteindelik die nuwe demokratiese Suid-Afrika daargestel het.

In ons land waar ons uit verskillende agtergronde kom,  sou  die  proses  om
verskillende ervarings met mekaar te  versoen,  en  waardering  daarvoor  te
skep, altyd 'n pynlike, maar ook soms 'n kontroversiële ervaring  wees.  Die
WVK het daartoe bygedra om die fondament te lê waarop bruin, swart,  wit  en
Indiër kan bou  aan  'n  gesamentlike  toekoms.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The  real  meaning  of  the  TRC  does  not  lie  in   its   findings   and
recommendations only, but also in the fact that the Commission was  able  to
take its course. Although it was not a perfect process, the TRC process  was
just as necessary as the initial negotiations  that  eventually  established
the new democratic South Africa.
In our country, where we come from different  backgrounds,  the  process  of
reconciling the various  experiences  with  one  another,  and  creating  an
appreciation  for  it,  would  always  be  a  painful,  but  also  sometimes
controversial experience. The TRC contributed to laying  the  foundation  on
which brown, black, white and Indian can build together on a joint future.]

As a nation, our thanks must be extended to Archbishop Tutu  and  the  other
commissioners, and also the staff of the TRC.  [Applause.]  Even  more  than
the rest of South Africa, they must have known  that  many  observers  would
either criticise  the  final  report  of  the  Commission,  or  dismiss  its
findings as biased or irrelevant a decade  after  the  fact.  Despite  this,
they have rendered a significant service to South  Africa;  a  service  with
regard to addressing our past in order to  strengthen  our  future  resolve.
The TRC has assisted us, once on different sides  of  history,  to  be  part
today of building our common future.

The New NP has  also  certainly  been  critical  of  some  aspects  of  this
process, like the  composition  of  the  Commission,  and  the  remarks  and
conduct of certain commissioners during the process.  But  on  balance,  the
positive aspects have outweighed the negative ones. The TRC opened our  eyes
to incidents and issues to which we might  otherwise  have  been  oblivious.
This was particularly true of the individual experiences which were  shared;
of  families  and  loved-ones  missing;  of  innocent  victims  of  bravery,
depravity and tragic loss.

What the TRC did not reveal, because it could  not,  were  the  hundreds  of
thousands of untold experiences. In asking: "What now for reconciliation  in
South Africa?", the answer must always remain: We must ensure that the  many
told and untold experiences are never repeated.

The TRC has shared with us all  one  part  of  the  story  of  our  country.
Another part, the largely untold narratives, are  also  about  the  loss  of
opportunity  and  the  degradation  of  human  dignity,  like  that  of  May
Abrahamse. Born in the heart of  District  Six,  she  is  one  of  the  most
talented South African performers who has  ever  lived.  She  portrayed  the
leading female characters in a  host  of  musicals,  and  she  sang  leading
soprano roles in major operas. But in the apartheid years, at the height  of
her talent, she was never given the opportunity to perform as a  soloist  at
any of the major  opera  houses.  Instead,  she  went  about  teaching,  and
imparting  her  talent  and  technique  to  countless  young   people   from
disadvantaged backgrounds.

It was only in 2001 that she appeared for the first time  on  stage  at  the
Artscape Theatre in Cape Town. Last week in the Western Cape, May  Abrahamse
received provincial government honours for  her  lifelong  achievements  and
dedication. [Applause.]

Nor was the experience mentioned of Gary Boshoff, one of the  many  talented
and exceptional coloured  sportsmen  who  were  denied  the  opportunity  to
represent their country at the highest competitive level. Born  in  Caledon,
here in the Boland, he started playing representative rugby in 1984, and  he
was selected to play for Saru in that  same  year.  In  1989,  linked  to  a
bursary to continue  his  studies  at  Oxford,  he  was  presented  with  an
opportunity to play in the Oxford-Cambridge Derby,  anybody's  dream.  Given
his personal commitment to Saru's policy, that prohibited its  members  from
playing international rugby at the time, he declined that opportunity.

In 2001, along with other coloured and black players  who  were  denied  the
opportunity to represent their country at international  level,  he  finally
received his Springbok blazer. Today Gary is  the  CEO  of  the  Blue  Bulls
Rugby Union in Pretoria. [Applause.]

The truth is that the experiences of thousands of May  Abrahamses  and  Gary
Boshoffs went untold in the TRC process. In this sense, every day  in  South
Africa  is  about  truth  and  reconciliation,  about   dealing   with   the
inheritance of our past, and we all have a collective and  a  personal  role
to play in this regard.

Turning specifically to the issue of reparations, former President  Mandela,
speaking during a special debate on the TRC report in February 1999 in  this
House, acknowledged that reparations can only ever  be  symbolic,  never  in
proportion to the extent of the suffering and the sacrifice of  so  many  of
our people. In his words:


  The best reparation for the suffering of victims and communities, and the
  highest recognition of  their  efforts,  is  the  transformation  of  our
  society into one which makes a living reality of  the  human  rights  for
  which they struggled.

The New NP fully endorses this sentiment. At the same time,  though,  it  is
of great importance that final reparations are  paid  to  specific  victims.
The process of  monetary  reparations  to  individuals  does,  however,  not
nullify the need for a wider process of addressing the inequalities  created
by our past. The New NP favours the idea of a closed list;  that  those  who
have appeared before the commission, and have been part of the TRC  process,
should receive reparation payments.
President Mbeki previously, in another debate in this House, said:


  We must, however, also make the point that no  genuine  fighter  for  the
  liberation of our people ever engaged  in  struggle  for  personal  gain.
  There are many who laid down their lives, many who lost their limbs, many
  who are today disabled and many who spent their best years  in  apartheid
  prisons. None of these expected a reward, except freedom itself.

Those of us who have not  been  part  of  this  liberation  struggle  cannot
pretend to fully understand the sentiment, but  coming  from  a  people  who
have been part  of  a  liberation  struggle,  I  recognise  the  sentiments.
[Applause.] These sentiments are noble, and that is why they are  respected.
Liberation  struggles  should  always  be  for  the  common  good,  and  the
willingness to state that fearlessly pays tribute to  those  who  have  made
huge sacrifices.

The essence of these  sentiments  is  not  to  downplay  the  importance  of
monetary reparations, nor the symbolism of this kind  of  compensation.  The
essence is that once-off  reparations  are  never  sufficient  in,  and  of,
themselves. At the most basic level, the New NP  believes  that  what  South
Africa needs, most urgently, in the post-TRC period, is  a  true  reparation
of the spirit. The restoration of  real  human  dignity  will  be  the  only
lasting solution to the legacy of racial discrimination.

How best can we correct the imbalances of the past, particularly  for  those
victims of discrimination who were not part of the TRC process? By  ensuring
that the real reparations are ongoing, almost on a  daily  basis.  The  most
important means of achieving  this  goal  is  by  rooting  out  poverty  and
creating jobs, by empowering our future generations through  better  quality
education and by expanding the  ownership  of  our  economy,  for  instance,
through fast-tracked land reform programmes.

The New NP is in favour of special interventions in  order  to  address  the
inherited imbalances in education, as well as the skew distribution  of  the
ownership of land. In order to address these, and other related  issues,  we
would strongly support Government and private sector initiatives  to  inject
new capital into upgrading the education system, fast-tracking land  reform,
and the settlement of farmers from  disadvantaged  communities.  [Applause.]
We believe that the goodwill exists for new public-private  partnerships  to
be formed for empowerment in these spheres on the basis that  the  financial
contribution from the business sector  is  matched  rand  for  rand  by  the
Government.

Regardless of the format that it will take, the  fact  that  there  is  wide
agreement on the need for broader reparations illustrates that we, as  South
Africans, understand that we must collectively address  the  legacy  of  our
past, and that the will is there to do so.

It would be unseemly, that was one of the proposals from  the  side  of  the
TRC, that 10 years into our new democracy, the  President  should  apologise
on behalf  of  the  security  forces  and  state  apparatus  of  the  former
Government.

The President has given South Africans the  assurance  that  our  Government
will never allow the mistakes of the past to be repeated.  This  is  not  an
undertaking which should be taken lightly, especially with so many  prophets
of doom contending that it is only a matter  of  time  before  South  Africa
degenerates into a second Zimbabwe. [Interjections.]

President Mbeki's undertaking also places a heavy  burden  on  the  Head  of
State, the Government and the majority  in  our  country,  especially  in  a
multiracial society like South Africa.  I  say  this,  because  conventional
wisdom is that after a period of goodwill, multiracial societies often  fall
back into polarisation along racial and ethnic  lines,  propelled  by  those
whose interests are served by fuelling division and polarisation.

The New NP is particularly encouraged  by  the  signs  of  maturity  in  the
discourse in our country with regard to writing our history, and giving  due
recognition to our past. [Applause.] The Freedom  Park  Project  is  exactly
what this commitment is about. Recording the struggles  of  those  who  have
fallen to slavery, genocide, wars of resistance,  the  liberation  struggle,
the Anglo-Boer War and both World Wars. Building our shared  future  entails
acknowledgement of, and respect for, the different  strands  of  our  common
history, and a serious awareness of the need for inclusivity.

The message to minority communities in South Africa is one of invitation  to
be part, not only of the process of healing, but  also  of  the  process  of
building. For the white community specifically, those who in the  past  were
in positions of power,  the  time  has  come  to  leave  aside  feelings  of
depression about power lost, to leave aside  the  unqualified  glorification
of the past, longing for those times will never, and must never, bring  them
back. [Applause.] Instead, the invitation for  the  white  community  is  to
understand and embrace the challenges of the present and our joint future.

Confronted, as we are in South Africa, by a  critical  choice  for  minority
communities between retreating into a  laager  of  self-interest  and  self-
pity, or making a positive contribution to the mainstream of  politics,  the
choice  is  self-evident.  Instead  of  complaining  and  wallowing  in  the
depression of the loss of  privilege,  the  white  community  should  rather
celebrate being part of a much bigger South African whole. [Applause.]

There are many people in the white community who stand ready  to  join  with
us and become builders in the process  of  reconciliation.  [Applause.]  For
the coloured community this is  also  true.  However,  many  people  in  the
coloured community who were victimised by  our  past  still  feel  that  the
doors in the new South Africa have not fully opened for all South Africans.

Noble intentions are one thing, but living reconciliation is quite  another.
It is a symbol of the power of reconciliation that today Franklin  Sonn  can
be the President of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, and David Piedt can  be
the Chairperson of the Klein  Karoo  Nasionale  Kunstefees.  We  have  taken
massive steps forward, and there are  countless  examples  of  what  we  can
achieve together. There is, however, much more still to be done.

In conclusion, the first 10 years of our democracy have  partly  been  taken
up by dealing with our past. Up until now  that  has  stood  between  us  as
South Africans. Now that we can agree on the formula for dealing with  that,
we must ask ourselves what more stands  between  us  as  we  deal  with  the
challenges of our future. [Interjections.]

The TRC has assisted us in peering into the  abyss,  and  together  we  have
said: "never again". Now we must live that commitment. The  New  NP  commits
itself to doing just that, and that is to build this country, hand in  hand,
with the black majority. [Applause.]

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: Madam  Speaker,  President,  Deputy  President,
Premiers, hon members and fellow South Africans, the reason  South  Africans
went to the polls  in  millions  in  1994  is  because  all  were  tired  of
bloodshed, dictatorship and racial  domination.  They  needed  a  government
that  would  restore  their  dignity,  change  their  material   conditions,
transform their political, economic and social lives and do away  completely
with the cruel apartheid system. That is why  today  in  debating  this  TRC
report we want to say it loud  that  as  South  Africans  we  celebrate  the
triumph of the human spirit.

The TRC is one of the vehicles which was established during  the  transition
period to allow our people from different backgrounds  to  find  a  platform
...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, I ask you to  conduct  your
conversations rather more quietly. Proceed hon member.

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: ... for dealing with the  ills  and  atrocities
of apartheid. The victims were allowed to share their  pain  publicly,  they
allowed the perpetrators to accept their role in causing the pain. It was  a
window for achieving social justice while dealing  with  the  past,  healing
ourselves and reconciling so that we can build a new nation, South Africa.

Yes, it was important for us as South Africans to know the truth,  to  allow
the truth to be told, to accept the truth, to deal with the  truth  so  that
we can start the healing process. To reconcile in our inner  self  first  as
individuals especially those who were hurt, the survivors.

Ke eme mo khwi ke sena sekgopi le se se nnyane. Di fetile ka moka, bjalo  ke
mofenyi.  [I stand here without any ill feeling. All is past and gone  as  a
survivor.]

Madam  Chairperson,  what  we  learnt  from  the  Bible  is  that  when  the
Israelites left Egypt where they were slaves, they faced difficulties,  they
were tired from a long journey and not having sufficient  food,  they  faced
rains and heat - hence they started complaining and  got  divided.  This  is
not what the TRC report in front of us is about today. It is  not  going  to
divide us as South Africans. The purpose of the TRC is to help us deal  with
the past, to help us heal and create a better South Africa where  atrocities
will never be repeated again.

We should actually celebrate this triumph of the  human  spirit  and  by  so
doing we will emerge victorious. There is no price that can be  attached  to
life. Money cannot replace human life. We agree that the  Government  should
pay the money already allocated for reparations, but we do not see  monetary
payouts as the only way to compensate those who are hurt. The policies  that
the Government has adopted should be  implemented  fully,  especially  Batho
Pele.

Ga re swareng batho bageso, batho ba ga bo rena ka  hlompho  le  mabobo,  re

[Let us treat our people with respect and pride. We must make sure  that  we
perform our duties to the maximum. May I raise the point about the issue  of
people  who  disappeared  and  their  whereabouts  were  unknown   and   the
exhumations.

During 1993-1996 we saw many  families  discovering  what  had  happened  to
their beloved. But what is still in my mind, and that I will  never  forget,
is that one family's reburial of their  son  brought  reconciliation  and  a
family coming together after  they  were  separated  by  apartheid.  Parents
forgave each other as they were always blaming each other.

This is why we want reconciliation to start in our  families,  then  in  the
communities. Today we are able to meet each other and greet  all  as  fellow
South Africans.]

It is true that those who died did not die  in  vain,  so  let  us  remember
those people with dignity and  the  contribution  that  they  made  to  this
country. Let us work to ensure that the next generations  can  be  proud  of
us.

I like Bible stories, and what I learnt from the Bible is that God is a  God
of mercy, not a God of pity. When you give mercy to a  person  according  to
the Bible, you allow the person to acknowledge  his  mistakes  and  his  bad
tendencies and repent. But if you feel pity for a person you end  up  giving
a compassionate love, and not making the  person  take  the  responsibility.
That is what the TRC is about, to allow people to  acknowledge  so  that  we
can give them a chance in life.

I wish to salute the ANC leadership, because in spite of the suffering  that
was caused to them, none of them were resentful when  they  worked  on  this
process.  They  never  allowed  resentment  to  push  their  beliefs  or  to
influence their plans. This was one of  the  mistakes  that  made  the  then
National Party - not the New National Party - who took  over  in  1948  from
the United Party resentful. Therefore, they could not be rational  in  doing
certain things, they tended to protect themselves.

Judaism also teaches us that the one who bears a grudge acts  like  the  one
who, after having cut one hand while handling a knife,  avenges  himself  by
stabbing the other  hand.  Surely,  this  is  not  what  we  want  as  South
Africans.

Some months ago there was a commemoration of the Anglo-Boer  War  and  there
were concerns raised that we have to acknowledge the women of  South  Africa
- especially those who died during the Anglo-Boer War -  and  the  women  in
Winburg who participated in fighting apartheid.

Earlier on the President spoke about the Freedom Park which is  one  of  the
legacy projects. I would like to make concrete  proposals  here  because  we
know that in many countries we have learnt what they did after  their  wars.
In Voltaire's words,  ``working  takes  away  from  us  three  great  evils:
boredom, vice and need''. As human beings we can do a lot  of  work  in  our
locals because we can engage in practical projects  that  will  help  us  to
heal and to continue as a nation.

In the ANC also, there was an adoption of Vukuzenzele. In Sesotho  they  say
``Moketa ho tsoswa o itsosang, Kgomo go tsoswa yeo  e  itsosang''.  Ka  lona
leo ge o lebelela dilo tse ka moka ka maleme ka moka di a  twelela.  Seo  se
ra go re batho ba rena ga ba nyake go no dula ba amogele seo  se  tswago  mo
Mmusong. Ga se tsela yeo ba bego ba phela ka yona pele go e  tla  apartheid.
Ke tlo kgopel a gore ke laetsane le setshaba go re go na le dilo tseo re  ka
di dirago moo re lego gona.

Sa pele ... (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[We find those expressions in all languages. This is a sign that our  people
do not believe in hand-outs from the Government. This is not how they  lived
during the apartheid era. I would like to plead to the community  that  they
should know that there are things they can do in their community areas.]

Firstly, if we utilise our school walls, maybe we can dedicate one  side  of
the wall to write the names of the fallen heroes that were former pupils  at
the school and so tell our new learners about those heroes. This  will  also
help the new generation. We need to write short stories in  simple  language
about the heroes in our  areas.  We  have  started  the  process  of  naming
buildings, places and parks, but from the Government's side it is  necessary
to transform our museums to reflect the history and  culture  of  all  South
Africans.

There is a need to build graves for  unknown  soldiers.  In  some  countries
there is a wall with lists of names with an oil light which  symbolises  the
spirits of fallen heroes that will live on. We need  to  take  care  of  the
graves  of  other  South  Africans  who  are  buried  in  the   neighbouring
countries. We know that there are burial sites which are dedicated to  South
Africa, in Zambia and Tanzania. These people did not choose to  go  and  die
there, they had to leave because the situation was unbearable.

I want to thank our communities for participating in the process of the  TRC
and for the role the comrades played during the TRC. A few weeks ago we  saw
one of the comrades, comrade Helen Pastoors,  who  received  amnesty  a  few
years ago. I do not want to forget some of the comrades like Esther  Maleka,
Dorothy Nyembe, Miss Mmini,

A ke tsebe leina la gagwe efela ke a  tseba  gore  ke  morwedi  wa  Vuyisile
Mmini, ka karolo yeo ba e bapetsego mo ntweng ya rena. Ke  kgopela  gape  go

follows.)

[I do not know her name, but I know she is the daughter  of  Vuyisile  Mnini
with the role they played in our struggle.

I would like to remind Mr Mncwango that we should remember all the works  of
Desmond Tutu and his co-workers. Again we  should  thank  him  and  remember
what he has done at Graaff-Reinet at the time of the death of  Sobukwe  when
he stopped the masses from killing Dr Buthelezi [Applause.]]

Dr MANGOSUTHU BUTHELEZI: That is a lie ...

Ms S MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: All this was written in the  newspapers  and  all
over that people were trying to kill Dr Buthelezi and we  do  not  know  the
truth of everything but this is all that happened then.

When hon Mncwango was speaking, he reminded me of the googles.

Ke kgopela go re re le MaAfrika Borwa ka  moka,re  swaraneng  ka  diatla  re

paragraph follows.)

[I am asking that all South Africans unite and move forward  and  know  that
our country will never be ruined by fighting. With  or  without  armies  our
country will never turn back.]

Rev K R J MESHOE:  Chairperson,  hon  President,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, the TRC report is well put together and a lot  of  attention  has
been given to detail. The report primarily consists of page  after  page  of
testimony and reconstruction of events that various  applicants  brought  to
the  TRC  in  their  applications  for  amnesty.   With   regards   to   its
effectiveness in achieving its stated  aims  and  objectives,  I  personally
feel the TRC process fell short in some respects.

As a process  in  promoting  the  uncovering  of  truth  about  what  really
happened, it proved to be effective at times, but lacked the power to  truly
force people with the correct information to testify or  give  incriminating
evidence against those who refused to take part in the process.

A lot of criticism has been levelled against the TRC because  it  is  widely
believed  to  have  gone  beyond  its  mandate  with  regard   to   business
reparations. The  most  controversial  of  all  the  TRC  findings  is  that
businesses that benefited from  apartheid  be  made  to  pay  reparation  to
victims. The TRC report also argues  in  favour  of  claims  by  victims  of
apartheid  against  foreign  banks  and  companies  that  are   accused   of
bankrolling the apartheid state.

Although we do not agree with all the recommendations made by  the  TRC,  we
nevertheless believe that they are a genuine  attempt  to  solve  a  complex
problem of making reparation and closing a painful chapter of our history.

The ACDP agrees with the TRC that the  hon  President  of  the  Republic  of
South Africa, as Head of State, should apologise to all  victims  on  behalf
of those members of the security forces of the former state and those  armed
forces of the liberation movements who committed gross violations  of  human
rights. This will not be the first time a head of  state  makes  an  apology
for  wrongs  done  by  his  subjects  in  the   interests   of   peace   and
reconciliation. That is why the ACDP argues that the President should do  it
in the interests of national reconciliation.

Jesus Christ was the first person to ask for forgiveness on  behalf  of  the
guilty. He actually carried our guilt to  make  reconciliation  between  God
and all sinful mankind possible. This was a good  example  for  all  leaders
and heads of state to follow.

I agree with the  President  that  imposing  the  so-called  wealth  tax  on
business and industry, as proposed by the TRC, would not be a  proper  thing
to do. [Interjections.] We can talk about that. South Africans  are  already
languishing under a heavy tax burden. To the President,  I  say:  Thank  you
for doing the right thing in this matter.

Government is correct in believing that all South Africans  must  contribute
to the Reparation Fund,  rather  than  targeting  companies,  many  of  whom
contributed and are still contributing to  the  creation  of  jobs  and  the
maintenance of our infrastructure.
The President told us that members of Government will be setting an  example
by being the first to contribute to the Reparation Fund. All other  MPs  and
civil servants will find it easy to follow such an example.

There are many willing individuals and corporations  whose  conscience  must
be  pricked  and  appealed  to,  who  should  be  approached  and  asked  to
contribute to the Reparation Fund. The ACDP  believes  that  the  Government
must be commended for deciding to use the  carrot  and  not  the  stick.  If
there are incentives there will be corporations that will  give  generously,
and honoured citizens of this beautiful country will also follow suit.

I believe this concluding debate on the Final Report  of  the  TRC  has  the
potential of ushering in peace, forgiveness and reconciliation which we  are
hoping and praying for, or the potential of further dividing the  nation  on
terms which may embarrass some of us.

My closing remarks, therefore, will be to repeat what I  said  a  few  years
ago, as I believe it is still relevant  today.  Violation  of  human  rights
that were committed by some parties were  repeatedly  exposed  while  others
were not. Parties whose members were involved in acts of violence  were  not
equally treated.

It is a fact that the TRC has been used in some  instances  as  a  political
tool designed to discredit political opponents. The activities  of  the  TRC
have primarily focused on  the  violence  between  black  and  white,  while
ignoring the black-on-black violence that  resulted  in  the  necklacing  of
hundreds, if not thousands, of people, among them many innocent  people  who
were suspected of being either spies, sell-outs or collaborators.

I want to  plead  with  the  President,  his  Deputy  and  members  of  this
Parliament that we bring this painful process to an end by agreeing to  talk
about how restitution and reparations should  be  made  instead  of  talking
about or allowing selective prosecutions to take place.
For the sake of the future of this country, let us admit that  mistakes  and
abuses were  committed  by  many  of  those  who  worked  for  the  previous
government and many of those who were  violently  opposed  to  the  previous
government. We should support the prosecution of all those  who  are  guilty
of human rights violations, whether they appeared before the TRC or not,  or
we should not support the prosecution of a few unfortunate ones who  do  not
belong to a particular party. [Interjections.]

The President told us that Government has heeded the  call  for  a  national
day of prayer and traditional sacrifice. The ACDP proposes that this  should
be a national day of prayer,  repentance  and  reconciliation  and  healing,
instead of just a traditional sacrifice.

South Africa will not have genuine reconciliation without acknowledging  the
Almighty God, because reconciliation has to start in the heart and  this  is
the time for every one of us to look deep into our own heart  and  see  what
have we done and how can we contribute towards building a new South  Africa.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Chairperson, Mr President ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order! Hon  members,  please  keep  your
private conversations private. Proceed, hon member.

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Mr  President,  Deputy  President,  hon  Premiers  and  hon
members, we would be mistaken if we believed that this Final Report  of  the
TRC is the last word on human rights abuses that occurred  under  apartheid.
There are still people who refuse to  testify,  whilst  others  applied  for
blanket amnesty and failed. The whole truth has not been revealed.

Nonetheless, we must thank the TRC commissioners and their  staff,  as  well
as the many people who came forward to testify. They have shed light on  the
scale of the human suffering perpetrated upon the people of this country  by
the apartheid regime. What must happen now as speedily as possible  is  that
those who have bared their souls before the TRC, and who  have  been  proved
to be victims of gross human rights violations, must receive reparation.

What the TRC process has very forcefully demonstrated is  that  the  history
of momentous events extend beyond the names of famous  and  notorious  role-
players. Indeed, the TRC has taught us and the world that it is  always  the
ordinary man, woman or child who suffers the most, fights  the  hardest  and
eventually makes the defining difference that changes  the  landscape  of  a
country for ever. We must salute these people and remember them with  equal,
if not more, passion than that which we  bestow  upon  the  great  names  of
heroes and villains.

These ordinary yet great people have also  demonstrated  to  the  world  the
meaning of ubuntu and the true heart of all  South  Africans,  because  they
have forgiven even when they cannot forget.

The victims of apartheid have a legitimate expectation  that  their  quality
of life would be improved, either through the  payment  of  reparations,  or
the creation of job opportunities by the companies  that  were  barred  from
doing business in South Africa because of sanctions that  could  now  return
and invest in the country, and that economically they would be emancipated.

However, the victims of apartheid are disappointed that some  South  African
firms have moved billions of rands abroad since  1994  under  the  guise  of
foreign expunction. In some cases this appears to reflect a  lack  of  faith
in the new democratic dispensation.  Indeed,  the  would-be  investors  from
abroad have questioned the rationale  of  this  sudden  exodus  of  capital,
causing reluctance on their part to invest in our country.

In hindsignt, the terms of reference  of  the  TRC  should  have  been  more
specific with regard to the role of business in the  apartheid  years.  That
is why I said earlier that the last word has not been spoken with regard  to
this final report. As a result  some  South  Africans  are  now  taking  the
matter of South African and foreign business who continued to  operate  here
in spite of sanctions to court. Already the media  reports  in  this  regard
have damaged the shares  of  South  African  companies  and  threatened  the
overall  strength  of  the  JSE.  Therefore,  Government   should   consider
intervening between the affected parties in this latest salvo  with  a  view
to finding an  amicable  solution  that  will  avoid  further  harm  to  the
economy.

I would advise  the  Government  to  meet  around  a  table  with  business,
victims' representatives and the  lawyers  that  are  fighting  lawsuits  in
order to find a solution to the claims of the victims of apartheid.  Already
we hear that an emergency summit may  be  called  between  all  stakeholders
from 28 to 30 April  this  year.  It  would  be  in  the  Government's  best
interest if it became involved at an early stage  to  allay  fears  that  it
does not care about the victims of apartheid, while also providing  it  with
an opportunity to seek a mutually acceptable settlement.

The TRC was also not the first word on the subject  of  reconciliation.  One
thing that we should be proud of is that we are a forgiving nation.  By  the
time the TRC process was launched, the vast majority of South  Africans  had
already embraced each other. The goodwill between President Mandela  and  De
Klerk ensured that the country did  not  stray  and  fall  into  the  abyss.
Similarly, it was the forgiving spirit of South Africans  that  prevented  a
large-scale massacre in the days following that fateful event 10  years  ago
when Chris Hani was assassinated. It  is  for  the  same  reason  that  many
people who testified before the TRC could easily forgive  people  identified
during the whole process as perpetrators of gross human rights violations.

Despite all the positive gestures by the former NP leadership, it is  a  sad
fact that they largely avoided the TRC process, while their juniors went  to
testify - the people who took orders, who went to face  their  victims.  But
those who issued the orders ran away. We owe the TRC  a  debt  of  gratitude
for  exposing  the  former  NP  government's   hypocrisy,   which   unbanned
organisations,  but  months  later  were  still  planning  military  actions
against these organisations and their sympathisers. The TRC  has  vindicated
the suspicion held  by  some  of  us  that  depsite  the  unbanning  of  the
liberation  movements  in  February  1990,  military  operations  that  were
effectively anti-ANC were being planned as late as June 1991.

One hopes that the victims identified, who are to receive reparations,  will
include the families of those  people  who  were  massacred  in  trains  and
hostels during the early nineties.

When  the  NP  government,  as  early  as  1988,  identified  the   Transkei
government as being sympathetic to the liberation movement,  they  began  to
destabilise  the  region  through  financial  sanctions  and  five  separate
assassination plots or attempts against me. Of course, the Big Brother  back
then denied these actions. [Interjections.] But,  thanks  to  the  TRC,  the
truth was exposed by the former soldiers of  the  SADF  and  the  SA  Police
officers  who  applied  for  amnesty  for  their  role  in  these   actions.
Personally, I bear no  grudge  against  them.  Thank  you.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF LIMPOPO: Chairperson, Your Excellency the  President,  Deputy
President,  fellow  members,  we  debate  the   Truth   and   Reconciliation
Commission Report in the month of April, the month of the  assassination  of
Chris Hani, which in my view, precipitated the demise of the late  president
of the African National Congress, Oliver Tambo. This is also  the  month  in
which Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu was hanged  some  years  ago.  We  take  this
moment to salute the  memory  of  these  great  martyrs,  and  through  them
countless others who laid down their lives so that  we  could  be  free.  We
salute those who carry physical scars visited upon them by  the  monstrosity
known as apartheid. We salute  those  who  bear  psychological  scars,  like
Solomon Mahlangu's comrade, Comrade Motloung. I don't know how many  of  you
still remember him. We embrace the apartheid orphans, widows and widowers.

 The release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report  adds  a  new
chapter on our long and protracted road to freedom. The hour  has  come  for
us  to  collectively  look  back  and  with  the  advantage   of   hindsight
acknowledge the horrors visited upon an entire  people.  The  dehumanisation
was carried out by a regime who could best be described as heartless.

We call upon those who claim not to have known to acquaint  themselves  with
the contents of the report. They must do  so  in  order  to  understand  the
crimes that were committed in their name. They must also do so in  order  to
come to terms with the brutalities of that  regime.  Only  then  would  they
find it possible to embrace their fellow compatriots as equal  humans.  Only
then would they not flock to the vanquished  white  laager  which  has  been
already  thrown  into  the  dustbins  of  history.  Only  then  would   they
understand that no one would  be  right  to  fight  back  the  frontiers  of
freedom and liberation of their fellow  compatriots.  They  would  then  not
believe the prophets of doom who  blame  our  Government  for  the  sins  of
apartheid.

Some are urging us to in fact forget the past. We are  told  to  forget  the
past and indulge in collective amnesia. We are condemned for not  plastering
over our scars. They believe that reconciliation is possible only  when  the
victim apologises to the perpetrator.

We are of the view that this report is  a  mirror  which  must  continue  to
remind all of us as to where we came from. It is also a road sign that  must
guide us away from an abyss where we could lose our humanity by denying  the
humanity of our fellow human beings. We are ready and  willing  as  well  as
able to forgive, but forget, never. We shall follow the new  road  signs  as
we push back the frontiers of poverty, as we  restore  the  dignity  of  our
people and also the dignity of the oppressor and as we fight  for  a  better
life for all.

If the truth were to be told, the  biggest  achievement  of  the  past  nine
years was in the restoration of dignity to our people. It cannot be  reduced
to mortar and brick. It is about us being new human beings, having  a  place
under the sun in the land of our ancestors. Of course, the past  nine  years
have seen us make strides that were thought impossible  in  our  pursuit  to
ensure that we deliver a better life for all. We had to create  institutions
that did not exist because this change that has  happened  in  this  country
was no less than a revolution.

As we maintained, under the conditions of  apartheid  we  would  always  say
apartheid cannot be  reformed  but  it  must  be  destroyed.  And  when  you
destroy, as we did, the institutions of  apartheid  it  means  creating  new
institutions which were fragile. But even with those  fragile  institutions,
we were able to perform the miracles that we have performed.

It cannot be business as usual after this TRC report has  been  released.  I
think  we  have  to  shift  our  mindsets  as  South  Africans.  We  need  a
revolutionary paradigm  shift  so  that  the  divisions  that  have  existed
between town and countryside begin to be addressed in a  very  vigorous  and
consistent way. We have to  begin.  Even  those  of  us  who  are  in  rural
provinces tend to concentrate our  energies  on  the  towns  and  leave  the
countryside to itself. So, we need to begin to have that paradigm  shift  as
a tribute to the martyrs who have died for the liberation and also  as  part
and parcel of our collective effort at reconciliation and reparation.

We also need to begin to deal with the divisions between the  rich  and  the
poor parts of  the  country.  In  other  words,  you  would  find  that  the
companies that operate at a primary level in very poor parts of the  country
go and beneficiate at other parts of the country. So, we need to then  begin
to say as part of reparations, what is it that can be done so that if  there
are new institutions which are being built they should  be  built  in  those
primary areas. I think that requires a lot of debate and  engagement on  our
part because if that doesn't happen, what then happens is  that  the  people
leave the rural areas and come and squat in towns and it becomes  impossible
for us to provide them with shelter and all other things that must go  along
with that. So, stabilising communities  in  their  own  environment  becomes
part of reparation. [Applause.] But it also allows us to use  the  resources
in a way that would not be under undue pressure.

I want to take this opportunity to thank Archbishop Tutu and his  colleagues
for an excellent piece of work. I think they have given us reason  to  hope;
they have given us a foundation to begin on. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, Mr President, it was a  Sunday  afternoon,  15
December 1985, the  Van  Eck  and  De  Nysschen  families  of  Messina  were
enjoying the summer afternoon together.  They decided  to  go  for  a  short
drive on their game farm. The two men sat in the front seats and  the  wives
and children were on the back of the bakkie. The next moment they  detonated
a landmine. The two women and the four children in  the  back  were  killed.
The husbands later testified how they picked up  body  parts  in  the  trees
after that explosion. I saw the pictures of little Kobus,  three  years  old
and Ignatius, two years old. It was enough to motivate me to fight  the  ANC
until the bitter end - whatever that may  require.  That  is  where  we  are
from. Remember that.
According to the TRC report on page 870, this was part of  an  ANC  landmine
campaign aimed at military patrols in the border regions. Sir, that  is  not
true. It was miles from the border. It was a private  road,  never  used  by
military patrols. The  Van  Eck  and  De  Nysschen  families  were  ordinary
civilians with  no  military  connections.  The  three  MK  operatives  were
granted amnesty. They received amnesty long before the TRC was  established.
They received amnesty as part of the record of  understanding  before  1994.
If you take the Indemnity Act  of  1990,  the  Pretoria  Agreement  and  the
Record of Understanding between the ANC and the NP government, more than  20
000 ANC supporters and  members  received  indemnity  before  the  TRC  even
started; indemnity because their motives were political.

Why is it important, Sir? Because it explains why so few ANC operatives  and
so many of the security forces from  the  previous  government  applied  for
amnesty before the TRC. Of the  7  000  that  applied,  6  000  were  denied
amnesty. Seventy per cent of these are from the  previous  government.  Many
of them are today still in jail. Their  motives  were  political  and  their
offences not different from the 20  000  ANC  supporters  that  walked  free
without a TRC Norgard  test.  Can  someone  come  and  explain  this  at  my
meetings during question time, after I  was  brave  enough  to  speak  about
reconciliation, and I do that every night and you can come and listen.

I was a member of our delegation at Kempton Park in  1993  negotiating  with
the ANC. I believe that that was important then. For this I was  kicked  out
of my previous political party. Mr Fanie van der Merwe and Mr  Mac  Maharaj,
with the help of Gen Johan van der Merwe  drafted  the  post  amble  of  the
Interim Constitution. It read:


  There is a need for understanding but  not  for  vengeance,  a  need  for
  reparation but not for  retaliation,  a  need  for  ubuntu  but  not  for
  victimisation.

I  ask,  Sir:  What  is  the  alternative?  That  there  is  no   need   for
understanding, but for vengeance? It cannot be. No need for  reparation  but
retaliation? No need for ubuntu but for victimisation? That  cannot  be  the
answer. This is how many Afrikaners felt after the Amanzimtoti ANC  bomb  in
1985; or after the limpet mine in the Benoni Wimpy  on  30  July  1988  that
killed innocent civilians. Of course, that is also how the  ANC  felt  after
the incident mentioned in the report. That is why we are talking and  trying
to get somewhere.

Die vraag is: Hoe sluit ons hierdie hoofstuk in  ons  geskiedenis  af?  Deur
``Kill the Boer'' of ``Kill the Blacks'' te skreeu? Dit gaan  ons  nie  help
nie. As Afrikaner is ek bereid om hier te staan, om deurlopend met my  mense
te praat oor versoening en samewerking, en verwag  ek  dieselfde  van  ander
leiers.

Die slagoffers van die stryd, aan albei kante, moet vergoeding  kry  so  gou
as moontlik soos  aangekondig,  en  ons  verwelkom  dit.  Ons  moet  kyk  na
kollektiewe amnestie om die uitstaande gevalle af te handel. Daar is nie  'n
ander manier nie. Hoe verkondig die VF versoening vir die volgende 10  jaar,
terwyl selektiewe hofsake net van die een kant af deurlopend  plaasvind?  Ek
aanvaar die ANC-leiers wat nie amnestie gekry het  nie,  sal  natuurlik  nie
vervolg word nie. Siviele eise teen hulle is wel  moontlik.  Sluit  dit  ook
amnestie in vir Suid-Afrikaners wat in Zimbabwiese tronke sit?  Dit  is  die
klein mannetjies wat net die bevele gehoorsaam het. Die groot manne  is  weg
en hulle betaal die prys.  Daarom  is  die  VF  teleurgesteld  dat  ons  die
geleentheid mis om oor algemene amnestie of spesifieke  amnestie  te  praat.
Die probleem gaan nie op hierdie manier weggaan  nie.  As  leiers  moet  ons
saam hierdie boodskap na  buite  stuur  aan  ons  mense  om  polarisasie  te
voorkom.  Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The question is: How do  we  conclude  this  chapter  of  our  history?  By
shouting ``Kill the Boer'' or ``Kill the Blacks''?  That  is  not  going  to
help us. As an Afrikaner I am prepared to stand here  and  continually  talk
to my people about reconciliation and co-operation, and I  expect  the  same
from other leaders.

The victims of the struggle, from both sides,  should  receive  compensation
as announced as quickly as possible, and we welcome this. We should look  at
collective amnesty to deal with the outstanding cases.  There  is  no  other
way. How does the FF advocate reconciliation for the  next  10  years  while
selective court cases are taking place  continually  on  one  side  only?  I
accept that the ANC leaders who did not receive amnesty  will  probably  not
be prosecuted. However, civil cases against them  are  possible.  Does  this
also include amnesty for  South  Africans  who  are  sitting  in  Zimbabwean
prisons? These are the small guys who merely  obeyed  the  orders.  The  big
guys have gone and now they are paying the price.

For this reason the FF is disappointed that we are missing  the  opportunity
to talk about general amnesty or specific amnesty. The problem is not  going
to go away in this manner. As  leaders  we  should  collectively  send  this
message out there to our people to prevent polarisation. I thank you.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, we in  the  UCDP  welcome  the
final TRC report as an authentic document of  record.  The  authenticity  of
the report cannot be rebutted.

We thank the commission members for a job well done. They sat hours  on  end
at various venues,  sometimes  in  inclement  weather  listening  to  people
relating their sad stories, some fabricated and others  factual.  We  prayed
much for their strength.

Contrary to what was said in the media by some people, the TRC has not  made
any findings of gross violations of  human  rights  as  perpetrated  by  the
leader of my party, Kgosi L  M  Mangope,  or  the  security  forces  of  his
government. This truth leaves egg  on  the  faces  of  those  self-appointed
political upstarts who have been going around  saying  that  his  government
was guilty of misdeeds.

May we repeat that the truth in the report has vindicated the leaders of  my
party. They have clean hands. In fact, the amnesty  committee  ordered  some
people, among them the former ANC  North  West  MEC,  Malebana  Metsing,  to
apologise to Kgosi Mangope and others. That is the truth.

We have always said  that  the  truth  shall  prevail.  The  commission  has
established that most parties from the ANC, PAC, Azapo, IFP and  the  former
South African government  have  accounts  to  make  with  respect  to  their
misdeeds. However, the truth is that some people have up till now  not  been
accounted for; let alone those who died at the hands of  their  comrades  in
exile and the SA  Security  Forces,  as  a  result  of  the  instant  jungle
justice. [Interjections.]

The reparation fund to be established is most welcome,  and  we  have  noted
the commitment of Government to start contributing to the  fund.  The  UCDP,
however, feels that people and business are being overtaxed already  and  we
are not in favour of a so-called wealth tax.

By way of ongoing attempts to make South Africans accept  one  another,  the
programme of action  towards  a  society  free  of  racism,  xenophobia  and
related intolerance has to be mounted as recommended  and  this  has  to  be
done sooner rather than later.

We maintain that up till now access to centres of higher learning  was  open
to all in this country. There is no need for any  special  arrangements  for
entry into tertiary institutions in respect of  those  whose  secondary  and
tertiary education was interrupted by the struggle.

It is unfortunate that some of our compatriots have gone unsaid, unsung  and
unwept. We strongly support the putting up of  a  task  team  to  deal  with
disappearances and exhumations. We note what  the  President  said  in  this
regard insofar as  the  National  Directorate  of  Prosecutions  has  to  be
contacted.

Affected movements of the day should show appreciation of this  gesture  and
reciprocate by declaring the whereabouts of  the  other  people.  We  should
continue to cleanse our hearts in order to be reconciled as a nation.

 We support the view  that  the  President  may  exercise  his  presidential
discretion in the process of  pardoning  perpetrators,  but  plead  that  he
should be circumspect so as not to hurt the  rights  of  victims  by  making
blanket amnesties.

Finally, Madam Chair, we believe that a leader who ascends to  office  takes
the office with assets and  liabilities.  A  leader,  like  a  father,  will
remain a father for better or worse. It is for this reason that  we  support
the view that the President of the Republic of South  Africa  apologises  to
all victims on behalf of those members of the security forces of the  former
state and those forces of  the  liberation  movements  who  committed  gross
violations of human rights. [Interjections.]

The word of the head of state will surely strengthen  national  unity  which
aims  at  reconciliation,  in  spite  of   transgressions   in   the   past.
[Interjections.] The interim Constitution of 1993 summed it  up  well,  when
it read, Premier Shilowa:


  There is a need for understanding, not vengeance; a need  for  reparation
  but  not  retaliation.  There  is  a  need  for  ubuntu   but   not   for
  victimisation.

We have to live  in  love,  respect,  trust,  hope  and  tolerance  for  one
another. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Chair, Mr President, my time is limited. The  TRC  has
done some good things. It has discovered hidden things such  as  who  killed
Griffith Mxenge and his wife, Victoria;  Dr  Fabian  Ribeiro  and  his  wife
Florence; Steve Biko  and  others.  It  also  discovered  secret  graves  of
massacred victims of apartheid.

But as warned by the PAC, this commission has achieved  nothing  fundamental
for the victims and survivors of apartheid colonialism. From the  beginning,
the TRC was a  gigantic  exercise  to  appease  the  forces  of  oppression,
national dispossession and injustice. Through the  International  Convention
on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid the UN  declared
apartheid a crime against humanity. This convention was  as  the  result  of
resolution 3068 adopted by  91  members  of  the  UN  and  opposed  by  only
Britain, America, Portugal and South Africa. That was the old South Africa.

As a crime against humanity apartheid  is  on  par  with  genocide  and  war
crimes. Perpetrators of crimes against humanity cannot even  plead  superior
orders. They did know  at  the  Nuremberg  International  Tribunal.  Indeed,
Hitler's successor, Donitz,  could  not  escape  responsibility  for  crimes
against humanity on the plea of being obedient to superior  orders.  He  was
imprisoned.

In South Africa the authors of the TRC report, by their actions, have  shown
that to them a crime against humanity does not apply to  Africans.  That  is
why the TRC paraded before itself members of the  liberation  movement  such
as the PAC and its military wing Apla, as well as those of the ANC  and  MK.
That the PAC, ANC and others took up  arms  to  defend  the  African  people
against genocide and the crime of apartheid was ignored even  by  those  who
once called apartheid a theological heresy. Apartheid  was  practised  right
at the so-called TRC. For example, Magnus Malan was granted bail  of  R10000
while PAC Lethlapa Mphahlele was granted R35 000 bail.  The  court  expenses
of apartheid perpetrators were paid by the  state,  while  freedom  fighters
from especially the PAC had to pay their own cost. Over R5 million was  paid
for Eugene de Kock alone. The TRC never queried this.

Many members of Apla were refused amnesty and  subjected  to  brutally  long
prison sentences. Thapelo Maseko for 55 years, Bhani Mangaliseki  58  years,
Shakespeare Buthelezi 64 years; Simelele Ngesi 16  years;  Mdudeki  Ntantiso
74 years and six months; Phila Dolo a life prison sentence  plus  54  years;
Kenny Motsomai two life prison sentences plus  19  years;  Sipho  Mbeki  two
life sentences plus 20 years; Phakamile Cishe three death sentences plus  21
years; Kwanele Msize three death sentences plus 24 years.

The TRC has been neither a truth nor a reconciliation commission. There  can
be no truth and reconciliation without justice.  There  should  indeed  have
been a reparations commission for the victims of crimes against humanity  in
South Africa, just as there was in  the  case  of  the  Jews,  Japanese  and
Koreans after the Second World War. I thank you. [Time expired.]

Ms M P THEMBA: The President of the Republic of  South  Africa,  the  Deputy
President, hon Ministers, hon members, ladies and gentlemen.

[Madam Chairperson, I would be making a mistake  if  I  did  not  make  some
remarks on the painful and wound-pricking speech that has been made  by  hon
Mncwango, who pretended to be pure and clean. He behaved like a small  child
who was found with sugar on his cheek. When he was asked  what  was  on  his
cheek, he said, I have done  nothing.  I  did  not  eat  sugar.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

The truth is that the nation admits that it did make some mistakes, and  now
it's time for reconciliation. If we keep on deceiving one  another,  we  are
not going to achieve our goal of forgiveness because it would be clear  that
we are still hiding some things.]

The international community has been highly impressed by the  TRC,  and  its
example  has  been  followed,  with  local  variations,   in   post-struggle
situations  in  several  countries,  for  example,  East   Timor.   It   has
effectively  become  a  model  which  can  be  adapted   for   purposes   of
reconciliation and reconstruction in other countries.

It is important to highlight the transparency of  the  TRC  procedures,  its
public nature and the media coverage through which it has reached all  South
Africans. It  must  also  be  commended  for  the  open  invitation  to  all
survivors to submit statements.

This stands in contrast with, for example, the truth commission in Chile  in
the early 1990s, which was conducted behind closed doors and from the  start
it was restricted to only certain cases of gross  human  rights  violations,
like  disappearances  and  the  tracing  of  missing  persons.   The   truth
commission in Chile did not investigate  detentions  or  torture  and  as  a
consequence still suffer a  lack  of  credibility,  resulting  in  continued
denial of the truth on one side, and ongoing  demands  for  justice  on  the
other, thus, prolonging the polarisation of society.

In recent TRCs in other countries this transparency has not  always  been  a
feature, which may  cast  doubts  on  their  potential  for  reconciliation.
Moreover, the maturity and  moral  strength  of  the  disenfranchised  South
Africans should be underlined. For it is these qualities that made  the  TRC
possible and successful. While the primary source of this maturity can  very
legitimately  be  traced  to  African  culture  and  values,  the  political
analysis, particularly, the explicit  definition  of  the  enemy  being  the
system and not the whites, has been of  crucial  importance  in  entrenching
those values over the years and preparing the  disenfranchised  for  turning
its  back  on  revenge  and  hatred  in   favour   of   reconciliation   and
nonracialism. This, together with the transparency,  is  a  shining  example
for the whole world. Today, it  stands  in  very  stark  contrast  with  the
current discourse of Bush and partners.

The TRC has eloquently demonstrated Africa's exceptional capacity for  moral
strength, tolerance, reconciliation and peace. The TRC has also set a  model
for nonracialism at home and in the world.

While it may not be possible to compensate each  victim  of  apartheid,  the
new  Government  has  spearheaded   the   reconstruction   and   development
programmes. These are aimed at restoring the dignity of our people who  were
oppressed.

Reconciliation cannot take place in a vacuum. It  has  to  occur  in  tandem
with qualitative changes in the lives  of  our  people.  This  implies  that
positive steps have to be taken to push back the frontiers  of  poverty  and
improve the living conditions of the poor people.

In this light, the new Government has instituted the capital  gains  tax  in
order that all sources of income are taxed. It increased direct  support  to
poor households, especially to children. By  2006,  more  than  6,5  million
children will be beneficiaries of this grant. The extension  of  the  social
security net is one of the post-apartheid government's  greatest  successes.
Social security reached 2,5 million people in April 1997. As at March  2003,
there are 5,6 million people who benefit  from the  social  security  grant.
It increased its spending on health to ensure  that  hospitals  and  clinics
have sufficient medicines and drugs. In addition, two large  hospitals  have
been built, namely the Nkosi Albert Luthuli hospital  near  Durban  and  the
Nelson Mandela Hospital in Umtata. More people receive primary  health  care
than before.

 More children has received basic education  during  the  term  of  the  ANC
Government. A total of 1,5 million hectares of land has  been  redistributed
to its original owners; the list goes on. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, would you please allow  the
member to be heard.

Ms  M  P  THEMBA:  Madam  Chairperson,  it  must  be  borne  in  mind   that
reconciliation is not a one-time gesture but a process,  made  possible  and
initiated by the TRC, which might be reversed if it is not  followed  by  an
ongoing willingness for moral and material reparations by  the  perpetrators
and all beneficiaries of apartheid in South Africa.

In other words, by means of the TRC, the South African disenfranchised  have
set a model by taking the first steps towards reconciliation but as yet  not
the whole nation. All citizens who have  benefited  from  apartheid  have  a
special responsibility in ensuring that they make some contribution  towards
reconciliation and reparations. This can occur in  a  myriad  of  ways,  for
example, by assisting the dispossessed through  empowerment  initiatives  or
by contributing financially through  the  promotion  of  equity  and  skills
development initiatives.

Many people, especially those  who  have  not  experienced  the  horrors  of
apartheid repression, have argued that we must draw a veil over the  horrors
of the past. Those who argue that we must forget the past do so  because  of
cowardice and a refusal  to  accept  responsibility.  As  the  ANC  we  have
consistently rejected these attempts to downplay the  horrendous  injustices
suffered by our people. Our rejection of these arguments  is  based  on  the
understanding that real reconciliation involves our  capacity  to  face  the
past and accept its reality because our past is painful.

We cannot speak of reconciliation  without  remembering  historical  wrongs.
Preparedness to confront and redress the mistakes of the  past  involves  an
acknowledgement that gross human rights violations did take place.  Although
we might be  tempted  to  forget  painful  memories  and  act  as  if  these
traumatic events never happened,  it  is  dangerous  to  try  and  blot  out
painful and humiliating memories. Repressed memories remain  alive  and  can
give rise to severe neurosis. It is better to accept a painful past than  to
deny or repress it.

Nor can we speak of real reconciliation without an  acceptance  that  people
need to be compensated for the violations of their human rights.  Reparation
is an internationally accepted principle that  provides  for  people  to  be
compensated for human rights violations.

How can some people argue that these policies  that  we  put  in  place  are
adequate compensation when they keep quiet when  the  previously  advantaged
owners refuse to make land available  for  redistribution;  when  previously
advantaged white schools refuse to accept black pupils; and when  previously
advantaged people use the courts to  fight  affirmative  actions,  like  the
Telkom share-offer to previously disadvantaged individuals? Why do  we  need
to remember the past?

History is not the residue of life but the framework for  our  own  identity
as a nation. Remembering the past helps to sustain us by giving  meaning  to
our existence as a nation. We  should,  therefore,  nurture  our  children's
appetite to learn what happened in our past, what history has  to  teach,  a
recovery of that which should not be forgotten.

If we do not do this we face the danger that oppression and  brutality  will
be forgotten, that the injustices committed in the name of race  might  slip
away from human consciousness. There is an old saying  to  the  effect  that
those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. We need to  remember  the
past not to relive it, but to make sure it does not repeat  itself.  Failure
to keep the past alive is the enemy of  reconciliation  because  it  refuses
survivors the public acknowledgement of their pain. It invites offenders  to
take the path of denial. It deprives future generations of  the  opportunity
to understand and learn from the past and to participate in the building  of
a lasting reconciliation.

A lack of commitment could lead to a reassessment of the TRC in  a  negative
sense, to a hardening of attitudes and, ultimately to the  reversal  of  the
process of reconciliation.

 From the above remarks, it will be clear that a  successful  reconciliation
process is a condition for successful  nation-building  in  as  far  as  the
division between beneficiaries and  survivors  of  apartheid  goes.  Nation-
building covers, of course, many  more  areas  of  diversity  and  division.
[Time expired.]

Ms C-S BOTHA: Thank you, hon Chair. During the time of the TRC hearings,  my
son wrote the following words:
  Fear not death nor suffering, nor evil, but  guard  at  the  door.  Guard
  against indifference.

I believe that he was right. This debate today already bears testimony to  a
fundamental shift beyond indifference. In the 1999 TRC debate,  then  Deputy
President Mbeki, set the defining parameters in our continuing struggle  for
national unity and reconciliation, as a question  of  race.  Today  we  have
moved on and we have identified reparations as a  crucial  element  of  this
process on the way to closure.  We  are  grateful  that  the  President  has
committed the Government here to monetary payment of reparation, as the  TRC
created a legitimate  expectation  of  legally  enforceable  rights  to  the
specific victims of gross human rights abuses.

Judge Didcott held that the state is fully responsible for  reparations,  as
it was responsible for amnesty. Similar  sentiments  are  expressed  by  the
protocol of the African Court on Human Rights and the Matsoenyane report.

So, while we are thankful for the R30 000, Mr President, we believe that  it
should have been more. What is equally important, shall I quantify what  was
suggested in the TRC report? What is  equally  important  is  that  the  new
undertakings do not befall  the  fate  of  previous  arrangements.  Ask  the
Khulumane Victim Support Group, Madam  Premier  of  the  Free  State,  about
nonfulfilment of raised expectations.

Then I must also say that I find it  callous  to  dismiss  genuine  need  by
saying that you cannot attach monetary  value  to  suffering.  There  is  no
member of this House who lives off cold charity. Indeed, we  believe  it  is
incumbent on the Government to match reparations to real  needs.  Precedents
for  individual  monetary  compensation  amply  exist  in  comparative   and
customary law on reparation. This was also  de  facto  attested  to  by  the
South African  Government  when  it  paid  pensions  to  former  members  of
resistance organisations. Nor do I think that the  merits  of  the  symbolic
gesture, whatever it may be, with its  shift  from  the  individual  to  the
societal - a sculptured stone for Bobby Yahr or a statue at Freedom  Park  -
can make up for the painful gaps that this offer  leaves,  but  the  caravan
moves on.

The biggest challenge now is to ensure implementation, which rests with  the
President's Fund. It is untenable that victims could have returned from  the
President's Fund empty-handed, as the report states. It is  unbearable  that
this can happen while many perpetrators have prospered. The old refrain  ``I
do not know what really happened'', could easily  become  ``I  do  not  care
what really happened''.

We urge the President to place the implementation structures under  vigorous
scrutiny so that the R30 000 once-off  payment  he  has  promised  does  not
render victims humiliated as they legitimately try to access it. I take  the
liberty of suggesting that disbursements from the proposed  reparation  fund
be moved to  nongovernmental  agencies  so  that  it  does  not  follow  the
ignominious example of undisbursed funds in  the  Umsobomvo  and  the  Lotto
Funds. [Interjections.]
In his foreword ... [Interjections.] The DA will take charge of it for  you.
In his foreword to these last reports, Archbishop Desmond Tutu portrays  our
TRC as a  kind  of  benchmark  against  which  the  rest  are  measured.  By
implication, the decisions  taken  here  will  reverberate  in  far  foreign
corners. They will certainly impact on economic  growth,  our  domestic  and
foreign fixed investment. Those are the most  effective  tools  we  have  to
count the inequalities apart. And I am indeed very glad of the  wisdom  that
did not place these at risk here. If I  interpret  your  earlier  statements
correctly, Mr President, this ghost can now be laid to rest.

Then, finally, Madam Speaker, Mr President, it would be wrong to imply  that
ordinary South Africans are indifferent to the plight of  their  neighbours.
Many are contributing in numerous and substantial ways  to  the  process  of
redressing inequality. And, as their sense of legitimately  belonging  to  a
new  South  Africa  grows,  so  too  will  their  acceptance  of  individual
responsibility with regard to the reconciliation  process.  I  am  confident
this is true of all DA members. I certainly wish to be counted  among  those
who take up this challenge. Thank you.

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, I want to begin  my  contribution  to  the
debate by paying tribute to the liberation movements, the  gallant  fighters
who belonged to the armed formations of the liberation  movements,  and  all
the men and women  who  were  not  members  of  these  formations,  but  who
nevertheless gave up their lives to free  black  people  from  the  yoke  of
oppression and dehumanisation.

The TRC has now concluded its task, a task borne out of compromises  at  the
negotiation table. The Promotion of National Unity and  Reconciliation  Act,
which gave rise to the existence of the  commission,  became  a  subject  of
debate within various sectors of our society, Azapo included.

It  is  now  common  knowledge  that  the  Azanian  Peoples'   Organisation,
Nontsikelelo Biko, Churchill Mxenge and Chris Rebeiro  took  the  matter  to
the Constitutional Court. At the Constitutional  Court  the  parties  placed
the following before  the  judges:  that  apartheid  was  declared  a  crime
against humanity and  as  a  consequence  all  criminal  acts  committed  in
pursuit of the apartheid system should be punishable by  law;  that  victims
of  gross  human  rights  violations  should  not  be  deprived   of   their
constitutional right to settle disputes through  the  courts;  that  freedom
fighters  in  particular  and  persons  who  fought  against  an  evil   and
oppressive system of  apartheid  cannot  be  treated  in  the  same  way  as
defenders of the evil system; that it is unfair to victims to grant  amnesty
to  perpetrators  of  gross  human  rights  violations  and  say  that  such
offenders should not be held civilly liable  for  damage  sustained  by  the
victims.

Chairperson, it is now history that Judge Mahomed, DP, only dealt  with  the
constitutionality  of  this  matter  and  today  we  are  dealing  with  the
political and other related matters of  reconciliation.  Interestingly,  the
judge, that is Judge Mahomed, had this to say about the Azapo  concern,  and
I quote:


  I understand perfectly why the  applicants  want  to  insist  that  those
  wrongdoers who abused their authority and wrongfully murdered, maimed  or
  tortured members of their families who had, in their view,  been  engaged
  in a noble struggle to confront the inhumanity of the  apartheid  regime,
  should be  vigorously  prosecuted  and  effectively  punished  for  their
  callous and inhumane conduct in violation of criminal law.

The judge goes on to state that:


  Every decent human being must feel grave  discomfort  in  living  with  a
  consequence which might allow perpetrators  of  evil  acts  to  walk  the
  streets of this land with impunity.

The announcement made by the President concerning prosecution for those  who
did not appear  before  the  Truth  Commission  to  divulge  their  acts  of
inhumanities, is very  satisfying  indeed  for  Azapo,  possibly  for  Judge
Mahomed as well.

Chairperson, perpetrators have been granted amnesty. What we  must  now  ask
is: What about the victims? This is the question that confronts us  in  this
House. This is the time when questions of justice through reparation  should
come into being. Judge Didcott, in his minority report,  had  this  to  say,
and I quote:


  Reparations are usually payable by states, and  there  is  no  reason  to
  doubt that the postscript envisages our state to  shoulder  the  national
  responsibility for those.

This view coincides with the majority view of  the  judges  that  held  that
Parliament was entitled to adopt a wide concept of reparation.  It  is  this
part of the judgment that Azapo calls upon Parliament to adopt.

If Parliament agrees with Azapo, we see reparation as a  process  that  must
deal with all aspects of the oppressed life. In Azapo's terms, the  monetary
aspect of reparations should be seen as but a part of  an  overall  strategy
to restore human dignity and a decent life to all those who  suffered  under
apartheid.

Businesses that operated during apartheid and benefited  from  cheap  labour
must know that millions of workers, and not only South African workers,  but
including those from the neighbouring states, contributed billions of  rands
to their wealth in the form of what  is  referred  to  by  Azapo  as  unpaid
wages. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members
the following member that I am going to call  is  going  to  make  a  maiden
speech. [Applause.]

Ms M P MENTOR: Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP,  Comrade  President,  Comrade
Deputy President,  hon  Premiers,  hon  members,  distinguished  guests  and
comrades, I do not know what a maiden speech is, but I will ask at  the  end
of my debate. [Laughter.]

I will start from the beginning to salute the memory  of  the  late  Comrade
Patrick Moseli Mmoloa who was the last president of  the  ANC  Youth  League
before the ANC was banned. He died in combat in the Wankies Polilo  Campaign
in 1968, lest we forget.

I also wish to take this solemn moment  to  salute  the  memory  of  Comrade
Peter Mokaba. Those who were enemies of peace in the time  of  our  struggle
chose to make him not popular, but unpopular  with  the  slogan  ``kill  the
boer, kill the farmer''. Those of us who shared  the  battle  trenches  with
him know that he rallied  the  youth  of  this  country  around  the  slogan
``fight and produce land'' not ``kill the farmers,  kill  the  boers''.  Not
only that slogan: The one that he more often than not  rallied  them  around
was ``fight profusely''.

I also salute the memory of Comrade Parks Mankahlana. I  specially  remember
him for imbuing on the youth of our country the need to always  analyse  the
world around you, to deconstruct it and to reconstruct it  if  necessary.  I
should have paid tribute to Comrade Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu  before  I  did
so to Comrade Peter Mokaba and  Comrade  Parks  Mankahlana.  I  deliberately
paid respects and tribute to him and saluted his memory last because I  will
return to the topic pertaining to him later in my speech.

The TRC process as it was alluded to by speakers  before  me  was  just  one
process  amongst  many  that  was  intended  to   lay   a   foundation   for
reconciliation, peace and change for this country.  It  was  also  meant  to
enhance the process of restoring the dignity of our people, those that  were
oppressed and those that were not oppressed.

As South Africans we had hoped to extract out of the TRC process  reparation
which  entailed  what  became  known  as  the  Five  Rs,  namely,   redress,
restitution, rehabilitation, restoration  of  dignity,  and  reassurance  of
nonrecurrence. If  anyone  considers  the  extent  of  damage,  humiliation,
denigration and untold miseries that were unleashed upon millions  of  South
Africans by apartheid, the argument still stands that  no  amount  of  money
will be able to pay for that damage. There is no amount of  money  that  can
buy or pay for the human dignity lost.
I therefore submit before this  House  upfront  that  the  highest  possible
reparation price that we can pay to South Africans, those who  are  no  more
and those who are still alive, is a process of ensuring  that  South  Africa
becomes truly democratic,  nonracial,  nonsexist,  prosperous,  and  united.
[Applause.]

We owe it to ourselves as a form of  reparation  and  compensation  to  make
sure that we deliver good governance. That is the price we  must  pay.  That
should be our reparation and compensation.

The community of Galeshewe where I come from understands  and  accepts  this
argument. Hence they celebrate the fact that because of a Cabinet  decision,
Galeshewe  has  become  a  nodal  point   for   urban   reconstruction   and
development. [Applause.]

This is besides the fact that the SANDF once killed youths in  Thabane  High
School during school hours point blank because they wanted  to  change  that
school into a temporary military base during the state of emergency.  For  a
number of reasons they refused the community of Galeshewe for  a  number  of
days access to the corpses of their youth and children,  and  to  clean  the
brains and blood that was scattered all over  the  classrooms.  The  highest
price we received and are happy for is the RDP. [Applause.]

Ma de Bruin of Upington, who was the only woman  amongst  the  Upington  26,
was on death row because of a common purpose and was allegedly found  guilty
on the basis of a common purpose for killing a policeman  in  Upington.  She
went to testify before the TRC.

She is still waiting and standing in a queue like any  other  South  African
today for her RDP house. She says that it is not necessary  for  her  to  be
paid money. She argues that she is happy to see Pabalelo becoming  a  better
place to live in. The only thing she says is that she  has  struggled  since
receiving stay of execution to  educate  her  four  children  who  have  all
matriculated  and  are  still  waiting  for  the  opportunity   of   getting
employment. She is confident  that  eventually  they  will  get  employment.
[Applause.]

The Khoi and the San people in the Northern Cape who  live  in  Schmidsdrift
and in Platfontein just outside  Kimberly  understand  and  accept  that  no
amount of money will repay them for the dignity they were stripped of  as  a
community by  apartheid.  They  are  happy  to  be  resettled  to  become  a
community amongst South African communities. [Applause.]

With regard to the TRC and education, we have a very unfortunate  situation.
I suspect that there were no young members when  the  Act  that  constituted
the TRC was put in place or the brief for the TRC was put  there  because  I
do  not  understand  how  it  became  possible  that  education  was  not  a
particular reference point.

There were six main reference  points  given  to  the  TRC.  It  was  media,
business, the religious community, prisons, health  and  the  legal  system.
How we omitted education I do not know, but that is water under  the  bridge
because correctly so education became an arena of the  struggle  because  it
was a vehicle for sustaining that heinous crime against humanity.

Young people swopped classrooms and lecture halls for battle trenches.  They
even converted classrooms  and  lecture  halls  into  battle  trenches  that
extended to the streets and back into the classrooms and lecture halls.

All South Africans in  their  millions,  especially  black  South  Africans,
including white South Africans, were given gutter education whose  main  aim
was to  make  other  people  subservient,  therefore  servants,  and  others
masters and therefore superior. According to me there is no amount of  money
that will be able  to  correct  or  to  repair  for  the  damage  caused  by
apartheid education.

I want to make a passionate plea to this House.  Luckily  the  President  is
here as well as members of the Cabinet and the Premiers.  The  young  people
of this country who fought against gutter  education,  who  understood  that
education had to be a necessary part of the struggle, had harboured  a  wish
since the inception of Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College, Somafco, to see  it
come home. Some of them are no more.

It can come back as much as the argument holds that we must  go  and  exhume
the bones and the remains of our comrades all over the world.  I  think  the
argument can be sustained that we need to bring Somafco home. When we  bring
it home we must make it an  institute  of  national  excellence.  It  should
exist alongside an in coexistence with the  Freedom  Park  to  preserve  our
history. [Applause.]

I am sure that everybody saw in the media in the  past  few  days  what  the
Iraqis are doing to themselves. It is painful. We do  not  want  our  people
ever to do that to themselves, never mind what will happen to us.

Artifacts dating back 5 000 years or so were broken in anger. I still argue
that it is in anger against, not Saddam Hussein, but the invasion of the
Americansÿ ... [Interjections.] [Applause.] ... on Arab soil if you care to
say.

That institute must be a beacon of hope, when  we  bring  it  home  for  our
people, and a source of bread. It must have satellite  institutions  in  all
provinces.  It  must  be  a  centre   for   research,   reconstruction   and
development. It must assess on our behalf, independently so, whether we  are
delivering or not. It must make  recommendations  to  Government  at  local,
provincial and national levels.  It  should  be  a  centre  from  which  our
communities will derive  lessons  and  skills  of  conflict  prevention  and
conflict resolution. It will be a centre for peace and war studies  so  that
we must not forget and that we must not be complacent.

It will be a protector for our communities against  unscrupulous,  merciless
and unethical researchers who use our communities as guinea pigs,  never  to
return to them or to acknowledge them, not even  their  theses,  books,  and
whatever, and never paying any royalties to them. It will be a defender  for
our communities, indigenous knowledge and for intellectual  property  rights
for our communities. It will patent those rights where  a  need  arises  ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  Your  speaking
time has expired hon member. [Applause.]

Ms M P MENTOR: Deputy Chair, I was told that when you are  making  a  maiden
speech you can exceed by two minutes. [Laughter.] [Applause.] We will  learn
from that institute ... [Interjections.]

 The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Your
speaking time has expired hon  member.  [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  Order  hon
members. Order! Hon Millin, I have not called you yet,  you  can  take  your
seat. Hon Mentor can you take your seat please. You have taken a  very  good
chance. I have heard that and I did use my discretion. [Laughter.]

Just to answer your question. A maiden speech is normally  a  term  used  to
describe a member's first address to the  House.  I  say  this  because  you
wanted to know. It is normally parliamentary  procedure.  Members  who  make
their  first  speech  in  Parliament  do  not  raise   contentions   issues.
[Laughter.] [Applause.] However, they should be listened to  very  carefully
by the members without any interruption and I  am  happy  that  the  members
have done so. [Applause.]

I am also advised that the member at the podium is going to give her  maiden
speech. [Applause.]

Ms T E MILLIN: Deputy Chairperson and hon members, it is indeed a  privilege
to participate, albeit in a small way, in this landmark debate today. May  I
start by quoting a few words from Proverbs 7:20:


  There is not a righteous man or woman on earth who does what is right and
  never sins.

For this fundamental reason it is not unreasonable that there are those  who
have  serious  reservations  about  the  so-called  truth   commissions   or
omissions which inevitably  are  perceived  by  segments  of  society  as  a
distortion, even a manipulation, of history from the perspective of  one  or
other political viewpoint. It is for this reason and fact that I share  some
of the reservations of the IFP with regard to the process of the TRC.

We are all, each one of us, products of our respective  histories  and  tend

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members
can you  please  give  the  member  time  to  present  her  speech.  We  are
conversing rather too loud. Continue hon member.

Ms T E MILLIN: Thank you Chairperson. And much as society may feel the  need
to blame others for past wrongs it is imperative that  we  all  accept  that
not one of us in the history of humankind is without  sin,  for  all  of  us
have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, to quote Romans 3.
However, it is indeed nothing short of a miracle that nearly nine  years  on
since the new  political  dispensation,  and  given  the  diversity  of  our
backgrounds, culturally, traditionally and politically, that we have,  as  a
rainbow nation - and I use  that  term  intentionally  -  nevertheless  come
together as one in a general spirit of cooperative  governance.  I  want  to
echo the words of our hon President who stated here today that  never  again
should one group or community oppress another in our nation.

He added that no revenge or retribution as a result of our  collective  past
history has any place in  our  present  or  future.  These  are  commendable
sentiments which, together with the overall tone of the hon the  President's
speech before this Joint Sitting of  the  NA,  will  hopefully  promote  the
worthy cause of ongoing reconciliation of all  the  people  of  our  beloved
country.

Therefore, as  a  believing  Christian,  I  conclude  by  stating  that  the
Government under which Jesus lived was  corrupt  and  oppressive.  On  every
hand were crying abuses, extortion, intolerance and  grinding  cruelty.  Yet
Jesus attempted no  civil  reforms.  He  attacked  no  national  abuses  nor
condemn the national enemies. He did not interfere  with  the  authority  or
administration of those in power.

He who was our example kept aloof from earthly governments, not  because  he
was indifferent to the ways of human kind, but because the  remedy  did  not
lie in mere human or external measures.

To  be  efficient,  the  cure  must  reach  people  individually  and   must
regenerate  the  heart  not  by  the  decisions  of  courts   or   councils,
commissions or legislative assemblies, not by the patronage of  worldly  and
great men or women, but by the power of our Almighty Creator.

Here is the power that can bring about the upliftment  of  all  mankind  and
the human agency for the accomplishment of this work, namely the  nature  of
sin, repentance,  reconciliation  and  restoration  are  the  teachings  and
practising  of  the  Word  of  God.  I  thank  you.  [Interjections.]  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

 Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, like the hon Dr Pheko, the  final  report  reminds
us that it has  been  the  consistent  complaint  against  the  TRC  by  the
liberation movements that they were treated on a basis of  moral  and  legal
equivalence with the former  state.  But  the  law  which  created  the  TRC
required such equal treatment, as the TRC reminds  its  readers.  Of  course
this is because nobody won any war. Neither violent repression  nor  violent
revolt succeeded. The decision that there would be amnesty  was  part  of  a
constitutionalised negotiated settlement.  And  that  selfsame  Constitution
requires equality before the law.

Has the TRC in fact succeeded in being even-handed? The independent  Amnesty
Committee, the judges, scrupulously  observed  the  law,  and  therefore  no
question of fairness can legitimately arise. Their report is a  pleasure  to
read, and I think that we all owe our thanks to the judges and  to  Advocate
Martin Coetzee, who lately acted as  CEO.  But  Sir,  did  the  broader  TRC
investigate violations by all sides equally? In a  word,  their  words,  no.
Having  decided  that  the  state  and  IFP  undoubtedly  perpetrated   most
incidents, they set  about  devoting  ``most  resources''  to  investigating
those bodies.

Now the question of whether the commission in  fact  fulfilled  its  mandate
could have been left to the court of history and of public  opinion,  except
that it has got itself and South Africa into a mess  with  its  support  for
international reparations claims. The commission acknowledged early  in  its
life that the gross violations of human rights, as defined in the Act,  that
it was supposed to investigate are really the bodily  integrity  rights.  It
was supposed to enquire into killing, torture, abductions  and  severe  ill-
treatment.

However,  it  decided  that  it  would  make  a  distinction  between  those
defending apartheid and those fighting it, because  of  the   commissioners'
``deep awareness of systemic discrimination, which made  it  very  difficult
to  concentrate  only  on  killing,  torture,  and  so   forth''.   In   the
international  community,  apartheid,  as  a  form  of   systematic   racial
discrimination, constituted a crime against humanity. And so the  commission
made itself the last word  on  discrimination  and  all  of  apartheid  -  a
position  which  now  gives  its  outrageous   reparation   suit   proposals
international  credence,  and  threatens  our  economy  and  precisely   the
unemployed, previously discriminated against poor.

The commission is very fond of  telling  other  people,  even  the  hon  the
President, to apologise. I  would  suggest,  very  respectfully,  especially
those commissioners making careers  in  the  US  should  apologise  on  this
issue. Having signed up on  apartheid  as  a  crime  against  humanity,  the
commission endorsed the liberation movements' claim of a  just  war  without
further ado. However, the qualifications of  the  laws  of  war  fortunately
also applied. Just war does not legitimate unjust means like the killing  of
civilians.

The findings on the AWB and APLA are damning. The PAC  position,  Dr  Pheko,
that whites were beneficiaries of the system, therefore every  white  person
was part of the defence lines of apartheid and every white home a  garrison,
is found by the TRC to be absurd. The Amnesty Committee  documents  a  media
briefing by APLA commander Letlapa Mphahlele, to whom  hon  Pheko  referred,
on 28 October 1997 in Bloemfontein, in which he said, ``his proudest  moment
was seeing whites dying in the killing fields'',  and  accused  the  Amnesty
Committee of being a farce and a  sham  which  sought  to  perpetuate  white
supremacy.

I wish to place on record that Mr Mphahlele confirmed during a radio  debate
with me on Cape Talk, 19 November  2002,  that  he  ordered  the  Heidelberg
Tavern and St James Church massacres. Yes, I do so, because it  remains  our
view that Mr Mphahlele must be prosecuted. It remains the  position  of  the
TRC that prosecution should be considered  where  evidence  of  gross  human
rights violations exist. The spiritual leaders at  St  James  told  me  last
year that the forgiveness  they  could  express  as  Christians  toward  the
cadres who did receive amnesty, is something separate from the state.

People, in their view, received their opportunity for  grace,  and  if  they
turned it down, they must face the wrath of the law.  If  I  understand  the
President's proposal to be an invitation  to  people  with  locus  and  with
information to turn state witnesses - that is how I understand it -  then  I
will say that the normal course of the law seems to be followed. Apart  from
some risk  of  one-sidedness,  that  is  the  right  way.  The  proposal  is
suggesting that the law follows its normal course,  and  that  is  precisely
the position to which South Africa should return in  order  to  restore  the
rule of law. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  D  A  HANEKOM:  Chairperson,  President,  Deputy  President,   Premiers,
Ministers, hon members, it's difficult to talk so late in  the  debate  when
so much has been said and not to repeat a lot of what  has  been  said.  The
President has  left  the  House  I'm  afraid,  because  I  wanted  to  share
something with him. I have some of the passages in my speech which  he  used
in his speech. The problem is I wanted to say these  things  first,  but  he
got in before me. [Laughter.] Well, I'll live with that.

Chairperson, this debate on the final Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission
report clearly cannot confine itself only  to  the  recommendations  in  the
report, nor can it  limit  itself  to  the  report  itself.  It  is  another
important moment of memory and reflection; another  opportunity  for  us  to
move a few more steps forward towards reconciliation and nation-building  in
our country.

We are dealing with extremely delicate and emotional matters that  bring  to
the surface our collective sorrow and joy, our pride and our  shame  and  of
course, sometimes anger and resentment that has not yet been put behind us.

What happened in South Africa during the  ugly  period  of  apartheid  rule,
happened. There is no undoing it or wishing it away.  The  effects  of  that
reality present us with another reality: the painful legacy of  poverty  and
inequality. That we also cannot simply wish away. But both  these  realities
of what happened before and what is with us today  can  be  dealt  with  and
must be dealt with together as a single package.

The way we deal with the past must carry us into the future; a  future  that
offers something better for everyone. That was the approach of the ANC  long
before the first elections in 1994. It  was  also  never  the  intention  to
place the entire burden of dealing with the past and achieving the goals  of
reconciliation and nation-building on the shoulders of the  TRC  alone.  The
Government has consistently recognised the need to deal with the horrors  of
the past, as well as  the  legacy  we  inherited,  in  a  comprehensive  and
integrated manner.

In fact,  the  process  of  healing  the  wounds,  rebuilding  our  country,
restoring  dignity  to  our  citizens  and  even  direct  compensation   and
restitution began the day this democratically elected Government  came  into
office - before the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation  Act  was
passed in 1995 and before the commission was appointed.

The Restitution of Land Rights Act was passed by this  Parliament  in  1994.
It was all about bringing justice to those who  had  been  forcibly  removed
from  their  land,  and  in  so  doing  restoring  dignity   and   achieving
reconciliation in our country. There is no doubt  that  the  restoration  of
land rights constitutes reparation - ''making amends for a wrong'' as it  is
defined in the Oxford English  Dictionary,  or  ''the  action  of  repairing
something''. Of course there is much more that this Government has  done  to
restore dignity, to bring social justice to our people and  to  rebuild  our
country and repair the damage  done  by  centuries  of  racism,  sexism  and
oppression.

In saying these things I do not in any way wish to  diminish  the  immensely
important role played by the TRC in healing the wounds of our  painful  past
and in promoting reconciliation and national unity. The way the process  was
initiated, the fact  that  for  the  first  time  ever  there  was  a  truth
commission appointed by an Act of Parliament, the people chosen to serve  on
the commission, the most unusual bishop who was heading it, and the  way  it
conducted its work started  the  healing  process  and  reconciliation  long
before the finalisation of the report and long before the implementation  of
some of the recommendations began. But it is important to see  the  work  of
the commission and its recommendations in the right context.

Our country has  produced  many  great  and  colourful  figures.  Archbishop
Desmond Tutu surely ranks amongst the best and most colourful of  them  all.
We should not underestimate his personal role  in  healing  the  wounds,  in
promoting values of compassion and forgiveness and  creating  an  atmosphere
in which people were able to hear the truth and tell the truth. Not  all  of
us show emotions the way he does, but when he cried  with  the  victims  and
the perpetrators, the whole nation cried with him.  And  when  laughter  was
born out of his tears, we  laughed  with  him,  and  somehow  we  knew  that
marvellous things were happening in our country, and that we  had  made  the
right choices, and we were on the right road.

Indeed Chairperson, we are on the right road. It is often a bumpy  road  and
we still have a long way to travel, but we are on the right road. It is  the
road towards the fulfilment of a dream: a future where poverty  is  a  thing
of the past; a country where there is equality between people  of  different
races and between men and women; a  country  where  everyone  can  read  and
write, where people feel secure; and a country that we all feel proud of.

In the ANC we have always understood that genuine reconciliation  cannot  be
achieved without social justice. We made the choice  that  reparations  will
be paid to the victims of human rights violations who  brought  their  cases
to the commission. And this must be done in the same way as those  who  lost
their land and who lodged claims with the Restitution Commission  got  their
land back or received compensation. But the exercise of  reparation  we  are
engaged in goes far beyond redress to immediate victims. Quite simply,  what
is called for is a massive  reconstruction  and  development  programme.  It
needs to reach as many people as possible and it needs to be sustained.

This has been central to all Government policies and programmes since  1994.
It has made a huge difference in many  people's  lives.  And  although  many
people still do not have water, or still live  in  inadequate  housing,  and
although many are still trapped in poverty, there is  no  doubt  that  there
has been positive change in this country that every citizen  benefits  from.
Statistics are good at recording how many houses have been  built,  but  not
so good - as you said, Premier of Limpopo - at capturing the restoration  of
dignity and the enjoyment of freedoms and rights.

A farm worker may be doing the same job as before, but no longer  stands  to
be evicted from his or her home when she can  no  longer  do  her  job.  Her
children will not be illiterate. She elects her own  public  representatives
and this country belongs to her. That is change.  That  is  social  justice.
That is reconciliation. That puts meaning to many  of  the  clauses  of  the
Freedom Charter, including that this country belongs to the people who  live
in it.

The farm owner - her employer -  also  has  rights  and  freedoms;  many  of
which, incidentally, even if she happens to be  white,  she  did  not  enjoy
during the apartheid era. She is an equally valued citizen of  this  country
and this country also belongs  to  her.  Her  success  as  a  farmer  and  a
businessperson is our success. She is one of us.

That brings me to the economy and to  one  of  the  recommendations  in  the
report, namely the wealth tax. As I  said  before,  the  reconstruction  and
development of our country, the process of repairing the  damage  caused  by
apartheid, needs to be comprehensive and needs to be sustained.  For  us  to
offer a better life to all our citizens and to offer opportunities to  those
most disadvantaged in our society, for us to be able to  do  that,  we  need
money. And for that we need a healthy and growing economy.

No  doubt  Cabinet  has  started  its   deliberations   on   some   of   the
recommendations in the report. I must  say  that  I  did  write  the  speech
before I heard what the President had to say and now  we  are  much  clearer
about Cabinet's views  on  the  wealth  tax  and  other  such  matters.  But
nonetheless, I was writing it with some trepidation that I might  contradict
the President from this podium. I will not. I will venture an opinion  on  a
once-off tax. I don't think it is the best way of achieving  our  collective
goals. We fund  our  entire  programme  of  reconstruction  and  development
through tax revenue as it is. We have  significantly  improved  our  revenue
collection. For as long as our economy continues to grow, it is a  sustained
and growing source of finance.

If the rationale for the wealth tax is that it is the best  way  to  finance
reparations,  reconstruction  and  development,   it   is   a   questionable
rationale. If the argument is that businesses benefited under apartheid  and
now they have to pay back, well, let's deal with that.

Firstly, many businesspeople will tell you how constrained they were  during
the apartheid period, and how doors were  opened  to  them  after  democracy
came  to  our  country.  That  is  when  many  businesses   really   started
flourishing.

Secondly, the make-up of many of the companies, even those  who  may  really
have benefited under apartheid, has changed.  Some  more  than  others,  but
most have changed and we want them to change even further. This  is  one  of
the ways to address the inherited inequalities in our economy.

Thirdly, the introduction  of  extraordinary  taxes  nine  years  after  the
apartheid era has come to an  end  will  leave  businesses  wondering:  What
next? We need growth, we need investment, and for that we have  to  avoid  a
climate of uncertainty. The wealth tax, with all the best intentions in  the
world, would not help create that environment of certainty  and  confidence.
Reparations have to be  paid  and  reconstruction  must  continue,  but  the
wealth tax is just not in my opinion the best way of financing it.
That does not in any way suggest that  business  should  not  make  an  even
greater contribution to the reconstruction effort. Yes,  they  have  done  a
lot, in the funding of schools, clinics,  offering  learnership  programmes,
sponsoring sports development and  much  more.  But  the  challenges  remain
enormous and there is much more to be  done.  In  any  event,  South  Africa
belongs to them, as it belongs to me and to  you,  and  they  should  do  it
because they want  to  do  it  and  because  the  challenge  is  also  their
challenge. These are matters that  will  be  discussed  at  the  Growth  and
Development Summit, and business should be seriously  applying  their  minds
on how they can really make a difference.  Because  they  want  to.  Because
this is their country.

Chairperson, Mr President, to end off.  An  interesting  piece  of  research
might be to establish the total number of  years  members  sitting  in  this
House have spent in prison and in exile. Comrade President, you  spent  most
of  your  adult  life  banished  from  the  country  of  your  birth.   Your
predecessor spent 27 years in jail. Bitterness does not feature in  the  way
you are leading our country. Bitterness did not feature in  the  way  Nelson
Mandela led our country. We fought for  freedom  and  we  fought  for  human
rights and it was not about reward. There are many in this House  that  have
served prison sentences: there's Andrew Mlangeni, 27 years; Billy  Nair,  20
years; Isu Chiba, 18 years; Barbara  Hogan,  10  years;  Jeremy  Cronin,  10
years, the Deputy President himself, 10 years, and most of the rest  of  his
life in exile. He was very healthy in  prison,  incidentally.  He  lost  his
hair when he was in exile. [Laughter.] We no longer have him with us in  the
gallery, but we did have Father Mike Lapsley there who lost his hands  while
he was in exile: a bomb - a parcel bomb. He was a minister of religion,  not
a cadre of uMkhonto weSiswe.

The price has been paid by many people. In our gallery we are also  honoured
to have George Bizos up there. George Bizos failed in  his  task  though  to
... [Applause.] They fought for  our  human  rights  incidentally  and  they
fought hard. They are heroes of our struggle. Where George Bizos did fail  -
he tried hard to get Nelson Mandela off and to get  him  not  to  serve  his
prison sentence, but he failed dismally in that. [Laughter.]  I  believe  we
had Arthur Chaskalson here earlier. These were fighters  for  human  rights.
These were people who helped us draft a magnificent  constitution  for  this
country and today, Arthur Chaskalson, as we know, heads  the  Constitutional
Court in our country.

We have much to be proud of. Mr President, we did not do  that  for  reward.
Even I served a little bit of time behind bars. Not  those  bars  where  you
drink, but the prison bars. [Laughter.] Now I served so little  time  behind
those bars that it is called  a  parking  ticket.  So,  it's  a  bit  of  an
embarrassment  to  me.  But  even  for  that  parking  ticket  I  want  some
acknowledgement. All of us sitting in this room - there is  Mr  Masala  back
there, there is  Ben  Fihla  and  many  others  -  we  are  human.  We  want
acknowledgement for what we did. But we did not do it for reward and  it  is
not a colour statement. The fact that you cannot quantify  a  life  lost  is
not a colour statement. There's no money in the world  that  can  compensate
for the life of a person lost. We did it because this  is  our  country  and
because we believe that it belongs to all who live in it - all of us.

 The District Six Museum up the road will be part of  that  acknowledgement.
Freedom Park - still to be established - will be part of  that  recognition,
and other museums and monuments are important to our  country.  Symbols  and
recognition do help in the healing process and the message in the memory  is
a clear one: Never again.

But Mr President, real material change in people's lives  remains  our  most
important challenge. But this time though, we do it together -  all  of  us.
Not for reward, but simply because we want to do it; because  we  live  here
and this country belongs to us.
[Applause.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. Your  Excellency,  our  President  of
South Africa, Deputy President, hon Ministers, hon Premiers, hon members  of
both Houses, hon Chairperson of the NCOP, and  also  recognising  amidst  us
today the  Speaker  of  the  KwaZulu-Natal  Municipality,  hon  Numsa  Dube.
Malibongwe!

Ladies and gentlemen, with the closure  of  the  apartheid  regime  and  the
liberation of our people through democratic elections, we  entered  our  new
South Africa free.

The torture, the killing in 1960 of our innocent people under the  apartheid
pass laws, the humiliation  and  injustice  of  the  apartheid  regime  were
imbedded in the minds of the majority of South Africans. How  was  democracy
successful with such a people?

To compensate, repair and correct those inhumane injustices a system had  to
be introduced. Thus  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  body  was  introduced.
Travelling through the South African state, the TRC has been the  source  to
many, many inhumane and horrific deeds.

South Africa has been tagged the "rainbow nation". Its  citizenry  consisted
of persons from all walks of life. Black, white, coloured, Asian,  male  and
female among other divisions that were indented through legalities  such  as
the Colour Bar Act. Noting this rich diversity and the desire  to  attain  a
democracy, it was and is crucial  that  this  diversity  be  united  as  one
nation harmoniously. To do this the South African people,  especially  those
victims of the apartheid regime, had to learn to forgive.  As  said  in  the
words of the previous hon President  of  South  Africa,  the  hon  Nelson  R
Mandela, ``we shall forgive but we shall not forget''. Today we stand  as  a
democracy, no matter what colour or creed.

The Minority Front thanks and supports the  TRC  for  all  its  efforts  and
achievements. Though forgiveness and justice have been inculcated, it  shall
never completely heal the wounds and losses that had  been  suffered.  Maybe
it is good in the light  of  using  such  abuse  as  a  deterrent  for  ever
returning to such an autocratic  and  treacherous  governmental  system.  By
reminding ourselves of the ills of the past, we shall not carry hate in  our
hearts, but hope and appreciation for what we have achieved -  a  democracy,
one people, no matter what colour or creed.

Many controversies have been noted with regard to the TRC process,  but  the
MF feels that if criticism is not made we  would  not  be  able  to  declare
sufficiently our successes and failures.

It has been quite a task set out for the TRC, and its final report has  been
eagerly awaited. It is pleasing to note the  various  role-players  in  this
taxing process. Important contributions have been made  from  both  business
and civil society, depicting eager and earnest interest in the wellbeing  of
South Africa.

The MF is pleased with the efforts of the Justice Minister, the hon  Penuell
Maduna, who had embarked on efforts to incorporate the  above  persons  into
the process, and with the recommendations made in the final two reports.

The input of our citizenry is important, and the transparency of our  system
allows for viable contributions from various stakeholders such as  business,
NGOs and civil society.

Amnesty,  national  reconciliation,   reparations   and   measures   to   be
implemented to prevent a recurrence of the past, is  what  the  MF  strongly
supports.

The MF supports hon Maduna in his view that our efforts  should  be  focused
on economic growth and social  development,  to  enable  ``us  to  meet  the
aspirations of all our people for access to healthcare, education,  housing,
social welfare and safety and security''.

The MF further supports the reparations to  be  paid  and  suggests  that  a
systematic framework be introduced to do so. It also agrees that a claim  on
business would cause panic in a number of sectors. To avoid  this  imbalance
and disruption, systems should be put in place to accommodate  the  process.
It would certainly hold major repercussions for us,  both  domestically  and
internationally.

The MF notes the sensitivity of the issue and that a  balance  is  difficult
to  attain.  However,  having  viewed  the  TRC  report,  it  is  felt  that
possibilities to attain our means exist, and we support all  efforts  whole-
heartedly.

The MF supports  reconciliation,  nation-building  and  the  improvement  of
relations between communities. I thank you, Sir.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, hon President, in your speech today  you  made
a gallant attempt to  set  the  tone  for  a  debate  in  an  atmosphere  of
reconciliation. The National Action appreciates this approach of yours.

There was, however, Mr President, one vital missing  link  in  your  speech.
You abundantly made mention of a decision  by  the  struggle  leadership  to
focus on reconciliation and  not  retaliation,  of  reconciliation  and  not
revenge. In one paragraph in your speech you said three times ``we said  ...
, we said ... , we said ... '' and then you mentioned these things.
But, Mr President, you and I know it takes two to tango.

Therefore, I  must  tell  you  that  in  your  speech  today  I  missed  the
mentioning of a devotion to peace and reconciliation from the  side  of  the
previously advantaged. Therefore, I want to pay tribute today  to  thousands
of Afrikaner people and  their  leaders  who  did  not  choose  the  Savimbi
option, but who accepted the loss of privilege and power, and embarked on  a
process of peace and reconciliation. Without their contribution our  country
could have looked like Baghdad looks today.

Agb Speaker, dit is met gemengde gevoelens dat ek die werksaamhede  van  die
WVK vandag moet evalueer. Laat ek eerlik wees, die oorgrote meerderheid  van
die Afrikaners het  hierdie  proses  ervaar  as  een  lang  beskuldiging  en
blaamwerping, asof voor die wêreld oopgespalk,  terwyl  jou  derms  uitgeryg
word. Ons het ook  die  proses  as  baie  eensydig  ervaar,  asof  ``truth''
geselekteerd gesoek is, asof oor die verslag van die WVK  geskryf  kan  word
``the good, the bad and the  ugly''.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Hon Speaker, it is with mixed feelings that I must evaluate the  activities
of the TRC today. Let me be  honest,  the  greater  majority  of  Afrikaners
experienced this process as  one  long  accusation  and  casting  of  blame,
experienced it as if one had been spread-eagled before  the  world  and  had
one's intestines ripped out. We also experienced this process as being  very
one-sided, as if ``truth'' had been sought selectively, as if the report  of
the TRC could be described as ``the good, the bad and the ugly''.]

It may be easy for someone like the hon Tony Leon to praise the TRC  and  to
say ``no further  amnesty''.  It  is  easy  to  say  this  from  an  elitist
distance, as the predecessors of the DA were neither part  of  the  struggle
nor of the regime. But, Mr Leon, I must remind you  it's  a  different  case
with your temporary supporters in Pretoria  in  die  moot  [in  the  valley]
today.

On the other hand, Chairperson, with the benefit of hindsight, we could  not
proceed without this type of process. I acknowledge that.

Die WVK, pynlik en gebrekkig soos dit was, het tog 'n funksie vervul  as  'n
soort weerligafleier, 'n soort  katarsis.  Die  alternatief  kon  dalk  veel
erger gewees het. Die Nasionale Aksie aanvaar die WVK as 'n gebrekkige  maar
tog noodsaaklike instrument vir sy tyd. En die klem val  hier  op  ``vir  sy
tyd''.

Meneer, die boeke moet nou toegemaak word. Die  uitgerygde  derms  moet  nou
teruggepak word sodat die liggaam van Suid-Afrika normaal  kan  funksioneer.
Daartoe moet alle  Suid-Afrikaners  hulle  nou  verbind,  sonder  'n  morele
leedvermaak aan die een kant  of  'n  neerdrukkende  skuldkompleks  aan  die
ander kant.

Reparasie, die aandring op reparasie, het weer eens  vandag  sterk  na  vore
gekom, en is gekonkretiseer in die  WVK  se  aanbeveling  van  'n  eenmalige
soort van rykmansbelasting. Die NA wys egter daarop  dat  bykans  elke  wet,
elke beleidstuk, elke begroting wat deur hierdie Huis  goedgekeur  word,  'n
vorm van reparasie  is.  Swart  bemagtiging,  regstellende  aksie,  spesiale
projekte  tot  armoedeverligting,  die  verhoging   van   intreevlakke   vir
inkomstebelasting,  die  voorkeurvoorsieningsbeleid  en  grondhervorming  is
alles een groot stuk reparasie. Daarom verwelkom  die  NA  die  aankondiging
van  die  President  dat  die  WVK   se   aanbeveling   van   'n   eenmalige
reparasiebelasting nie aanvaar word nie. Hy  verwelkom  ook  sy  teenkanting
teen die Fagin-tipe hofsake teen private maatskappye.

Oor amnestie spreek die  Nasionale  Aksie  sy  teleurstelling  uit  dat  die
President nie 'n deeglike proses aangekondig het om  in  hierdie  opsig  die
onafgehandelde werk van die WVK aan te spreek nie. Die aankondiging dat  die
Direkteur van Openbare Vervolgings die saak moet hanteer,  is  vaag  en  kan
lei tot subjektiwiteit, en ons vra direk  dadelik  meer  inligting  daaroor.
Die NA is ten gunste van 'n verdere proses, nie van algemene  amnestie  nie,
maar van kollektiewe amnestie, gereguleer  deur  deeglike  wetgewing  waarom
ons partye en organisasies kollektief kan  aansoek  doen,  naamlik  amnestie
vir persone wat oortree het in die geloof dat hulle  die  oogmerke  van  die
organisasie bevorder het.

Die aankondiging van die President laat ook geen  ruimte  vir  amnestie  aan
persone wat reeds skuldig bevind is en 'n vonnis uitdien nie. Al waarna  dit
vir my lyk, is dat 'n ongekontroleerde meganisme van pardon  soortgelyk  aan
dié van artikel 84(j) aan die President nou in die hande  van  die  Openbare
Vervolger geplaas word. Groter duidelikheid is dringend noodsaaklik.

Die WVK was 'n instrument wat 'n bepaalde funksie in 'n bepaalde tyd  vervul
het, 'n besem wat op 'n sekere tyd moes skoon vee.  Daardie  proses  is  nou
afgehandel. Indien dit dan blyk dat die besem om sekere redes nie by al  die
hoekies kon uitkom nie, is dit nét verantwoordelik om 'n deeglike  meganisme
daar te stel wat dit kan doen sonder om afbreuk te  doen  aan  die  WVK.  Ek
dink dit sal 'n positiewe sein uitstuur van alles is nie  afgehandel  en  in
graniet gegiet by Kempton Park nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)
[The TRC,  painful  and  imperfect  as  it  was,  nevertheless  fulfilled  a
function as a  kind  of  lightning  conductor,  a  kind  of  catharsis.  The
alternative could have been far worse. The National Action accepts  the  TRC
as an imperfect but nevertheless essential instrument for its time.  And  in
this the emphasis is on "for its time".

Sir, now the books must be closed. The ripped out  intestines  must  be  put
back so that the body of South Africa can function  normally.  To  that  all
South Africans must now commit themselves, without  moral  gloating  on  the
one hand or an oppressive guilt complex on the other.

Reparation, the insistence on reparation, once again strongly  came  to  the
fore today and is concretised in the  TRC's  recommendation  of  a  once-off
kind of rich man's tax. The NA, however,  wishes  to  point  out  that  just
about every Act, every policy document, every budget approved by this  House
is a form of reparation.  Black  empowerment,  affirmative  action,  special
projects for poverty relief, the increase in entry levels for taxation,  the
preference procurement policy land reform all comprise one  large  piece  of
reparation. For  that  reason  the  NA  welcomes  the  announcement  by  the
President that the TRC's recommendation of a  once-off  reparation  tax  has
not been accepted. It also welcomes its opposition to the  Fagin-type  court
cases against private companies.

With regard to amnesty, the National Action conveys its disappointment  that
the President has not announced a proper process in this regard  to  address
the incomplete work of the  TRC.  The  announcement  that  the  Director  of
Public Prosecutions should handle the matter is  vague  and  could  lead  to
subjectivity and we are  asking  directly  for  more  information  about  it
immediately. The NA is in favour  of  a  further  process,  not  of  general
amnesty, but of collective amnesty, regulated by  thorough  legislation  for
which our parties and organisations can apply collectively,  namely  amnesty
for persons who transgressed in the belief  that  they  were  promoting  the
objectives of the organisation.

The announcement by the President does not leave any  room  for  amnesty  to
persons who have already been convicted and are  serving  a  sentence.  What
this looks like to me is that an uncontrolled  pardoning  mechanism  similar
to that of section 84(j) to the President is now being placed in  the  hands
of the Public Prosecutor. Greater clarity is of the utmost urgency.

The TRC was an instrument that fulfilled a certain  function  at  a  certain
time, a broom that had to sweep clean at a certain time.  This  process  has
now been completed. If it appears as if the broom could not  reach  all  the
little  corners  for  certain  reasons,  then  it  is  just  responsible  to
introduce a thorough mechanism that can do this without detracting from  the
TRC. I think that this will send a positive signal that not  everything  was
dealt with and cast in granite at Kempton Park.]

 The CHAIRPERSON: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Ons in Suid-Afrika sal met mekaar onderhandel sonder  dat  dit
deur 'n tweede struggle  voorafgegaan  word.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: We in South Africa will negotiate  with  one  another  without
going through a second struggle. I thank you.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Chairperson, hon President Mbeki,  hon  Deputy  President,
hon members, ladies and gentlemen, not only am I honoured to participate  in
this historic debate on behalf  of  the  ANC,  but  I  would  also  like  to
acknowledge the contribution of comrade Dullah  Omar,  one  of  the  driving
forces behind  the  establishment  of  the  TRC.  History  will  record  his
contribution in bold type and in capital letters. [Applause.]

As we bring closure to the formal aspects of the work and existence  of  the
TRC, it is well to remember that, although the TRC process revealed  certain
weaknesses, as is to be expected with any such ambitious  project,  it  will
always be regarded as one of the symbolic monuments erected to the  "triumph
of the human spirit over adversity". Today I wish to remind us  of  what  we
set out to do eight long years ago by way of an abbreviated analysis of  the
historical context, legal origins and philosophical foundation of  the  TRC,
both in an international and national context.

Internationally, the last two decades of  the  second  millennium  witnessed
the demise of a whole range of certainties, which  irrevocably  altered  the
world order as we knew it. The East/West dichotomy,  which  provided  a  bi-
polar world order, with its own  unique  internal  dynamic  allowing  for  a
relative measure of equilibrium, has given way to a uni-polar  world  order,
completely dominated by a rampant United States of America. This  period  of
flux has witnessed an  unprecedented  period  of  explosive  change  towards
democracy, as a myriad of  countries  have  been  involved  in  a  political
transition from some form of dictatorship to democracy.

These transitional processes unleash new problems and  tensions  in  society
on the  one  hand,  while  on  the  other  they  create  new  possibilities,
opportunities and solutions, and allow for a renewing creativity.

Taking  into  account  the  differences  which  exist  between  transitional
processes, national traditions, material circumstances and  the  freedom  of
political and legal options, no country or  organisation  has  developed  an
approach or model which could in any way claim to be universally  applicable
to nations in transition when dealing with the legacy of their  past,  which
invariably encompasses each aspect of such  society.  This  is  particularly
apposite if such legacy has been associated with violations of human  rights
in the past, hereinafter referred to as violations.

In international jurisprudence and practice two  broad,  flexible,  somewhat
imprecisely defined and mutually exclusive models or  approaches  have  been
developed for dealing with past violations  in  transitional  situations.  I
shall refer to these as the justice model, which deals with the question  of
prosecution and punishment, with the elements  of  retributive  justice  and
criminal accountability forming  its  central  tenets,  usually  within  the
framework of an existing criminal  justice  system  or  mechanism,  and  the
reconciliation or truth model,  with  the  elements  of  acknowledgement  of
truth and reconciliation forming its central tenets -  of  which  the  truth
commission is the most often used mechanism in recent times.

The stark choice between these two models is what confronted us those  eight
long years ago, as echoed in the ominous warning  of  Adam  Michnik  at  the
time:


  On the road out of dictatorship, each solution has its price. The road of
  justice - which often turns into the  road  of  revenge  and  war  -  has
  bloodshed  as  its  price.  But  the  road   through   negotiations   and
  reconciliation has its price, too. When you get up from  the  negotiating
  table you may have to defend your former enemy, now your partner, from  a
  lynch mob. In truth, what you are defending is  the  principle  that  all
  citizens have the right to live in the same state.

We as South Africans found neither of  these  models  on  their  own  to  be
apposite to our transition. I am,  therefore,  of  the  opinion  that  South
Africa may have, at least, created  a  new,  innovative  variant  of  either
model, or, at best, created a third unique hybrid model. I refer to it as  a
restorative or social justice model, containing essential elements  of  both
models, as a mechanism suited to our transition, to deal with our legacy  of
human rights violations.

Time constraints do not allow me to analyse the TRC in any  detail.  Suffice
it to point out that the philosophical bedrock upon which the  establishment
of the TRC rests, is best  captured  in  the  pragmatic  wisdom  of  Chilean
lawyer, Pepe Zalaquett:


  Many people, and especially many people in the world of the human  rights
  movement, are disconcerted by the idea that you should also bear in  mind
  the feasibility of your principles. In Chile, President Aylwin stated  at
  his inauguration that he would strive for all truth and justice in so far
  as it was possible ... and that ... we have  all  come  to  realise  that
  under changing circumstances, a less striking form of courage  is  called
  for. It is the courage to forego easy righteousness, to learn how to live
  with real-life restrictions, but to seek nevertheless  to  advance  one's
  most cherished values day by day, to the  extent  that  it  is  possible.
  Relentlessly, responsibly.

I now want to look at this question within the South African context.  South
Africa is at present still undergoing  a  period  of  transition.  The  last
decade has witnessed a gradual shift from an illegitimate, minority,  white,
dictatorship towards a more humane and democratic  society.  The  foundation
has been laid for our society, firstly, to start dealing  with  and  rolling
back the legacy  of  our  apartheid  past  and,  secondly,  to  achieve  our
strategic  objective  of  developing  into  a   truly   united,   nonracial,
nonsexist, democratic and prosperous nation. This has been made possible  by
the deliberate policy  of  reconciliation,  reconstruction  and  development
adopted by the ANC, which has enabled us  to  narrow  the  space  for  those
forces which might have had plans to subvert the transition  by  violent  or
other means. This policy forms  the  kernel  of  our  social  transformation
project during the transition and is  now  a  foundation  principle  of  our
Constitution.

The main content of this policy is  the  transformation  of  the  political,
economic, social, ideological, moral and all other aspects of the legacy  of
the apartheid dispensation. This is to be achieved  by  the  building  of  a
single South African nation which acknowledges the diversity of its  people;
a new and progressive patriotism; the healing of the wounds  of  a  shameful
past; the deracialisation of society; the liberation of  Black  people  from
political and  economic  bondage;  the  progressive  eradication  of  gender
inequalities and women's oppression in particular; uplifting the quality  of
life  and  promoting  the  equality  of  all  South  Africans  through   the
progressive sustained eradication of  poverty  and  the  attainment  of  the
basic  needs  of  the  majority;  creating  and  maintaining  a  culture  of
democracy and human rights; and, lastly,  establishing  a  more  humane  and
caring society.

Arising from this approach, the attainment  of  the  twin  goals  of  socio-
economic justice, also referred to  as  socio-economic  reconstruction,  and
the restoration of the moral order of  our  country,  also  referred  to  as
moral reconstruction, have crystallised as the two  main  strategies  to  be
vigorously pursued to successfully attain  social  justice  as  a  means  of
dealing with South Africa's legacy of her apartheid past and  achieving  our
strategic objectives.

Firstly, in respect  of  our  socio-economic  reconstruction  goal  we  have
introduced various  mechanisms  in  pursuit  of  the  attainment  of  socio-
economic justice. Many have been mentioned today  and  I  will  not  discuss
them here.

Secondly, in respect of the moral reconstruction goal, there is, and was,  a
compelling need for the moral reconstruction of the country,  not  least  of
all due to the abdication of the rule of law  and  the  violation  of  human
rights under apartheid. This entailed our  restoring  some  semblance  of  a
moral order for our society, based on international norms and standards  and
broadly reflecting the new soul of our nation. We needed to identify a  tool
or mechanism to enable our nation to deal with its  psychological  or  moral
healing and to  lay  a  foundation  for  the  moral  reconstruction  of  our
society. This particular process of healing is highly  personalised  in  one
sense, but also has an important public dimension, as the nation as a  whole
needs to come to grips with such violations. One of the ways  to  start  the
healing process in South Africa was to embark on an  honest  assessment  and
diagnosis of the sickness within our society, in  an  attempt  to  give  our
people, both perpetrators and victims, an opportunity to face the  past  and
its consequences, and to start afresh.  It  is  in  this  context  that  the
possible creation of a truth commission offered us one such  opportunity  to
deal with the past without dwelling  on  it,  and  to  establish  the  moral
foundation from which to build a truly new South Africa. Hence, the  genesis
of the TRC.

 I would venture the opinion that the TRC was a logical  conclusion  to  our
atrocious and shameful past. The establishment  of  the  TRC  did  not  take
place in a vacuum; it is not an abstract concept drafted by lawyers in  some
dark, secret room. The idea, not the detail, germinated in the  crucible  of
struggle; born in the engine room of political negotiation.  Negotiation  is
about building trust, confidence-building mechanisms  between  protagonists,
as much as anything else.  The  manner  in  which  our  transition  unfolded
through the process of political negotiation made  the  possibility  of  the
establishment of a truth commission inevitable. I would  go  so  far  as  to
venture that the final settlement of the negotiation  process,  codified  in
the interim Constitution, at least implicitly, contained the  seeds  of  the
establishment of the TRC.

Thus, in 1995, this Parliament established the TRC by passing the  Promotion
of National Unity and Reconciliation Act. This marked one  of  the  historic
events, during  the  transition,  which  facilitated  the  so-called  "South
African miracle".  Although  the  establishment  of  truth  commissions  had
become a widely used tool or mechanism in the recent past, the TRC marked  a
unique moment in world history, because it was the first time that a  nation
had  created  a  truth  commission  through  a  public,  participatory   and
democratically verifiable process, by way of an Act of Parliament. The  TRC,
also in many other respects, featured unique and  historic  characteristics,
which individually, collectively or contextually, had  never  been  utilised
in the context of a truth commission. Suffice it to say  for  now  that  our
approach was for the first time  ever  to  contextualise  an  individualised
amnesty process, within the framework and context of a truth commission,  in
such a manner as to focus in a balanced and  reconciliatory  manner  on  the
restoration of the dignity, honour and integrity of the  victims,  while  at
the same time giving effect to the  constitutional  provision  of  providing
for an amnesty process.
Although it is undoubtedly so that the TRC will always proudly stand out  as
a shining beacon of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity, we  must
continuously strive to maintain a balanced perspective  in  respect  of  the
role and value of the TRC in addressing the legacy of the  past,  especially
in  achieving  or   promoting   reconciliation.   It   should   neither   be
underemphasised nor overemphasised.

In the context of what has gone before it cannot be overemphasised  strongly
enough that the TRC is but one mechanism we have pursued in respect  of  our
deliberate policy of  reconciliation,  reconstruction  and  development,  to
enable us to address but one moral aspect of the legacy of our past,  namely
the various forms of mainly  physical  violence  we  unleashed  against  one
another. It was never  meant  to  address  all  the  wrongs  caused  by  our
apartheid legacy,  which  are  varied,  complex  and  multifaceted,  as  its
focused and limited mandate bears witness to.

It  is  important  to  stress  that   reconciliation,   reconstruction   and
development form a process, not a single event or even a series  of  events,
and in all probability a lengthy process at that. The TRC  was  and  is  not
meant to equal reconciliation. The TRC per se cannot  bring  reconciliation;
it can only create a space to facilitate the process.  Long  after  the  TRC
has ceased to exist, the process of reconciliation will still be  continuing
in various other forms, more particularly within civil society. The  TRC  is
but one moment, one event, albeit an important moment or event, in  the  new
lease of life of our nation; it is not the process itself.

Hopefully  the  process  will  now  be  conducted  at  a  qualitatively  and
quantitatively higher level, with a nation more at peace with herself.  Even
if the TRC only makes a valuable contribution towards raising that level  to
some extent, future generations will not judge  us  too  harshly;  they  may
even smile fondly upon us. The TRC's importance is that it  came  relatively
close to the beginning of the process. It was the first time  that  a  South
African government - ironically the democratic one -  through  the  creation
of the TRC acknowledged that terrible wrongs had been perpetrated  upon  her
people, mainly by the old  government,  and  provided  them  with  a  state-
instituted and sponsored mechanism, independently managed and controlled  by
civil society.

Without pleading for ahistorical behaviour, we must be particularly  careful
not to elevate this one mechanism of a TRC, as important as it is,  to  some
mythical  status  as  our  only  or  most  important  vehicle   to   achieve
reconciliation, in isolation from all the other mechanisms we are  utilising
to achieve social justice and  to  reconcile  our  people.  A  danger  lurks
within such an approach, because it  may  create  expectations  which  could
never be met by the creation of the TRC.

It is in this context that the  attainment  of  the  twin  goals  of  socio-
economic justice and the restoration of the moral order of  our  country  to
deal with our apartheid legacy has been referred to by Dr Alex  Boraine,  as
our "unfinished business" - the flip side  of  the  same  coin.  Whilst  the
focus of the TRC will be on seeking the truth in  search  of  restoring  the
moral order and the pursuit of reconciliation and unity, serious  delays  in
the improvement of the quality of life of persons will bring into  disrepute
any attempts at reconciliation. If we do not substantially deliver on socio-
economic justice, then no matter how reconciliatory we  are  or  whether  we
know the complete truth about our past  or  not,  the  whole  South  African
liberation and democratisation project could perhaps  be  put  in  jeopardy.
Revealing the complete truth of our shameful past, without attaining  socio-
economic justice, or conversely, attaining  socio-economic  justice  without
revealing the complete  truth,  either  scenario  spells  failure,  possible
disaster  and  is  unacceptable  -  the   anathema   of   attaining   social
transformation.  Simply  put,  reconciliation  cannot  be  promoted  at  the
expense of reconstruction and development, with the converse  being  equally
true.

Finally and very  importantly,  I  need  to  mention  possibly  one  of  the
greatest  "hidden"  achievements  of  the  TRC,  which  amazingly  is  never
mentioned. During most recent  transitions,  especially  those  involving  a
move away from a military dictatorship, either simultaneously  or  prior  to
the establishment of a truth commission, these have been  accompanied  by  a
decision to decree a general or blanket amnesty. In these  transitions,  the
truth  commission  and  general  amnesty  became  necessary  and   sometimes
uncomfortable bedfellows.

In my view, the granting of such a general amnesty has been the main  reason
for creating a situation of impunity in those countries,  resulting  in  the
hegemony and the conspiracy of silence of the government forces  which  were
involved in violations, remaining virtually intact during such  transitions,
and which has in return led to such forces  remaining  outside  their  truth
commission processes.

Our TRC bears witness to the first occasion  in  world  history  that  I  am
aware of where the hegemony and the conspiracy of silence  of  the  security
forces, in this instance  especially  the  police,  had  been  broken  in  a
country undergoing a transition to democracy, by way of a truth commission.

In conclusion, as we continue building our nation, we may well heed  Andreas
Sajo, when he opines:


  There is no perfect condition for justice to take place, but  transition,
  in particular,  produces  a  special  set  of  conditions  for  imperfect
  justice.

However, we also need to keep  reminding  ourselves  that  eight  years  ago
South Africa began a journey to deal with the pathology of  her  past,  with
the possibility of reconciliation without justice, or with  the  possibility
of  justice  without  reconciliation.  She  ended  with  reconciliation  and
justice.  The  basic  concept  of  "the  South  African  way"  is   captured
eloquently in the words of Prof Werle:


  Inner unity requires reconciliation and this in turn requires the  public
  recognition of the historical truth. Those who are meant to forgive  must
  know what they are forgiving. It is therefore insufficient  to  establish
  the historical truth in merely an abstract manner. Instead, the  violence
  of the past and its causes must be named, the suffering  of  the  victims
  concretely established. Truth has precedence over  punishment,  but  also
  over amnesty. Acknowledgement legitimises amnesty, silence  excludes  it.
  Punishment can, to a certain extent, be  negotiated.  The  truth  cannot.
  This is South Africa's message to societies in transition.  There  is  no
  reconciliation without the truth.

I thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, hon President Mbeki, hon colleagues, on 4  April
I excluded myself from a 10-year formal relationship with the  IFP  to  have
the independence to address a new peace and reconciliation effort.  I  leave
next week for Australia,  as  a  peace  and  reconciliation  ambassador,  to
participate in an MRA conference examining the theme: Together we  can  make
a difference.

This is directly linked to a civil society initiative that I founded and  am
involved in, namely Peace  Alive.  Peace  Alive,  a  registered  Section  21
Company,  will  support  negotiations  to  overcome  intractable   political
problems. Within months we  shall  invite  25  Israeli  and  25  Palestinian
graduates, with  leadership  potential,  to  dialogue  in  the  neutral  and
conducive space of South Africa.

The work that I will be doing in  the  PJC  and  Peace  Alive  will  require
freedom from the strictures of a party caucus and a party National  Council.
I therefore requested to work in co-operation with the IFP,  to  fulfil  the
1999 mandate, while being afforded the opportunity of pursuing my  political
career in a separate direction.

I now turn briefly to Iraq. War, even  when  it  is  fought  with  the  most
modern equipment, remains  a  retrogressive  way  of  defeating  terror  and
dictators. The reported loss of items of antiquity  is  unconscionable,  the
death of innocent civilians remain  unacceptable.  War  is  destructive  and
senseless. The deepest consequences of  this  war  have  still  to  surface.
Modern human beings will need to consider alternative and decisive means  of
combating terrorism and overthrowing tyrants and despots wherever they are.

I will now address  the  TRC  report  and  the  issues  of  reparation.  The
President's announcement of granting a once-off R30 000 to  each  identified
individual, on top of a portion of the interim grant of R50  million,  is  a
positive start. Care needs to be taken that recipients are  well  counselled
in order that they are not wheedled out of  their  gratuity  by  crooks  and
shysters.

Government must also make sure that those who need an enhanced pension,  get
it, and that those whose education was disrupted, will be able  to  complete
their education.

In place of the once-off wealth tax,  proposed  by  the  TRC,  it  might  be
better to consider a business, farm  and  residential  levy  in  respect  of
individuals occupying the 25 or so  per  cent  of  the  most  desirable  and
select locations in  the  country.  This  levy  should  be  for  ten  years.
Apartheid was,  after  all,  about  seizing  the  most  desirable  locations
through Group Areas and until that ghost is laid to  rest,  reparation  will
not have taken place.

For peace to take root in  South  Africa,  justice  has  to  be  served.  In
addition, a special levy of 0,50% on taxable  income  from  those  who  earn
above  R200  000  should  also  be  considered  in  place  of  a   voluntary
contribution. This should also last for ten  years.  It  would  be  a  small
price to pay for stability and peace.

In conclusion, I am very pleased that the President has left the  door  open
in respect of amnesty. We must collectively address this issue  and  find  a
solution that will finally resolve the matter. Thank you.

Mr W J SEREMANE: Mr Chairperson, hon President, hon Premiers and  Ministers,
hon members and compatriots, much has been said, Mr Chairperson, so  that  I
rather give my time that is left and attention  to  those  who  are  on  the
verge of being forgotten. I quote:


  Silence is betrayal. A time comes when silence is betrayal. We are called
  to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for victims of our  nation  and
  those it calls the enemy.

Martin Luther King Jnr, vexed in spirit, had that to say when he  looked  at
the contradictions of injustice juxtaposed  against  both  the  genuine  and
selective struggle for justice, truth and peace.

I therefore dedicate this humble contribution to the  many  unsung,  uncared
for, the marginalised and even the  forgotten  mothers,  fathers,  sons  and
daughters of this land. I do not forget  the  cadres  languishing  in  urban
ghettoes and in rural villages neglected and  forgotten.  I  remember,  too,
the  many  people  of  goodwill  in  places  such  as  Houghton,  Greenside,
Randgate, Clewer and the neighbouring countries.

My tribute goes out to the widow, Mma-Moshoeu, the mother of the late  Phaki
Moshoeu, alias  Rogers  Manyalo,  and  his  late  brother,  Gordon  Moshoeu,
otherwise known as Grenade.

My tribute also goes to Mamongane and Tsakane,  parents  of  Tebogo  Timothy
Seremane, his Chimurenga name, Kenneth Mahamba; Moshabi, mzukuru wa  Komosha
Wedza [Moshabi, nephew of Komosha Wedza].

I also think of Mrs Makhubu, mother of the  brave  young  man,  nameless  to
many, who bears the slain young Hector Peterson in his arms in  the  posters
we occasionally see.

Sadly, too, I think of the parents of Thamsanqa Ndunge, otherwise  known  as
Joel Mahlathini; the family and brother of Maki Skhosana;  the  children  of
the late Dr Ribeiro and the late Mrs Ribeiro; Sam Mokodubete;  Selby  Themba
Ngendana and Joas Mpakeleng Mogale.

Truth and reconciliation is a historic effort that we must regard as a  gift
and a work of grace and mercy, in spite of all its shortcomings.  This  kind
of project should not be left to be trivialised by all of us.

The immediate  task  of  reparation  for  victims  of  gross  injustices  of
apartheid cannot be overemphasised. Those who know better  have  pronounced,
and correctly so, that, I quote:


  Reconciliation is no easy option nor does it rule out confrontation. Just
  as  there  can  be  no  cheap  grace,  there  can  never  be  any   cheap
  reconciliation, because we cannot cry `peace, peace' ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr W J SEREMANE: ... where peace does not prevail. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I
don't think it is necessary for me to go over what I  consider,  in  general
terms, to be a very good debate on  the  speech  by  the  President  on  the
occasion of his tabling the final report of the TRC. I do think we have  had
a wonderful discussion. All of us had a moment  to  reflect  on  where  this
country has come from, where it  is  and  where  it  is  going.  Unless  one
intends to dilute what has been said,  or  in  any  way  which  is  negative
affect what has been said, one should not go over the debate.

I think what remains to be done now that the  President  has  performed  his
task under section 44 of the Act is  for  Parliament  to  then  perform  its
function under section 27(2) of the Act,  which  would  then  conclude  this
part of our work. Therefore, I do think,  Chairperson,  that  at  a  certain
moment you might indeed want  to  consider  reminding  Parliament  what  its
specific function is in this regard.

It is unavoidable, however, to comment on  some  of  the  observations  that
were made by some of the members. It's expected, I'm sure, that  one  should
start with the hon member Mncwango's remarks. Hon member  Mncwango  says  we
need to close the book, and he talks about the  issues  of  amnesty  and  of
ensuring that bygones do indeed become bygones.

I do wish that the hon member had adopted this posture when the  moment  was
right,  when  indeed  we  could  all  have  advised  all  the  people,   who
participated in the  conflicts  of  the  past  under  the  auspices  of  our
parties, how to deal with the TRC. This is because if we had not  encouraged
people to regard the TRC with disdain, the hon member would  not  be  making
this plea today. The hon member said that a group of ANC  leaders  -  27  of
them - applied for amnesty and failed to get it.

I don't how many times we have tried to explain  what  was  happening  here.
That group of ANC leaders was led by the President here. I dare  any  member
of this Parliament to stand up now and say what the President is guilty  of.
And even if they have evidence,  they  are  fully  entitled  to  go  to  the
nearest police station and say: "Charge him."

What we decided to do as the leadership of the ANC, which the TRC failed  to
understand, was to take full responsibility for whatever happened under  the
auspices of the ANC.  [Applause.]  Good  and  bad.  That  was  a  deliberate
position we took.

In other words, we did not find it useful to distance ourselves from  people
who fought apartheid under us, and those who may have made any  mistakes  in
the course of fighting and, indeed, who may even have committed  crimes.  We
said, as the ANC leadership, that we couldn't do that. Of course, there  are
parties which chose to distance themselves from their own cadres.  They  did
do so. [Applause.] The ANC didn't do that.

Now, I am saying that if indeed you know  of  any  crime  we  committed  for
which we need to  be  punished  or  pilloried,  go  to  the  nearest  police
station. They will take a statement from you, and  eventually  whatever  you
think is evidence at your disposal would have to  stand  judicial  scrutiny.
If it fails, accept that.

The hon member then made another very interesting remark here. He said  that
the President of the Republic of South Africa said that the  ANC  leadership
conspired to kill uMntwana wakwa Phindangene. Nothing could be further  from
the truth. I want to quote what the TRC was told by the  ANC  leadership  in
its second submission to the TRC. I'm on page 13 of 41 pages, and I quote:


  The TRC has asked what was the ANC's "military policy"  towards  Inkatha,
  and whether the ANC  leadership  considered  members  of  Inkatha  to  be
  "legitimate military targets". The ANC  had  no  "military  policy"  with
  regard to Inkatha. The  ANC  has  never  considered  Inkatha  members  or
  officials as targets simply because they aligned themselves with Inkatha.

Now I dare the hon member  to  produce  evidence  to  the  effect  that  the
President said that we, in the leadership of  the  ANC,  conspired  to  kill
uMntwana wakwa Phindangene. We never did. What we  certainly  did  tell  the
TRC was that when we became aware of the existence of  a  unit  in  uMkhonto
weSizwe that  indeed  was  debating  and  thinking  of  this,  we  made  the
necessary interventions as leadership. We made those interventions.

Now it was not the leadership. Anybody could have discussed the President  -
could have discussed Madiba. It would be grossly erroneous on  the  part  of
anyone to say that that was a conspiracy on the part of  the  leadership  to
murder uMntwana wakwa Phindangene. But once we  became  aware  of  that,  we
intervened. Hence, nothing was done to harm him. [Applause.]

He works with us in our Government today as a matter of choice by us in  the
ANC, because we value the contribution he makes. We never conspired to  kill
him. Indeed, the record  will  show  that  the  President  never  made  that
statement, and if the hon member wishes  to  challenge  it,  the  record  is
there in the archives. It was captured electronically, and it is also  there
in hard copy. We shall retrieve it for the benefit of this House.

The hon member also said something  about  Archbishop  Tutu's  bias.  It  is
useful to remember that no commissioner was self-appointed.  They  were  all
appointed by the head of state under this Act - the  Promotion  of  National
Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. At least two conditions  applied  with
regard to their appointment. The first condition  was  that  they  would  be
appointed by the head of state,  by  the  President,  as  commissioners  "in
consultation"  with  the  Cabinet,  not  "after   consultation",   but   "in
consultation". Then, of course, that implies that we had  a  veto  over  the
President's power to appoint them, because if indeed we didn't want any  one
of them  as  members  of  Cabinet,  we  could  easily  have  said,  "No,  Mr
President, not this one." [Interjections.]

The second condition before I come to what I was  going  to  say,  was  that
they would be fit and proper persons who would be impartial  and  who  would
not have a high political profile. Of course, what the  hon  member  doesn't
say is where else we could have found these people. We were not looking  for
a deus ex machina that would descend from on high to solve our problems.  We
were looking at South Africans as we found them. Indeed,  inasmuch  as  Tutu
might have had anything to do with the United Democratic Front,  the  number
2 after him, Alex Boraine, had very much to do with  Tony  Leon's  party,  a
lot to do with it! Nobody tells us that he had a particular bias.

There were others as well who had real hostility towards my  ANC.  But  when
the President said, "These are the men  and  women  I  want  to  appoint  as
commissioners", acting in consultation with us in Cabinet, we all said  that
that was right and to go ahead and appoint them. Indeed, the TRC has done  a
good job with very limited resources and within  limited  time.  [Applause.]
The world despatches delegations upon  delegations  to  come  here.  As  I'm
speaking there's a delegation here from Sri Lanka to learn from  us  how  we
South Africans made it, how we did it. For God's  sake  they  would  not  be
coming here if we had made a mistake by setting up the  TRC  and  appointing
whoever we did appoint through the President. It was not a mistake.

Again, it was absolutely necessary for us as a country to  go  through  that
cathartic experience so that we are able to say that though  we  don't  know
the whole truth, though we may be some distance  away  from  reconciliation,
though we may be some distance away indeed from  the  total  eradication  of
poverty, the truth is that as a country we are able to  say  that  the  past
will never be visited upon anybody and upon any community in this country.

There never shall be education specifically for a  certain  group,  intended
to thwart and stunt its development as a group. There never  will  be  group
areas, there never will be whites-only schools, etc. There never,  for  that
matter, will be any parts  of  the  God-given  Indian  and  Atlantic  Oceans
reserved for certain  races.  That  will  never  happen.  It  can't  happen.
[Applause.] It can't happen, because the people of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa in their entirety, black and white, turned their backs once  and  for
all on apartheid and whatever it stood for. All of them!

I said last week that even those who had to be grabbed  by  the  scruffs  of
their necks and led kicking and screaming into the modern Republic of  South
Africa accept today that there will never be a moment for them to drag  this
country back to where it has come from. I said to Afrikaners last week  that
the Afrikaner adage "Agteros kom ook in die kraal" is applicable here.

Bantu Holomisa, my old friend the hon Holomisa, wants to  know  why  we  are
actually opposed to the litigation in the US. This has been canvassed by  so
many speakers that I don't think we need to dwell on it  that  long.  But  I
think  it  needs  to  be  said  that  if  we  could  find   political   and,
subsequently, social  and  economic  problems  to  what  seemed  intractable
problems of the Republic of South Africa, it  shall  not  take  a  court  in
America in excess of 10 000 kilometres from here to find a solution  to  the
disabilities of blacks. I want to say, again:  Think  carefully  about  what
you are talking about.

Imagine the scenario if these companies, which are actually trading  in  the
South African economy and have investments here, have judgments  imposed  on
them by America and, as a result of those judgments, they then have  to  pay
damages to a whole host of people - by the way, the money  won't  come  from
trees, it will come from investments - and therefore they may have to  shred
jobs. The same people that you pretend to be so concerned  about,  will  pay
the price. It won't be paid by anybody else, after a judge  in  America  has
given that decision. It will affect the people of South Africa directly.

We,  this  Government,  think  we  should  deal  with  the  problem  totally
differently, and we want to believe that the masses  of  our  people  accept
the way we are dealing with it. We have no intention whatsoever  of  causing
a socioeconomic interruption in whatever we are trying to  do  and  achieve.
We have no intention whatsoever of doing that. No leader worthy  of  his  or
her salt would do  anything  that  is  tantamount  to  shooting  himself  or
herself in the foot and hoping he or she can run after that.  We  shall  not
do that. We shall do it our way.

The President has invited all of us  to  make  a  contribution  towards  the
President's Fund and, indeed, we should. It is  an  invitation  extended  to
all of us, whether we were beneficiaries of apartheid  or  victims  thereof,
or whatever. Maybe like Tony Leon you  might  have  been  neither  fish  nor
foul, etc. [Interjections.] No matter what you may have  been,  there  is  a
call that has been made in that if you are able to  do  anything  about  the
plight of the majority out there, do it. Do it. We owe it to  ourselves  and
we owe it to posterity to do something  about  the  disabilities  of  blacks
that are neatly traceable  to  our  past,  to  our  colonial  past  and  its
apartheid offshoot.

Therefore, what remains to be done is for each and every one of us to go  to
the constituencies we represent and interact with and  to  tell  them  about
the  message  of  the  President.  Ke  a  leboga  Ngiyabonga.  [Thank  you.]
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, that concludes the debate. However, I  want
to remind you  that  the  Minister  has  indicated  that  the  Promotion  of
National Unity and Reconciliation Act provides  for  a  joint  committee  to
consider matters referred to it in terms of the  Act.  This  committee  will
now be constituted to take matters  further  and  specifically  to  consider
recommendations with regard to  reparations  for  victims,  as  required  by
section 27 of the legislation.

We need now to speedily  give  consideration  to  the  proposals  that  were
presented to us earlier  by  the  President.  The  presiding  officers  will
constitute the joint committee as soon as possible and mandate it to  submit
its report as soon as we return from recess.

The Speaker adjourned the Joint Sitting at 19:03.
