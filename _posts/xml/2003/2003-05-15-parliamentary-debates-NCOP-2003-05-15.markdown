                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, at the next sitting of this House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the -


       (a)  Minister of Health, Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, has  failed  to
           endorse a general antiretroviral  treatment  plan  for  HIV/Aids
           sufferers in the  face  of  a  Treasury  and  Health  department
           report, stating that providing these drugs  is  the  most  cost-
           effective way of combating the Aids pandemic;


       (b)  constant ducking and diving of  the  Health  Minister  continues
           while the litany of disaster of HIV and Aids continues to grow;


       (c)  Minister's tenure of office has assumed  the  proportions  of  a
           national disaster and is an international embarrassment  to  our
           country;


  (2) appeals to the Cabinet to overrule this Minister and  to  accept  and
       implement the report; and


  (3) calls upon the President to replace her forthwith with  someone  more
       sensitive and more capable.

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move  at  the  next  sitting  of  the
Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) supports and embraces the importance and significance of  today,  the
       occasion of the 9th anniversary of the United  Nations  International
       Family Day, which is a prelude to United Nations  International  Year
       of the Family, marking the 10th anniversary next year;


  (2) acknowledges and pays tribute to those thousands of people and family
       members  gathered  in  Soshanguve,  at  the  Boikhutsong  (Block   T)
       Community Hall today to celebrate this event and those who helped  to
       organise the event, namely the Department of Social Development,  the
       Family and Marriage Association of SA, Miss  South  Africa  and  Soul
       City;


  (3) on this day, heeds the appeal by  the  Minister  for  all  of  us  to
       strengthen family bonds as one of the key  challenges  in  the  fight
       against poverty, HIV/Aids and other social ills; and


  (4) acknowledges that the family is the bedrock on which society is built
       and recognises that in order for good values to develop, we all  need
       to work  together  in  partnership  as  communities,  civil  society,
       business, labour and NGOs to make sure that  we  strengthen  families
       for a better life for all our people but especially our children.

                       A MODERN-DAY WOLRAAD WOLTEMADE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel graag 'n voorstel sonder kennisgewing:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy innige waardering en dank uitspreek teenoor mnr Len  Slabbert,  'n
       hedendaagse Wolraad Woltemade,  vir  die  heldedaad  wat  hy  met  sy
       medewerkers onder tragiese omstandighede  verrig  het  deur  8  mense
       tydens die afgryslike  ramp  by  die  Saulspoortdam  van  'n  gewisse
       watergraf te red;


  (2) met waardering erkenning gee aan die navolgenswaardige voorbeeld  wat
       hy met dié daad aan ons almal gestel het dat daar nie wit of swart of
       bruin mense in Suid-Afrika is nie, maar dat ons almal  net  medemense
       van mekaar is wat onderlinge medemenslikheid, deernis en naasteliefde
       verdien; en


  (3) voorts erkenning gee aan die klein maar só belangrike rol wat sy daad
       en optrede gespeel het, en in die  toekoms  nog  sal  speel,  in  die
       proses om ons as mede-Afrikane steeds nader aan mekaar  te  bring  en
       ons goddelike plig van naasteliefde teenoor mekaar na te kom.

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its deepest  appreciation  and  gratitude  towards  Mr  Len
       Slabbert, a modern day Wolraad Woltemade,  for  the  heroic  deed  he
       performed with his co-workers under tragic  circumstances  by  saving
       eight people from a certain watery grave during the horrific disaster
       at the Saulspoort Dam;


  (2) acknowledges with appreciation the example that he has set for all of
       us with this deed, one worthy of imitation, showing  that  there  are
       not white or black or brown people in South Africa, but that  we  are
       all simply fellow human beings who deserve  mutual  common  humanity,
       compassion and neighbourly love; and


  (3) further acknowledges this small but very important role that his deed
       and actions played, and will  play  in  future,  in  the  process  of
       bringing us even  closer  to  one  another  as  fellow  Africans  and
       complying with our  divine  duty  of  neighbourly  love  towards  one
       another.]

                       PHASING OUT OF COMMANDO SYSTEM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat, na aanleiding van die President se  aankondiging  in
       sy amptelike Openingsrede  dat  aandag  geskenk  gaan  word  aan  die
       uitfasering van die SANW-kommandostelsel en  die  skep  van  'n  nuwe
       stelsel, daar groot kommer bestaan en die mening uitgespreek  is  dat
       'n sekuriteitsvakuum in landelike gebiede voorkom moet word;


  (2) voorts kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP -


       (a)  ná omvattende navorsing  en  oorlegpleging,  'n  beleidsvoorstel
           saamgestel en voorgelê het aan die Minister  van  Veiligheid  en
           Sekuriteit asook die Minister van Verdediging;


       (b)  die kundigheid van 'n prominente  lid  van  die  Suid-Afrikaanse
           Nasionale Weermag, brig-genl John de la Monte,  gebruik  het  om
           die beleid saam te stel;


       (c)  se voorstel vir 'n plaaslike polisiemag,  in  die  lig  van  die
           groot aantal plaasmoorde,  die  behoefte  aan  'n  doeltreffende
           landelike beveiligheidsplan aanpak;


       (d)  glo dat die skep van 'n Suid-Afrikaanse plaaslike polisiemag  'n
           logiese, effektiewe en bekostigbare alternatief vir die  huidige
           kommandostelsel is, dat alle  plaaslike  polisie-eenhede,  hetsy
           voltyds of deeltyds,  spesifiek  opgelei  moet  word  vir  hulle
           dubbele rol en dat sekere eenhede toegerus en opgelei moet  word
           vir buite-area-beskermingswerk in oorlogstyd; en


  (3)  die  hoop  uitspreek  dat  die  beleidsvoorstel  vir  'n   plaaslike
       polisiemag sal bydra tot 'n konstruktiewe debat oor die transformasie
       van die kommando's.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that, following the President's announcement  in  his  official
       Opening Address that attention is to be  given  to  phasing  out  the
       SANDF commando system and creating a new system, great concern exists
       and that the opinion has been expressed that  a  security  vacuum  in
       rural areas must be avoided;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  after comprehensive research and consultation, the  New  NP  has
           compiled a policy proposal and submitted it to the  Minister  of
           Safety and Security and the Minister of Defence;


       (b)  the New NP made use of the expertise of a  prominent  member  of
           the SA National Defence Force, Brig-Gen John  de  la  Monte,  to
           compile the policy;


       (c)  in the light of the large number of farm murders, the  New  NP's
           proposal for a constabulary addresses the need for an  effective
           rural safety plan;


       (d)  the New NP  believes  that  the  creation  of  a  South  African
           constabulary is a logical, effective and affordable  alternative
           to the current commando system, that all constabulary units,  be
           they full-time or part-time, must be  specifically  trained  for
           their dual role and that certain  units  must  be  equipped  and
           trained for protective work outside their usual scope  in  times
           of war; and


  (3) expresses the hope that the policy proposal for a  constabulary  will
       contribute towards a constructive debate on the transformation of the
       commandos.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the horrific act of triple suicide bombings carried out against
       the citizens of Riyadh by 15 suicide bombers;


  (2) regrets the loss of more innocent lives claimed  by  the  unspeakable
       acts of international terrorism;

       terror by ensuring co-ordinated efforts;


  (4) expresses its deepest condolences to the people of Saudi Arabia; and


  (5)  welcomes  the  Saudi  kingdom's  resolve  to  mete  out  appropriate
       punishment to the perpetrators.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, I rise to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the massacre in the DRC that claimed the lives  of
       a number of innocent people;


  (2) acknowledges the detrimental effect this massacre  can  have  on  the
       progress that has been made in resolving the DRC conflict peacefully;


  (3) believes this tragedy should not be allowed to derail our  commitment
       to the peaceful and speedy resolution of conflict in the DRC; and


  (4) confirms its commitment to continue to lend support to  the  DRC  and
       other countries on the continent  afflicted  by  internal  strife  to
       build  and  strengthen  dialogue  around  the  ongoing   process   of
       reconciliation, nation building and reconstruction.

          APPOINTMENT OF MS J L KGOALI AS CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, it is an honour  and  privilege,
on behalf of the Chairperson of the NCOP, to nominate  Ms  Joyce  Kgoali  as
Chairperson of the Council. We believe that Ms Kgoali  is  a  very  capable,
able and competent person and that her experience as a provincial  Whip  and
as a member familiar with this House, would  enable  her  to  discharge  her
responsibilities as Chairperson of Committees of  this  Council  in  a  very
responsible, effective and efficient manner. We wish her well.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I am not sure, Chief Whip. You said  you
nominated her as Chairperson of the NCOP.

The CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  COUNCIL:  ...  of  Committees.  I  nominate  her  as
Chairperson of Committees in the NCOP. We certainly do not want  a  coup  in
the absence of the Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I thought as much. That  is  why  I  was
correcting that.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 19 - Social Development:

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson,  hon
members, MECs, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, this Budget  Vote
debate of ours today takes place against the backdrop of critical  decisions
that were taken during  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  in
Johannesburg last year, to halve the world's poor by the year 2015. It  also
takes place when we  are  all  preparing  for  the  Growth  and  Development
Summit, which is to take place within three weeks in this country.

In my Budget Vote speech to the National Assembly this year  we  pledged  to
accelerate the  pace  of  delivery  of  social  development  programmes  and
grants, whilst empowering millions of our poor right  through  the  country.
Indeed, the vulnerable of  our  society  and  particularly  children,  older
persons, people with disabilities, people  infected  with  and  affected  by
HIV/Aids and other diseases do  need  that  intervention.  These  vulnerable
sectors of our population are, more than  ever  before,  beginning  to  feel
that the Government is indeed taking bold steps  to  make  them  masters  of
their own destiny. I did also reiterate that children  must  come  first  in
all that we do.

Today we also celebrate the 9th anniversary of the International Day of  the
Family. This prelude to the 10th anniversary will be celebrated  across  the
world next year as the International Year of the Family.  This  should  mark
the  beginning  of  our  journey  to  realise  social  integration   through
strengthened family units and accompanying social infrastructure.

As I speak to you today, hundreds of families are  gathered  in  Soshanguve,
in the City of Tshwane, and many other parts of South  Africa.  They  gather
to reaffirm our commitment  to  ensuring  that  the  family  and  vulnerable
groups  are  placed  at  the  centre  of  development  strategies   in   our
programmes. Many families are under pressure to  cope  with  the  impact  of
poverty, HIV/Aids, unemployment and other social  ills,  and  these  have  a
devastating  impact  on  the  most  vulnerable  members  of   our   society,
especially children. In this regard it is the  duty  of  the  Government  in
general and our department in particular, as well as our society,  to  reach
out and assist. It is from this perspective that our theme  today  and  this
year is ``Building a social contract to strengthen families and  communities
for a better life for our children''.

This approach is at the centre of the moral regeneration of our society  and
is the premise of addressing many of the social challenges  confronting  our
society, including those currently confronting children themselves.

Strengthening of organs of civil society is important  for  accelerated  but
sustained development. We will therefore  endeavour  to  work  more  closely
with nongovernmental organisations to meet the needs  of  our  people.  This
will be complimented by the employment of a cadre of  community  development
workers who will be deployed to work directly  with  the  communities  after
training.

It  is  our  belief  that  strong  families  are  a  foundation  for  strong
communities and strong communities are a foundation  for  stronger  nations,
and stronger nations are nations that will be fit  for  children  and  their
development. We'll therefore intensify our programmes to support the  family
in our communities.

I take this opportunity  to  thank  the  members  of  this  House  who  have
travelled the journey from welfare to social development  with  us.  I  also
thank the community  members  and  civil  society  organisations  that  have
maintained us on the path of ensuring that children are  put  first  in  all
that we do as a country.

Following the presidential address in February this  year,  I'm  pleased  to
announce that an additional 1 million children below the age  of  nine  will
now be able to access social grants. The grant will  be  extended  to  those
between the ages of nine and  ten  in  the  year  2004.  We  will  therefore
progressively over the next three years increase the  coverage  to  children
up to the age of fourteen. I want to say that we aim at ensuring  that  each
and every child gets a grant, and a child to us is everybody under  the  age
of eighteen. [Applause.]

I must, however, express my concern that not  all  children  who  should  be
receiving grants do indeed receive them. This is true for  all  grant  types
targeting children, including the foster care and  care  dependency  grants,
which account  for  only  just  over  180  000  of  the  5,6  million  grant
recipients, which is far from the targeted numbers.

Staff shortages, inadequate infrastructure, inappropriate  skills  and  lack
of access to registration  centres  are  some  of  the  identified  critical
problems. To overcome these concerns we have begun our work with  provinces,
local authorities and the Departments of Education, Health and Home  Affairs
and  have  intensified  the  campaign  to  reach  out  to   all   qualifying
beneficiaries. Particular attention is being given to the  Eastern  Cape.  A
special task team has been established to assist the province.  I  am  happy
to announce that considerable progress is being made to benefit the  poorest
of the poor, specifically in that province.

We have also extended our arm  to  civil  society  organisations  that  have
assisted us in reaching rural areas and vulnerable groups. In  the  build-up
to the National Assembly Budget Vote I challenged trade unions to assist  us
in these efforts. I'm pleased to announce that owing to meetings  with  many
unions, including Nehawu, we are at the dawn of a revolutionary  partnership
to  extend  and  improve  service  delivery  to  the  poor  and   vulnerable
communities through the use of union members as  well  as  retired  persons,
members and volunteers.

Indications in our database show that nearly 2 million older people  receive
old age grants. This translates to about  98%  of  those  eligible  for  the
state old age grant. Thus our efforts, which included grant increases  above
the inflation rates over the years, have served to intensify  our  responses
to reducing the pain and ongoing suffering of our people,  especially  older
persons and people with disabilities.

The challenge that remains is to ensure dignified and  speedy  treatment  of
these groups  and  other  grant  beneficiaries  during  the  processing  and
payment  of  grants.  In  this  regard  we  have  developed  the  norms  and
standards. These involve setting up project management offices and  training
more than 2 000 officials in social  security  administration  and  customer
care.

Continuous improvement of our services is of paramount importance  and  this
cannot be achieved with the  current  limited  infrastructure,  particularly
the information management technology at our  disposal.  We  have  therefore
extended our arms to seek strategic partners who will be able to  assist  us
in the replacement of the  archaic  SOCPEN  system  so  as  to  improve  the
provision of social assistance.

The provision of social assistance grants  is  a  very  significant  poverty
alleviation  programme  of  Government.  For  this  purpose  we  require   a
different institutional arrangement that  focuses  on  this  initiative.  To
this end, as you  may  be  aware,  Cabinet  has  decided  to  establish  the
National Social Security Agency.  The  agency  would  be  a  specialist  and
focused institution  for  the  management,  administration  and  payment  of
social grants.

It is expected that the agency's  entry  will  simplify  social  development
budgets to the provinces. We are still experiencing unacceptable  conditions
of long queues, deaths during payouts and an  environment  where  there  are
loan sharks, which puts our old  citizens  in  further  vulnerability  while
they have to travel and walk long distances to get their grants. I must  say
that we need to work even harder with the  provinces  to  ensure  that  this
comes to a stop,  so  that  we  can  restore  the  dignity  of  our  elderly
citizens.

Co-operative governance is therefore a critical success factor  with  regard
to improving service delivery. As we continue to work with the provinces  in
the spirit of  co-operative  governance,  with  the  aim  of  extending  our
service, we are beginning to see the urgent need to also work  closely  with
local government.  Collaboration  with  local  government  ought  to  ensure
quick, easy, effective and efficient access to services by the citizens.

May I point out very, very clearly that the areas  with  the  most  problems
are mainly the former Bantustan areas. It is not only the Eastern  Cape,  as
such; basically all of them have the same problem.

One of the most critical areas of our work this year will be to  consolidate
our approach to a comprehensive social security system for  finalisation  in
the Cabinet lekgotla this year.
It is important to indicate that this approach is more  than  just  awarding
social grants; it constitutes - I  want  to  stress  that  -  a  package  of
services to those at risk or facing certain contingencies.

The Social Cluster is working towards consolidating the various elements  of
our comprehensive social security system for finalisation by Cabinet. And  I
would really appeal to members of this House  to  study  that  report  very,
very  well.  It  is  not  only  about  the  basic  income  grant.  It  is  a
comprehensive approach that touches almost all those grants that  are  being
given by Government as a whole. It is not easy to just give  everybody  R100
and they go away. There are thousands of  people  who  need  that  and  many
other services.

The impact of HIV/Aids and poverty and social exclusion on our  communities,
and children in particular, is devastating. In  many  cases  children  whose
parents  or  care-givers  have  died  of  HIV/Aids  are  left  to  care  for
themselves and their siblings. Consequently, these  children  cannot  attend
school or participate in recreational activities. Many  of  the  communities
continue to shun and marginalise families affected by the pandemic.

This year the department has been allocated R65,9 million to accelerate  the
expansion  of  the  home-based  and  community-based  care   programmes   in
partnership  with  NGOs,  community-based  organisations   and   faith-based
organisations. In the past we supported more  than  300  centres  which  are
targeting over 75 000 children and families  to  date.  Since  many  of  the
communities continue to  shun  and  marginalise  families  affected  by  the
epidemic, the department has set aside a substantial amount  of  its  budget
to cater for drop-in centres  and  soup  kitchens,  which  will  be  run  by
provincial departments  in  co-operation  with  community  organisations  in
order to care for children and those who are very, very frail.

To enhance our understanding and efficacies of HIV/Aids, our department  has
conducted  a  number  of  research  studies  in  this  area.  We  have  also
collaborated with other organisations, including the  Department  of  Health
and  Statistics  SA.  Simultaneously,  we  have  to  continue  building  the
capacity of  the  Government,  NGOs,  CBOs  and  FBOs  to  understand  these
research findings and use them in planning their intervention and  services.
In the past two years we have trained more than 1  500  Government  planners
through the Primary HIV/Aids capacity- building course. This course will  be
expanded to also include civil society.

In the National Assembly Budget Vote this year I asserted  that  our  attack
on poverty is underpinned by our desire to empower our people  in  order  to
extricate themselves from poverty.  To  this  end,  my  department  and  the
Government as a whole have been administering over R563 million since  1997,
which supports over 3 600 community-based projects. These projects  seek  to
rebuild and strengthen  the  community  asset  base,  whilst  ensuring  that
community-level social infrastructure is  enhanced,  vulnerable  groups  are
targeted and food insecurity is addressed.

In the next financial year, which  marks  the  final  year  of  the  Poverty
Relief Programme in its current form, the Department of  Social  Development
will receive and  will  be  managing  R71 million.  This  will  be  used  to
strengthen the existing poverty relief projects and  link  them  with  other
resources and agents of development.

Despite the significant gains we have  made,  there  are  still  challenges,
both at  programme  and  project  levels.  One  of  these  is  the  complete
isolation and exclusion of communities from assets and institutions such  as
land, banks, suppliers of certain services, markets and  skills  development
agents. These challenges require that we increase the  number  of  community
development  workers  and  improve  their  skills   base.   The   challenges
confronting the projects themselves may require greater flexibility  in  our
financing and development policies.

In order to mitigate the food crisis confronting millions of our  people  in
the country and subregion, the Government has allocated  over  R400  million
for each of the next three years, starting from 1 April 2003,  in  the  form
of the integrated food nutrition programme. The programme is led by the  hon
Minister of Agriculture, Thoko Didiza, and will provide relief  measures  to
vulnerable groups that cannot afford adequate and nutritious food  owing  to
poverty and escalating food prices. In order to support  this  programme  my
department has employed and seconded 36 officers to all the provinces.

The main beneficiaries of this programme will be children,  the  granny  and
female-headed households  and  the  households  of  those  affected  by  and
infected with HIV/Aids. Essentially the programme is initially  focusing  on
social facilitation and  the  distribution  of  food  parcels  to  the  most
vulnerable,  in  co-operation   with   the   provincial   departments,   the
Independent Development Trust, the National Development Agency and  a  range
of relief organisations. In future the provision of  food  parcels  will  be
complemented by the support of food production clusters and  initiatives  in
impoverished communities and households.
I take this opportunity thank you for, and seek  your  ongoing  support  in,
delivering this important programme. I further ask for  your  assistance  in
order to develop the programme in such a manner that it  can  be  a  vantage
point for community empowerment and stimulation of local economy.  But  more
importantly, we appeal to you to assist us in targeting those  families  and
those households that are entitled to this support.

Transformation of the legislative framework remains  an  important  part  in
ensuring that democracy in our country has real meaning to  the  vulnerable.
To this end, I am pleased to announce  that,  with  the  assistance  of  hon
members on the portfolio and select  committees,  the  following  Bills  are
being worked on and are close  to  completion:  firstly,  the  Comprehensive
Child Care Bill, that seeks to provide holistic protection  to  children  in
line with the socioeconomic rights enshrined in our Constitution;  secondly,
the Social Security Agency Bill, that has as its  object  the  establishment
of a national security agency that will be a specialist institution for  the
management and administration of  social  assistance  grants;  thirdly,  the
Social Assistance  Bill,  that  will  provide  for  a  national  legislative
framework to provide for the  rendering  of  social  assistance  and  social
relief of distress to persons in line with the  constitutional  requirements
of equal and equitable access;  the  Older  Persons  Bill,  which  seeks  to
protect  and  secure  the  dignity  of  older  persons;  and  the   National
Development  Agency  Amendment  Act,  which  has  formally  transferred  the
National Development Agency to my department. And the cumulative  effect  of
this and the above pieces of legislation  will  be  to  lay  the  basis  for
strengthened families, communities and civil society for a better  life  for
all, especially children.

Allocations to the provincial  Social  Development  budgets  have  increased
significantly over the Medium Term Expenditure Framework period, from  R19,4
billion in 1999-00 to R31,2 billion in the year 2002-03. This is  about  one
expression of our commitment to social development and poverty eradication.

I take this opportunity once again to thank all the members who assisted  us
to communicate and publicise social grants and our other services. I say  to
them all, Nangomso! Without your efforts we  would  not  have  reached  such
growth levels.

Whilst beneficiary numbers have almost doubled over  the  past  five  years,
the department's staff numbers have not increased. We cannot deliver on  our
mandate unless we have the  right  numbers  and  skills  at  the  points  of
delivery. With that I say, thank you. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS:  Thank  you,  Deputy  Chairperson.  Ministers,  MECs,  special
delegates  and  members,  I  firstly  want  to  take  this  opportunity   to
congratulate our new Chairperson of Committees  on  her  appointment.  She's
been very well aware of all the difficulties we've been facing and I'm  sure
she'll be able to assist us in trying to resolve many of them. It  is,  once
more, a privilege for me  to  rise  in  support  of  Vote  No  19  -  Social
Development.

One of the central themes of President  Thabo  Mbeki's  opening  address  to
Parliament in February this year was once again the theme  of  pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty. This is an  indication  that  poverty  alleviation
and  its  ultimate  eradication  is  amongst  the  top  priorities  of   our
Government and has been since 1994.

For those members who might not know, the President of the country  is  also
the President of the African National Congress. On the occasion of the  91st
anniversary of the ANC on 8 January of this year, I want to quote  what  the
President said:


  Central to our strategic goal is the realisation of the objective of  the
  eradication of poverty. With the eradication of  poverty  as  our  urgent
  task we must at the same time advance  continuously  towards  the  social
  transformation  of  our  country  through  a  concerted   programme   for
  reconstruction and development.

Over the past years the mandate of the Department of Social Development  has
been expanding, as the Minister has said, to include playing a  bigger  role
in the establishment of income-generating opportunities for  the  poor,  the
driving of  short-term  food  relief  and  caring  for  those  infected  and
affected by HIV and Aids to  the  support  of  home-based  care  programmes.
Therefore, in the context of the high prevalence  of  poverty  country-wide,
these  areas  of  support  are  critical  to  the  protection  of  the  most
vulnerable in our society.

The introduction of  the  child  support  grant  in  1997  and  the  further
extension of the age limitation from 7 to 14  years  from  April  this  year
means that the safety net has been extended  considerably.  This  should  be
recognised as one of the major achievements of  this  democratic  Government
to date. This extension of the safety net brings the total number of  social
grant beneficiaries to 5,6 million in March this year.  The  majority,  over
2,5 million, are the recipients of the child support grant.

It is further reflected in Table 6.3 of the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review
where the provincial expenditure on social  grants  are  tabulated.  Limpopo
tops the list with 89,1%, followed by the Eastern Cape and  Mpumalanga  with
88,3% and 81,0% respectively for the current financial year. An  average  of
85,8% of provincial budgets are allocated and will be spent  on  the  social
grants for this year, and of course this  average  will  increase  over  the
medium-term period. With the levels of poverty increasing continuously,  the
growth in numbers of beneficiaries is  set  to  accelerate  further  in  the
coming years with an estimated 25,8% rise by 2005-06.

However, there is one big challenge that we need to  look  at,  and  I  have
discussed this with the Minister as  well.  Those  children  who  have  been
orphaned, who are under the age of 18  and  who  cannot  actually  apply  in
their own capacity for anyone of  the  social  assistance  grants,  are  the
children that fall outside the safety nets. These are the children  who  are
mostly found on the street corners, and because they  are  hungry  they  are
then vulnerable to a whole range of abuse and exploitation.

The widened safety net called for the most  efficient  service  delivery  in
the administration of these grants. In various provinces unfortunately  this
still remains an area of weakness. I'm  therefore  glad  to  note  Cabinet's
approval in principle of the establishment of a national  public  entity  to
take over the function of grant administration and delivery. I believe  this
will in a big way  strengthen  the  department's  capacity  to  support  and
monitor the delivery of social grants.

I do not want to dwell much on the rands and cents of  the  budget  at  this
point. I think our  special  delegates  and  our  MECs  who  are  here  will
probably go into that in detail and I think our colleagues in  the  National
Assembly have done so adequately as well.

As part of our preparation for this debate we had a day-long interaction  on
Tuesday with various provinces focusing on provincial  priorities,  spending
patterns and challenges. Unfortunately not all provinces could  attend,  but
we had submissions from the  Eastern  Cape,  we  had  submissions  from  the
Western Cape, Limpopo, North West and Mpumalanga. Amongst  the  most  common
priority areas that emerged were, firstly,  poverty  alleviation;  secondly,
access to social security; and, thirdly, the issue of service delivery.

Spending patterns by and large follow these priorities. However, it  is  the
challenge that I want to focus on - the challenges that  came  out  of  that
day-long interaction - and largely there  are  three  main  challenges  that
came to the fore. Firstly, the issue of human resource  capacity;  secondly,
interdepartmental collaboration; and, thirdly, fraudulent access  to  social
security.

With regard to human resource capacity, I want to mention that I myself,  as
a woman, am in a position of  responsibility  towards  the  voters  of  this
country. I can tell you that I would not be able to perform to the  best  of
my ability if I did not have the human resource capacity both  at  work  and
at home. I think all of us can attest to that. We would not be  seated  here
if we did not have the necessary support around us. The same could  be  said
for Government and in particular the Department of  Social  Development.  In
order for us to deliver on our commitments, we need to have warm  bodies  or
person power to do so.

According to national norms and standards, the ratio  of  social  worker  to
population is said to  be  1:5  000.  In  the  Eastern  Cape  the  ratio  is
presently 1: 13 000. The province currently operates on  49%  of  its  total
human  resource  capacity.  Mpumalanga  indicated  that  they  have  1   000
vacancies in their department at the moment.  The  only  deduction  one  can
make from these statistics  is  that  service  delivery  has  been  dealt  a
serious blow. If one notes that Mpumalanga and the Eastern  Cape  are  among
the poorest provinces, with vast rural areas, then what are we saying  about
pushing back the frontiers of poverty, particularly for the most  vulnerable
in our society?

The  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  highlights  the  fact  that   poorer
provinces have a higher distribution of  pensioners,  disabled  persons  and
young children. These are also the  categories  of  people  who  are  mostly
dependent on  social  security  and  other  services  which  the  department
renders. Mr Minister, the notion of a leaner Public Service might,  in  this
instance, not hold water. Looking at the task and responsibility at hand,  I
firmly believe that there should  not  be  a  blanket  application  of  this
notion. It would be a sad day if we went to the polls next  year,  10  years
into our democracy, and our grandparents, the disabled  and  children  could
not access benefits because departments did not  have  warm  bodies  or  the
person power to process applications timeously.

On interdepartmental collaboration, I know that this  is  not  a  debate  on
Home Affairs, but unfortunately Home Affairs features very prominently  when
it comes to the work  that  Social  Development  does.  Particularly  social
security grants depend largely on delivery from Home  Affairs  in  terms  of
ID's and birth certificates. This is one department  that  none  of  us  can
escape. It governs our lives from the day that we enter into this  world  up
to the day that we depart from this world. If those in need do not have  the
necessary documentation like ID's and birth certificates they would  not  be
able to access  the  services  available  from  Government  departments  and
especially Social Development. Even if the Minister has  all  the  resources
and capacity to deliver on his Constitutional mandate, we will not  be  able
to do so as citizens of  this  country  if  we  cannot  positively  identify
ourselves. Here, once again, the issue of human resources comes into play.

I was unofficially informed that there are in the region  of  1  800  vacant
posts in the Department of Home Affairs. This  department  is  unfortunately
also jokingly referred to as the Department of Actors, or Hollywood,  as  it
is called. Many of the middle and senior  management  positions  are  acting
personnel. The end result of  this  is  that  no  one  can  really  be  held
accountable for any actions taken or not taken. We  need  to  ask  ourselves
the question: Who suffers? The categories of people we  have  identified  as
the most vulnerable are  the  ones  who  suffer,  namely  the  elderly,  the
disabled, women and children. During our visits last  year  to  the  Eastern
Cape and this year to the  North  West,  all  our  colleagues  were  present
there. All  the  questions  that  were  posed  were  largely  posed  to  the
Department of Home Affairs because people  could  not  access  the  services
from Social Development. They did not have the relevant  documentation.  One
would actually urge the Minister to have a sit-down, not over a cup  of  tea
but probably a pot of tea, to look at this matter. [Interjections.]

The third challenge is fraudulent access to  social  security.  Through  our
province's provincial visits and interaction  with  our  colleagues  in  the
legislatures  it  has  been  reported  that  some  people  are  fraudulently
accessing our social security services. Mothers may register more  than  one
child, while some of them are renting their children out to  other  families
and so on. This we need to really look at. I think we will agree that  these
cases of fraudulent use  of  access  to  social  security  are  denying  the
genuinely deserving people of a livelihood. I also  do  not  think  that  we
will be able to rid ourselves of the fraudulent occurrences  overnight,  but
I certainly believe that we can  minimise  the  incidence  substantially  by
exploring ways in which our information systems can talk to each  other.  As
an example I want  to  mention  the  Home  Affairs  National  Identification
System, which is simply called Hanis.

This point again  takes  us  back  to  interdepartmental  collaboration.  We
cannot begin to dream of success  as  Government  if  different  departments
operate as islands and do not share information and  strategies.  These  are
challenges we have identified, and all of us should  be  putting  our  heads
together to see how best to confront and defeat these. One must commend  the
establishment of Cabinet clusters, which was done a long time  ago,  because
it does go a long way in  facilitating  co-operation  for  service  delivery
between Government departments, and especially the social cluster.

In conclusion I would like to thank the  department,  under  the  very  able
political leadership of Minister Skweyiya and the  acting  Director-General,
Mr Madonsela, and his staff for their constant availability  and  assistance
to the committee, as well as the provinces who responded to our  invitations
and hosted us when we visited them, our parliamentary staff  and,  last  but
most definitely not least, the thousands  of  civil  servants  staffing  our
desks and offices who have dedicated  themselves  to  service  to  the  most
vulnerable citizens of our society, many a time under poor conditions.  Some
of us have visited some of these offices. To them I want to say:  We  salute
you. Without you we would not be able  to  create  a  better  life  for  our
people. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N MOERANE (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, members of the House, the  Eastern
Cape rises in support of the budget. I am not going to reinvent  the  report
as the hon chairperson spoke at length  about  it.  Rather,  my  input  will
highlight the most important things that affect the Eastern  Cape  and  some
that are unique to it at this time.

In terms of the previous financial year's budget, our focus in  the  Eastern
Cape - in an attempt to push back the frontiers of poverty  -  has  been  on
the children, the poor, the physically  challenged  and  the  aged.  Through
that process and with the budget that we have been given,  we  have  managed
to have a grant intake in terms of the various social security categories.

With regard to the old age category, from March 2002 to March 2003 we had  a
minor jump, as we initially had an intake of 400 222, which  by  March  2003
had increased to 410 000, an increase of 10 227. In terms of the  disability
intake, we moved from 140 000 to 225 000, the  increase  being  85  622.  In
terms of the child support grant, the figure grew from 101 000  to  463 000,
an increase of 352 366. With regard to the foster care grant, we  grew  from
6 619 to 16 317, the increase being 9 698. In terms of the  care  dependency
grant, we moved from
6 350 to 12 120 - so we doubled that figure.

There  have  also  been  major  improvements  in  social  security   as   we
established help desks to render, mainly, the  payment  of  and  an  enquiry
service for the  most  problematic  paypoints.  We  bought  83  laptops  and
utilised them throughout all the districts. We  also  intensified  education
to educate people about  the  importance  of  the  various  social  security
grants, making sure that they were accessible to all the people,  especially
in the remote areas. In this regard, we  embarked  on  a  massive  programme
through the Soul City bashes at which children were  registered  for  social
grants.

Through the Department of Education and the director  for  social  security,
we embarked on weekly talk shows on popular radio stations. We also  ensured
that thousands of leaflets  and  brochures  were  circulated  all  over  the
province. We held imbizos in various villages.  We  also  had  mobile  teams
registering eligible beneficiaries,  and  we  did  this  jointly  with  Home
Affairs.

In terms of the  child  support  campaign,  the  increase,  as  I  indicated
earlier, has allowed 114  269  children  to  be  registered  and  they  have
received payment since then. We have had a number of challenges.  Some  have
been mentioned, although I would like to  mention  the  challenge  regarding
identification  in  the  form  of  the  birth  certificate,  especially  for
orphanage kids. This does not allow those that are eligible to have  access.
There are also those that are over the age of nine, who have no one to  lean
on until the age of 18. That is still a challenge for us.

There are a number of NGOs and churches that are looking after them, but  we
have no way of assisting. Maybe we need a policy directive in terms  of  how
best to tackle this. Also, in terms of the challenges,  one  of  them  which
has been highlighted is the brain  drain  of  human  resources.  People  are
migrating to well-endowed areas in the former Transvaal and some  are  going
overseas, but I don't think this is a problem that is unique to us alone.

In terms of fraud cases, we are doing our level best  to  clean  up,  and  I
think all of you bear testimony to that. The  unique  fact  about  fraud  is
that it  is  committed  not  only  by  civil  servants  or  members  of  the
community, but also by professionals in this field  -  lawyers,  nurses  and
some teachers - those who benefit in terms of the child support grant.

There is also the small misunderstanding of people who  are  civil  servants
who get both the social grant and the  civil  pension.  So,  there  is  that
problem  as  well.  In  terms  of  infrastructural  development,   we   have
progressed as the Eastern Cape province to ensure that the  service  we  are
rendering is accessible to everybody.

We went to 24 functional districts and inserted cables  for  data  capturing
in all of them. However, we have problems in terms of office  accommodation.
We have resorted to buying park homes, but they become problematic  if  they
are hit by a moving vehicle. For this financial year we are  still  focusing
on the same target group, with minor additions.

We are now focusing not only on children, women and the youth, but  also  on
people who are infected with and affected by HIV. This number is  constantly
increasing, and you may want to know why that is so.

When it comes to the province and national statistics, in terms  of  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty through  social  security,  the  poverty  rate
amongst children in the Eastern Cape is 72%  at  the  moment.  In  terms  of
infant mortality, the rate is 49%. The Alfred Nzo and O  R  Tambo  districts
are the poorest. As a result  of  this,  and  in  terms  of  our  provincial
priorities, we  are  going  to  focus  on  infrastructural  development  and
accelerate public service delivery this financial year. We  also  felt  that
we needed to make sure that, in pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty,  we
focused on the eradication of poverty and on public service transformation.

On the latter, we are hoping to reduce the numbers in terms of  both  social
security and mainstream social welfare, because we still have the  challenge
of balancing the two in order to make sure that in the percentage  break  we
have a ratio of 80:20. At the moment it is above 80%, or near 90%, which  is
not a healthy situation. Through these fraud interventions we are hoping  to
reduce the number to an 80:20 split.
Regarding poverty eradication in this financial year, we have an  amount  of
R97,992 million to ensure that the key programmes are funded. We  are  going
to  fund  20  women  co-operatives,  20  dual-purpose  programmes,  18  food
security  programmes,  10  HIV/Aids  programmes,  and   one   youth   skills
development programme through urban renewal. However,  in  partnership  with
other agencies, we are going to do more than that.

Regarding, specifically, the national food emergency programme,  we  are  in
partnership  with  the  Department  of  Health  and   the   departments   of
agriculture and education in the province in terms of  which  we  are  doing
various things.  For  us,  as  a  department,  we  are  going  to  focus  on
agricultural starter packs, and for that  we  have  granted  R19,5  million,
which comprises 20,8% of our total budget of R97 million.

We are also going to fund drop-in centres and soup kitchens  in  the  amount
of R2,4 million - food supplements for HIV/Aids and TB patients.  An  amount
of R2,4 million has been set aside and that amounts  to  R94,1  million.  In
terms of HIV/Aids, in particular, an amount of R7,234 million has  been  set
aside for the care and support of those who are infected with  and  affected
by HIV/Aids to make sure  that  they  are  protected  and  that  the  social
services for orphans and vulnerable children are supported. As  a  component
of that, we are going to finance community-based home care in the amount  of
R6,6 million.

However, we are faced with a number of  challenges,  one  of  which  I  have
mentioned already, namely the orphanage kids. We also have the challenge  of
extending the number of NIP sites. Currently, we  have  six  sites,  and  we
want to move beyond that to cover all the  districts  if  we  can,  although
there are limitations. However, in partnership with  other  departments,  we
think this is possible if we focus on our different roles.

In terms of HIV/Aids finances, there is the capacity-building  component  of
home-based carers, as I have mentioned. We also need to make  sure  that  we
harmonise the funding within the budget framework.

We also have the challenge in the Eastern Cape of improving social  security
administration. We are striving for perfection  in  this,  and  I  think  in
terms of the turnaround we are going to make it. We already  have  a  target
of 35 days to process applications, and that is achievable.  But  there  are
districts that can ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  Your  speaking
time has expired, hon member.

Ms N MOERANE (Eastern Cape): Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Thank you, Chairperson, hon  Minster,  hon  MECs,  colleagues.
Chairperson, please afford me a minute to congratulate Joyce Kgoali  on  her
election as Chair of Chairs. I just want to tell her that we  are  going  to
watch her. She should be a good referee now. [Laughter.]

As we all  know,  the  social  development  sector  supports  the  poor  and
vulnerable through  direct  income  support  and  social  welfare  services.
Grants are administered by the provinces, with  the  actual  payment  taking
place through agents.

My province is often referred to  as  the  poorest,  the  most  problematic,
where  bad  administration  and  non-delivery  are  the  rule  and  not  the
exception.

A delegation from the Eastern Cape legislature gave us a very promising  and
positive fiscal review and developmental priorities for  social  development
in the province. According to that, the paperwork has been done and  we  are
now waiting for implementation.

In the context of the high prevalence of poverty, exacerbated by the  impact
of HIV/Aids, we need all the support to protect  our  society.  The  Eastern
Cape  delegation  reported  that   ten   HIV/Aids   programmes   have   been
implemented, and that the budget allocation has been increased - still  just
a drop in the ocean, but at least we are moving. I thank you for that.

The extension of  the  child  support  to  older  children  is  particularly
laudable. My party has often pleaded for this extension  and  by  2006  poor
children up to their 14th birthday will qualify  for  grants.  However,  hon
Minister, we have this poverty age gap from 14 years to 60.  This  situation
is untenable. A basic income grant is the only way to close  this  country's
huge poverty gap. To see the introduction of a basic income grant,  will  be
a victory for those who really care about the poorest of the  poor.  Let  us
see this as the next challenge in pushing back the frontiers,  not  only  of
poverty but of hunger!

As I said before, hon Minister, Eastern  Cape  has  received  much  negative
publicity in the news, especially when it comes  to  the  payout  system  of
pensions. During the months of January and  February  2003,  at  least  four
pensioners died while waiting in the line to receive their pension.

We, the select committee, went on an oversight visit  to  the  Eastern  Cape
and found that the Department of Social Development outsourced  the  payment
of pensions to two companies, Allpay and Cash Paymaster Services, or CPS.

Allpay focused on the western half of the province,  and  CPS  serviced  the
former Transkei region. Allpay and CPS were awarded the R180 million  three-
year  contract.   Both   companies   use   a   computerised   system   using
``smartcards'' which were  devised  for  easy  use  and  increased  security
purposes.

As we know the National Department of Social  Development  developed  social
security norms and standards, which  all  provinces  have  to  comply  with.
These  norms  and  standards  take  on  board  the  Batho  Pele  principles.
According to these principles, pensioners should not  have  to  travel  more
than five kilometres to  the  nearest  payout  point.  These  payout  points
should have toilet facilities, running water, seating and  shelter,  and  no
beneficiary should wait more than two hours for  his  or  her  grant  to  be
paid.
Let me say at the outset, in the Eastern Cape these norms and standards  are
still lacking. We  still  have  these  very  long  queues  of  beneficiaries
waiting for hours to receive their grants. We do understand the vastness  of
the province, and the negative impact this travelling distance  has  on  the
ability to deliver an efficient service.

There are, however, things lacking and those need to  be  attended  to.  The
following  problems  need  urgent   attention:   incomplete   enrolment   of
beneficiaries - some important personal details are missing  on  application
forms; departmental backlog in processing procurators - people  who  collect
grants on behalf of beneficiaries; failure in areas in forwarding  lists  of
frail  beneficiaries,  resulting  in   those   beneficiaries   unnecessarily
standing  in  queues;  shortage  of  critical  staff  in   the   department;
availability of laptops with beneficiary information for help  desks  -  but
thank you, MEC, as you said those were in  operation,  well  done;  and  the
review of ID documentation of potential beneficiaries, especially  from  the
former Transkei and Ciskei.
Other problems include: poor facilities at payout points, for  example  lack
of ablution facilities, shelter, etc; failure to  adhere  to  the  principle
that payout points should not exceed the  1  000  beneficiaries  per  payout
point;  poor  water  provision  resulting  in  water  sellers  charging  for
drinking water, and enterprising neighbours charging for the  use  of  their
toilets; and poor crowd control and insufficient  security  at  some  payout
points, leading to the intimidation of beneficiaries from micro-lenders  and
others. We suggest that there should be  visible  deployment  of  police  at
payout points.

Hon Minister, the issue of  microlenders  at  pension  payout  points  needs
urgent attention. Are they registered with SARS?  Are  they  regulated?  Are
there guidelines on the maximum amount of interest that may  be  charged  to
loan applicants? This matter  should  be  investigated.  The  harassment  of
these poor people must stop!

We need a full-time commitment by all  stakeholders,  and  especially  those
who hold the  purse  strings,  to  implement  systematically  an  integrated
programme where the social cluster, as a collective,  delivers  services  to
the communities in need.

Friswell once  said,  and  I  quote:  ``Poverty  makes  people  satirical  -
soberly, sadly, bitterly satirical.''

Hon Minister, you are devoted to your job, and  my  party  salutes  you  for
that. South Africa needs more than a good Minister.  You  should  strive  to
get your counterparts in the provinces, and their administrations,  to  your
level. Then,  and  only  then,  will  we  succeed  in  not  having  bitterly
satirical people in our country. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr E NOE (Free State): Chairperson, hon Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,
MECs, members of the NCOP, ladies  and  gentlemen,  granted  and  given  the
shortcomings that have been outlined by the members who spoke before me  and
the Minister, I think we should be grateful that when we look  back  we  can
be full of pride that the Government of the ANC  has  not  disappointed  the
majority of the people who have put it into power to transform this  country
and bring about a better life  for  all.  The  budget  statement  which  the
Minister has just tabled  attests  to  the  fact  that  the  battle  against
poverty is won.

Evidence has proved beyond reasonable doubt  that  the  poverty  alleviation
programmes introduced by Government have indeed given  South  Africans  hope
for the future, because many of the most vulnerable  of  our  people  -  the
elderly, children and people with disabilities who benefit from  the  social
security grants - are able to provide for their  own  basic  needs  such  as
food, clothing and shelter.

It is worth mentioning and also reminding this House that the Free State  is
the second poorest province in the country. Hence it has benefited from  the
Presidential Lead Projects whereby certain areas were  identified  as  nodal
points because of their high level of poverty.

Drawing from the national and provincial focus to  the  improvement  of  the
social security service delivery system central to our  challenge  has  been
to make social security services more accessible and available to people  in
rural and informal settlements, in line with the  norms  and  standards.  In
this regard,  the  department  has  embarked  on  a  number  of  programmes,
including upgrading the systems and procedures in the  provision  of  social
security grants. In presenting an input on  the  Free  State  today,  may  I
begin by stating that the tide has indeed  turned.  We  remain  focused  and
united in our belief that the widespread poverty  in  the  midst  of  global
prosperity is both unsustainable and morally unacceptable.

The department's core functions are poverty alleviation,  development,  care
and protection of the vulnerable. The key provincial policy priorities  are:
improving service delivery  by  improving  the  existing  system  of  social
security; transformation of other welfare services by improving the  quality
and equity of service  delivery,  capacity  and  governance  of  the  social
service sector; mitigating the negative impact  of  HIV/Aids  and  expanding
the  home-based  care  and  HIV/Aids  programme;  reducing  poverty  through
integrated sustainable development by  specifically  prioritising  the  most
vulnerable groups;  responding  to  the  brutal  effects  of  all  forms  of
violence against women and children;  rebuilding  families  and  communities
through policies and programmes empowering the young, old  and  disabled  to
promote social integration; lastly, a commitment  to  corporate  governance,
which  includes  working  with  different  tiers  of  Government  and  civil
society.

The social security programme is central to the  provision  of  safety  nets
for the most vulnerable groups, namely children, women,  older  persons  and
people with  disabilities.  This  department  is  constantly  improving  the
social security system in order to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty  by
making grants accessible to eligible beneficiaries,  particularly  those  in
the rural areas.

In response to President Mbeki's call last year to register all  people  who
are eligible for social grants,  the  Free  State  officially  launched  its
campaign to increase the uptake of social pensions and  grants  at  Roadside
Farm in the Thabo Mofutsanyana district in August 2002. At the  launch,  the
MEC for Social Development appealed to all Free Staters  to  put  our  heads
and hands together in crafting a viable  and  winning  strategy  that  would
ensure maximum access to the social security  system.  A  positive  response
was received from the  following  stakeholders,  who  have  made  invaluable
contributions in giving  support.  They  include  our  Departments  of  Home
Affairs, of Health and of Education, municipalities,  the  Soul  City  drama
series, and the Alliance  for  Children's  Rights  to  Social  Security,  or
Access. I won't read the whole list. Together  with  these  stakeholders  we
have managed to increase the number of  grant  beneficiaries  by  more  than
20%.

The biggest increase has been in the following grant types,  as  at  14  May
2003. In the old age category there are 122 352 beneficiaries  and  we  have
already spent R84 million. In disability there are 7 579  beneficiaries  and
we have  spent  R55  million.  Regarding  foster  care,  there  are  15  394
beneficiaries and we have spent R7 million. In the care dependency  category
there are 2 560 and we  have  spent  R1,7  million.  With  regard  to  child
support grants from 0 to 6 years, there are 153 455 and we  have  spent  R24
million, while those of ages ranging from 7 to 8 years number 8 842  and  we
have spent R1,3 million.

In rolling out the multidisciplinary assessment panel  for  care  dependency
and disability grants, due to  the  success  of  the  two  pilot  disability
assessment panels, provision has been made for an additional  seven  panels,
which are being rolled out with effect from April  2003.  An  amount  of  R3
million has been allocated for  this  current  financial  year  towards  the
upgrading of payout points in  ensuring  that  beneficiaries  receive  their
grants in a safe and conducive environment.

Regarding  the  professionalisation  of  social   security   staff   through
multiskilled training which includes computer literacy, customer care and  a
one-year social security course,  this  remains  a  high  priority  for  the
department. Funds have been made available for this purpose.

We cannot but overemphasise the casual link between poverty and HIV/Aids  in
our communities, which creates a vicious cycle  threatening  our  dreams  of
achieving a better life for all. More  and  more  people  are  plunged  into
poverty, children  are  deprived  of  care  and  protection,  with  families
increasingly deprived and disempowered by the scourge of HIV/Aids.

The social security programme remains the live wire safety net that will  go
a long way towards improving the lot of care-givers  and  extended  families
in their quest to provide care and support to their  next  of  kin.  Key  to
this  challenge  is  our  ability  to   mobilise   communities   and   civil
organisations to intensify our efforts against the spread  of  the  epidemic
and to redirect its impact.

The integrated  food  security  programme  has  a  two-pronged  strategy  of
distributing food parcels for a period of three months and the provision  of
cost-effective starter packs and support services  from  the  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs. This integrated  food  security  programme  is
driven by the cluster departments consisting of the  Departments  of  Social
Development, of Health, of Agriculture and Land Affairs and of Education.

This programme is led by the Department of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,
while other stakeholders such as  local  government,  municipalities,  NGOs,
CBOs and faith-based organisations are also involved in  the  identification
of beneficiaries and the monitoring of the  distribution  of  food  parcels.
The province is currently busy with the second phase of the distribution  of
30 000 food parcels and the final phase is scheduled  for  the  end  of  May
2003.

Due to the limited time allocated to this input, the  provincial  department
of social development will be in a position  to  provide  more  details  and
further information about when we interact with our counterparts. Lastly,  I
want to welcome the statement  made  by  the  Minister  that  he  is  indeed
succeeding in bringing on board the trade unions and getting civil  servants
to pull up their socks. I think that this is one critical area we  must  not
shy away from in ensuring that our civil servants do respond.

During our constituency week,  when  we  visit  offices,  we  sometimes  get
really embarrassed. I want to make  reference  to  the  situation  which  is
problematic where social workers within municipalities are not working  hand
in hand with the social workers in the  department.  That  creates  problems
for the communities, who will not  know  where  to  draw  the  line.  Social
workers in the municipalities are not responsive enough and we need  to  pay
serious attention to this. We support the budget. [Applause.]

Mnr F ADAMS: Mnr die Adjunkvoorsitter, Minister,  agb  lede  van  die  Raad,
provinsiale minister en LUR'e, om vir vandag te  sorg,  beteken  om  in  die
toekoms te belê.

'n Belangrike deel van ons missie is om in vandag se kinders  te  belê  deur
middel van kennis- en karakteropbouende opvoeding en leiding vir hulle,  hul
ouers en hul gemeenskappe. Wanneer jy die jeug opvoed, help jy om hulle  toe
te rus om vir hulself te kan sorg. Jy leer  hulle  ``om  vis  te  vang''  en
daardeur maak jy dit vir hulle moontlik om deel van die  oplossing  te  word
vir die behoeftes van hul gemeenskappe.

Dit behoort ons doel te wees om diegene wat fisiek gestrem is en wat so  erg
gestigmatiseer word en wie se potensiaal in baie sfere  van  die  samelewing
misken word, in staat te stel, op te voed en te bemagtig.

MIV/vigs eis steeds 'n verwoestende tol  in  Suid-Afrika.  Vir  bykans  tien
jaar lank al is die meeste mense se reaksie op hierdie epidemie  om  dit  as
'n mediese kwessie, soms as 'n kwessie van sosiale gedrag  of  'n  politieke
kwessie te beskou. Baie min pogings het tot dusver op die  geestelike  aspek
gefokus - om 'n omgewing te  bou  sonder  stigma,  wat  begin  deur  na  die
geestestoestand van die geïnfekteerde om te sien.

Die wêreld kan nie genoeg hospitale bou om na al sy MIV/vigs-pasiënte om  te
sien nie, en kan ook nie wag dat 'n oplossing eendag na  vore  kom  nie.  Ek
glo dat net hulle families en gemeenskappe  werklik  na  geïnfekteerdes  kan
omsien.

Daar is  dwarsdeur  Suid-Afrika  wonderlike  voetsoolvlak-organisasies,  wat
meestal met bitterlik skrapse  begrotings  werk,  besig  om  die  stigma  te
verander wat aan diegene kleef wat met MIV/vigs besmet is. Hulle help  hulle
om aanvaar te word, om met liefde in hul gemeenskappe versorg  te  word,  en
in die proses bou hulle modelle van gemeenskap- en familiesorg wat  'n  kans
het om hierdie siekte te oorwin.

'n Groot probleem is die  ongelykheid  in  die  salarisse  van  maatskaplike
werkers. Maatskaplike werkers wat in diens van die staat  is,  verdien  meer
geld as diegene in die nie-regeringsektor. Ons stel voor  dat  'n  deel  van
die antwoord daarin kan lê dat meer geld beskikbaar  gestel  word  aan  nie-
regeringsektore,  gemeenskapsgebaseerde  organisasies  en  geloofsgebaseerde
organisasies. Baie nie-regeringsektore,  gemeenskapsgebaseerde  organisasies
en geloofsgebaseerde organisasies word egter glad nie  gefinansier  nie,  en
die verskillende provinsies finansier hulle  ook  verskillend.  Daar  is  'n
behoefte aan 'n eenvormige finansieringsbeleid. Daar is 'n  toename  in  die
hoeveelheid probleme in die gemeenskap wat lei tot 'n toename in die  aantal
nie-regeringsorganisasies,     gemeenskapsgebaseerde     organisasies     en
geloofsgebaseerde organisasies. Daar sal  gekyk  moet  word  na  addisionele
fondse om te verhoed dat baie van hierdie organisasies  hulle  deure  sluit.
As daar meer fondse is, kan nie-regeringsorganisasies wat tans  nie  befonds
word nie, ook fondse ontvang en al die provinsies  kan  dan  ook  op  gelyke
voet gebring word deur  dieselfde  subsidies  aan  hierdie  organisasies  te
betaal.

Nog 'n oplossing vir die probleem is ons vrywilligerkorps. Ons  vrywilligers
probeer om mense en die behoeftes van die gemeenskap bymekaar uit  te  bring
deur middel van 'n reeks programme en dienste. Hulle is daaraan  toegewy  om
oplossings vir sosiale kwessies en probleme te  vind  wat  sal  help  om  'n
verskil te maak in ons buurte en gemeenskappe en  dit  sal  verbeter.  Hulle
vervang nie ander agentskappe en organisasies in die  gemeenskap  nie,  maar
oorbrug eintlik die gaping in dienste wat  deur  agentskappe  gelewer  word.
Daarby bied hulle die geleentheid om netwerke te vorm met  ander  leiers  in
nie-winsgewende,  korporatiewe  en  regeringsgemeenskappe.  Deur  vrywillige
diens kan mense die lewensgehalte in hul gemeenskappe versterk  en  verbeter
en hulself en ander help om gelukkiger, gesonder en meer produktiewe  lewens
te lei. Die feit dat vrywilligers op individuele basis hul dienste  aanbied,
is ook voordelig, want dit help om 'n persoon se selfbeeld te bou,  dit  dra
sosiale waardes oor  en  gee  die  persoon  die  verantwoordelikheid  om  sy
dienste op 'n vrywillige basis aan te bied as 'n persoonlike onderneming  om
deur sy diens iets aan die gemeenskap terug te gee.

Menseliefde is 'n waarde wat  van  geslag  tot  geslag  oorgedra  word  deur
ouers, verlengde families en die gemeenskap. Tot onlangs was dit  nie  nodig
om dit formeel te verwoord nie, dit was net hoe  mense  geleef  het.  Vandag
word families in ander rolle geplaas. Hulle trek dikwels rond en woon  selde
naby mekaar. Baie families ken nie eers hul bure nie. Die  ouer  familielede
woon in tehuise waar hulle deur professionele mense versorg  word.  Daar  is
nie  meer  duidelike  maniere  waarop  families  kan  saamwerk  en  tot  hul
gemeenskappe kan bydra nie. U mag dink dat die kinders van  vandag  gelukkig
is om minder verantwoordelikhede te hê, en lekker moderne speelgoed  het  om
hulle besig te hou. Ek glo hulle  is  uitgehonger  vir  geleenthede  om  aan
hulself en ander te bewys dat hulle van jongs af 'n waardevolle  bydrae  tot
die samelewing kan maak. Dit is duidelik dat kinders erkenning  wil  hê  vir
wat hulle kan bydra. Kleuters probeer altyd  hulpvaardig  wees;  die  boetie
vee byvoorbeeld die sussie se neus af, skink 'n glas  melk,  maak  skoon  as
die melk gestort het, ens. Die resultate mag dalk nie  altyd  so  goed  wees
nie, maar die bedoeling is suiwer.

Ons behoort ons families betrokke te kry by vrywillige diens, want  families
is dinamiese sosiale stelsels, met struktuur  wette,  komponente  en  reëls.
Ouerskap vorm die kerngeloof wat 'n kind  in  homself  het.  Die  belangrike
reëls is dié wat bepaal wat dit beteken om  'n  mens  te  wees.  'n  Familie
definieer homself deur die toewyding en  liefde  van  sy  individuele  lede.
Almal trek voordeel daaruit deur deel te neem  aan  aktiwiteite  wat  daarop
gemik is om hulle saam te snoer.

Voorsitter, ek wil afsluit. Ons demokrasie is nege  jaar  oud.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Mr Deputy Chairperson, Minister, hon members  of  the  Council,
provincial Minister and MECs, to provide for  today  is  to  invest  in  the
future.

An important part of our mission is to invest in the children  of  today  by
means of knowledge and character-building education and guidance  for  them,
their parents and their communities. When you educate the youth, you  assist
them by equipping them to be able to take  care  of  themselves.  You  teach
them ``to catch fish'', and in so doing make it possible for them to  become
part of the solution with regard to the needs of their communities.

It should  be  our  aim  to  enable,  educate  and  empower  those  who  are
physically  disabled  and  who  are  very  severely  stigmatised  and  whose
potential is disregarded in many spheres of society.

HIV/Aids still takes a devastating toll in  South  Africa.  For  almost  ten
years, the reaction of most people to this epidemic has been  to  regard  it
as a medical issue, sometimes as an  issue  of  social  behaviour  or  as  a
political issue. Until now,  few  efforts  have  focused  on  the  spiritual
aspect - to create an environment  without  stigma,  that  from  the  outset
cares for the mental condition of the infected.

The world cannot build enough hospitals to take care  of  all  its  HIV/Aids
patients, nor can it wait for a solution to appear one day. I  believe  that
only the families and the communities can really take care of those who  are
infected.

Throughout South Africa there  are  wonderful  organisations  at  grassroots
level which for the most part work with extremely  meagre  budgets,  engaged
in changing the stigma that clings to those who are infected with  HIV/Aids.
They assist them to be accepted, to be  lovingly  taken  care  of  in  their
communities and in the process they create models of  community  and  family
care that has a chance of triumphing over this illness.

A major problem is the disparity in the salaries of social  workers.  Social
workers employed by the state earn more than those in  the  non-governmental
sector. We suggest that part of the answer could lie in  making  more  money
available  to  non-government  sectors,  community-based  organisations  and
religious organisations. Many  of  the  non-government  sectors,  community-
based organisations and religious organisations are, however, not funded  at
all and the various provinces also fund them differently. There  is  a  need
for a uniform funding  policy.  There  is  an  increase  in  the  number  of
problems in the community that  have  contributed  to  an  increase  in  the
number of non-government organisations,  community-based  organisations  and
religious organisations. In order to prevent  many  of  these  organisations
from closing down, we would have to look at additional funds. If  there  are
more funds, non-government organisations  currently  not  being  funded  can
also receive funds, and by paying the same subsidies to these  organisations
all the provinces will be placed on an equal footing.

Another solution to this problem is our corps of volunteers. Our  volunteers
attempt to bring people and the needs of the community together by means  of
a range of programmes and services. They are dedicated to finding  solutions
to social issues and problems that will help to make  a  difference  in  our
neighbourhoods and communities and will improve them. They  do  not  replace
other agencies and organisations in the community, but actually  bridge  the
gap in services rendered  by  agencies.  In  addition  to  this,  they  also
present an opportunity to network with  other  leaders  in  the  non-profit,
corporative and government communities. People can, by  means  of  volunteer
services, strengthen the quality of life in their communities,  enhance  and
improve themselves, and help others to  lead  happier,  healthier  and  more
productive lives. The fact  that  volunteers  offer  their  services  on  an
individual basis is also beneficial because it helps  to  build  a  person's
self-image,  it  transfers  social  values  and   gives   the   person   the
responsibility to offer his services on a  voluntary  basis  as  a  personal
undertaking through his service to give something back to the community.

Humanitarianism  is  a  value  that  is  transferred  from   generation   to
generation by parents, extended families and the community.  Until  recently
it was not necessary to formally express it, it  was  just  the  way  people
lived. Families are placed in different roles today. They often move  around
and very seldom live near one another. Many families do not even know  their
neighbours. The older members of the family stay in institutions where  they
are cared for by professional people. There are no longer distinct  ways  in
which families can work together and contribute to  their  communities.  You
may  think  that  the  children  of  today   are   happy   to   have   fewer
responsibilities and wonderful modern toys to  keep  them  busy.  I  believe
that they are starved for  opportunities  to  prove  to  themselves  and  to
others that they can make a valuable contribution to society  from  a  young
age.  It  is  clear  that  children  want  recognition  for  what  they  can
contribute. Toddlers are always trying  to  be  helpful;  for  example,  the
little brother wipes his sister's nose, pours a glass  of  milk,  cleans  up
when milk has been spilled, etc. The results may not always be so good,  but
the intention is pure.

We should get our families involved in voluntary  service  because  families
are dynamic social structures with structural laws,  components  and  rules.
Parenthood forms the crux  of  the  belief  a  child  has  in  himself.  The
important rules are those that determine what it means to be a human  being.
A family defines  itself  by  means  of  the  dedication  and  love  of  its
individual members. Everybody benefits from taking part in activities  which
are designed to bring them together.

Chairperson, I want to close. Our democracy is nine years old].
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Member, your time has expired.

Mr F ADAMS: Die Nuwe NP bedank die Minister en  die  Wes-Kaapse  provinsiale
minister en hul departemente wat nou ... [The New  NP  thanks  the  Minister
and the Western Cape provincial Minister and  their  departments  which  now
... ]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mnr Adams, die tyd is  om,  Meneer.  [Mr
Adams, your time has expired, Sir.]

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs, members of  the  NCOP,
ladies and gentlemen, in pushing back the frontiers of poverty, the  Gauteng
department of social services and development has come  up  with  programmes
intended to be part of their acceleration to  intensify  the  fight  against
poverty, and the  roll-out  plans  to  engage  our  communities  and  public
representatives on these programmes.

The primary focus is  on  the  vulnerable  groups,  like  children,  elderly
people, people with disabilities, women and the youth. Beyond that,  we  are
also confronted with matters of  attending  to  HIV/Aids,  poverty  and  the
abuse of alcohol and drugs. It is within this context  that  the  department
seeks to broaden  the  access  of  these  services  and  to  reposition  the
programmes to suit our call to push back the frontiers of poverty.

The current scenario  and  proposed  roll-out  are  the  payment  of  social
grants, strengthening the social grant net  and  delivering  quality  social
services. This will ensure that those who qualify  for  grants  are  reached
and registered, especially child-related grants. To reach more  children  in
distress, the child support age  limit  has  been  increased  to  14  years,
staggered in three phases until 2005.

Grants which are payable include the child support grant for children  below
nine years, currently; care dependency grants for  disabled  children  under
18; old age grants for males above  65  and  females  above  60;  disability
grants for people with disabilities above 18 years, including people  living
with HIV/Aids that is at an advanced stage; war veteran grants for  veterans
of the First and Second  World  War  and  other  related  wars;  foster-care
grants for care-givers of abandoned or neglected  children;  and  grants-in-
aid for care-givers who take care of the weak and vulnerable.

More than 656 000 people in Gauteng continue to  survive  on  grants  on  14
April 2003. More than 352 000 are children; 252 592 are the  aged;  119  491
are people with disabilities; 12 047 are foster care-givers; 7 332 are  care
dependants; 413 are grants-in-aid; while 1 132 are war veterans.

For the 2003-04 financial year the department has budgeted R3,8  million  to
reach more than 1,5 million people. From this scenario it is clear that,  at
the end of this financial year, the department shall have overspent  on  the
current beneficiaries, excluding possible new applications.

The number of child-support grants, given the new age limit,  is  far  above
the national target, pending the necessary audits  to  determine  fraud  and
possible misuse of the grant. It is thus clear  that  the  following  grants
for children can be targeted for mass registration: foster-care  grants  for
orphans  or  neglected  or  abused  children;  care  dependency  grants  for
children with disabilities; and grants-in-aid for care-givers of  vulnerable
groups, especially sick beneficiaries.

As far as the roll-out plan is concerned, the  key  component  of  our  mass
mobilisation approach involves the manner in  which  volunteers  and  public
representatives  can  take  part  actively  in  the  campaign.  The  methods
proposed are as follows: A provincial week of  social  grants  registration,
where we will set out a week in October as  part  of  the  build-up  to  the
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, on 17 October,  to  deploy
progressive leaders from  the  democratic  forces  across  the  province  to
register for grants.

Here branches will embark on a door-to-door campaign as a  build-up  to  the
two weeks of social grants registration. Above all,  public  representatives
will then be deployed to various communities to mobilise people to  register
for grants. The registration days will be from 3 to 31 May - I am  referring
to Saturdays.

As regards assistance to people  infected  and  affected  by  HIV/Aids,  the
department has budgeted R12 million to  provide  for  the  strengthening  of
community initiatives for the care of people infected with and  affected  by
HIV/Aids, and the provision  of  school  uniforms  to  children,  especially
orphans in distress.

I am going to skip some of the information because this was supposed  to  be
tabled by the MEC.  I  will  just  highlight  the  significant  issues  like
EkuRhuleni, which was  targeted  as  a  pilot  programme  to  roll  out  the
strengthening of the  clothing  community  projects  and  to  support  local
economic developments that target orphans. This rolling out  programme  will
involve the distribution of forms to  structures  and  schools  to  identify
these children, and the identification  of  community  programmes  on  home-
based  care  to  strengthen  community  initiatives  in  the  fight  against
HIV/Aids.

There is  also  an  establishment  of  development  centres  to  consolidate
poverty projects across the  province.  The  role  and  responsibilities  of
these development centres in poverty alleviation will be to  facilitate  and
co-ordinate capacity-building and skills development programmes;  to  render
projects,  management  and  support  services  to  beneficiaries;   and   to
facilitate and co-ordinate the  provision  of  other  relevant  services  to
beneficiaries.

I  also  won't  name  the  currently  funded  development  centres  and  the
identified development centres for future support. I just  want  to  mention
that the rationale for the identified areas is in accordance with the  draft
document regarding strategy and tactics, research and  facilitation  to  put
Africa first.

The identified locations for development centres have been informed  through
the intervention of the full DSO and the local government social workers.  I
will also not go into the activities in those development centres, but  I'll
just name a few, namely building construction, upholstery,  bakery,  poultry
and others.

With  regard  to  integration,  the  interdepartmental  poverty  alleviation
committee is to link their  planning  and  implementation  with  development
centres and MPCC. Development centres are to be linked to  local  government
integration development plans.  The  interdepartmental  poverty  alleviation
committee,  development   centres   and   MPCCs   and   other   departmental
beneficiaries are to be referred  to  the  Gauteng  special  projects  where
possible and relevant.

Regarding the food security strategy, the targeting criteria will be  child-
headed households, people ill  with  HIV/Aids  awaiting  grants,  access  to
social security to those not in receipt of  any  regular  state  assistance,
HIV/Aids-infected people who are unemployed because they  are  not  fit  for
work and do not receive  any  regular  state  assistance,  and  TB  patients
awaiting access to grants for social security and  not  in  receipt  of  any
regular state assistance.

With regard to challenges, by 15 April 2003 more than 23 families have  been
identified or approached by ward committees, and they voiced  the  following
complaints: sustainability, the budget raising expectations that we may  not
deliver, and the effect on election preparations.

It is within this context that the department is preparing a  business  plan
to  incorporate  the  views  on  the  ground,  provincial  cabinet  and  the
department  limitations.  Thus,  during  the  Budget  Vote  speech  we  will
announce a proper mechanism to deal with these matters.

Concerning the food relief funding for 2003  and  2004,  an  amount  of  R27
million has been allocated for this programme. Three per cent of this  total
allocation will be for administration,  71%  for  food  parcels,  20,8%  for
starter packs, 2,6%  for  HIV/Aids,  2,6%  for  soup  kitchens  and  drop-in
centres.
With regard to sustainability  around  food  security  ...  [Time  expired.]

Mr H J BEKKER (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam  Chair,  it's  a  pleasure  for  me  to
address the House, particularly since it's my fourth maiden speech. I  don't
know how long a person can stay a maiden, but after four  times  I  think  I
would still need the  protection  of  the  Chair.  It's  also  a  privilege,
particularly in terms of the fact that I can do my bit here  to  assist  the
select committee under the chairmanship of the hon Ms Jacobus. I  hope  that
we will be able to contribute.

Social development in South Africa places severe demands, not  only  on  the
Budget, but also on our social conscience. Looking around us and seeing  the
poverty, we will note that it is more visible than  the  prosperity  in  the
country. The utter and absolute divide between the haves and  the  have-nots
must be addressed.

When looking at KwaZulu-Natal, this division is even more visible. Over  the
years, and particularly during the time of the so-called independent  states
and national states, it was the general opinion  of  many  people  that  the
previous  government  determinedly  did  underfund  the  so-called  national
states in comparison to the independent states,  with  the  idea  that  they
should be forced into a position of accepting independence.

The scars of this policy are still visible and we will have to look at  ways
in which one could address that. In KwaZulu-Natal  the  process  has  caused
people to become poorer and poorer. Today  the  backlog  is  still  visible.
Despite the self-help schemes  and  programmes  of  self-sufficiency,  these
matters could be addressed only partially.

The hon chairperson referred to the terrible  ratio  of  social  workers  in
respect to social clients. The enormous case loads that social workers  have
to handle must be the challenge of the future. As public representatives  we
are grateful for the  improvement  in  the  amount  payable  to  the  social
pensioners. I, however, believe  that  the  payout  of  pensioners  must  be
streamlined.
The question to be asked is  why  the  banking  institutions  can't  play  a
greater role. Yes, the banks do have a solid argument that it would  not  be
financially viable for them since it would be mostly pensions that  came  in
and that would be withdrawn immediately afterwards, but I fail  to  see  why
the department cannot pay an administrative fee to the banks,  or  Postbank,
for that matter, in order to defray the costs of the banks which they  would
have for these so-called negative accounts.

It should be possible to assess what the  average  cost  to  the  department
would be when pensions are being paid out directly  or  even  by  electronic
cash payout services. Did we ever do a calculation of the  losses  owing  to
theft, robberies and false payments?

Although the majority of pensioners would never  ever  be  able  to  benefit
from this particular scheme, and  we  would  have  to  continue  the  manual
payout of these pensioners, I think  a  significant  portion  of  pensioners
could be assisted in this particular way, and I should think that  it  could
be viable to look at possibilities of this nature.

Members who know me and  have  always  pictured  me  in  the  financial  and
economic spheres, may  be  amazed  to  know  that  for  seven  years  of  my
professional career prior to politics I was involved in  the  welfare  field
myself. During most of the seventies  and  the  early  eighties  I  was  the
administrative and financial manager of the National Council for  Child  and
Family Welfare.

During this period I was also elected as the secretary of the  then  ad  hoc
committee of all  national  welfare  organisations.  My  main  task  was  to
provide  collective  information  and  data  for  the  preparation  of   the
memorandum at that time to improve  the  subsidisation  formula  of  welfare
organisations with social workers in their service.

Members may be amazed to know that at that stage the type  of  subsidy  that
was allocated to welfare organisations was based on the entry  level  salary
of a social worker in the employ of the state, and that was the only  amount
that welfare organisations could get. It was only after solid argument  that
it was accepted by the department that the ratio should be changed and  that
it moved to the basis that we have today.

Again, I think the stresses, particularly  owing  to  the  ratio  of  social
workers to clients, could bring this aspect to the fore, and the  time  will
probably come at some stage or other that we will have  to  look  into  this
matter of the subsidisation of social workers in the welfare field,  because
they're taking a massive workload  off  the  shoulders  of  the  department,
which is actually the responsibility of the department as such.

With these few words I wish to close. Let  us  hope  that  our  country  can
experience more economic prosperity and that we will be able to do more  for
our poor and for poverty alleviation. I thank you. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: I have been mandated formally by my  province,  the  MEC
and all my permanent delegates from a peaceful  Limpopo  province,  to  tell
the Minister that the absence of a baseline has always been  a  major  cause
of inconsistencies in our welfare budget allocations. This has  resulted  in
insufficient coverage and shortfalls. Every year  in  September  our  social
security   budget,   in   particular,   becomes   exhausted,   whereby   new
beneficiaries are made to wait for  the  new  financial  year  in  order  to
receive their much-needed grants.

I was reluctant, but my MEC urged me to make the  Minister  aware  that,  on
the basis of the surveys conducted, it became crystal  clear  and  categoric
that the problem is not  the  lack  of  baseline,  as  claimed,  but  it  is
underfunding. A good example of the effects of underfunding  could  be  seen
when one takes into account the many times  that  the  child  support  grant
targets have been revised. At first, the provincial target was  set  at  410
000 and later at 510 000 as against the 600 000 set nationally.

It is commonly known that a major problem faced by rural provinces  such  as
KwaZulu-Natal,  Limpopo  and  Eastern  Cape  is  the  use  of  grants  as  a
substitute for employment. Hence, at times,  people  go  to  the  extent  of
using illegal means to access these grants. The major casualty in this  case
is so-called temporary disability. The fact is that in Government  there  is
nothing temporary, as the general practice is that temporary ends  up  being
permanent. There was a big debate where some  people  were  suggesting  that
there is a strong belief that the temporary disability should be phased  out
because it is subjective. The debate is still continuing, but we would  like
to get the opinion of the Minister in  this  regard.  Because  the  question
that remains and which ought to be answered by us all, is what are we  going
to put in place if it is phased out?

It should be pointed out that in Limpopo, we are  affected  by  cross-border
problems, as  we  share  borders  with  three  neighbouring  states,  namely
Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. People from these  countries  cross  over
and obtain relevant documents, such as ID's and  birth  certificates,  which
they present to apply for grants. In  terms  of  our  Constitution,  as  the
Minister is  aware,  we  are  left  with  no  choice  but  to  accept  their
applications. Do not be surprised, as  we  are  seated  here  and  as  I  am
speaking, there is a draft court order instructing us to disburse grants  to
400 children and 395 old age beneficiaries from the  neighbouring  countries
because they possess relevant documents issued in our country.

The MEC said I must inform the hon Minister that another policy  problem  we
are facing is funding nonprofit organisations.  In  most  cases  funding  of
these organisations is  urban  biased,  with  no  coverage  in  rural  areas
because registered organisations are only  found  in  urban  areas.  Coupled
with this scenario is the issue of access to other grants,  such  as  foster
care. This grant does not accommodate the extended  African  family  system,
as access to it will demand of  a  person  to  go  through  the  Westernised
adoption process. It is a well-known fact that one  may  take  care  of  the
kids of one's relatives without going through a process  of  changing  their
original particulars. Knowing the Minister as I do, he will look into  this,
because we  are  Africans.  Let  us  not  unintentionally  disadvantage  the
Africans we intend serving.

Another problem is the shortage  of  social  workers  who  are  expected  to
handle more cases than expected. They are very few. Right now the  ratio  of
social worker to beneficiaries is abnormal. I want to  urge  the  department
to look into this  very  seriously.  Another  problem  is  this  arrangement
whereby a social worker is expected to submit only 2 cases in 7 to 8  weeks.
You go into these social workers' offices to find that their files are  very
big, but that they are not allowed to submit cases every day  as  they  can.
The arrangement with justice is to submit only two cases and wait for  seven
to eight weeks for them to resubmit again. With due respect,  hon  Minister,
can that be looked into, Sir?

We would like to put on record that there is a  distortion  of  our  welfare
budget allocations. At face value there seems  to  be  an  increase  in  our
budget. The truth is that the purported increase is  largely  an  allocation
for regulation 11. As an expert in this field, I am telling  those  who  are
novices that regulation 11  is  backpay  rate  for  the  increase  of  child
support grants in October  2002  and  April  2003  respectively,  the  child
support grants extension as well as the National Food  Emergency  Programme.
Therefore, the claim that it is  a  23%  increase  in  our  budget  for  the
current financial year as against the national  norm  of  19%  is,  in  real
terms, not true. The budget increase does  not  improve  coverage  but  only
deals with the status quo.

In conclusion, one would like  to  present  the  problem  of  infrastructure
backlog in respect of our welfare facilities,  such  as  payout  points  and
offices at service delivery points. This also goes for our  staffing  norms.
At present our staffing level is only 45% functional. The  reason  for  this
state of affairs is that 98% of our budget goes to grants, with  the  result
that other welfare services such as child justice and social work  services,
to mention but a few, get squeezed.

Lastly, I want to remind ... [Time Expired.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, ladies and gentlemen,  the
ruling party's imbizos  and  other  parties'  road  shows,  discussions  and
interactions with communities are playing an important role  in  identifying
and acquainting our various constituencies with  the  assistance  Government
is providing to alleviate poverty. This  is  particularly  relevant  to  the
vulnerable groups such as  the  elderly,  young  children  and  people  with
disabilities.

It is reported by the relevant MEC in  the  North  West  province  that  the
child support grant beneficiaries have increased by 83,5%, from 120  140  in
April 2001 to 220 482 in April 2003. However, there are still  some  of  our
children's  children  who  are   struggling   to   acquire   the   necessary
documentation that would enable them to tender  their  applications.  It  is
also reported by the above-mentioned source that for the  current  financial
year for HIV/Aids was allocated R7,58 million; food security and  nutrition,
R41, 615 million; child support grant extensions,  R125,  426  million;  and
R3,68 million for poverty relief.

It must, however, be remembered that the  increases  in  the  allocation  of
child support grants and the extension of the service to children of  up  to
14 years in the next three years will result in  a  consequent  increase  in
the infrastructural needs. One of the challenges, as  alluded  to  by  other
provinces, is that our provinces experience a  shortage  of  social  workers
who are relinquishing  their  services  in  order  to  seek  more  lucrative
employment elsewhere. This trend will need  to  be  looked  into,  and  some
remedies sought to reverse it.

However, there are those who argue that the payment of child care grants  is
indirectly encouraging unprotected sex and the bearing of more  children  by
the young mothers in order to qualify for more grants.  I  contend  that  we
cannot stand by if that is really happening. [Time expired]

Mr H T SOGONI: Hon Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs, special  delegates
and hon members, let me  start  by  expressing  the  UDM's  appreciation  of
Government's special attention given to the challenges  facing  the  Eastern
Cape, and for the decisive efforts taken by the province  and  the  national
Government to remove the major obstacles that have continued to disturb  and
impede proper service delivery that is so necessary to  address  the  plight
of the poor in my province.

The sting of the  Scorpions  is  definitely  being  felt  by  the  dishonest
officials who have defrauded the department of millions of rands  meant  for
the most needy in society. Criminals must be made to pay heavily  for  their
sins.

The UDM further  encourages  the  province  and  the  Department  of  Social
Development,  in  particular,  to  take  very  seriously  and   to   respond
positively to the findings contained in the report recently released by  the
task team on matters of poor service delivery in the Eastern Cape.

Mphathiswa, icebiso nesicelo se-UDM kukuba ugutyulo lokungcola  nophengululo
olunzulu ngobume beli sebe lakho malungapheleli kwii-ofisi eziseBisho,  koko
malunwenwe, luhle lude luye kufikelela nakwii-ofisi zezithili zethu.  Inkal'
ixing' etyeni naphaya kumanqwanqwa asezantsi, mhlekazi.

Ndenze  nje  umzekelo,  phaya  kuthi   eMzimkhulu   apho   ndizinze   khona,
Mphathiswa, kukho umzali ongakhange  ade  axhamle  kuncedo  luka  Rhulumente
oluyimali eyinkxaso esisibonelelo  sabantwana  (child  support  grant)  wade
wabe umntwana uya phuma kwiminyaka  efanelekileyo,  emithandathu.  Xa  ezama
ukubuza umzali, nam ndide ndamncedisa, impendulo  ayinikwayo  kuthiwa  igama
lakhe  laphuma  kwipay-point  engeyiyo  eyakhe.  Ikhonjwe  kwaNdab'  ayilali
eMadudusini, sithi siyibamb' apho, ikhonjw' eLusikisiki.  Kodwa  ke  lilonke
ugqibele   engafumananga   luncedo   loo   mzali.    Kodwa    igama    lakhe
laliseliphumile. Umbuzo ke, mhlekazi,  uthi  ubunzima  bungakanani  na  kwi-
ofisi yaseMzimkhulu neyaseLusikisiki  ukulungisa  umcimbi  wepay-point  kude
konakalelwe umntwana nomzali? (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)
[The UDM would like to suggest to the hon Minister  that  sewerage  and  the
evaluation of this Department should not only be at Bisho, but it should  be
extended up to district offices. The hon Minister must know that  there  are
in the lower levels, Madam Chairperson.

Citing just one example, where I come from in the Mzimkhulu area,  there  is
a parent who did not get the child support grant until her  child  was  more
than six years old. When she enquired - I even helped  her  -  she  got  the
answer that her name was registered at a different pay point.  It  was  said
she was registered at Madudusini and when we got there, we were told  to  go
to Lusikisiki. Eventually she did not receive the grant. Her name,  however,
appeared in the system. The question then is: Are offices at  Mzimkhulu  and
Lusikisiki in that much of a bad situation that they cannot even solve  such
a small issue, that of a pay point, such that a parent and  a  child  should
lose out like that?]

According to Gail Wannenberg in an article in the South  African  Year  Book
on International Affairs, 2002-03, poverty  reduction  remains  one  of  the
most intractable issues faced  by  policy  makers  in  post-apartheid  South
Africa. This statement was echoed by the Premier of the Eastern Cape in  his
state of the province address in February this year, when he stated:


  Poverty poses the biggest single threat to our people.

It is also estimated that about  18%  to  24%  of  South  Africans  live  in
chronic poverty, which is a worrying factor indeed, especially  in  view  of
Statistics South Africa's indication that the poor have  become  poorer  and
the rich richer since 1995. The mission of the department,  which  seeks  to
enable the poor, the vulnerable and the excluded to  secure  a  better  life
for themselves should therefore be supported by this  House  and  all  those
who are committed to building a caring society.

During the briefing by provinces  on  the  intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review
early this week, it was clearly observed  that  almost  all  the  provincial
departments agree that poverty reduction and HIV/Aids are  a  priority.  For
instance, the Limpopo MEC's submission emphasised a primary focus  as  being
-


  ... the empowerment of communities  to  assume  full  responsibility  for
  their well-being and to take charge  of  their  initiative  to  eradicate
  poverty.

The UDM supports this Budget Vote. [Time expired]

Mr  M  L  FRANSMAN  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  Minister  Skweyiya,  hon
members, MECs, in the last month in April, as directed by the President,  we
were instructed to actually go out and listen to different  communities  for
our Imbizo month. We have listened to approximately 10 000 people  and  what
we have heard really was that Government is on the right track. There  is  a
question of deepening delivery in these communities.

Listening today also to the strategic objectives and the directives  of  the
Minister in his speech, one can only but say that the Government  cares  and
that we need to further fast-track delivery.

We came back from Stellenbosch last year  invigorated  and  enthusiastic  in
our  commitment  to  create  a  better   life   for   all.   Our   President
contextualised our strategic goals in the 8 January statement as follows:


  Central to these tasks and strategic  goal  is  the  realisation  of  the
  objective of the eradication of poverty. When our people  attained  their
  freedom in 1994,  they  inherited  a  country  with  millions  of  people
  afflicted by poverty. These masses had fought both for  the  emancipation
  from oppression and a liberation from poverty and worry.

From Mr Skewyiya's speech, or  budget  focus,  it  is  clear  that  the  way
forward for us in the province is by setting out very practically  the  work
we will be undertaking to realise a better life  for  all.  The  challenges,
however, confronting us are of a structural nature  and  indeed  poverty  is
structurally imbedded. It  is  therefore  important  that  our  approach  be
integrated and multidimensional.

Poverty should be addressed through a systemic approach.  We  cannot  afford
to create boxes for ourselves or  not  look  beyond  the  rigid  parameters.
After all, these are limitations we place on ourselves.

After nine years of liberation, we have learned very well  the  lesson  that
everything impacts on everything else. And here I want to cite  the  example
of the child support grant. To children under the age of  14  years  it  has
been  extended  over  the   next   three   years.   To   realise   effective
implementation of that grant, we have identified our relationship  with  the
Department of Home Affairs as being absolutely crucial  to  our  ability  to
succeed and therefore I want to thank the select committee chairperson,  who
has spoken about that.

The registration  of  births  and  issuing  of  identity  documents  are  an
integral part of the pensions and grant  systems.  Its  most  immediate  and
urgent impact is in relation to the CSG, or  child  support  grant,  because
for every month a child is without  a  valid  birth  registration  document,
that child suffers loss and deprivation.

In the Western Cape the child support grant is one  of  the  most  important
interventions for us, because it alleviates poverty  and  the  suffering  of
children at the most basic level of survival. It provides a safety  net  for
each and every child in order to survive. Already we have well over 200  000
children on the system receiving that  grant.  In  the  next  two  financial
years we expect to increase that figure by about 163 000.

Bearing in mind that we have consistently  beaten  the  forecast  uptake  of
grants, the figures may well be much higher than  that.  Currently  we  have
the obligation to  ensure  that  each  child  that  qualifies  for  a  grant
receives it. Also, in the last financial year, we were able to increase  our
social grants beneficiaries by approximately 100 000. Approximately  85%  of
the Western Cape budget for social  services  is  spent  on  grants  to  the
extent that, by the end of this financial year, we expect 550 000 grants  to
be on payment on a monthly basis.  That  means  more  than  half  a  million
people per month receive assistance from Government.

In the province our budget for this financial year  talks  of  approximately
R3,7 billion, with R280 million  per  month  being  spent  directly  on  the
poorest. The  critical  challenge  which  we  have  identified,  apart  from
ensuring the delivery of the grant, is the question of how  the  person  and
the family spend that grant. So, the strategy is to  reflect  on  the  right
person, the right grant at the right time, but we are taking it  further  in
the province by saying the right person must spend the  grant  appropriately
and that is going to be a very particular focus for us in the province.

It is clear that whilst we provide a wide social safety  net,  the  ultimate
goal is to eliminate poverty through development, job creation and  creating
sustainable livelihoods. The eradication of poverty remains  the  first  and
most urgent priority. It must form the backdrop of every decision  we  take.
Indeed the challenge is also to transform grants into  a  development  tool.
It is what we do beyond grants and pensions that will further determine  our
success or failure.

For that reason the Western Cape supports  the  Minister's  announcement  of
the establishment  of  a  national  social  security  agency,  so  that  the
administrative function of  paying  grants  is  centrally  controlled.  This
would allow us to pay far more attention to  the  developmental  aspects  of
our portfolio. And the critical challenge here  remains  the  transformation
of our services. There is  still  a  skewness  in  terms  of  the  budgetary
allocation to NGOs, CBOs and old-age homes  in  the  context  of  previously
advantaged NGOs, and that is something that we are now correcting.

In the Western Cape we have also established a special  directorate  dealing
with poverty under my portfolio. We have already prepared a draft  framework
policy against which we are lining up our  expenditure.  Not  only  is  this
directorate occupied  with  project  funding,  but  it  is  also  integrally
involved in the food security programme, job  creation,  youth  development,
community empowerment and research. We have  taken  the  objectives  of  the
integrated food security and utilities programme seriously and therefore  we
have rolled out a strategy dealing with the newly allocated R20 million  for
the Western Cape dealing with food security.

However, in the province we have also  put  in  place  a  special  programme
around food production for daily subsistence  and  supplementation.  In  the
current  food  crisis  and  through  the  intervention   of   the   national
structures, we were able to distribute food parcels in the Western  Cape  to
approximately 4 000 families, all of which amounted to  the  value  of  R4,5
million. On the provincial level we have decided that CBOs  and  faith-based
organisations are important and in that context we  have  allocated  a  food
parcel each to approximately 14 000 beneficiaries, not from national  funds,
but provincial funds in this regard.

Lastly, I want to refer to the focus around youth development. This is  next
month, when we will be dealing with the focus on young people. Indeed,  with
the 16 June celebrations  on  the  horizon,  we  are  all  reminded  of  the
powerful role that the youth played in our struggle  and  the  potential  of
our youth that can be unlocked today. The Western Cape perceives  the  youth
as agents for change and therefore youth development  programmes  are  of  a
central nature.

Between 26 May and the end of June this  year  the  focus  will  be  on  the
protection of children, where the theme  talks  to  Protecting  a  Child  is
Everyone's Business and we will be rolling out a full  month-long  programme
relating to that. We have also allocated R1 million to empower, through  the
community development worker strategy, one  hundred  young  people  in  this
province, capacitating them, empowering them, and making sure that  we  send
them back into communities to unlock and assist community structures.

We have also been able to look at the Western Cape's new skills  development
initiative. Approximately R1,5 million over the next three  years  has  been
allocated to develop long-term skills, recreation,  readership  ability  and
job prospects for 500 young people  in  Mitchell's  Plain  and  Khayelitsha,
which is the urban nodal point of the President.

In this year, the year of united  action  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, the first of a decade we must benchmark, and  consider  the  impact
of each of our decisions on the basis of  how  it  is  going  to  impact  on
poverty. This means that the fight against poverty as the  biggest  priority
must resonate even more loudly in Government,  particularly  in  the  Public
Service. It can no longer be business as usual. The time has come for us  to
make sure that the sense of urgency is felt throughout.  We  must  inculcate
in every sector the ethos that we are still fighting the struggle  for  true
liberation. Let us together, under the banner of united  action,  push  back
the frontiers of poverty and look forward to a better life  for  all.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Thank you, Chair. Being mandated by my chairperson  from  the
select committee and being the last speaker, as well, I think  we  all  need
to remind ourselves, as members of the Council, that the ANC-led  Government
has, since it came into power in 1994, systematically sought to rectify  the
imbalances of the past.  However,  in  particular  in  the  area  of  social
development, we as the ruling party have set very high goals  regarding  the
final elimination of poverty, which our Minister and  all  other  Government
Ministers are required to meet. Therefore, it is our duty as councillors  or
delegates here to assist in registering the unregistered. That is  the  bone
of contention and the bottom line.

Former President Mandela made  his  Government's  first  commitment  to  the
poor, but especially to children, when he accepted the first  draft  of  the
NPA, which is the  National  Programme  of  Action  for  Children  in  South
Africa, in June 1994. The 1999 NPA has been the  driving  force  behind  the
Government's programme to alleviate child poverty.

Each  year,  since  1994,  we  have  re-examined  our  goals,  targets   and
strategies regarding the poor. We have subsequently  made  readjustments  to
meet the current demands, such as with the annual increase in social  grants
since 1997. We have realised that we need to  be  constantly  on  the  alert
when dealing with the negative ramifications of apartheid, far more than  we
initially thought.

If we look at the Minister of Finance's 2002 Budget Speech,  as  an  example
of his Government's commitment to  reducing  poverty,  we  can  see  how  he
outlined the need  to  make  the  eradication  of  poverty  our  number  one
priority, in particular when he said:


  We must be clear that the reason we need to combat poverty is because  it
  deprives  individuals  and,  by  extension,  societies  of   their   full
  potential. It robs children of their childhood,  it  condemns  adults  to
  illiteracy, it deprives people of access to simple  necessities  such  as
  safe drinking water, it condones many millions of diseases, it wears down
  the human spirit and robs people of their dignity.


  We must fight poverty because, until it has been overcome, we cannot  lay
  claim to being a compassionate society.

We also heard the President, in his January statement  on  the  occasion  of
the 91st anniversary of the ANC, determine that -


  Our current strategy goal is the reconstruction and  development  of  our
  country for the eradication of the legacy of colonialism  and  apartheid.
  It indicates the task we have to accomplish to reach this strategy  goal.
  Central to this task  and  our  strategic  goal  is  the  realisation  of
  objectives of the eradication of poverty.


  When our people attained their freedom in 1994, they inherited a  country
  with millions of people affected by poverty.  These  masses  have  fought
  both for their emancipation from oppression  and  their  liberation  from
  poverty and want.

With regard to the social grant, he said:


  Our Government views the system of social grants as an important part  of
  our struggle to alleviate and eradicate poverty.  Our  movement  has  the
  responsibility to ensure that all those of our people who are entitled to
  receiving these grants get what they are entitled to.


  In particular, we must bear in mind that those entitled to  these  grants
  are among those most vulnerable in our society.

To overcome some of  the  fragmentation  within  the  Department  of  Social
Development, there has been an intense  focus  to  improve  an  evenness  of
service delivery across all provinces. Some of these  measures  include  the
implementation of national norms,  standards,  improvements  of  the  social
pensions  system,  expansion  of  the  social   grant   administration   and
management units and the development  of  assessment  tools  for  disability
grants, to assist community panels in the assessment and approval  of  these
grants.

In his 2003 Budget Speech, the Minister of  Finance  further  elaborates  on
this ANC-led Government's view on the growth  and  development  strategy  to
continue to realise the social and economic rights of every  South  African,
and the poor in particular.

In this year's  budget  he  demonstrates  how  and  why  income  support  to
vulnerable people such as  the  elderly,  young  children  and  people  with
disability  continues  to  be  our  largest  and  most  effective  reduction
programme. He has, again, listened to the needs of the most vulnerable,  and
has consequently increased pensions, disability  grants  and  child  support
grants, or CSGs.

For children he introduces a three-year implementation plan to  increase  to
14 years the age for  children  receiving  the  child  support  grants.  All
provinces will be able  to  implement  this  radical  new  policy  shift  in
funding by virtue of the conditional grant to provinces.

Provinces must, however, bear in mind that the CSG will have  no  impact  on
child poverty if the  take-up  rate  is  slow.  So,  while  Government  does
prioritise children in policy, spending patterns and service  delivery  must
also make a positive contribution in order to reduce child poverty.

In addition to the CSG, the Minister of Social Development  also  introduced
another provincial condition applying to funds. The implementation of a  new
food relief programme was first announced in the medium-term  budget  policy
statement. Its intent is to provide relief in the form  of  basic  foodstuff
to  households  that  are  struggling  to   meet   their   basic   nutrition
requirements without any means of income  or  support.  An  amount  of  R400
million per year was allocated for implementing the programme over  the  MTF
period. Obviously, children living  under  these  conditions  then  directly
benefit from such a programme.

I would like to conclude by saying that the department's  specific  mandate,
with regard to this programme, is to ensure that children who  are  infected
with HIV/Aids have access to services that include alternative care,  social
grants, counselling, food security, provision of  clothing,  and  protection
from abuse and other forms of  maltreatment.  Most  provinces  have  already
employed contract workers to speed up the delivery  and,  according  to  the
department, all official working areas of  HIV/Aids  have  already  received
the appropriate training.

We, in the ANC, believe that the Department of Social Development has,  this
year, played a very active role in eradicating  poverty  and  is  already  a
full participant in the year of united action to push back the frontiers  of
poverty.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Thank you, Comrade Chairperson.

First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the  House  for
its co-operation and for the assistance that it  has  given  to  us  as  the
department, and we hope that during this budget year this  co-operation  and
assistance will increase in order for all of us to  achieve  what  we  want,
which is a better life for South Africans as a whole but, more  importantly,
for the children in this country.

Quite obviously, we do agree that there are a  lot  of  challenges  that  we
still face and one of them, as has been said,  is  that  of  human  resource
development,  which  is  an  issue  that  we  ought  to  be  dealing   with.
Specifically, it is the need  for  more  social  workers  and  their  better
remuneration within our country as a whole. I hope we will  be  able  to  do
that, working together as parliamentarians and  as  Government  as  a  whole
and; more importantly, by working with the institutions of  higher  learning
and nongovernmental organisations to ensure that we train the right  people,
in particular the development workers that we have been talking about.  That
is one of the decisions reached by the ANC at Stellenbosch, and we ought  to
ensure that it does take place.  We  cannot  do  it  alone.  We  need  those
institutions to come up with a programme that will be able to assist  us  in
that.

I quite earnestly do agree with the hon Jacobus about  the  issue  that  she
has raised here. First of all, there is the challenge of orphans  under  the
age of 18. It is something that all of us ought to sit  down  with  to  find
ways in which we can close that gap that is there, because  it  is  quite  a
big one. It does raise a lot of problems for us as  the  Government  and  as
people regarding what we do with our children. Quite obviously, no  ordinary
loving parent would like to see streetchildren running  around  the  streets
of Cape Town without anybody to look after them.

It is our duty as fathers and citizens to do that and to  work  together  to
resolve   this   issue,   working   very   closely   with    nongovernmental
organisations, civil society as a whole  and,  more  importantly,  with  the
communities themselves and church leaders. That will not only  lead  to  the
betterment of their conditions, but  we  will  also  be  creating  a  better
society and communities for our country. That is not  necessarily  an  issue
for the Department of Social Development alone,  as  the  hon  member  said.
There is a need for interdepartmental co-operation between  the  Departments
of Health, Education, Housing and Safety and  Security  to  answer  some  of
these questions.

Quite obviously, I agree that there might have been a  lot  of  problems.  I
know, because I was Minister for the Public Service when we all hounded  for
a lean Public Service and a  better  Public  Service  and  all  these  other
things which have proved not to be very, very true.

I think one of the issues that we did take into consideration  is  that  all
these theories that come from Europe do not necessarily feed development  in
our country. We rushed on them with all those propagandists that  came  from
all these other countries and, as the ANC,  we  dilly-dallied  and  did  not
take up the right positions. I think that the position  that  was  taken  by
Cosatu was right and it is becoming clearer today that we  do  not  need  to
cut down on the Public Service. We need to increase it.  We  need  to  train
people and ensure that they have got the right skills so that  we  are  able
to deliver to our people as we are supposed to be  delivering.  I  think  we
ought to look into  that  and  not  be  shy  as  the  ANC  to  answer  these
questions.

It is 10 years now since that has been there.  We  are  in  the  process  of
reviewing  our  policies  as  the  Government  so  that  we  can  see   what
achievements we have made and where the mistakes and weaknesses are. One  of
them was that we listened to this propaganda from  the  so-called  theorists
that came from very far and we just accepted their messages  without  asking
questions. I think we ought to go back and look into that.

With regard to many other  things,  quite  obviously  there  are  a  lot  of
questions that have been raised - the issue of the task team in the  Eastern
Cape and the issue of fraud in general. These are  issues  that  all  of  us
ought to address, and I am very pleased that quite a number  of  members  of
Parliament have come to tell me, yesterday, today  and  during  our  caucus,
that we have been able to find people who are transgressing, and,  in  fact,
who are committing criminal acts of fraud and  misrepresentation,  which  we
have put forward to the police. We hope that the  police  will  be  able  to
cope and bring these people to justice.

Some of these issues I think are caused by the type  of  Public  Service  we
had. Quite obviously, in 1994 there were many compromises  that  were  made,
which we agreed to for the sake of continuity and  stability.  We  took  all
the rotten apples from the former apartheid government  and  the  Bantustans
and we put them all together in order to continue. During that process  that
behaviour and that culture  has  infected  even  the  new  people  that  are
supposed to have been purer and more caring than the others.  I  think  this
is something that we ought to be looking into. We need to ensure  that  such
people are out of the Public Service.

Also, I am a little bit surprised  -  although  I  think  I  should  not  be
surprised - by the report that teachers are also involved in the  issue,  as
the MEC for the Eastern Cape has said, of robbing and committing fraud  with
regard to the child support grant. I think it is a horrible  thing  because,
at this time, we are depending mostly on  teachers  within  the  educational
institutions to be part and parcel of ensuring that all those children  that
are in their schools are integrated and get the child  support  grant  until
the age of 18. In the next five to seven years,  we  will  be  depending  on
them. If they are involved in this, I think it is something  that  we  ought
to look into, and we will have to talk to the relevant Minister and MECs.

With regard to the issue of comprehensive social security,  quite  obviously
we are dealing with that. We are hoping that we will  be  able  to  come  up
with some  answers  before  the  end  of  this  year,  but  it  is  quite  a
complicated issue. It is not a question,  as  I  said,  of  giving  R100  to
everybody. It is broader than that. It ought to encompass  the  question  of
unemployment, roads, accidents and the national health policy. These  things
do not necessarily exist at the moment. They need a lot of expertise.  There
is progress that we can report but there are  still  a  lot  of  challenges.
Research also needs to be looked into. The issue of temporary disability  is
a tricky one and somebody even asked that we should  dissolve  it.  It  will
not be so easy to do so. We are supposed to be a caring Government.  We  are
supposed to look after the weakest of the weak and we ought to do  that  but
also avoid fraud as much as possible.

Regarding the cross-border problems that have been mentioned with regard  to
Limpopo and Mpumalanga, the Free State and the Eastern  Cape,  we  ought  to
ensure that it is only people who are entitled to the  grants,  citizens  of
South Africa, that are getting them. When  it  comes  to  funding  for  non-
profit-making organisations, it is quite true that  I  raised  that  matter.
The money that we are giving to civil society, as a whole,  is  not  enough.
The crises that  we  are  facing  that  were  left  by  apartheid  need  the
strengthening of  civil  society,  but  more  importantly  it  needs  to  be
strengthened in the rural areas where they do not exist.  We  ought  to  use
their power,  ability  and  capacity  to  advance  our  poverty  alleviation
programmes and the struggle and fight against HIV/Aids within  our  society.
They need more money and training than they are getting at  the  moment.  We
have to do that all together.

Addressing the question of social workers is something that I  have  started
with. Their pay and numbers have been noted and I think we  should  work  on
it to ensure that we provide further training for them  as  opposed  to  how
they are being trained at the moment.

The imbizos are our only weapon to reach out to  our  people,  and  we  hope
that through imbizos and constituency  offices  we  will  continue  to  work
closely with society so that they  tell  us  what  is  wrong  and  what  our
weaknesses are so that we are able to resolve  them.  People  will  also  be
able to evaluate the work that Government  and  members  of  Parliament  are
doing within society.

Malunga namanyundululu aseMzimkhulu kaMnu Sogoni, ndivile. Ndiyivile  inkosi
yam. Ukuba ngaba ingandinika  igama  lale  nkosikazi  kunye  nesicelo  sakhe
kwakunye nazo zonke ezinye izinto zayo, sakuzama ukukhangela ukuba  singenza
ntoni na. Imali leya yona yeyakhe. Asiyoyalaa mntu  uyivalileyo.  Kunjalonje
kufuneka bayikhuphe loo mali bamnike  kwangaloo  mini,  isusela  kuloo  mini
wasenza ngayo  isicelo  de  kube  lolu  suku  akulo  ngoku.  Ndicinga  ukuba
masisebenzisane ngolo hlobo. Ukuba ungayithumela nje kum eofisini,  ndicinga
ukuba singayisombulula kamsinyane loo ngxaki.  Baninzi  abantu  abanjengaye.
Baninzi. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[With regards to the atrocities committed at Mzimkhulu, I have heard you  Mr
Sogoni. I have heard you, Sir. If you could please give me the name  of  the
woman and her application and all the other accompanying documents, we  will
try and see what we can do. That money is hers, most definitely. It  is  not
that of the person who has  stopped  it.  They  must  give  her  the  money,
starting from when she made the application until today. I think  we  should
look at it that way. Kindly send it to my  office,  and  I  think  we  could
solve the matter very quickly. You find many such cases. Many of them.]

With regard to the MEC for the Western  Cape,  Mr  Marius  Fransman,  we  do
understand and support what you are doing and I think we should be  able  to
work together specifically on that Urban Renewal  Programme  for  Mitchell's
Plain and Khayelitsha. We should take about a day or  two  to  go  to  those
places and invite as many of these  members  as  possible  to  be  part  and
parcel of the campaign.  We  can  do  it.  There  are  so  many  members  of
Parliament, specifically from the ANC, who are sitting here  and  can  do  a
lot of work. I think we could make use of them as much as possible.

In regard to the hon Kgware's  contribution,  we  do  understand  there  are
quite  a  number  of  problems  there.  These  are  not  our   policies   as
individuals. They are not the President's policies or  mine,  but  they  are
policies of the ANC, the liberation movement. We only elucidate  and  ensure
that everybody understands them.  That  means  they  do  not  end  with  the
President, a Minister, an MEC or  members  of  Parliament.  They  should  be
carried to the people. They should be part and parcel  of  our  lives.  They
should be about how we react individually as citizens and as cadres  of  our
movement towards resolving some of the  problems  that  face  our  people  -
problems of poverty, ignorance and disease, specifically  HIV/Aids,  in  our
country, which is to a very large extent a great challenge,  and  we  should
do everything we possibly can to resolve it.

Furthermore, I would like to repeat again  that  the  state  of  the  social
security system in this country and the state of welfare  services  is  more
dependent on how each  and  everyone  of  us  contributes  towards  that  to
resolve the pain that the majority of our people  are  feeling.  Today  they
are able to say, ``I am hungry'' to a Government that they themselves  voted
for. They were unable  to  say  that  before  1994,  because  they  did  not
recognise that government. Now they do, and they can say ``siyalamba''  and,
as members of Parliament, we should be pleased that they  are  able  to  say
that by articulating their problems so that they can be assisted as much  as
possible.

Personally, I would really love it if members of Parliament and  those  from
the NCOP were able to pinpoint some of these public  servants  who  are  not
doing their jobs so that we can deal with them. The  issue  of  children  is
very central in that. There are many things that we have been  able  to  say
and do but I think that even that issue of children is something we  as  the
ANC need to review.

We agreed in principle that we  would  encourage  that  children  be  looked
after within their communities. We said we would discourage the building  of
orphanages. However, I am asking you  now,  as  members  of  Parliament,  to
review that in the face of the crisis that is in front of us today. We  have
to review those positions. Is it not time, specifically  with  reference  to
children and perhaps elderly people as well, that we go  back  and,  without
running away from the issue of using and appealing to  our  communities  and
our homes for home-based care, build some  orphanages  and  make  sure  that
communities look after them and resource them in a manner  that  we  can  be
proud of. That is something I am asking of you. Look into it, please.  There
are real problems out there.

I am not sure about the way that we dealt with those issues,  which  was  to
throw away what was there before. There were a number of orphanages  before.
I know, because I grew up here and they no  longer  exist.  I  am  wondering
whether we should not go back to churches and other people and say  that  we
could give them money if they looked after those  children.  We  could  even
build orphanages among our communities rather than let  children  be  abused
or remain at home. I know there might be problems  there,  but  I  think  we
should not just close our eyes to that, but rather resolve these issues.

In conclusion, I think we have been concentrating mostly on the rural  areas
and rightly so, but we ought not to forget that there are  people  in  urban
areas too. There are children that are hungry;  old  people  who  are  being
abused and there is the issue of HIV/Aids. All these people do  need  access
to the grants that we give and access to welfare services.  It  is  in  that
spirit that as the ANC, on the 1st of June 2003,  we  hope  to  go  to  Port
Elizabeth because of the crises that have taken place in that office to  try
to find ways in which we could assist those communities  to  register  their
children and look after their elderly people. We are working  on  that,  and
we ask churches to be part and parcel and lead  that  process  and  pinpoint
areas in which we can interact. After that, we will possibly move to  Durban
where there is also a crisis and then visit other areas  like  Bloemfontein,
and Tshwane or the East Rand. With those few  words,  Madam  Chairperson,  I
thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I thank you very much, hon Minister. I  think
we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I also think  that  it  is
the responsibility of every member of this House to roll  up  their  sleeves
and help to ensure that our people have  a  better  life.  Thank  you,  once
more. Thank you, also, for the debate.

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
  AFFAIRS - SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PROTOCOL ON EXTRADITION

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Hon  members,  as  a  country  we
firmly believe in the need for, and are strongly  committed  to  pursue  and
implement, a comprehensive integrated and holistic approach to the  question
of peace,  stability  and  security,  which  includes  and  reflects  local,
regional and international dimensions. Furthermore, we believe that  justice
and international law should guide the relations between nations.

In the same way as our economic development depends on growing regional  and
international economic co-operation, so will our security depend on  growing
regional and international  co-operation.  This  need  is  dictated  by  the
emergence of non-state actors as important  players  on  the  global  stage,
such as transnational drug and  organised  crime  cartels  and  the  dangers
posed by economic crimes cause by the increasing weakening of states in  the
developing world, as national barriers are  gradually  broken  down  in  the
face of global forces such as  transnational  corporations  and  speculative
capital.

The only way we can protect ourselves as  a  country  and  region  from  the
negative fallout of these developments  is  if  we  work  together  and  co-
operate more closely around criminal matters,  including  extradition.  Such
co-operation is becoming even more important as we seek to build  peace  and
security as a foundation stone for the African renaissance.

Extradition especially  addresses  the  attempts  of  countries  to  resolve
crimes in which the offender  from  one  country  commits  a  crime  in  his
country and takes refuge in  another  country,  or  the  offender  from  one
country commits a crime in another country and slips back into  his  or  her
own country.

Not all countries have extradition  treaties  with  others,  which  make  it
difficult  to  bring  criminals  to  justice.  South  Africa  is   therefore
fortunate to be able to ratify this Protocol on Extradition  with  our  SADC
neighbours, in addition to the other bilateral extradition treaties  already
concluded with other countries.

In  today's  world  of  transnational  crime  and  international  criminals,
bringing fugitives to justice is a major problem. Modern communications  and
modes of travel make it possible for the criminals to have  their  bases  in
different countries and to operate worldwide.

To prevent them from broadening the scope of their activities and  spreading
their tentacles throughout our SADC region, we need to prepare ourselves  to
challenge  these  criminals  who  recognise  no  borders,  no  laws  and  no
governments. Any delay on our part in reversing  this  serious  menace  will
not only raise the cost in terms of human  lives,  but  also  set  back  the
progress we have made in terms of reconstructing and developing  our  region
after years of war and destruction.

To succeed in this enterprise, SADC countries have to be fully  equipped  to
chase, track down and apprehend fugitives and bring them  to  justice.  This
Protocol on Extradition will make an important contribution in  enabling  us
to meet this challenge. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free  State,  Gauteng,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
  AFFAIRS - SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PROTOCOL ON MUTUAL LEGAL
                       ASSISTANCE IN CRIMINAL MATTERS

Mr  P  A  MATTHEE:  Chairperson,  firstly  hearty  congratulations  on  your
election as Chairperson of  Committees.  We  know  that  you  are  eminently
suitable for this position and that you will do well.  We  look  forward  to
working with you in your new capacity.

I have the honour today on behalf of the Select Committee  on  Security  and
Constitutional Affairs to request this House to approve  that  South  Africa
ratifies this protocol in terms of section 231 of the  Constitution.  It  is
common cause, Chair, that we in the SADC region are all determined to  fight
crime with all the might that we have. I will just very briefly set out  the
scope of application and obligation to provide mutual  legal  assistance  in
terms of this protocol.

In terms of article 2 thereof, the state parties shall  in  accordance  with
this protocol provide each other with the widest possible measure of  mutual
legal assistance  in  criminal  matters.  Mutual  legal  assistance  is  any
assistance given by  the  requested  state  and  respective  investigations,
prosecutions or proceedings in the requesting state in a criminal matter.

Criminal  matters  include  investigations,  prosecutions   or   proceedings
relating to a number of  offences.  Assistance  shall  be  provided  without
regard to whether the conduct which is the subject  of  investigation  would
constitute an offence under the laws of the requested state. And  assistance
to  be  provided  includes  the  serving  of  documents,  the  provision  of
information, search and seizure, taking evidence and all other matters  that
go along to ensure a successful prosecution.

It is intended solely for mutual legal assistance between the state  parties
in the SADC region. It is also important to note, Chair, that this  protocol
shall not apply to the arrest or detention of a person with a  view  to  the
extradition of that person or to the enforcement in the requested  state  of
criminal judgements imposed in the requesting state, except  to  the  extent
committed by the laws of the requested state or the transfer of  persons  in
custody to serve sentences.

The Chief State Law Advisor of International Law and  the  Chief  State  Law
Advisor have indicated that no provisions of this protocol are  in  conflict
with international law or domestic law. Once South Africa has ratified  this
protocol,  an  instrument  of  ratification  will  be  deposited  with   the
executive secretary of the SADC.

The co-operation in terms of this protocol is therefore a mechanism to  help
eliminate cross-border  crimes  in  this  region  and  to  see  to  it  that
criminals in the region are prosecuted successfully. We all hope  and  trust
that this protocol will greatly assist all the  SADC  countries  to  achieve
this goal. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Constritution.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before we conclude,  I  just  want  to

to meet with the  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP  in  his  office  after
