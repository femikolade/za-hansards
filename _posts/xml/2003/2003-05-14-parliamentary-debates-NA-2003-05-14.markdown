                   INTERNATIONAL CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL DAY

                               (Announcement)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  I  wish  to  inform  members  that  a
candlelight ceremony will be held tomorrow at 13:00  in  the  lobby  of  the
National Assembly. This would be in recognition of  the  International  Aids
Candlelight Memorial Day which falls on Sunday, 18  May  2003.  This  is  to
honour the memory of those who were lost to Aids; to show support for  those
living with HIV/Aids; and to raise awareness of  the  disease  and  mobilise
communities in the fight against HIV/Aids.

This year's theme for the candlelight memorial is: ``Remembering the  cause,
renewing our  commitment.''  This  will  allow  all  members  to  share  the
occasion with one another, determine how HIV/Aids  has  affected  our  lives
and discuss how  the  community  can  play  a  role  in  the  prevention  of
HIV/Aids, as well as in the education, support, care for  and  treatment  of
those affected by the disease.

The 2003 theme  also  encourages  members  to  share  personal  visions  and
describes how they can strive to make  that  vision  a  reality.  As  public
representatives, you are therefore requested to  join  hands  in  the  fight
against HIV and Aids, and to be in the forefront of  remembering  the  cause
and renewing the commitment.

The House adjourned at 17:07.
