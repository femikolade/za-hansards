                      SHORTFALLS IN AMBULANCE SERVICES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor -


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die aanvaarde sisteem van primêre gesondheidsorg grootliks op 'n
           verwysingsisteem  berus  wat  primêr  afhanklik  is  van   goeie
           ambulans- en  vervoerdienste  en  dat  dit  in  die  uitgebreide
           platteland nog méér  van  toepassing  is  as  in  die  stedelike
           gebiede;


       (b)  daar 'n geweldige behoefte aan die lewering van  nooddienste  is
           veral as gevolg van die feit dat daar so 'n hoë ongeluksyfer  op
           die land se paaie is;


       (c)  die Minister van Gesondheid die volgende kommerwekkende  tekorte
           ten opsigte van ambulansdienste  in  die  onderskeie  provinsies
           bekend gemaak het: In die Oos-Kaap is daar  'n  geraamde  tekort
           aan 160 ambulanse en slegs 26%  van  die  huidige  ambulanse  is
           bruikbaar en hulle is gemiddeld 10  jaar  oud,  terwyl  KwaZulu-
           Natal 'n tekort aan 600 ambulanse  het  en  slegs  50%  van  die
           huidige ambulanse bruikbaar is; en


       (d)  volgens die  Minister  ál  die  provinsies  bykomende  ambulanse
           benodig om in hul huidige behoeftes te voorsien; en


  (2) die Regering versoek om  in  samewerking  met  provinsiale  regerings
       onmiddellik aan hierdie tekorte aandag te gee aangesien dit veral die
       armste mense is wat die swaarste getref word.

Voorstel goedgekeur ooreenkomstig artikel 65 van die Grondwet.  (Translation
of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the accepted system of primary health care is based in the  main
           on a  referral  system  that  is  primarily  dependent  on  good
           ambulance  and  transportation  services,  which  is  even  more
           applicable to the vast rural areas than to the urban areas;


       (b)  there is an immense need for the delivery of emergency services,
           in particular owing to the  fact  that  there  is  such  a  high
           accident rate on the country's roads;


       (c)  the Minister of Health  has  announced  the  following  alarming
           shortfalls in respect of ambulance services  in  the  respective
           provinces: In the Eastern Cape there is an  estimated  shortfall
           of 160 ambulances, and only 26% of the  current  ambulances  are
           servicable at an average age of 10  years,  while  KwaZulu-Natal
           has a shortfall of 600 ambulances, and only 50% of  the  current
           ambulances are servicable; and


       (d)  according to the Minister all of the provinces  need  additional
           ambulances in order to meet their current demands; and


  (2)  requests  the  Government,  in  co-operation  with  the   provincial
       governments, to pay immediate attention to  these  shortfalls,  since
       the poorest of the people in particular are being affected  worst  of
       all.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.]

                     FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES IN SRI LANKA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes with concern the floods and landslides that hit Sri Lanka;


  (2) further notes that these are the worst floods to hit  the  island  in
       half a century  with  the  death  toll  of  more  than  230  and  the
       displacement of more than 200 000 people;


  (3) commends the Indian government for its swift response in  dispatching
       a ship with a rescue helicopter, a team of doctors, divers,  medicine
       and food, as well as the Norwegian government, the International  Red
       Cross and all other relief agencies for their support;


  (4) supports the call for  greater  international  support  to  help  the
       country cope with the millions of survivors now facing starvation and
       the threat of airborne diseases; and


  (5) assures the government and people  of  Sri  Lanka  of  our  continued
       support as they struggle to deal with the aftermath of this  national
       tragedy.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       SCRAPPING OF RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the ACDP rejects calls by Government  officials  to  scrap
       religious public holidays, such as Good  Friday  and  Christmas  Day,
       which are sacred to Christians who  are  in  the  majority  in  South
       Africa and who also need to have their rights respected;


  (2) notes that, in fact,  the  ACDP  would  like  to  see  Ascension  Day
       returned to the calendar of public holidays; and


  (3) calls on the Government to allay fears in this regard by  making  the
       policy position clear, by way of a statement by a senior Minister.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there an objection to the Motion?  There  is
an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of motion.

                      MINDLESS ACT OF TERROR IN MOROCCO

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  denounces  the   mindless   act   of   terror   in   Morocco   which
       indiscriminately killed and maimed scores of innocent people;


  (2) believes that terror acts aimed at the deliberate killing of innocent
       civilians can never be rationalised or justified as a result  of  any
       situation or circumstance;


  (3) extends its condolences to the families of the victims; and


  (4) further extends it heartfelt support to the government of Morocco  in
       its efforts to track down and prosecute those  responsible  for  this
       cowardly act.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           DEATH OF CARYN LINDESAY, DAUGHTER OF LEADING CAMPAIGNER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the  death  of  Carlyn  Lindesay,  daughter  of  a
       leading campaigner against women and child abuse;
  (2) notes that Lindesay was beaten to death with a hammer  in  her  Parow
       flat this weekend and was found in a pool of blood by her mother;


  (3) believes that a man will appear in the Bellville Magistrates Court in
       connection with the matter; and


  (4) extends its condolences to her family, friends and relatives.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any other member  wishing  to  move  a
motion without notice? There is none. We proceed  therefore.  The  Secretary
will read the first Order of the Day. [Interjections.]

Yes, hon Raju?

Mr N M RAJU: [Inaudible.]  Sorry,  Madam  Chair,  I  had  a  motion  without
notice.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I did put the question. There was no  response.
I'm afraid we have proceeded beyond that point, Mr Raju. But  I  will  allow
your motion. I would urge you in future to ignore Ms Thompson  and  actually
concentrate on the Chair. [Laughter.]

                   SA FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION'S INTERVENTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with  consternation  and  exasperation  that  the  SA  Football
       Association and the 2010 soccer World  Cup  bid  committee  found  it
       necessary to intervene in the selection of the Bafana Bafana squad to
       play England in a friendly in Durban on Thursday, 22 May 2003;


  (2) further notes that this intervention was occasioned by  the  national
       coach Shakes Mashaba's inexplicable omission of South  African  stars
       such as Lucas Radebe, Quinton Fortune, Shaun Bartlett, Benni McCarthy
       and Siyabonga Nomvete from the Bafana Bafana team to play  against  a
       formidable  England  team  that  includes  world-class  stars   David
       Beckham, Michael Owen, Emile Heskey, David James and Rio Ferdinand;


  (3) believes that such a lack of planning and communication bodes ill for
       South Africa's World Cup bid as it sends out  the  wrong  signals  to
       fans and sponsors to favour the bid; and


  (4) calls on Safa to refrain from taking ad hoc decisions in the  conduct
       of its affairs so as not to jeopardise the 2010 World Cup bid by  SA.
       [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Is  there  an  objection  to  that  motion?
[Interjections.] That is a spectacle I have not seen in this  House  before.
[Laughter.] There is an objection. The motion without notice will  therefore
become a notice of motion.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 20 - Sport and Recreation South Africa:

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Madam Chairperson and hon  members  of
this House, at this historic moment in our society's development this is  my
fourth budget speech to be delivered in this august House. Not only  are  we
on the brink of our  third  democratic  elections  after  the  end  of  this
financial year, we are also on the verge of entering the  second  decade  of
freedom from apartheid domination.

I am introducing a budget of R225 million, the largest ever  for  Sport  and
Recreation. It represents  significant  growth  relative  to  when  I  first
assumed this portfolio. While  it  represents  a  satisfying  275%  increase
compared to the 1998-99 budget, it is still not nearly enough  for  what  is
needed to place  our  country  on  an  even  footing  with  our  traditional
adversaries in sport.

Moreover,  the  major  part  of  the  budget,  R129  million,  comprises  an
allocation from the poverty relief, infrastructure creation and  job  summit
pool that could be transferred to the Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government as part of the municipal infrastructure grant at the end of  this
financial year. That will result in a 53% decline in the budget  over  which
we will have direct control.

For  this  year,  however,  with  the  Building  for  Sport  and  Recreation
Programme allocation removed, the  remaining  R96 million  is  split  up  as
follows: Programme 1: Administration -  R18,187 million;  and  Programme  2:
Policy, Funding and Liaison - R78,075 million. With regard to  Programme  2,
the funds available for  sports  development  amount  to  R44 million.  That
gives an indication of how underfunded sport really is.

I am, however, firmly of the opinion that despite  setbacks  every  now  and
then, the tide has indeed turned for us in sport  and  recreation.  While  I
sometimes have to lament the slow pace of change in sport,  I  am  convinced
that the imminent release of the Sports Transformation  Charter  will  bring
us back on course to ensure  rapid  movement  from  the  entrenched  racial,
gender and spatial rigidities of the past, and, indeed, turn the  tide  into
a flood.

I am happy to note significant progress in the  representative  profiles  of
certain sports. I have so far resisted the option of legislating  on  sports
transformation, offering all national federations  instead  the  opportunity
to reconsider  their  own  options  for  driving  the  initiative  in  their
structures. We must transform; there is  no  alternative.  If,  however,  we
fail to make progress, I will have to reconsider my options.

Sport has, in the past, been at  the  forefront  of  transformation  in  our
society. I cannot allow that advantage, the moral high ground that  we  once
occupied, to be lost. That would amount to a betrayal of the many  who  have
dedicated so much, some even their lives, to the cause of  ensuring  a  fair
dispensation for all in sport in our  country.  National  federations  often
accuse  their  provincial  affiliates  of   letting   them   down   in   the
transformation initiative. I  trust  that  this  House  will  influence  the
provinces to fulfil their obligations in this respect.

The 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup has come and gone, and has  meant  a  lot  to
our society. While the performance of the Proteas  in  the  competition  was
disappointing to local supporters, the tournament itself  was  a  resounding
success. I want to congratulate the organising  committee,  led  by  Dr  Ali
Bacher. I want especially to single out the support which obtained from  the
provincial and local authorities, without whose assistance  the  competition
would never have been able to take place. The  co-operation  that  prevailed
between the three spheres of government and the private  sector  presents  a
model that should be emulated in similar endeavours that we  may  embark  on
in the future. The 2010 soccer World Cup bid should draw on it.
I also want to extend a special word of congratulations  to  the  mayors  of
our cities who hosted fund-raising banquets to support  charities  of  their
choice. These were certainly noble gestures that serve to  prove  how  sport
and sports events can be used to leverage resources for other causes.

The socioeconomic benefits of the Cricket World Cup have  also  proven  that
sport can contribute significantly to addressing the major  challenges  that
we face as a country. The consequences of  the  huge  influx  of  spectators
from abroad  have  assisted  us  as  a  department  and  as  an  institution
generally to address one of the  major  challenges  of  our  time  in  South
Africa, that of job creation and poverty relief. It is estimated that  about
20 000 foreign spectators visited our shores to watch the ICC Cricket  World
Cup first hand. That translates into close to 3 500 jobs. Initial  estimates
also indicate that the economic benefits  of  the  event  amounted  to  some
R1 billion. This proves that sport has a role to play in  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty.
We recently hosted a successful conference on developing a strategy  in  the
bidding for and the hosting of major events in our country.  The  conference
was well attended by representatives of local and provincial authorities.  I
am happy to confirm that we reached consensus about approaching bids  in  an
orderly fashion to ensure that we develop the  capacity,  incrementally,  to
host larger and more complex events to enable  us,  eventually,  to  present
the biggest spectacle of world sport, the Olympic Games, some  time  in  the
future. During the conference we committed ourselves  to  prioritising  bids
to host the 2010 soccer World Cup, the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and to  give
consideration to the 2020 Olympic Games.

Of course, events take place in cities and towns, and local  and  provincial
authorities have a critical role to play in any international event that  we
plan to host. I am encouraged by the trend in certain  national  federations
to host some of their international events in cities and towns that  do  not
often have such opportunities. Examples are the last two Davis  Cup  matches
that  were  hosted  in  Nelspruit  and  Polokwane  respectively,  the  World
Shooting Championships in Limpopo and the  Bafana  Bafana  matches  in  Port
Elizabeth, with a big game coming to East London in June.

We have now confirmed and launched our domestic bid to host the  2010  World
Cup. Government has expressed its support for the bid  and  will  make  sure
that it provides all the guarantees that Fifa requires.  This  time  we  are
sure it is Africa's turn, as Fifa approved the  rotation  system  last  year
and our continent will start the process. South Africa will  be  up  against
Nigeria, Libya,  Tunisia,  Egypt  and  Morocco  in  the  race  to  host  the
competition. While we are quietly confident, we will not  underestimate  our
African counterparts.

Again, the local and provincial spheres of government are  the  cornerstones
of both the bidding and hosting processes. The support  of  this  House  for
both  processes  will  therefore  be  critical.  Cabinet  has  set   up   an
interministerial committee, with Deputy President  Jacob  Zuma  as  convenor
and me as deputy convenor in order to oversee Government's  input  into  the
bid process. The bid committee has  also  been  invited  to  make  a  formal
presentation to this interministerial committee in due course.

Thursday this week heralds the launch of the international campaign  of  the
bid when our national team  plays  England  in  an  international  match  in
Durban. I am sure that hon members have concerns about a  number  of  issues
relating to this match, issues that have dominated the media over  the  past
few days. I share those concerns. I had an urgent meeting with Safa and  the
bid committee officials upon their return to the country. The  NCOP  is  the
first structure to know about this, so you are very privileged. [Laughter.]

So, on Friday evening I had a meeting with Safa and the bid committee.  This
meeting was also attended by the national  coach,  Bra  ``Shakes'',  Ephraim
Mashaba, and the national team manager, ``Screamer'' Shabalala. By  now  you
will  be  aware  that  all  parties  concerned  have  reached  agreement  on
Thursday's match and on future matches requested by the  bid  committee.  It
is now important for us to focus on the bigger picture, which  is  to  rally
broad support for hosting the 2010 World Cup in our country. I will  respond
in due course to Mr Raju, but not now. I don't  have  the  time  to  respond
now.I need to build up steam so that I  am  confrontational  enough  when  I
respond to that. [Laughter.] I never shy away  from  confrontation.  I  love
it.

From a departmental perspective,  we  regard  our  Building  for  Sport  and
Recreation Programme as our flagship. It also constitutes  an  area  through
which we co-operate the closest with  the  local,  regional  and  provincial
authorities. At this  stage,  there  is  not  yet  clarity  on  whether  the
Building for Sport and Recreation Programme will continue  to  be  a  stand-
alone programme or whether it will become part of the MIG.

Cabinet took a decision to consolidate all infrastructure-creation  projects
under the MIG. But, the  National  Treasury  is  still  in  the  process  of
auditing us, as the BSRP, with a view to  making  a  recommendation  on  our
continued independent existence.
I would, of course, like to see the programme  remain  with  my  department.
Municipalities have many  other  priorities  on  which  to  deliver.  Sports
facilities, I have established, do not feature high on their agendas.  I  am
of the opinion that we will face strenuous challenges in competing  for  MIG
funds as sport and recreation facilities  tend  not  to  be  priorities  for
local authorities, given the many other pressing basic needs that they  have
to cater for.

I will therefore engage my colleagues in Cabinet  in  order  to  retain  the
Building for Sport and Recreation Programme in my department, failing  which
I would like to ensure that an amount is ring-fenced for  facility  creation
and upgrading to guarantee that we  do  not  fall  further  behind  in  this
important project, which is aimed directly at improving the quality of  life
of our young people and citizens.

Our impact extends well beyond the creation or upgrading of  facilities;  it
also includes the skills that  we  transfer  to  the  people  that  we  give
employment to. It makes them more saleable in the tough  job  market,  while
the  community  sports  councils  and  clubs  that  we  establish  and   the
empowerment of local councils in managing  the  sports  facilities  that  we
build further contribute to the empowerment initiative.

We try to foster a spirit of entrepreneurship in the  communities  in  which
we build facilities by encouraging informal trading where  and  when  sports
events take  place,  for  example  Athlone  Stadium  when  we  launched  our
national bid. If people were around Athlone Stadium  they  would  have  seen
the informal trade that was going on there. It was quite beautiful.  At  all
the facilities, all over the country, we do the same.

We have also commenced and will continue  to  use  the  project  for  sports
contribution to the process of symbolic reparation by naming the  facilities
that we build and upgrade after fallen heroes in the areas where  we  build.
Of course, we will never build a facility and give it  a  name  of  somebody
who lived during that time and belonged to that regime which  stank  like  a
polecat.

Our BSRP, our project of building, commands a budget of R129 million in  the
coming financial year. The 113 projects that have been  identified  will  be
spread as follows across the country: Western Cape - R8,71  million  for  13
facilities; Eastern Cape - R22,8 million for 25 facilities; KwaZulu-Natal  -
R23,16 million  for  17  facilities;  Mpumalanga  -  R9,91 million  for   12
facilities; Gauteng - R10,8 million  for  10  facilities;  Limpopo  -  R19,2
million for 9 facilities; North West -  R10,25 million  for  10  facilities;
Free State - haak Vrystaat! - R9,66 million for 15 facilities;  and  in  the
Northern Cape - R6,57 million for two facilities.

We will build in communities as diverse as Ngqamakwe in  the  Eastern  Cape;
and in Petrus Steyn which started Ngqushwa actually - you should  be  seeing
that, hon member Kondlo. We did. That's where we  launched  this  programme.
Regarding Petrus Steyn in the Free State, I was in  Trompsburg  recently  to
open another one. We have built in Boipatong in Gauteng; Umvoti in  KwaZulu-
Natal; Machado in Mpumalanga; Ga-Segonyana in the Northern Cape;  and  Nduli
in the Western Cape.

I would like to implore the provinces and municipalities to ensure  that  we
deliver timeously on these projects. We must extend the  building  phase  of
the  projects  during  which  people  in  the  communities  have  access  to
employment, which is the primary purpose of this exercise. In the past,  the
building phase was squeezed into  three  months,  limiting  the  period  for
employment. Despite that, we have managed to provide jobs and pay more  than
6 500 people an average of more than R4 500 during the  building  phases  of
the projects over the past two years.  Over  the  past  10  years,  we  have
managed  to  spend  R450 million  in  total  on   building   and   upgrading
facilities.

While that started to make a difference in people's  lives,  it  constitutes
less than 10% of the estimated existing  shortfall  in  facility  provision,
especially in disadvantaged communities. Moreover, we must  start  to  build
more  than  just  basic  facilities.  How,  for  example,  can   we   ensure
representivity in  swimming  teams  -  an  important  consideration  in  the
transformation initiative - when we have no swimming pools in  disadvantaged
communities? We don't  have  these  swimming  pools  so  we  have  to  start
building them, because the swimming team  that  we  send  overseas  or  that
participates in our games here at home is still lily-white.

We launched our Letsema campaign on 3 February this year  in  Cape  Town  by
cleaning up the Langa Stadium with generous help from MPs who  are  here  in
the NCOP and in the NA, and from schoolchildren and the community. We  trust
that  this  launch  will  provide  the  impetus  for  similar   efforts   in
communities around the country.

Sport and Recreation SA has been identified to  play  a  leading  role  with
regard to implementing a  people's  contract  for  moral  regeneration.  Our
various projects, some of which are already up and  running,  are  aimed  at
the youth, especially those in the high crime nodes.

The launch of our Young Champions project  took  place  in  Mamelodi  on  18
January 2003  to  which  we  attracted  more  than  2 000  participants  and
involved   a   cross-section   of   national,   provincial   and   community
organisations. We will launch the project in all the remaining provinces  in
due course. The next one will be Cape Town in June.

The programme is aimed at setting up sustainable  local  sports  leagues  in
the identified areas into which young people can be drawn  with  a  view  to
ensuring not only that they participate in wholesome sport  and  recreation,
but that we are able to identify talented players  that  can  be  channelled
into the competitive mainstream.

While the broad context  of  our  project  is,  of  course,  urban  renewal,
integrated, sustainable rural development and social crime  prevention,  our
purpose with  this  initiative  is  at  least  twofold:  one,  to  focus  on
addressing the problems of substance abuse, including  problems  related  to
the misuse of alcohol and other substances; and, two, to aim  at  generating
social cohesion which will serve in a  representative  capacity  to  address
some of the challenges that we face  as  a  nation  -  that  is,  the  Young
Champions programme. You know the song: Stand up for the champions  -  those
are the young champions that we want to stand up  for.  [Laughter.]  I  will
teach hon members that song after I have finished.

One of the issues that  has  stood  out  as  a  sore  thumb  for  me  during
interventions  with  all  stakeholders  in  sport,  and  also  from  my  own
assessment, is the slow progress with regard to ensuring  equity  for  women
in sport. Women and Sport SA has had its flaws and is currently  dormant.  I
have accordingly decided  to  reallocate  the  responsibilities  to  the  SA
Sports Commission in which a commissioner has been  identified  to  champion
the cause of women.

We have three women there - Desiree Ellis, Gogo Manqoyi and Hajera  Kajee  -
who will be championing the participation of women in sport.  I  have  given
them a mandate, clear guidelines and targets for progressing this  important
priority of Government, in which we as sport once again  provide  a  visible
face of progress in this regard. It is a challenge that we all face and  one
that I hope we can live up to in the future.

I am happy to announce to this House that I have also reached  an  agreement
with my colleague, the Minister of Education, Prof Kader  Asmal,  on  school
sport. Our respective departments are working on the  details.  In  essence,
we  have  agreed  that  the  Department  of   Education   will   take   full
responsibility  for  the  curricula  aspects  of  school  sport,   including
physical education and the extracurricular programme of the school.

My own department and  provincial  departments  responsible  for  sport,  in
partnership  with  the  national  and  provincial   federations,   will   be
responsible for all competitive and representative school sport  programmes.
Moreover, National Treasury has notified me  that  from  next  year  onwards
resources for the LoveLife Games will be channelled through  my  department.
These developments will go a long way not only  to  consolidate  the  vexing
question of resourcing school sport, but also to ensure that this  important
component of the overall sports development continuum is properly aligned.

On Saturday, while on a  bus  going  to  Tat'  uSisulu's  funeral,  I  heard
someone phoning their children to make sure that they polished  their  boots
and played very well.  The  mother  was  really  whispering  to  the  child,
saying: ``Play well and really make it.  Make  it.''  The  father  was  also
assisting. I am not sure if I should say this, but it was good to  hear  and
spy on Madam Chair and her husband  really  encouraging  their  children  to
play sport. [Laughter.] Thank you very much for that. You did not know  that
I listened. I did.

I am very well aware that certain schools  refuse  to  introduce  soccer  to
their sports programmes. This is done under the pretext  that  they  do  not
have facilities for soccer and that there is no interest in soccer, or  that
they do not have coaches. But  these  same  schools  have  numerous  playing
fields for other codes of sport. In fact, they pay coaches in sports such  a
hockey, rugby  and  cricket.  I  would  like  to  make  an  appeal  to  such
institutions that prevent all children who  have  an  interest  in  football
from developing their skills to reconsider their position and stance.  After
all, soccer is the country's national sport; that we cannot deny. So we  are
giving out a friendly warning to those schools. My  Presbyterian  upbringing
says  I  should  just  give  them  a  friendly  warning.  That  is  what  my
Presbyterian upbringing says.

That brings me to a major theme of my budget speech for this  year.  I  have
decided to dedicate my entire tenure to the transformation of sport. I  have
already referred to the extent to which sport is  a  visible  reflection  of
the progress that we  are  making  in  the  transformation  of  our  society
generally. I am of the view that the image that we present  at  the  moment,
especially in terms of representivity, is not a good one. Surely, this  must
be an indictment of all of us who are committed to a new South  Africa  that
is based on inclusiveness, equality, and fairness.

The transformation agenda will remain a priority for the rest of my term  in
office. I remain dedicated to that  cause.  As  I  have  said  before,  this
matter is non-negotiable. I  will  never  compromise  on  it.  Whatever  the
newspapers write about me, Balfour,  threatening  this  or  not  threatening
that, I will not compromise on that. They can write  and  write  until  they
get tired of writing. [Interjections.] What I have become aware  of  through
the various workshops  on  transformation  that  we  have  held  around  the
country is that the initiative enjoys overwhelming grass-roots support.

This is what  counts  for  me:  that  transformation  is  supported  by  the
majority of people in our country. The transformation charter  will  be  the
culmination of an exercise that is taking me around the country,  consulting
with the people  at  the  grass-roots  level.  I  will  be  concluding  this
programme of transformation imbizos in each of  the  provinces  during  this
year. The national federations  have  agreements  with  me  with  regard  to
development,  transformation  and  representivity  that  I  expect  them  to
honour. I will be watching  their  performances  relative  to  the  proposed
transformation charter very closely.

As I said earlier, I have taken  cognisance  of  and  laud  the  efforts  of
certain federations who have committed themselves to  the  cause  and  whose
teams are beginning to reflect our society more adequately. With  the  Super
12 rugby series having been just completed, our national team now goes  into
preparation mode for test matches  against  Scotland  and  Argentina,  which
will be followed by the Tri-Nations series. These matches will prepare  them
for the Rugby World Cup later this year.

In mentioning this, I want to reiterate that, as Government, we  have  never
forced national federations  to  implement  the  quota  system  in  national
teams.  I  repeat  this:  We  have  never  forced  national  federations  to
implement the quota system in national teams. This applies to rugby  in  the
same way that it applies to cricket or  any  other  code,  because  that  is
where you get a lot of people writing us letters and what have you.  What  I
do with those letters sometimes is to sit with  a  red  pen  and  give  them
marks. I then send them back to the writers, especially  when  I  know  that
they are the remnants of the apartheid system. I don't have time to  respond
to some of those.

But this does not imply that all-white national teams  will  ever  take  the
field as representatives of our  people.  That  would  be  unacceptable  and
would mean that transformation within sport would have  failed.  I  will  be
meeting with rugby representatives  soon  to  receive  an  update  of  their
programmes.

Earlier today cricket made a presentation  to  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Sport and Recreation in the National Assembly on  their  position  regarding
transformation. Members will recall that I appointed a committee of  inquiry
into cricket claims that the sport has  transformed  sufficiently,  allowing
them to move away from the quota system. Today, cricket says that they  have
not transformed enough. That is what they said this morning. They  have  not
transformed enough. So, they still need to do a lot  to  transform.  I  have
had that report,  which  I  am  talking  about,  for  a  while  and  cricket
representatives have acknowledged it and are welcome  to  work  with  me  on
that report.

They have consistently displayed reluctance  to  meet  with  MECs  regarding
that report. I raised it today  with  them  and  they  admitted  that  their
reluctance was based on pure ignorance. Therefore they have agreed  that  we
will meet with MECs to look at that report and push it forward.  As  members
of this House you have  a  specific  interest  and  responsibility  in  your
respective provinces. I would  like  to  invite  you  to  engage  provincial
cricket authorities on the contents of that report and to test the  validity
of the claims that they made. It is  important  that  we  engage  all  South
Africans in our cities, towns, rural communities - Lusikisiki, Mqanduli  and
Sterkspruit - on whether they agree with and support the  claims  that  were
made by cricket representatives.

The process involving the task team is now at  a  reporting  stage.  I  have
instructed that task team to look into the practical  implications  of  that
report. They have submitted their report to me. I will be informing  Cabinet
about the proposed action we should take. The latter report, that  also  has
other far-reaching consequences for sport and  recreation  in  our  country,
proposes the streamlining of the governance  of  the  institution  in  South
Africa to ensure that we optimally utilise the limited resources we have  at
our disposal.

We have also prioritised some sports in terms of  funding  so  that  we  can
fund sports that give us exactly what we want -  the  mass-based  aspect  of
the sport, the competitiveness of the sport,  the  international  nature  of
the sport, and how  it  attracts  young  people  from  all  corners  of  our
country. I hope and  trust  therefore  that  this  House  will  support  the
initiatives we have taken and that the Select  Committee  on  Education  and
Recreation will encourage and oversee the whole process together with us.

In the same context, I have recognised the need for national and  provincial
federations to be run  more  professionally.  Federations  are  the  primary
delivery agents for sport and recreation in our country. They  work  at  the
coalface. Indeed, some of them are currently facing serious  problems  as  a
result of divisions within their ranks. Very often I am  expected  to  react
to media reports on such issues. This is not fair. It should be  up  to  the
administrators to come forward should they need my assistance, as Safa  did,
as Shakes and as everybody did over this whole issue.  These  problems  will
have to be rooted out, because the interests of athletes are suffering as  a
consequence of them.

I have already  sanctioned  the  appointment  of  an  interim  committee  in
softball that will prepare for elections in the sport  towards  the  end  of
this year. By next month, I will be hosting a meeting for  karate  in  order
to put in place a new  national  controlling  body  of  karate.  I  am  also
facilitating the introduction of  professional  basketball  in  the  country
after disputes between Basketball SA and the Premier Basketball League  that
resulted in court action.

The  Sports  Commission  together  with  host  province  Gauteng,  in   this
instance, hosted the inaugural South African Games in  Pretoria  last  year.
The biannual event was an overwhelming success, and will be  hosted  by  the
Eastern Cape next year. It can only grow from strength to strength and  will
provide our budding sport stars with opportunities to display their  talents
and pit them against those of their peers from across the  country.  The  SA
Games is an important component of sports development  in  our  country  and
must be supported with a view to developing it into  the  prestigious  event
it deserves to be. This House and the select committee  must  help  in  that
process.

I want to talk very briefly on the sports tourism that  we  saw  during  the
Cricket World Cup. Tourists pitched up and we had a  lot  of  people  coming
in. There is a report that we commissioned that will be coming out soon.  It
will show us what the Cricket World Cup has done for  our  country.  We  are
working on that report with Madame Cheryl Carolus and you will  get  a  copy
of that report.

Lastly, we stand on the brink of another exciting year in sport,  both  from
the perspective of progressing the institution of sport along  the  path  of
transformation  within  our  country  and  from  the  participation  of  our
athletes and teams in competitions at home  and  abroad.  During  my  recent
visit to Abuja, Nigeria, to attend  the  General  Assembly  of  the  Supreme
Council of Sport in Africa, I had the opportunity to inspect some  of  their
facilities that they have built in Abuja  for  the  8th  All  Africa  Games.
Members should remember that we hosted the 7th All Africa  Games.  They  are
going to host the eighth.

Our athletes can look forward to an exciting  All  Africa  Games  tournament
and in some of the  best  facilities  in  the  world,  including  the  Games
village that meets the highest international  standards.  We  have  a  proud
record to defend and depend on Team South Africa, as we now call our  teams,
as we go out. That is probably the best thing we can do rather than  calling
our teams by different names. Any team  that  we  send  out  is  Team  South
Africa. Team South Africa will be defending. We are  the  champions  of  the
All Africa Games. So, we will be going to Abuja with a  huge  contingent  of
about 370 athletes to defend and keep our flag flying.

We look forward to the President's Cup, regarding those who play golf.  That
will take place in George in November. We do hope that  the  big  guns  like
Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, Veejay Singh  and  others  will  come
and play at the President's Cup. Of course, our own President  will  be  the
one who will lead the charge in that. We wish the local authority of  George
and the province of the Western Cape well in their efforts to plan  for  and
host the event. We look forward to a top class  and  successful  competition
that will see some of the world's foremost golfers gracing our shores.

The netball team is in Australia at the moment for a series  of  matches  in
preparation for the world cup that is due to be played in Jamaica  in  July.
They are doing very well, I must say, even though we have had to  send  back
two athletes, Bronwyn Bock and another netballer because they were injured.

Our softball team returned home last  week  as  Southern  African  champions
after the Zone 6 games in Botswana. Our national cricket team for  the  tour
of England for next month was announced yesterday. I am sure  that  you  saw
and heard about that. We wish the captain, my captain Graeme Smith, and  the
rest of the boys the best of luck. If you look at  the  composition  of  the
teams, both for the one-day international and the test squad, you will  find
that the balance is very, very good. I am quite happy with that. I  do  wish
them luck as they go on to beat England on their home soil.

Athletics SA has also announced a formidable marathon team to join the  rest
of our athletic squad for the IAAF World Championships due  to  be  held  in
Paris in August. Of course, I must admit that leaving  out  Hezekiel  Sepeng
is not because of just anything but  because  of  disciplinary  proceedings.
Some of these athletes don't stick to discipline. We need to make sure  that
they do.

Our women hockey team played in Potchefstroom against Great Britain  and  we
went on to draw 2 - 2 with them in our test match. We are now preparing  for
a  fourth  test  series  against  England.  I  would  like  to   convey   my
congratulations to the Lions team on retaining their Vodacom  Cup  title  in
the final against die Blou Bulle on Saturday, and, of course, to the  Border
Bulldogs - Who let the dogs out? - on  going  out  and  really  ripping  the
Griquas apart with a score of 35 to nil. They then became the  champions  in
the Vodacom Shield on Saturday. Support for that game was fantastic at  Absa
Park. If anyone still doubted the wealth  of  black  rugby  talent  in  that
region, Eastern Cape and Border, that match should convince  those  skeptics
that we have the talent - a pool of very talented rugby players.

Lastly, I would like to thank everybody who has contributed to  making  this
past year interesting, enjoyable,  exciting  and  successful  in  sport.  In
particular,  I  want  to  thank  the  Select  Committee  on  Education   and
Recreation and uTat' uKgware for his dedication and that of his team.  Thank
you for your unflinching support. Keep up the good work. I am firmly of  the
opinion that, as in other institutions of our society,  the  tide  has  also
turned in sport and recreation. It is our joint responsibility to turn  that
tide into a flood for the benefit of all our people.

I see that two of my daughters, Nellie and Bhumbhum, are  sitting  up  there
in the public gallery. I normally don't have my daughters  coming  to  watch
me deliver a speech. Stand up please. ``Stand up for the champions, for  the
champions, stand up!'' [Laughter.] Thank you, Madam Chair. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, Minister. I  am  not  sure  how  the
Minister is often labelled in public reports, but I  am  sure  that  we  now
have a singing Minister. [Laughter.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister of Sport and Recreation, MECs,  the
chairperson of the select committee and distinguished guests, we would  like
to extend our  congratulations  to  the  all-conquering  SA  Rugby  Football
Union's Under-19  team  on  their  success  in  the  recent  IRB  World  Cup
competition.

We are convinced that their success can only be attributed  to  the  sincere
all-round commitment to nonracial sport of the ANC and that of the  Ministry
of Sport and  Recreation  in  particular.  We  remain  confident  that  this
particular success will resonate in other sporting codes vis-à-vis those  of
females, the disabled and veterans.

The budget before us today represents a major shift in control by Sport  and
Recreation SA to a budget more geared towards delivery  at  a  local  level.
Although we in the National Council of Provinces do, in  fact,  support  the
transfer of funds to  municipalities  to  support  poverty  relief  and  the
municipality infrastructure grant, we are nevertheless concerned  about  the
capacity of some municipalities to budget and spend  according  to  national
and provincial priorities.

We believe that provinces are now in  a  much  better  position  to  address
Government's  objective  of  pushing  back   the   frontiers   of   poverty,
vulnerability and equality. It is therefore imperative that  in  the  spirit
of co-operative governance, which is  provided  for  in  section  5  of  the
Constitution, the role of provinces is  not  discounted  and  overlooked  in
this decision.

At this juncture in our  transformation,  we  are  still  subjected  to  the
prejudice of individual administrators, both from the former  anti-apartheid
sports movement and the established federations. The current  Vodacom  Rugby
Super 12 competition is a case in point, and this extends to the Currie  Cup
competition. The lack  of  influence  and  expertise  of  former  stars  and
administrators from the anti-apartheid fold remains a  bone  of  contention.
Similarly, the influence and control  of  former  die-hard  apartheid  rugby
players and administrators, specifically  in  rugby,  remain  controversial.
However, we are not arguing for them to abscond or to be abandoned. What  we
would like to see is a fusion of the former protagonists.

The national cricket team to tour England has  been  announced.  I  want  to
wish the selected players well, as the Minister has done.  The  Proteas  did
not have a good run in the World Cup, but let us hope  that  their  fortunes
can  be  turned  around.  It  is  still   important   that   as   provincial
representatives  we  engage  the  report  of  the  commission  of   inquiry,
appointed by the hon Minister, on transformation in cricket.

Too many provinces still lag far behind when it comes to  transformation  in
cricket. In fact,  in  the  report  a  number  of  provinces  admitted  that
transformation had not had the expected success. In so far as  the  rest  of
the federations are concerned, transformation remains  a  vexing  issue.  At
provincial level, it seems  as  if  considerable  progress  is  being  made.
Unfortunately, this only extends to amateur sports, whereas in  professional
sports it is being sacrificed at the expense of the lure of lucre, money.

We are, however, not unaware of the noble efforts of  the  majority  of  our
provincial federations in dealing with the wrongs of the past.  Netball,  in
particular, has gone from strength to strength. It is indeed  heartening  to
witness young women from all backgrounds slugging it out on  the  tarmac  or
on the SABC TV programme Mabaleng  on  a  Saturday  afternoon.  I  think  we
should mention that this coverage of provincial netball is  sponsored  by  a
large banking group.

South Africans are in the grip of the bid for the 2010 football  World  Cup.
We would like to congratulate the Ministry of  Sport  and  Recreation,  Safa
and its Western Cape branch, and the City of Cape Town on their  spectacular
launch of the South African bid to host this event,  which  is  by  far  the
greatest sporting event on earth. It is a pity that the result  did  not  go
our way in the match against Jamaica. We trust that unanimity  on  a  single
African bid will be  reached  soon  and,  if  it  is,  that  it  enjoys  the
unanimous support of all African countries.

Although we would like to see South Africa announced as  the  host  country,
it is imperative that at this point in time we advance  the  ideals  of  the
continent,  ``Afrika  ke  nako''[Now  is  the  time.]  This  event  and  the
subsequent economic and development spin-offs will provide sure impetus  for
Nepad. Moreover, we have the assurance from our ANC-led Government  that  it
will support our efforts unflinchingly. An  interministerial  committee  has
already been set up, and we would like to congratulate Minister  Balfour  on
his central role in this regard. Thank you, Comrade Minister.

It is with great regret that we learnt of the disintegration  of  Women  and
Sport SA, Wassa. We were  never  in  doubt  about  the  importance  of  this
structure and trust that the office of the hon Minister  will  endeavour  to
resurrect this very important structure as soon  as  possible.  Without  it,
South African sport will be the sore loser.

As the National Council of Provinces we are indeed encouraged by the  number
of provinces which are working seriously to revive indigenous sport. So  far
there have been a number of competitions in which all  South  Africans  have
taken part and they have proved to be both competitive and great fun.

South Africans are once again facing a bumper sporting  year  with  the  IRB
Rugby World Cup, the African Nations Cup qualifying rounds, the  IAAF  World
Championships and the All Africa Games. These all promise  huge  excitement.
We wish them everything of the best.

In conclusion, Sport and Recreation SA through its endeavours is leaving  no
stone unturned to level the  playing  fields  in  order  to  ensure  access,
infrastructure, development and mass participation in sport for all  in  our
country. In so doing, it is staying true to the objectives and  the  revised
White Paper. This leaves  us  in  no  doubt  that  for  all  sporting  South
Africans, the tide has turned indeed.

Lastly, we need to indicate to all members of the Council who come from  the
different provinces that whilst we have the sports  imbizos,  in  which  the
Minister and others are involved, we are invited  to  participate  in  those
imbizos. The first one was held in the Eastern Cape and we  participated  at
that level of the NCOP. We wish to encourage MECs  from  provinces  to  also
take on  board  the  other  members  present  in  order  to  indicate  their
participation in these imbizos. Thank you, Madam Chair. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair, hon Minister of Sport and  Recreation,  hon  special
delegates, hon colleagues, I would  just  like  to  preface  my  remarks  by
alluding to my hon colleagues who indulged in a  frenzied  orgy  of  raucous
objections to my motion without notice. [Laughter.]

If they read my motion in a quiet, nongallery-like  atmosphere,  they  would
realise that I did not say that Mashaba was wrong. I did not say  that  Safa
was wrong. I said, in  essence,  that  at  a  time  when  the  international
world's spotlight was focused on South Africa and Safa - on the eve  of  our
2010 World Cup bid - our top management should  have  acted  decisively  not
indecisively, not hesitantly, not with unsure steps, but with utter  savoir-
faire.

I am not alone. I would like to read  some  of  the  headlines:  the  Sunday
Times: ``Soccer fear still sends out the wrong signals"; the  Business  Day:
``Bafana-England game overshadowed by South African  soccer  politics";  the
Natal Mercury: ``Bafana somersaults"; the Natal Witness: ``Chaos  reigns  in
South  African  soccer''.  Fools  rush  in  where  angels  fear  to   tread.
[Interjections.]

Some nations seem to understand sport and its place in the world.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, Mr Raju. Would you take your seat for  a
moment. Hon member, are you rising on a point of order?

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Yes, Chairperson. I want to check whether it is in  order
for a member to talk about - debate - a motion which was objected to by  the
majority of the House. My view  is  that  he  is  bringing  that  motion  in
through the back door.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That's not a point of  order.  [Laughter.]  You
may proceed, hon member.

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you, Chair. Some nations seem  to  understand  sport  and
its place in the world. They enjoy their sport. They work hard  at  it,  and
accord it a certain respect in their culture.  Sporting  success  translates
into an upsurge in national pride.

Our nation's sporting sophistication is in danger of suffering a fatal  blow
if our national codes continue to remain in  the  hands  of  self-appointed,
narcissistic-type  individuals  for  whom  fraud  and  corruption  are  mere
vehicles for self-aggrandisement and who sabotage  the  ultimate  and  noble
ideals that Sport and Recreation SA has set towards South Africa becoming  a
great sporting nation.

In its presentation  to  the  select  committee,  Sport  and  Recreation  SA
broadly listed many priorities on its agenda to improve the quality of  life
of all South Africans through sport and recreation.  Not  mentioned,  in  so
many words, was the fact that the underlying motive of Sport and  Recreation
SA was to induce a sense of national pride in, the honour of  and  love  for
our national teams in their  attempts  to  bring  international  laurels  to
satisfy the nation's kaleidoscope of cultural communities whose  hunger  for
sporting glory, in whatever form, is insatiable.

No country in the world enjoys watching sport or participating in  sport  as
much as South Africa. No country in the world across racial, ethnic or  even
political spectrums evinces  such  a  frightening  obsession  with  national
sport.

``But we are not such a sick society.''  I  say  that  in  inverted  commas.
However, I am not so sure  after  last  week's  painful  eruption  of  utter
stupidity in the higher echelons  of  our  soccer  administration.  How  can
South Africa possibly hope to host the 2010 soccer World  Cup  if  we  can't
even agree on the selection of the national soccer team?  This  question  is
not mine; it is a question posed in the main editorial of the  Sunday  Times
of 18 May 2003.

I will not dwell on the  sequence  of  events  that  started  at  the  press
conference last Thursday when  one  Mr  Barney  Kujane  and  national  coach
Shakes Mashaba  were  announcing  their  respective,  but  different,  teams
purportedly to represent South Africa in a friendly match  against  England,
reputedly the classiest and most highly pedigreed soccer-playing  nation  in
the world. Sanity was ruled offside. [Interjections.]

Will such extraordinary events give sponsors and fans the confidence  needed
in South Africa to host football's showpiece event in seven years' time?  As
someone already mentioned, the seven-year itch of soccer fever  has  already
started. [Interjections.] I know the Minister is itching to get  stuck  into
me ... [Interjections.] [Laughter.] ... to get stuck  into  the  opposition,
but to use his own words, he  can  do  his  damnedest,  because  sticks  and
stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt  me.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, I'm  afraid  your  time  has
expired. [Interjections.] [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr M W MFEBE (Free State): Madam Chair, hon Minister, hon  members,  many  a
tear has been shed and many a poetic phrase has  been  sung  in  support  of
sports transformation. Yet, resistance to sports transformation, couched  in
a multiple of guises, remains an albatross around our necks.

I know that there are many people, some of them here and outside, who  would
like to see sports transformation as a lacklustre,  perpetual  process  only
driven by the whims and wishes of those who have appropriated to  themselves
the right to be the sole proprietors of our  sport.  Some  of  these  people
blatantly undermine  Government's  constitutional  authority  to  develop  a
policy and legislative framework within which all  role-players  must  play.
They  even  readily  scoff  at  Government's  constructive  intervention  to
restore order in our sport as unnecessary and draconian, and as  interfering
with the autonomy and independence of sports bodies.

I must admit that whilst the national Minister continues to be committed  to
sports transformation as a non-negotiable issue, the  problem  lies  at  the
provincial level. There is a lot  of  buck-passing  between  provincial  and
national federations. You find a situation in which when you ask a  national
federation why they don't transform, they tell you that  they  rely  on  the
pools from provinces  -  provinces  don't  transform;  they  don't  put  the
athletes forward to be selected. When you go to  the  provinces,  they  say,
``If we have an unrepresentative national team it  is  because  we  are  not
involved in selection''. So there is a lot of buck-passing.

I think I need to tell hon members that whilst the national Minister is  not
intending to move at this time  to  legislate  on  the  question  of  sports
transformation, I have come to the realisation, sadly  though,  that  policy
does not bind anyone. Policy is based on the consciences of people, if  they
have consciences at all, to  abide  by  its  dictates.  It  is  not  legally
binding.

We have been talking about sports transformation since the  ANC  opened  the
doors internationally to sport in this country, even before  we  arrived  at
the 1994 democratic elections. Today we  are  singing  the  same  monotonous
song of sports transformation. In my province, we have  gone  beyond  words,
having developed a White Paper on sport and recreation  in  1998,  the  same
year the national White Paper was developed.

Now we have a draft Free  State  sport  and  recreation  Bill.  Among  other
things, it will enforce transformation. I think Government cannot  stand  on
the sidelines and lament the lack of transformation  along  with  Nomathemba
in the squatter camp. I say, as an MEC, that  I  also  don't  know  what  is
happening. We  hope  these  people  will  have  good  hearts  some  day  and
transform.  We  have  the  policy  and  legislative  powers  given  by   the
Constitution  to  make  changes  in  this  country.  You  can  persuade  and
encourage people to change, but at some  point  you  must  say:  ``Ho!  Zima
apha!'' Now we need to use the carrot and stick method.

In my province we are going to legislate  and  make  it  mandatory  for  all
sports federations to sign a performance agreement with me. In  my  province
we are going to make it mandatory for all sport  and  recreation  bodies  to
register and be recognised, so that we will know what sports bodies and,  in
particular, what sports clubs are in the province. This is  because  no  MEC
can say how many clubs there are  in  his  or  her  province.  You  rely  on
sketchy information which is not accurate, rather  than  on  a  database  of
clubs. A club is the nucleus for the delivery of sport  and  recreation.  It
is where everything must happen. Sports  officials  must  lend  support  and
federations must lend support to a club if we are  to  see  growth  in  this
country. These things are happening, in consultation with  all  federations,
in my province.

I am grateful to  the  national  Minister  for  having  co-hosted  a  sports
transformation summit with us and the Northern Cape in the Free State.  Good
progress has been made in that regard. I have  already  appointed  a  sports
transformation committee in my province that will ensure  that  within  each
federation there are sports transformation units, so that transformation  is
not an issue left to the mercy of presidents and CEOs of federations.

Sport is a national asset. It is not the private property  of  the  wealthy,
the CEOs or the presidents of this country. No sports body can claim  to  be
independent at all. Government itself is not independent of  the  people  of
South Africa. It is people who elect government.  It  is  the  citizens  who
form clubs and federations. Even the sponsors - the  corporates  -  who  are
selective in sponsoring certain codes, which are skewed in favour of  white-
dominated sport, derive their very existence from the buying  power  of  all
of us, the majority of the people, who do not have any choice when they  buy
services and products. They need to plough this back and  ensure  that  they
help in the transformation process.

Sports sponsors hold a vital key to sports transformation in  this  country.
If they channelled the funds correctly, to where they are needed  the  most,
we would have a resurgence in sport and could put  sport  on  a  sustainable
growth path. I understand a sustainable growth path to mean that  sport  has
an irreversible and irrevocably high-profile status in the country in  which
there is continual mass participation and  a  high  number  of  high-quality
athletes who can compete equally, if not be better than, their  counterparts
in the rest of the world. That is where we are supposed to be moving.

Therefore, Minister, I support all your efforts in sports transformation.  I
support your budget and wish you well with this fat budget.  I  hope  it  is
not fat just because it is winter, but that beyond summer you get  a  fatter
budget. I hope that Treasury will give you a good  budget.  I  also  support
you in your view on the  decision  you  arrived  at  with  the  Minister  of
Education, because we need to have one centre of authority in  this  country
with regard to sports policy and implementation.

When you take the competitive aspects of school sports and give them to  the
Minister of Sport and Recreation, you create certainty in  the  delivery  of
sport, policy interpretation and the delivery of  services  with  regard  to
sport  and  recreation.  In  fact,  that  position  is  in  line  with   the
Stellenbosch resolution of the ANC. I think you are a  faithful  servant  of
your master who sent  you  to  speak  in  this  House,  which  is  the  ANC.
[Laughter.] [Applause.] On behalf of the Free State, I  also  fully  support
the 2010 bid.

I'd like to correct an omission from your speech, Minister,  which  is  that
the world Grand Prix motor cycling championships took  place  in  Welkom.  I
say this because in 1999, Sir Bob Charlton, the chair of the  UK  bid,  said
of South Africa: ``Don't judge South Africa by anything, not  by  the  Rugby
World Cup they have hosted.'' He said this worldwide via  the  Internet.  He
said: ``Judge them by the grand prix to be held in South Africa in the  Free
State in Welkom on 10 October 1999, because it requires high  organisational
skills''. We hosted this event successfully.

My message to Sir Bob Charlton, with regard to the UK team  that  is  coming
here, is: Support South Africa because we have met all those  challenges.  I
think any man of integrity would then say, ``They have done exactly  what  I
thought they would not do, five times in a  row.''  I  think  therefore  you
would have a colleague who would support South Africa in  the  2010  bid.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, many challenges face the  nation  as  South
Africa moves into the  21st  century.  Globalisation,  the  digital  divide,
abject poverty, HIV/Aids and creating conditions  conducive  to  sustainable
development are  a  few  of  the  critical  issues  the  nation  is  seeking
solutions for in partnership with other international role-players.

But while  significant  progress  was  made  in  the  first  nine  years  of
democracy, it was also a period in which it  was  necessary  to  develop  an
enabling policy  and  legislative  frameworks  in  terms  of  which  various
programmes in the Sport and Recreation department could be implemented.

It is necessary to focus  the  Government,  our  communities  and  ourselves
towards meeting the needs of the people of South Africa. Our goal should  be
to enable, educate and empower the physically challenged, who are  otherwise
severely stigmatised and whose potential is overlooked in  many  spheres  of
society. Irregularities  and  a  structural  lack  of  equity  in  physical,
financial and  human  assets  are  likely  to  constrain  poor  people  from
participating  effectively  and  efficiently   in   sport   and   recreation
activities.

One of the most effective ways of enhancing  overall  national  development,
decreasing poverty  and  reducing  inequality  is  the  elimination  of  the
enormous  disparities  in  access  to  utilities  and  services.  Sport  and
recreational programmes can and will play an important  role,  not  only  by
delivering services and highly needed benefits to the poor in South  Africa,
but also by providing income,  training  and  building,  and  by  developing
skills.

Abundant evidence from many developing  countries  indicates  that  vigorous
state spending on sport and recreational programmes  can  benefit  long-term
growth and the welfare of the poor at  a  relatively  low  cost.  This  will
contribute  towards  our  rugby,  cricket  and  soccer  being   number   one
internationally again, because we have the talent  and  we  are  simply  the
best. Maybe the hon singing Minister can add the song  Simply  the  best  to
his repertoire. [Laughter.]

What must be distinctive about the Sport and Recreation programmes  is  that
they should aim to locate skills that will enable young and  old  people  to
believe in themselves - that they  can  become  champions  for  our  beloved
country.

Another distinctive feature should be that the projects are  designed  in  a
participatory way, with significant community involvement.  This  is,  to  a
degree, the democratic process in the country  by  enabling  communities  to
engage with wider  political  processes,  and  also  potentially  serves  to
enhance the developmental impact of the Sport and Recreation programmes.

The New NP supports the goals set out by you, Minister, and the  department.
We would like to thank you and the provincial  departments,  and  urge  that
where facilities are created - and  we  hope  that  you  are  successful  in
convincing your colleagues that you should keep on creating  the  facilities
- their use be a priority.

In Groblershoop, a little town in the Northern Cape, sport  facilities  were
erected. The fencing-in of the facilities was  done  at  a  high  cost,  and
people were asked to pay a fee to enter the facilities. The result  of  this
was that these facilities were underutilised for years. Players,  spectators
and municipalities must be motivated and given support to make full  use  of
the facilities created.
I also urge the hon Minister to deal with  the  naming  of  facilities  with
sensitivity, because this  should  contribute  towards  the  unification  of
South Africa and not serve as a dividing factor. We had enough  of  that  in
the past.

Hon Minister, we will help you turn the tide to build and forge  a  people's
contract for a better South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K Z BATYI (Gauteng): Hon Minister, Chairperson,  excellencies,  gone  are
the days when sport was just about playing for fun. Today sport  contributes
to the economic growth of the country. The legacy of  the  apartheid  system
resulted in the skewed provisioning of sport  and  recreational  facilities,
in decreased participation levels, and  in  inadequate  human  and  physical
resources and funding, especially in previously disadvantaged areas.

In the development of our policy in Gauteng, which  is  in  draft  form,  we
have recognised that sport contributes greatly  towards  health,  wellbeing,
economic development, reduction in crime, nation-building and  international
relations.  For  the  individual,  sport  can  be  the  means  for  personal
expression, pride and accomplishment. For  many  people,  sports  activities
are a favourite means for volunteering  and  sharing  treasured  moments  of
rejoicing in the triumphs of their teams.

We believe that the implementation of the Sport and Recreation  policy  will
ensure the betterment of the lives  of  many  South  Africans,  particularly
those who were denied these opportunities before. The policy also  addresses
the promotion of gender equity and developmental programmes  for  the  youth
and people with disabilities, as well as addressing the rural areas  of  our
province.

Improving the delivery of sport for all will also be enhanced by  increasing
programmes  and  facilities   in   poor   and   historically   disadvantaged
communities, including access for people with  disabilities.  Improving  the
governance of sport will be  established  to  ensure  transparency,  access,
accountability,  redress  and  a  well-synergised   administrative   system.
Structures to implement these systems are in the  policy,  with  a  code  of
ethics to address conduct and behaviour.

To produce champions  who  will  participate  provincially,  nationally  and
internationally a sports academy structure is  being  established.  It  will
foster sport development in schools and communities and among the  youth  to
widen talent pools.

As a first phase of the Gauteng Sports Academy, the province has  identified
six sporting codes, namely cricket, netball, swimming, athletics, rugby  and
women's football, and a budget of about R4,7 million has been put aside  for
this purpose.

In mobilising community and  mass  participation  in  sport,  the  Masakhane
Games are a  good  platform.  Additionally,  from  the  Masakhane  Games,  a
Gauteng team is selected to participate in  the  South  African  Games.  Our
facility development programme  is  complemented  by  the  national  poverty
alleviation programme. For this we are very grateful.
Then comes the question: To whom do our  sport  administrators  account?  We
should have a system in which Government can intervene when conduct is  very
unbecoming. Federations should account to  the  public  for  every  cent  of
sponsorship they get, how it is spent, how many jobs are  created,  and  the
question of skills development and other related issues. Our aim is  not  to
run sport as Government, but to intervene in the interests of our people.

There has been nearly more than a decade of unity in sport,  but  a  sizable
portion of South Africans are still finding it difficult to  access  certain
facilities, like swimming and others. In  certain  sporting  codes  Africans
are still treated shabbily and refused. The  reasons  given  are  that  they
don't  have  the  technical  know-how.  We  must  fight  and  defeat   those
tendencies. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L SUKA (Eastern Cape): Madam Chairperson, first and foremost  I  want  to
say, on behalf of my province, that we support this budget  as  it  advances
the cause of transformation in our country.
In our address to the National Council of Provinces on the  Budget  Vote  of
Sport and Recreation in the  year  2002,  we  highlighted  the  passion  the
people  of  the  province  have  for  sport  and   recreation,   and   their
constructive contribution and  achievements  in  the  development  of  South
African sport at various levels. Our province continues  to  unearth  talent
in various codes of  sport,  as  demonstrated  by  the  inclusion  of  Monde
Zondeki and Robbie Peterson  in  the  Protea  cricket  squad  for  the  2003
Cricket World Cup in South Africa.

The hosting of three and five  Cricket  World  Cup  matches  by  the  Border
Cricket Board and the Eastern Province Cricket Board respectively,  was  the
most memorable achievement ever in the history  of  the  province,  as  this
afforded an opportunity for  the  youngsters  who  aspire  to  greatness  in
cricket to see international stars from various  countries  in  action,  for
instance stars from Kenya, England, Sri Lanka, Holland and so on.

The organisational capacities of the hosting cities, Buffalo  City  and  the
Nelson Mandela Metro, ably supported  the  cricket  federations.  Volunteers
and the government of the Eastern Cape rose to the occasion  and  put  on  a
brilliant display of professionalism for the country and the world to see.

As a result of the positive legacy left behind by  the  Cricket  World  Cup,
the Border Cricket Board will be able to  construct  cricket  ovals  to  the
tune of R3,3 million. I think it is also important to  mention  where  these
moneys  will  be  spent,  for  instance  in  the  remote   rural   area   of
kwaMasingata, Mdantsane, East London and Middledrift. The  Eastern  Province
Cricket Board will be in a position to  build  facilities  to  the  tune  of
R2,3 million in the following  areas:  the  Joza  township  in  Grahamstown;
Graaff-Reinet; Gelvandale in PE, in the northern areas where the  KwaZakhele
High School will benefit.

With  regard  to  participation  in  the  2002  South  African  Games,   the
challenges imposed by the SA Sports Commission in  introducing  the  concept
of the South African Games to the country was met  with  excitement  by  all
stakeholders in the province. Owing to the province's participation  in  the
2002 South African Games, it has been requested through or by the Minmec  on
Sport and Recreation - that is, the  intergovernmental  technical  committee
and the SA Sports Commission - to host the 2004  South  African  Games.  The
host city, East London, has  been  agreed  to  and  various  structures  and
committees are being put in place so as to level the  playing  field  for  a
spectacular 2004 South African Games event.

The introduction of the Peter Mkata and  Zim  Lesoro  provincial  rugby  and
netball tournament is  also  a  way  of  encouraging  our  young  ones.  The
tournament is held in  recognition  of  the  role  played  by  Peter  Mkata,
regarded by many South Africans as the best fly half ever  produced  in  the
history of  South  African  rugby,  and  of  Zim  Lesoro's  contribution  to
nonracialism in sport, in particular in the area of women's development  and
netball. This is a way of contributing to our transformation agenda.

This tournament increased the level of participation in  netball  and  rugby
as activities - the level increased to include 24 districts -  in  order  to
decide the winning school in  netball  and  rugby.  The  activities  in  the
districts  culminated  in  24  winning  schools   in   netball   and   rugby
participating in the provincial tournament held in the Nelson Mandela  Metro
last year.

The strategy of scientific and technical support entails  the  provision  of
support  to  athletes  and  administrators   by   identifying   talent   and
channelling it, for nurturing, in the academy of sport and  its  satellites.
The policy on the academies of sport is being  finalised  and,  with  inputs
from provinces, we hope that the national workshop of  21  to  22  May  2003
will produce the desired result in this regard.

By introducing vibrant sports  development  plans  through  the  concept  of
village sport and cultural councils, a programme has been designed  to  open
more  opportunities,  access  resources  and   provide   basic   sport   and
recreational facilities in rural towns and villages.  The  24  districts  of
the department are  currently  piloting  the  programme  that  includes  the
promotion  and  development   of   indigenous   games   and   ensuring   the
participation of villages and rural townships in the building of  sport  and
recreational  facilities;  and,  through  the  above  programme,   providing
training and opportunities in facility management for  volunteers  in  sport
and recreation.

The issue of transformation, which has been alluded to, is a vexing one.  In
our previous address to the National Council of Provinces we alluded to  the
fact that the challenges facing  the  provincial  department  of  sport  and
recreation were issues related to complete  integration  and  transformation
within the unified structures of various codes.  The  limited  resources  at
the disposal of provincial departments continue to pose a serious  challenge
and, to some extent, compromise the very issue of transformation.

Closing the gaps  in  terms  of  resources  and  participation  between  the
formerly  disadvantaged  and  advantaged,  the   urban   and   rural,   male
participation  and  female  participation,  able-bodied  and  disabled,   is
central to  transformation  and  requires  huge  injections  of  funds  from
Government. However, that must be preceded by proper business plans.

Arrogance on issues of transformation by  some  codes  of  sport,  owing  to
their financial muscle in world status, is good  reason  for  concern.  This
means that we concur with the issue raised by the  hon  MEC  from  the  Free
state when it comes to policy and legislation thereof.

We must also say hastily that we do have some challenges, which I think  are
not  insurmountable.  The  first  challenge  is  the   absence   of   sports
commissions in the provinces. The  Sports  Commission  exists  only  at  the
national level. As  a  result,  there  is  a  vacuum  at  provincial  level,
especially after the National Sports Congress was done away with.

With regard to school sport, I think the issue  was  well  placed  and  well
said here. What we are looking  for  is  the  speedy  finalisation  of  that
centre to hold under the Department  of  Education,  in  that  school  sport
should be under the Department of Education so that the centre  can  hold  -
nobody can pass the buck. The level of participation of women,  people  with
disabilities and rural communities is still a challenge.

With  regard  to  sports  facilities,  the  department  is  acting   as   an
implementing agent in the building of sport and  recreation  programmes,  in
collaboration with Sport and Recreation SA. In the previous  financial  year
of 2002-03 there were 12 projects running in the province, to  the  tune  of
R14,7 million. Those projects were in the following areas: Tsolo,  Ngqeleni,
Peddie, Ntabankulu, Mzimkhulu, Mqanduli, Cala, Tsomo, Sterkspruit,  Idutywa,
Mt Fletcher and Lady Frere. The projects under construction  this  financial
year are at Ngqamakhwe, Mgqesha, Keiskammahoek, Fort  Beaufort,  Fort  Hare,
Mdantsane, Lady Frere, Cala, Ngcobo, Sterkstroom and Cofimvaba.

The Eastern Cape Women Sports Association was  formed  recently  to  replace
the old Women and Sport SA association. The new structure's role will be  to
take responsibility for sports development and participation  in  the  areas
of sport and recreation. We concur with the national Minister that our  role
as a province or as government is  to  provide  support  and  assistance  in
terms of funding, and in terms of policy development and  implementation  in
that regard.

Currently, 90% of Government funding goes to federations that  have  women's
participation at various  levels.  It  is  part  of  the  provincial  policy
framework to encourage federations to pay attention to  women's  involvement
and participation.  In  addition  to  the  above  approach,  the  department
provides  an  annual  allocation  to  ensure  netball  development  and  the
participation of the provincial committees in the National Netball League.

We must also say that the tide  is  really  turning,  as  the  Minister  was
saying. We will support the budget ... [Inaudible.] ...  and  will  also  be
working together. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mr H T SOGONI: Sihlalo, Mphathiswa  obekekileyo  ...  Hon  Chairperson,  hon
Minister ...]

... MECs and special  delegates,  hon  members,  the  year  2003  marks  the
beginning of more anxious moments in South  African  sport  as  the  country
embarks upon another fierce contest to win the World Cup bid.

Someone has already warned South Africa  not  to  be  complacent.  One  Tony
Mashati has commented that Morocco may prove to be a very  strong  contender
for  the  2010  World  Cup  bid,  taking  into  account  that  some  of  the
campaigners have extensive international experience and strong networks.  We
believe as South Africans, however, that now is our  time.  Dempster  or  no
Dempster, World Cup 2010 should be staged in this country.

Kambe ke sihlalo woosihlalo andisayi kuba sangena  kwingxwabangxwaba  kaSafa
nebid komiti kunye nomqeqeshi. Sele igangathwe ngokwaneleyo. Hleze  ide  ibe
muncu. [Uwelewele] Ndifuna  ukuvakalisa  ukwaneliseka  yintetho  uMphathiswa
agqiba  ukusenzela  yona  xa  esiqinisekisa  okokuba   umcimbi   uwubambile,
uphantsi kolawulo olufanelekileyo. Siyabulela, Mphathiswa.  (Translation  of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[I will not seek to enter into the issue about the  problems  between  Safa,
the bid committee and the coach. Much  has  been  said  about  that.  Things
might turn sour. [Interjections.] However,  I  would  like  to  express  our
satisfaction at the speech that the hon Minister has  just  given  where  he
also mentioned that he is taking care of the matter,  it  is  being  handled
appropriately. We thank the hon Minister.]

Drugs in sport is another subject that  has  come  up  regularly  in  sports
commentaries lately,  both  locally  and  internationally.  One  commentator
refers to drug use in sport as ``the  dope  and  the  glory''.  Another  has
described doping as ``winning at all costs''. A better explanation is  given
by Daphne Bradbury, the CEO of the SA Institute  for  Drug-Free  Sport,  who
puts it this way:


  It's never enough to come second for many sportsmen, as that  could  lead
  to them losing their sponsors.

As one of the core objectives of sport and recreation, as determined by  the
department, is to achieve more medals, it appears therefore that we  have  a
real and  serious  problem  in  this  case,  because,  apparently  for  some
sportspeople,  more  medals  mean  more  dishonesty;  more  damage  to   the
integrity, image and value of sport; more contravention of  the  fundamental
principles of sport and fair competition; and more compromise of the  health
and wellbeing of the drug abuser.

In the words of one Toza Guga it seems that:


  The spirit of competition controls many  sportsmen;  for  them,  impaired
  health in the long run is a fair exchange for that glory on the podium.

Combine this with demanding sponsors,  and  international  sport  becomes  a
pressure cooker. This poses the challenge, therefore, for  all  role-players
in sport, at all levels of participation,  of  joining  hands  against  drug
abuse. The SA Institute for Drug-Free Sport  will  take  the  lead  in  this
case.

I have also noted that the department, in  the  preamble  to  its  strategic
plan,  has  acknowledged  the  still  existing   disparities   between   the
advantaged and disadvantaged with regard to access to sport. This  situation
is confirmed by the Gauteng MEC for sport who  has  been  quoted  as  saying
that the past 10 years of change  in  politics  and  society  has  not  been
equally complemented by development in sport. Thank you, Chairperson.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mnu  M  MTHIMKHULU   (KwaZulu-Natal):   Sihlalo,   Ngqongqoshe   wezemiDlalo
nezokuNgcebeleka, malungu  alo  mKhandlu  ohloniphekile,  kuyintokozo  ukuba
yingxenye  yale   nkulumo-mpikiswano   ngalesi   sabiwomali   salo   mNyango
wezemiDlalo nezokuNgcebeleka.

Sidinga ukuba sizibuze kulo mKhandlu ukuthi, njengoba nanyakenye  sazendlala
sazibeka kwacaca izinto okudinga masizenze ukuthuthukisa  isimo  sezemidlalo
kuleli zwe lakithi, ngakube njengamanje sesithathe  liphi  igxathu?  Ngakube
ukuhleleka  ngokulinganayo  kwezidingo  zezemidlalo  kuleli  zwe   kuqhubeka
kanjani kuze yimanje na? (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr M MTHIMKHULU (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, the  Minister  of  Sport  and
Recreation, hon members of this Council, I am grateful to  be  part  of  the
Department of Sport and Recreation's budget debate.

We need to ask ourselves as this Council, as we  listed  clearly  last  year
all the things that we needed to do to improve sport  in  our  country,  how
far have we gone?  How  has  this  country  managed  equal  distribution  of
resources in sport until now?]

We cannot keep on emphasising the importance of  visible  transformation  in
our sport all  the  time,  only  to  find  that  very  little  is  happening
practically on the ground. Those who sometimes accuse the Minister  of  what
they choose to call political interference in sport must know  -  I  repeat,
they must  know  -  that  transformation  is  not  just  an  option  but  an
obligation. We owe it to our people.

As KwaZulu-Natal we still have the enormous challenge  of  giving  our  full
attention to sport and recreation. As I  indicated  last  year,  we  have  a
serious anomaly in our province in terms of which sport  and  recreation  is
still part of a huge department of education and culture. This  leads  to  a
situation in which sport is treated  like  the  prodigal  son  in  budgetary
terms.  I  concede  that  a  political  decision,  such  as  the  one  taken
yesterday, is needed to address this matter.

Njengesifundazwe  esadlakadlwa  kakhulu  wudlame  lwezombusazwe,   sikudinga
kakhulu  ukuqiniswa  kokuthuthukiswa  kwezemidlalo  njengendlela   okuyiyona
yokujulisa izimpande zokubuyisana nokwakha kabusha isizwe sethu.  Ezemidlalo
futhi ziba nelikhulu iqhaza ekunqandeni intsha  ukuba  ingaweli  ezilingweni
zobelelesi nokubhuqwabhuqwa yizidakamizwa.

Mhlonishwa Ngqongqoshe, mina ngokwami  ngikubona  kufanele  ukuba  usiqinise
isandla  emkhankasweni  wokuba  ezemidlalo  zithathwe   njengento   engungqa
phambili emiphakathini yethu nasekuthuthukiseni  izinga  lezemidlalo  kuleli
zwe. Nakuba abanye  bangathini  bathini,  mina  ngibona  kufanele  siqiniswe
isandla.  Uguquko  siyaludinga,  umuntu  ethanda  engathandi,  ngoba  yilona
esalulwela.

Ngqongqoshe, kakufanele ukuba uyekelele nje  ezinye  izifundazwe  zizenzela,
njengalesi sethu saKwaZulu-Natali,  zizihudulela  izinyawo  futhi  zizithela
ngamanzi abandayo ezinhlelweni zokuthuthukisa  ezemidlalo.  Kufanele  iphele
nya le nto yokuba kube nemidlalo osathola kuyona ukuthi izinhlanga  zakuleli
zwe   azikamelwa   zonke.   Njengoba   kade   esho   umhlonishwa,    kuyinto
engenakubekezelelwa leyo. Kakwehli kahle kimina uma usathola  ukuthi  iqembu
lamaBhokobhoko lisemhlophe kakhulu ngisho nalelo lababhukudi  njengoba  kade
usho. Nokho kuyancomeka ukuthi ngakwikhilikithi  kuyazameka  kancane.  Kodwa
sengathi isivinini singenyuswa sokuba amaqembu ethu  akhombise  ngokweqiniso
isimo somumo wezinhlanga zaleli zwe  lethu,  lokhu  abathi  ngesilungu  ama-
demographics. Ngingajabula-ke ukuzwa nawe Ngqongqoshe ugxila impela  ucacise
ukuthi ngakube lolu hlelo  ulubona  luhamba  ngakho  yini.  (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[As the province that has been mostly affected  by  political  violence,  we
desperately need serious development of sport as a  way  to  strengthen  the
roots of reconciliation and to  renew  our  country.  Sport  also  plays  an
important role  in  preventing  youth  from  getting  involved  in  criminal
activities and being destroyed by drugs.

I think the Minister should put more effort into campaigning for  sports  to
be taken as the most  important  thing  in  our  communities  and  into  the
improvement of the level of sport in this country. Some people  may  differ,
but I think more effort should be put into promoting sport. Whether we  like
it or not, we need transformation. It is what we fought for.
Minister, you should not let some provinces do as they  please,  like  ours,
KwaZulu-Natal.  They  are  dragging  their  feet  with  regard   to   sports
development programmes. The situation where one  finds  that  sport  is  not
representative of all the races of this country should come to  an  end.  As
the hon Minister has said, this will  not  be  tolerated.  It  is  not  good
enough to me that the Amabhokobhoko team is still very white,  and  that  of
the swimmers, as the Minister said.  But  it  is  commendable  that  we  are
trying in cricket. However, the pace should be faster so that our teams  can
represent the real situation of our country's  demographics.  I  would  like
the Minister to explain whether he thinks  that  this  programme  is  moving
according to plan.]

In conclusion, I urge this Council to  exhort  our  Minister  of  Sport  and
Recreation and his department to ensure that in this budget more  funds  are
channelled  towards  disadvantaged  communities   for   sports   development
programmes. I am sure that that will go a long way in our united  action  to
push back the frontiers of poverty. I thank you. Ngiyabonga. [Applause.]
Mrs R P MASHANGOANE: Chairperson, hon Minister of Sport  and  Recreation  Mr
Ngconde Balfour, hon members and distinguished guests, it is  an  honour  to
convey fraternal greetings to all from the sport and  recreation  fraternity
in Limpopo.

The significance of this debate is that it is taking place after the  recent
celebrations of the ninth anniversary of our freedom. This reality calls  on
us to look back and deepen our introspection and to  answer  every  question
correctly and with unparalleled honesty. The Minister said  that  facilities
will be named after heroes. As a humble reminder,  Minister,  we  also  have
heroes in South Africa.

Across provinces there is no doubt that  the  issue  of  transformation  has
been a challenge and  will  remain  so  for  a  while  -  until  we  form  a
formidable wall-to-wall  movement  throughout  the  country  to  uproot  all
tendencies which still seek to relegate blacks to the margins of sport.

Motlhomphegi Tona, re a bona gore  o  swere  phaga  ka  mangana-nngalaba  ya
tšhitadingaka yeo e šitago Phaahla go ahlola. O  leka  ka  thata  go  fetola
seemo sa ditaba go tša dipapadi. Maloba ale ngwana wa  maloba,  ka  pušo  ya
kgatelelo, o be a potoka ma šela go dira kgwele ya maoto. Mapatlelo  wona  e
le masetlapelo! (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[Hon Minister, we can see that you are working very  hard.  You  are  trying
hard to change the situation in the Sports  department.  Previously,  during
the apartheid era, one used to search for cloths  to  make  a  soccer  ball.
Stadiums were a disaster.]

Limpopo is grappling with this issue. In the previous year we  conducted  an
audit of federations with the intention  of  measuring  the  following:  the
accessibility of sport codes to blacks, particularly those codes which  were
previously  inaccessible  to  them;  the   demographic   representation   of
federations' executive councils and  their  administrative  components;  and
the scope of operation of such federations  as  some  of  them  operated  as
exclusive  family  clubs,  which  monopolised  public  facilities   to   the
exclusion of marginalised groups.

This audit was an eye-opener to the challenges that we  still  face  on  the
transformation front. What is clear and  very  real  is  that  for  sporting
codes such as cricket, hockey, swimming, golf and  rugby  transformation  is
still very elusive. However, we are grateful that the Minister has  made  it
his priority to visit  provinces  and  engage  all  role-players  on  sports
transformation. This will happen in Limpopo in July.

One of the greatest challenges in sport remains the participation  of  women
in codes which are traditionally men's sports. Our efforts to  empower  them
are really bearing fruit. A proud example are the  three  women  judges  and
two  referees  in  boxing.  One  of  these  referees   is   conducting   her
responsibilities at an international level. We were  truly  humbled  by  her
selection as a referee during a world boxing tournament, which was  held  in
Polokwane  earlier  this  year.  In  most  of  our  sports  structures   the
participation  and  representation  of   women   is   taken   into   serious
consideration, though we still have to do more to ensure that  that  reaches
the maximum level. That does not happen by chance, but is clearly guided  on
how it should happen.

Since the new dispensation, sport has been viewed as a vehicle  for  nation-
building and economic development. In that regard, our province  has  hosted
major sporting events of a national and international  character  that  have
contributed not only to the growth of sport but  also  to  tourism  and  the
provincial economy. An account of these events is as  follows:  the  Limpopo
provincial games;  the  world  practical  shooting  tournament;  the  Cosafa
tournament: Bafana Bafana versus Swaziland; a world boxing title fight;  and
the Davis Cup international tennis tournament.

These sports events have rekindled the interest of our people in  sport  and
have made a significant contribution to our  economic  growth.  Our  tourism
industry also got a positive boost  as  most  of  the  visitors  took  great
interest in our tourist destinations. We  celebrate  the  job  opportunities
that were  created  for  black  empowerment  companies  employed  to  render
services during those events.

Thirty days from today, in June,  we  will  be  staging  one  of  the  major
sporting events for the province - the O R Tambo  Games.  These  games  were
formerly known as the Limpopo Provincial Games. They have been  renamed  the
O R Tambo Games to honour the memory of this great leader who was  a  source
of inspiration and a role model for our youth  during  the  apartheid  days.
Subsequent to this event,  another  major  event  on  the  calendar  is  the
National Indigenous Games festival in September.

We have no doubt that these events will have the same impact as the ones  we
have had already in terms of job creation and poverty eradication, and  that
they will contribute to sports development and growth.

Talking about these events reminds  all  of  us  of  the  critical  lack  of
facilities in most rural parts of  our  country.  In  our  province  we  are
inundated with  requests  from  communities  to  provide  them  with  sports
facilities. These are always tall orders because at provincial level,  owing
to the meagre budget for the sport portfolio, we do not budget  for  capital
projects.

We, however, appreciate the allocation  from  the  Building  for  Sport  and
Recreation Programme which has made it possible to  establish  basic  sports
facilities in most communities. Last year in September  we  handed  over  12
facilities to municipalities, some of which were renovated and others  newly
erected. Another batch will be  handed  over  this  year.  These  facilities
create a conducive environment, which has begun to  turn  our  disadvantaged
communities into playing communities. Throughout the years, we have  ensured
that nodal points receive 30%, as required by the  allocation  framework  of
these funds.

The other area which the province still struggles with  is  that  of  school
sport, whose rightful location has not been pronounced in terms  of  policy,
that is whether it belongs to the Department of Education or the  Department
of Sport and Recreation. This matter we urge the  Minister  to  give  urgent
priority so that the funding of schools participating in  sports  activities
does not remain a permanent dilemma.  This  situation  hampers  the  focused
development of sport at school level.

However, good news is that one of our primary schools, Klaas  Mothapo,  came
out  champions  in  the  Ussasa  MTN  under-17  soccer   tournament,   which
positioned them to participate in the World  Schools  Tournament  in  China.
Unfortunately, owing to Sars - Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  -  this
tournament is to be held in abeyance until an alternative  host  country  is
identified. We congratulate our boys on this rare achievement.

This is an overview of  the  sport  and  recreation  landscape  in  Limpopo.
Obviously, this does not exhaust the whole  range  of  issues  that  we  can
share in this debate. Our impression is that our  sport  is  growing  though
there are some stiff challenges ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mr K PANDAY (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair, hon Minister and  hon  colleagues,
in a very sporting spirit I  bring  felicitations  and  greetings  from  the
Kingdom of the Zulus.

The hon Minister today touched on a wide variety of  issues  much  of  which
emphasised  the  need  for  transformation  and  the  upliftment  of  sports
performance. Sir, you have our fullest support. South Africa has  proved  to
the world, post-1995, that it is one of the  greatest  sporting  nations  in
this universe. May our sporting heroes continue to make us proud of them.

Sport and recreation are human phenomena that in the past two  decades  have
become the focus of serious social and  economic  research  internationally.
As Prof Richard Rottkov succinctly  put  it,  they  thoroughly  deserve  the
scientific attention they receive, as they are an integral  and  vital  part
of human, economic and social life. In South Africa, almost  10  years  into
our democratic dispensation, sport and recreation continue to be the joy  of
all our people throughout the country.
Like every other aspect  of  our  post-liberated,  democratic  society,  the
legislative  frameworks  are  in  place  for  the  implementation   of   the
transformatory agenda so  instrumental  in  moving  our  people  beyond  the
bondage of apartheid.  This  means  that  legislators  need  to  unite  with
communities throughout our  country  in  a  colossal  effort  of  solid  and
sustainable implementation that can only be  successful  if  it  encompasses
the  struggle  for  equity,  transparency,  accountability   and   capacity-
building. This, in turn, will enhance our democratic and  collective  values
and solidify our unity as a nation and as a people.

Allow me to thank the hon MEC from the Free  State  for  his  call  for  one
central authority for sport in our country. Taking a cue from the  hon  MEC,
the hon Minister should ensure that all  sporting  bodies  in  this  country
register with a central  body  and  that  each  should  sign  a  performance
agreement. In this way we would get a  fully  representative  team  in  each
code of sport. No one would be sidelined, and no one must be left out.

In  this  gallant  fight,  the  access  of  our  women  and  the  physically
challenged to facilities and opportunities is of  paramount  importance.  We
are all proud of the achievements of our physically challenged  athletes  in
many international events such as the Olympics.

Hence, it is a priority for all of us to ensure that the  opportunities  and
resources are made available for the continuation of such processes  at  all
levels. We need to ensure that all women feel free to participate  in  sport
and recreation activities throughout our country.

There is a serious backlog in sporting  resources,  and  thus  the  existing
coherent and comprehensive developmental policies need to be implemented  in
order to achieve our precious aims and objectives. These need  to  be  based
on scientific assessments of the developmental needs of our communities.

Our continual efforts to relate sport and recreation to the  growth  in  and
development  of  tourism  will  be  a  catalyst  for  economic  growth   and
development, the eradication  of  poverty  and  the  acceleration  of  black
economic empowerment at all levels.

We want to elaborate on school sport and recreation as a  fundamental  basis
for creating a healthy and well-educated youth, hence  a  healthy,  powerful
and prosperous nation. In terms of school sport, we need to resuscitate  the
interschool and intraschool sports programmes with  the  educators  and  the
communities as the vital links, that is both the stakeholders and the  role-
players.

In the KZN legislature, I  suggested  incentives  for  educators  to  become
seriously involved in this process, by utilising weekends in order not  only
to instil the culture of Batho Bele in our learners, but also the  pleasure,
joy, dignity and discipline associated with sport. One needs to  acknowledge
the lack of infrastructure in the majority of  our  schools,  especially  in
the poorest and rural areas.

I want to wholeheartedly support the vision and  hands-on  approach  of  the
new KZN Minister of education, the hon Mr Narend Singh,  who  suggested  the
use of bulldozers to create level sporting fields in our  beloved  province.
Indeed,  we  need  to  level  the  sporting  fields,  both   literally   and
figuratively. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  I  now  call  the  hon  C  M  Dugmore,  the
chairperson of the standing committee on  health,  cultural  affairs,  sport
and recreation. Hon Minister, I hope you could take in that long name.

Mr C M DUGMORE (Western Cape): Chair and Minister, I am deeply  honoured  to
take part in this policy debate in the NCOP today. I would like to  formally
convey the apologies of our MEC, MEC McKenzie, who is unable to be here.

For the benefit of the Chairperson, I would like to say  that  until  a  few
weeks ago I had a very simple title behind my name - the chairperson of  the
health committee, but  for  my  sins  they  have  now  asked  that  cultural
affairs, and sport and recreation be added  to  this  committee.  So,  I  am
looking forward to the work that lies ahead.

In fact, a very long time  ago,  I  was  a  former  secretary  of  the  then
National Sports Congress in this province. It was a very long  time  ago,  a
time when the Minister, sitting opposite me over there, and  ourselves  were
in the trenches doing things like  fighting  against  rebel  tours  and,  in
fact, at that stage, trying  to  persuade  people,  even  in  the  nonracial
sporting fraternity, that unity was, in fact, the best course.

I have always had a passion for  sport  and  its  ability  to  bring  people
together, to contribute to nonsexism and nonracism and, in  fact,  to  be  a
catalyst for development to assist with the moulding of  our  youth.  So  it
appears from what I have heard today that the battle lines are  still  drawn
and that there is a lot of work that still needs to be done.

Voorsitter, dit is eintlik merkwaardig om te sien hoe ver ons  as  die  ANC-
regering gevorder het in die laaste 10 jaar. Maar  daar  is  mense  wat  nog
raas wat daardie tyd geraas en geskreeu het. Eintlik net soos die  lid  Raju
wat ook aanhou om te raas en te skreeu oor die  feit  dat  die  ANC-regering
aangedring het  op  die  noodsaaklikheid  van  transformasie  in  sport,  om
spesifieke stappe te neem om bruin en swart spelers geleenthede te gee.  Die
feit  bly  staan  dat  dié  stappe  nodig  was.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, it is in fact remarkable to see how far we as  ANC  Government
have progressed during the past 10 years. But there are people  who  made  a
noise and shouted at the time who are still making  a  noise  and  shouting.
Actually like the member Raju who keeps making a noise  and  shouting  about
the  fact  that  the  ANC  Government   insisted   on   the   necessity   of
transformation in sport, to take  specific  steps  to  afford  coloured  and
black  players  opportunities.  The  fact  remains  that  these  steps  were
essential.]

The reality is that unless we  are  prepared  to  continue  taking  specific
steps to affirm our players, our administrators and our  coaches,  and  also
to continue our work to build and upgrade facilities  in  communities  which
have never had them, we will not be building equity  in  sport.  All  of  us
acknowledge that much has been achieved, but more needs to be done. I  think
the sentiment reflected in what the MEC from the Free State said today is  a
very real one and should, in fact, serve as a spur to all of us to  increase
the pace of transformation.

Apha  eNtshona  Koloni,  uRhulumente  wethu  uyazama  okokuba  abantu  bethu
bamanyane, kwaye savuya kakhulu akuba uMphathiswa  wethu  encedile  ukunyula
iKapa  xa  aBafana  Bafana  beza  kudlala  apha  kunye   neJamaica   phantsi
kwe``World Cup 2010 bid''. Thina bantu  baseNtshona  Koloni  siza  kuyinceda
i``bid committee'' yethu ukuze siwine ngo2010. Asifuni ukuba  sibuye  sidane
kwakhona kule ``bid''. [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[Our government, here in the Western Cape, tries to unite  our  people,  and
we were exhilarated by the help when our Minister chose  Cape  Town  as  the
venue for Bafana Bafana/Jamaica match of the 2010 World Cup Bid. We,  people
of the Western Cape, are going to assist our bid committee so that  we  come
out at the top in 2010. We do not want to be disappointed  again  this  time
round. [Applause.]]

We cannot afford to fail again. In fact, I want to put  it  on  record  that
our province appreciates the role that our  Minister  has  played  over  the
weekend in developing a compromise between Safa and the bid committee.  This
particular intervention has, I think, taken us a long way forward  in  terms
of tomorrow's game.

However, what I find very disturbing is the fact that people  like  Mr  Raju
stand up in this House today and, in fact, contribute to  creating  a  sense
of crisis and, by raising concerns  about  the  way  Safa  has  handled  the
issue, begin to question  the  bid  itself.  I  think  this  is  very,  very
dangerous. All of us acknowledge that there are concerns and  problems,  but
to then begin to say that we  are  in  danger  of  hosting  the  bid,  is  a
particular connection that I don't see.

We have, in fact, emerged  from  hosting  very  successful  activities  and,
simply because of a selection problem, to then  begin  to  question  whether
this country can host the bid itself, is something that I don't  think  goes
any way towards supporting what we know our country  can  actually  perform.
[Interjections.]

I think it is, in fact, cheap politics to stand up here and raise  questions
about our capacity to host the bid itself  when  dealing  with  the  problem
which we saw last week. I do not think this is  correct.  Sometimes  I  find
that the organisation that that particular member represents  rejoices  when
there are problems, because that allows them to create  cheap  politics  and
to mouth what newspaper headlines do every week, and they do not,  in  fact,
contribute to finding solutions to these problems.

For us in the  Western  Cape  issues  of  equity,  redress  and  access  are
critical to  the  transformation  agenda  of  our  national  and  provincial
government. I think it is important to remind members of  this  House  that,
until very recently, we had a provincial government which was, in fact,  one
of the loudest critics of  attempts  to  transform  sport,  of  attempts  to
transform recreation and culture in this particular province.

However, our new provincial government has, in fact, taken a very bold  step
to consolidate the  departments  of  sport  and  recreation,  and  arts  and
culture into one department and, for the first time,  to  begin  to  appoint
officials in this  province  that  begin  to  reflect  the  people  of  this
province.

Until almost a year or two ago we did not have a  department  of  sport  and
recreation in this province that actually represented  the  people  of  this
province. We had a  situation  in  which  African  administrators  from  the
Western Cape were consistently not appointed  to  drive  the  transformation
programme. Lip service was, in fact, being paid to the  need  to  transform.
[Interjections.] Now that we have actually implemented  the  new  provincial
government arrangement, people are being filled  with  hope  for  the  first
time that we are going to take transformation seriously.

In fact, what has been done under our new  Minister  is  to  take  steps  to
ensure that each and every code in this province  submit  development  plans
so that the department can assist in  achieving  equity  by  monitoring  and
supporting each one of those plans. One of the steps that our  MEC  is  busy
implementing  at  the  moment  is  ensuring  that  we   have   a   dedicated
transformation  unit  within  the  directorate  to  ensure  that   all   the
federations in our province participate in achieving the  goals  which  have
been set. I think sentiments expressed in this House, which have been  about
the need to actually  register  those  federations,  need  and  deserve  our
support.

In addition to our work with the federations, we are as a province  actively
working with four regional sports councils  as  well  as  the  Western  Cape
Sports Forum to monitor the implementation of these plans.  With  regard  to
one of the initiatives which has been  taken  now,  our  department  insists
that all applications for funding by federations have  to  include  progress
reports in regard  to  the  advancement  of  women  and  the  disabled,  and
attempts to build nonracism  and  encourage  rural  development.  Those  are
looked at before federations are considered for funding.

One of the concerns that we had identified in  our  province  in  regard  to
sport was the fact that when it came to disabled sport, there were a  number
of different structures in existence  in  our  province.  I  am  pleased  to
inform the House and the Minister that only last week  our  department  took
steps to unite these organisations and, in fact, launched  Disability  Sport
Western Cape on 16 May in Vredenburg. The  structure  was  launched  and  an
executive elected on the first day. The  following  day  over  600  athletes
participated in six different sporting codes. So, we have actually  moved  a
long way towards uniting and co-ordinating the disabled  sports  section  in
our province.

Another issue where I think we have seen progress in the last year  is  that
of  more  active  support  for  the  policy  objective  of  developing   the
participation of women and girls in sport, both in the playing  and  in  the
administration  of  our  codes.  This  particular  programme  also  includes
capacity programmes to develop women as  technical  officials,  coaches  and
managers. However, a key challenge remaining is the need  for  much  greater
efforts  to  draw  in  women  and  girls  from  historically   disadvantaged
communities where levels of participation are clearly inadequate.

I think another major challenge facing the department is also to  align  our
work with the new economic growth and development strategy for  the  Western
Cape, which was announced by MEC  Rasool  during  the  budget  speech.  This
strategy, ``Ikapa Elihlumayo'' or ``Die Groeiende Kaap'', aims  to  identify
key sectors which have the potential to grow our economy. It also  calls  on
each department to look at ways in which development takes place across  the
province and not only at areas which have benefited historically.
We remain convinced that sports  tourism  is  a  sector  with  even  greater
potential for growth in our province.  We  want  to  attract  further  major
international and national events to our province in  an  ongoing  way,  and
also to promote the use of facilities in areas outside of  the  metropolitan
one. I will convey to our MEC the urgings of our Minister that the event  in
George is one which is not only successfully run, but  also  contributes  to
golf development in that particular region.

Central  to  this  programme  is  providing  opportunities  for   previously
disadvantaged service providers at these events, and also ensuring that  the
whole sports and events  management  sector,  as  a  part  of  our  regional
economy, provides opportunities for black economic empowerment. Just  as  we
need transformation within sport itself, we also need transformation  within
the sports industry within our particular province.

I think the Minister's announcement in regard to the agreement reached  with
the Minister of Education is welcome. In fact, there has  been  progress  in
our province over the last year and a half among the department of  cultural
affairs and sport,  the  department  of  education  and  the  department  of
community safety. In addition, in our own provincial  budget  an  amount  of
R12 million  had  been  allocated  to  facilitate  the  delivery  of  sports
programmes in school. I think the new announcement means  that  we  need  to
engage with the Minister to actually look at how we are  going  to  continue
working with the three departments,  because  the  department  of  community
safety has also become involved. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call Ms  N  P  Khunou  who  will
making her maiden speech today. [Applause.]

Ms N P KHUNOU: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, sport is a  diversity
of languages that the whole world understands and  speaks.  It  is  thoughts
brought together into a more practical form. Though  there  are  times  when
you cannot express yourself, you always have a way  of  expressing  yourself
through sport.
Sport shows people outside of you the creativity inside you. Not  only  does
it bring about a sense of  team  building,  but  also  a  sense  of  nation-
building. Sport is magic. It is unifying and  healing.  It  brings  everyone
together to see the creativity that was given to us from the beginning.

The preamble to our Constitution states:


  We, the people of South Africa,
  Recognise the injustices of our past;
  Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in  our  land;  Respect
  those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
  Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it,  united  in  our
  diversity.
  We therefore, through our  freely  elected  representatives,  adopt  this
  Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic so as to -


     Heal the divisions of  the  past  and  establish  a  society  based  on
     democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights;


     Lay the  foundations  for  a  democratic  and  open  society  in  which
     government is based on the will of the  people  and  every  citizen  is
     equally protected by law;


     Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the  potential  of
     each person; and


     Build a united and democratic South Africa able to  take  its  rightful
     place as a sovereign state in the family of nations.

South Africans recognise past injustices and so does the Constitution.  This
country has seen unknown systematic  exclusion  of  black  participation  in
sport. In other words, we could not display the artistry  within  ourselves.
We were indoctrinated to become obscure,  since  our  abilities  to  perform
were removed. To our mind, sport can provide the healing qualities  for  our
nation. Sport and recreation are providing us with an  enabling  environment
to excel and demonstrate discipline. Right now we are  recapturing  part  of
what was lost for a long period.
I would like to quote from the 1995 South African  yearbook  under  RDP  and
sport. It states:


  Enforced segregation of sport and recreation during apartheid  years  has
  denied millions of South Africans the right to a healthy life.

It also emphasises the view that sport and recreation play an integral  part
in establishing a healthy society.

The youth are involved in drugs, substance abuse and  other  crimes.  It  is
also a fact that our prisons are overcrowded with juvenile  offenders.  This
is because they are still deprived of the  opportunity  to  play  sport  and
live healthy  lifestyles.  Just  like  a  goal  on  a  soccer  field  brings
celebration, our young men and women should be able to set themselves  goals
that bring them joy.

Transformation in sport is a guided process that can be planned,  controlled
and co-ordinated. It is a process of taking stock of what has been  achieved
by comparing agreed policies against performance on the sporting  field.  It
means that we not only achieve  the  stated  objectives,  but  sustain  that
which has already been achieved.  For  example,  in  the  past,  soccer  was
predominantly a black sport, whereas now it is reflecting  the  demographics
of our country.

It is incumbent upon all of us to remove every obstacle  and  barrier  based
on  unfair  discrimination,  specifically  relating  to   racism,   disabled
persons, disparities and gender. We  remain  committed  to  selecting  teams
that reflect the demographics of our country, with an  emphasis  on  quality
irrespective of race.

It is clear that sport is  a  national  asset.  Therefore  everyone  has  an
important role to play in giving back to  the  communities  what  was  taken
from them. It is our responsibility to give communities equitable access  to
all facilities by high-performance training.

In the Free State we have multipurpose facilities  in  all  five  districts.
They were all completed in record time - by the end of March 2003.  I  would
also like to emphasise proudly that  we  have  not  forgotten  our  cultural
sport  in  our  province.  We   are   introducing   indigenous   sports   in
acknowledgement of the rural  nature  of  our  province.  Sport  should  not
benefit the residents of urban areas alone, but should benefit  everyone  in
that it should be extended to all remote communities. We are in the  process
of accrediting training:  `dipapadi  tsa  Basotho,  diketo,  kgati,  moraba-
raba'' [the games of the Basotho people (names  of  games)],  to  mention  a
few. This shows some of the richness of our cultural  activities  which  can
boost education and health.

Women were forgotten in the past in sport. They are  now  participating  not
only in their historical sports, but also in soccer, boxing and  so  on.  We
now have a national soccer team called Banyana Banyana. It is also quite  an
achievement to know that disabled people are now  recognised  and  given  an
enabling environment unlike in the past. They have accessibility to  sports,
which is what our Constitution  requires.  They  now  partake  in  different
sports.

This is precisely the aim of our ANC-led Government: to improve the  quality
of lives through sport and recreation and free the  potential  of  each  and
every individual. This Budget Vote before us  today  seeks  to  ensure  that
access and opportunity are translated into  action.  The  ANC  supports  the
Vote. God bless us all. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF  SPORT  AND  RECREATION:  Chairperson,  let  me  start  very
quickly by referring to the maiden speech of Mama  Khunou.  Thank  you  very
much for your contribution to sport. I think what you  mentioned  first  was
the unifying aspect of sport,  interestingly  enough.  You  are  very,  very
correct. All South Africans are mad about  sport,  irrespective  of  age  or
gender. They love their sport.

The problem sometimes with most of us South Africans is that  we  don't  use
our minds and brains to think when it comes to sport,  as  we  do  in  other
aspects of life. When it comes to sport, we think with our hearts.  That  is
the problem in most cases. People become too emotional and use their  hearts
for thinking. The heart is not for thinking, it is  for  pumping  blood  and
making sure that life goes on. [Laughter.] The  mind  is  there  to  do  the
analysis, to think and to rationalise, but the problem is that we don't  use
it.

Regarding the whole debate that was referred to by Mr Raju,  I  did  mention
in my speech that in most cases I am supposed to respond to media reports  -
screaming headlines that say:  ``Chaos  in  Jukskei''.  Everybody  runs  and
asks: ``Where is that Minister?''  [Laughter.]  ``Where  is  that  Minister?
Things are going wrong''. Here I am not just referring to people from  other
political parties, but even to people from my own organisation,  my  beloved
ANC.

When people throw bottles and stones and what have you onto  the  field,  as
has happened in a game in South Africa, I am not sure how many people  phone
me asking ``What are you doing about that?'' [Laughter.] I said  to  one  of
them, who came from Ngqushwa: ``Ncumisa, I am at home at my  sister's  place
in Middledrift.'' [Laughter.] ``I am enjoying home-baked bread and jam.  Why
do you phone me when people at FNB  stadium  decide  to  throw  bottles  and
everything else?'' She said:  ``No,  no,  no.  Go  and  do  something  about
that.'' [Laughter.] That is why I say that people think  with  their  hearts
rather than with what God  gave  them  to  think  with.  Mntaka  Khunou  ...
[Khunou's child.] ... you are quite  correct.  This  is  supposed  to  be  a
unifying aspect, but it's not.

If your own team loses, people phone and say, ``Did you  see  that  referee?
Minister, do something about these referees.'' [Laughter.] As I  go  around,
I carry my own referee cards. Here's my yellow card, here's my red  card.  I
have them because I am sick and tired of not  being  able  to  have  my  own
cards, so that when you say do something, I can tell  you  to  forget  about
it. Do you think I am going to go there and tell  those  Kaizer  Chiefs  and
whichever other supporters  who  are  throwing  stones  to  stop?  I  am  in
Middledrift. How do I do that? So you are red-carded.  The  police  and  the
administrators on the field are supposed to do this, not the  poor  Minister
- Bhumbhum's father - who has to run all the way  there  to  stop  that.  If
your team loses, then it's ``Minister, do  something.''  Thank  you,  Mntaka
Khunou. [Khunou's child.]

At home nobody touches my remote control,  because  it's  something  that  I
don't share with anybody. I decide what I am going to watch. I  see  a  team
doing well so I want to watch. For instance, I see Phunya Selesele is  doing
very well; or that team is doing  very  well.  So  if  anybody  touches  the
remote control and I do not know where it  is,  it's  war,  because  if  you
phone me and say that referee so-and-so is not  doing  the  right  thing,  I
will know exactly what you are talking about. Then I  can  respond  to  you.
That's how difficult it is to run sport in a country which is sports mad.

Kgoshi will ask me: ``Why are Black Leopards  not  doing  well,  Minister?''
From the Eastern Cape  they  will  ask  me:  ``Why  are  Bush  Bucks  facing
relegation?'' I don't play football. You can see that. [Laughter.]  I'm  not
physically ... [Interjections.] I don't play football.

Let me respond quickly - I don't want to take up  too  much  of  your  time,
Chairperson. All the things that you have mentioned, I have taken  note  of.
I have taken note of the issues that you raised, Mr Panday.  First  of  all,
the special delegate is quite correct. If there could  be  a  separation  of
the sports department from that of  education  and  culture  -  so  that  it
stands alone, whether that means sports, arts and culture  -  that,  to  me,
would make a lot of sense. At the moment, being with education, it does  not
make sense, because it will always be the stepchild of education.  Dit  maak
nie sin nie. [It does not make sense.] So, talk to hon  Narend  Singh  -  he
has been given the job now - to really make sure that sport is run  properly
within that province. Otherwise, you will never be able to do that.

What has come out throughout is the issue of school sport. I am  happy  that
members have been concerned about this, as I have been concerned too  -  the
funding and placement of school sport. It  always  follows  that  you  start
with placement and then funding follows. You  cannot  start  the  other  way
round. You start with placement first.  You  know  where  it  is,  then  you
follow it with funding. Now that we have  agreed  with  Prof  Asmal,  it  is
going to be very easy. I hope provinces do not confuse issues here.

School sport is solely my responsibility. It is my  core  business  to  look
after sport. The Department of Education does not have the core business  of
looking after sport. Their core business is education. My core  business  is
sport. It's overarching for both of us. So we have agreed  to  separate  the
two, but in a very good relationship, working together  so  that  they  look
after the curricula aspects. These are human movement; PT, which we used  to
do; and all those kinds of things so that you know where  the  muscles  are,
for instance where the hamstring is - you can't have a  hamstring  here.  It
should be somewhere here. They will be able to do that.
Regarding the competitive aspects, we'll be able  to  look  after  them  and
fund them. We have agreed. We are meeting on the 28th in  the  morning  with
Prof Asmal. We have a joint minmec with the  Education  and  the  Sport  and
Recreation minmecs. They call it the council; I call it minmec. We will  get
them together. We'll talk about  this  so  that  it  cascades  down  to  the
provinces and so that every teacher, even in the rural areas, knows what  is
going to happen.

The second issue is indigenous sport. You spoke  about  it,  Mama  Khunou  -
diketho, uqgaphu, stick-fighting and all  those  sports.  Those  are  sports
that we want to recognise. The Sports Commission is  doing  very  well.  The
provinces are launching them, and I am very happy  with  the  way  they  are
coming on. I love skipping ugqaphu - you know,  rope  skipping.]  EsiXhoseni
ngugqaphu. [In Xhosa we call it ugqaphu.] It  is  played  by  counting  one,
two, three; ele ele; one, two, three; ele ele; and  then  you  jump.  I  can
still do it, and I love doing it. My children  get  embarrassed  when  I  do
these things. [Laughter.]
On the issue of Wassa, Women and Sport SA, I am aware that the Eastern  Cape
province has already launched its own association. I hope all others do  the
same. Bring in people who can be of benefit to women in sport. I would  love
to see that happening. This shouldn't just include women who  are  activists
only, but also those who are in sport. Put them together so  that  they  can
then be able to monitor what's happening with sport in  their  provinces.  I
am a father of three daughters. So I have a vested interest in  seeing  that
women's sport is taken seriously.

Regarding transformation, everybody has spoken about it, and I  fully  agree
with  them.  We  will  march  on  and  come  up  with  a   sports   national
transformation charter. We are left with few  provinces.  We  are  going  to
Limpopo - you are quite  correct  -  within  the  next  few  weeks.  We  are
launching this in Limpopo. We will do  this  with  the  other  provinces  as
well, finish it and come up with a charter. If we can  do  that  in  mining,
commerce and other spheres of our lives,  then  why  don't  we  do  that  in
sport? Therefore we  are  busy  doing  that  in  sport  so  that  nobody  is
confused. We don't confuse Mr Raju and his party  anymore,  because  at  the
moment they are very confused.

MEC Tata Mfebe spoke very well. He is a good orator.  He  spoke  very,  very
well. To have MECs of that calibre in all the provinces makes  my  job  very
easy, because they are clued up. They know exactly what needs  to  be  done.
So I am very happy with the contribution.

With regard to the motor grand prix, yes, I do welcome what you  have  said.
I don't have a fat budget. There is a difference between fat  and  big.  You
see, people think that Ngconde is fat. No, I am not. I am  big.  [Laughter.]
That's what makes sportspeople think before they say anything to me.  Ek  is
groot. [I am big.] So, before you say anything silly, you think  twice.  You
just don't say whatever  you  like.  [Laughter.]  I  am  present,  you  see.
[Laughter.]

You spoke about the issue of disabled sport. These are the sportspeople  who
bring us the most medals. Can we give them,  the  disabled  sportspeople,  a
big hand? [Applause.] They give us the best and bring the  biggest  haul  of
medals to this country. These are people such as Zanele  Situ,  Pringle  and
Terrence Parkin. They really make us very proud, and we  should  be  looking
after them. So each  and  every  province  should  be  looking  after  these
people.

Western Cape, thank you very much for uniting the associations for  disabled
sportspeople. This then will link up with Disability Sport  SA  at  national
level. Last week I visited the Efata School for the Deaf and the Blind  near
Fairfield Senior  Secondary  School  where  the  ANC  in  Cicirha  held  the
provincial conference  of  the  ANC.  I  visited  that  area  to  give  them
equipment. I am going to be going back there to assist Efata to  be  in  the
mainstream of disabled sport in our country so that they can participate.

Lastly, I will keep on interfering and intervening. I will  not  stop  doing
that. You can write, you can squeal, you can complain, you  can  throw  your
toys out the cot, it won't help. You can see that I  am  thick-skinned,  and
nothing is going to stop me from doing that. I've been given a  task  to  do
by the President of this country and the ANC and, by golly, I'm going to  do
it. It's as simple as that.  You  complain,  and  you'll  do  anything  from
another party, but please just forget about that. Join  us  to  do  what  is
correct. Your complaints on the side are not going to help us.

Lastly, facilities are a  problem.  I've  spoken  about  them,  and  I  know
exactly what needs to be done because I visit most areas. We  need  to  look
at this issue. Also, regarding the issue of this World  Cup,  I  agree  with
what the members have said, especially Mr Dugmore  whose  brother  was  also
one of the best fly halfs I have  ever  seen  play  for  UCT.  It  was  your
younger brother? [Interjections.] Oh! Kwakulamba usana apho. [Oh! That  game
was tough.] He was good. He was a youngster to me. He  got  in  when  I  had
just finished playing. I really thought that one day I could  get  him  back
and  try  to  show  him  what  we  did  in  our  time.  He  was  very  good.
[Interjections.] Yes, you are right, my days are gone. I wish that 40  years
could be taken off my age. [Laughter.] Taken off, and I  can  just  be,  you
know ...

You see, when we talk about the bid and other  things,  I  think  we  should
look at our country holistically. The little issue of a mishap  between  the
coach, the what-have-you, and everything else, does not say  that  we  don't
have the integrity, we don't the capacity, nor the commitment to be able  to
refocus ourselves. We should  not  make  a  big  issue  out  of  one  little
incident. By actually driving it further and further and  making  it  a  big
issue, we are really not doing this country any  justice.  So  I  am  really
hoping that whatever comments we make about this,  they  are  comments  that
can be beneficial to the country.

I am not here as the Minister to demonise South  African  sport.  I  am  not
here to do that. I am here to enhance sport and to  make  sure  that  it  is
assisted  in  order  that  it  is  run   efficiently,   democratically   and
transparently. So, this is not about demonising sport.

I am not going to read the  headlines  of  a  newspaper  and  start  saying:
``Look at these people! What are they doing?'' No. My job is  to  make  sure
that I call them together, intervene and convince them that this is  not  in
the best interests of the  country.  Leadership  suggests  that  we  refocus
people. We make sure that we persuade them. We make sure that we  coax  them
into a particular position, and we make  sure  that  we  reach  compromises,
compromises that are in  the  best  interests  of  sport  and  in  the  best
interests of the country.

So, whatever happened last week on Thursday, it is  not  something  that  is
going to make me stand up and say: ``You were wrong;  you  were  right;  you
were this or that''. That is not for me to do. For me it  is  to  sit  down,
listen and give leadership, and then come up with a position in  order  that
we can say to the country: ``We are out of this morass now. We are  focusing
this way''.

At the present moment the compromise that has  been  reached  is  that  Jomo
will coach the team on Thursday. That has been accepted. The  coach,  Shakes
Mashaba - I am saying the coach as well - accepts that. We are  going  there
on Thursday as a country to launch the international bid and  to  make  sure
that we send a message out there that says: ``Dempsey or  no  Dempsey,  this
time we are going to host the football World Cup in our country.''

Regarding whatever problems we encounter, Bra Steve used  to  say  that  you
use all gears when you drive a  car:  first  gear,  second  gear,  sometimes
reverse gear when you see that you're in the mud. You reverse and  get  out.
I respect Mr Raju. He is a sportsperson. He knows sport. If some  people  in
the party he belongs give him the  wrong  advice,  the  credibility  that  I
think you have as a former sportsperson is going to  wane  and  fall.  Don't
take any advice they give you. [Laughter.] [Interjection.] Don't  take  that
advice. They really are messing you around, Mr Raju.  [Laughter.]  Trust  me
when I say this. I am younger than you. Trust me.

They are really messing you around. I don't want to look at you  and  see  a
bitter old man who is confused. I want to look at you and  say  that  that's
the man who said to me one day ... Papwa Sewgolum was given  his  trophy  in
the rain in this country. Mr Raju was there. Mr Raju  knew  what  was  going
on. He brought that whole thing to him. Do not be made a pawn by people  who
do not like this country. Don't be made a pawn. Don't do that to yourself.

We are on course. We know what we are  doing.  Come  Thursday,  we  will  be
playing in Durban, launching this bid. After that we will sit down with  the
coach  and  with  Safa.  Again,  this  Minister  will  intervene  and   give
direction, and we will move forward. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, hon  Minister,  for  the
exciting debate. It really shows that we have a Minister who is very  active
in all the sporting codes in this country. Thank  you  very  much.  We  wish
that all Ministers would do the same  to  keep  us  happy  and  be  able  to
address real issues in this House.

Debate concluded.
 SALUTE TO THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF AFRICA - THE 40-YEAR CONTRIBUTION OF THE OAU
                        TO AFRICA'S FREEDOM AND UNITY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Madam Chairperson of Committees, I  am  pleased
to have this  opportunity  to  introduce  this  very  important  debate.  As
members are aware, on 25 May we shall commemorate the  40th  anniversary  of
the Organisation of African Unity - an important commemoration  indeed.  The
celebrations that we held last year to welcome the  launch  of  the  African
Union and those that will mark the OAU's  contribution  to  African  freedom
and progress this Sunday are a rare opportunity for South Africa and  Africa
to mark the historic achievements of Africans.

In an address to the Ghana National Assembly on 8 August 1960,  against  the
background of the crisis in  the  Congo  created  by  the  presence  of  the
Belgian troops and  the  secession  of  Katanga,  Kwame  Nkrumah  argued  as
follows:
  The African struggle for independence and unity must begin with political
  union. A loose confederation of economic co-operation is deceptively time
  delaying. It is only a political union that will ensure a  uniformity  in
  our foreign policy, projecting the  African  personality  and  presenting
  Africa as a force important to be reckoned with.

I repeat, he said:


  A loose economic co-operation means a  screen  behind  which  detractors,
  imperialists and colonialist protagonists and African puppet leaders hide
  to operate and weaken the concept of any effort to realise African  unity
  and independence. A  political  union  envisages  a  common  foreign  and
  defence policy, and rapid social, economic and  industrial  developments.
  The economic resources of Africa are immense and staggering. It  is  only
  by unity that these resources can be utilised for  the  progress  of  the
  continent and for the happiness of mankind.

It is clear from these words that the formation of the OAU  was  a  response
to a desire, a desire that the shared  African  experience  made  necessary;
that geography and history made necessary;  a  desire  to  give  Africa  the
appropriate hearing in  the  councils  of  the  world,  a  hearing  that  it
deserved.

As Salim Salim, one-time Secretary-General to the OAU, wrote:


  The founding fathers and mothers recognised then, as  we  recognise  more
  vividly  today,  that  the  salvation  of  Africa   does   not   lie   in
  individualised action, but in the collective approach at the  continental
  level. Consequently, the search for unity has continued to be  a  guiding
  philosophy and an ideal to whose achievement the Organisation of  African
  Unity has dedicated itself.

We as South Africans are correct to commemorate the Organisation of  African
Unity's contribution to unity, liberation and democracy  on  the  continent.
There are many commentators both on our continent and outside  who  tend  to
be negative about Africa, yet few can deny the important impact of  the  OAU
on South African and African affairs.

One of the most significant contributions  to  the  liberation  struggle  is
that made by the liberation committee of the Organisation of African  Unity.
The liberation committee worked to ensure African support for  our  struggle
and ensured that South Africa under apartheid was never off  the  agenda  of
the Organisation of African Unity.

The existence of the Organisation of  African  Unity  also  ensured  African
attention to the  resolution  of  conflict.  As  the  report  of  the  South
Commission states: ``The Charter of the OAU sets up ways  for  the  peaceful
resolution of intra-African disputes.'' And although these were  not  always
effective, the OAU has time  and  again  succeeded  in  dampening  incipient
conflict or in adding pressure for settlement.

The various OAU charters on rights place Africa in the domain of  continents
that were ready to give attention to universally  recognised  human  rights.
Many countries on the  continent  failed  to  observe  these  rights  or  to
produce laws that advanced the exercise  of  them.  Nevertheless,  for  many
African people they served  as  a  guiding  standard,  one  that  was  often
woefully absent from the lives of our people.

This lack of implementation of OAU charter agreements is,  in  my  view,  an
important signpost for African parliaments and for the  new  African  Union,
because in their founding  protocols  we  find  similar  provisions.  We  as
parliaments have a  responsibility  to  encourage  action  on  international
agreements and to ensure that  our  governments  act  to  make  charters  of
rights a practical reality.

We often engage as parliamentarians in deliberations on these  charters  and
other international instruments and yet,  very  rarely,  do  we  spend  time
assessing the degree to which they are indeed acted upon in our country  and
countries on the continent. I believe as Parliament that we need to take  on
this review and role far more seriously.

The African Union, as a further  advance  of  the  Organisation  of  African
Unity, must also seek to develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure  compliance
with resolutions of the union. The Commission on Peace and Security  should,
for  example,  initiate  a  process  of  ensuring   that   governments   and
parliaments are alert to action that should be taken  to  ensure  compliance
with humanitarian law. Just last week a uniform  report  on  the  impact  of
conflict on women was launched in our Parliament. The report clearly  points
to the  need  to  ensure  observance  on  our  continent  and  elsewhere  of
humanitarian law. Our countries and our parliaments  must  ensure  that  the
security services are trained in  these  areas  and  that  school  curricula
focus on humanitarian issues and conduct geared toward humanitarian law.

Our commemoration of the OAU also needs  to  be  a  celebration  of  African
achievements and, unfortunately, as Africans we don't  often  celebrate.  It
is a fact that most of the positive developments of note in Africa  occurred
in the postindependence era, that is during the life of the Organisation  of
African Unity. For example, education provision and development was a  focus
of  African  governments  after  independence  and   not   an   outcome   of
colonialism. We often tend to have a view that  it  is  the  colonisers  who
introduced education on our continent,  but  it  is  the  governments  after
independence that, in fact, pursued educational  development  and  provision
in many of our countries.

Many  of  you  would  know,  for  example,  that  when   Botswana   achieved
independence, there was only one  secondary  school  in  the  whole  of  the
country,  whereas  today  there  are  more  than  30  secondary  schools  in
Botswana, introduced by the government of Botswana  after  independence  and
not in the colonial era. We need to begin  to  acknowledge  the  history  of
African achievement. We need to ensure that the achievements of  Africa  are
part of our historical record and part  of  the  historical  record  of  the
Organisation of African Unity.
One of the most significant issues that I believe  we  should  all  confront
and seek answers to is the need to popularise the work of  the  Organisation
of African Unity and the work of our new body, the  African  Union.  We,  as
African  people,  are  often  forced  to  accept  negative  definitions   of
Africans, because our sources on African knowledge are  non-African  sources
and often are commentators who are ignorant of the  condition  of  Africans,
or are persons  who  have  internalised  the  pessimistic  view  of  African
progress. We  need  to  develop  our  own  record  of  our  progress.  These
commentators  succeed  in  the  morale  disarmament  of  Africans,   because
Africans  and  African  organisations  have  neglected  the  development  of
indigenous records of African progress, of  indigenous  records  of  African
achievements, of indigenous records of African challenges.

The African Union has to begin promoting writing on African  affairs  as  an
ongoing activity. A popular, accessible, multilingual annual publication  on
the African Union should be produced  each  year  to  keep  our  communities
abreast of the African Union. We could also look at  giving  nongovernmental
organisations a role in this regard.

Alongside preparing this 2003 African  Union  popular  report,  the  African
Union could also ensure that a publication on the  Organisation  of  African
Unity is commissioned so that the historic  contribution  of  the  OAU,  its
offices and its participants are preserved for all  time.  Who  will  ensure
that we remember Salim Salim? We do not have a record  of  his  contribution
as Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity, and much  of  the
record of the Organisation of African Unity is absent from our bookshelves.

The Organisation of  African  Unity  was  established  primarily  to  assist
Africa in coping with the postcolonial  challenge.  It  did  vital  work  in
ensuring a transition to full liberation and to African unity. The  creation
today of the African Union provides for increased  attention  to  the  large
number  of  outstanding  development  challenges  that  the  OAU  sought  to
address, but couldn't fully win victory on.
On the economic front, as Africa, we must focus on economic integration  and
on ensuring that for the first time the  natural  resources  of  Africa  are
exploited in the interests of Africa and not the interests of the North.  In
the daunting areas of social development, the key  objectives  we  face  are
universal primary education for all children by 2015, adequate  housing  for
all  the  people  on  our  continent,  improved  communication  in  all  our
countries, expanded infrastructure so that we are able to  travel  and  move
goods on all our roads throughout the countries of the  continent,  and  the
combating of the scourge of HIV/Aids.

Reaching these objectives will  require  open,  democratic  and  transparent
governance if we are  to  succeed  in  transforming  the  continent.  We  as
Africans, will have to assume responsibility for our progress, and  we  will
increasingly rely on the leadership of the African Union.

Our development strategies must be people-centred and should lead  countries
into a future of equitable and sustainable development. The priority has  to
be meeting the basic needs of the  people.  Our  focus  should  be  on  food
security,  on  health  provision,  on  educational  access,  on   employment
creation and on national economic development for sustainable growth.

Success in such  a  focus  will  require  attention  and  resources  to  the
development  and  support  of  women  on  our  continent.  As  is  now  well
documented, it is impossible to ensure development of our continent  if  50%
of our people  are  underdeveloped,  neglected  and  exploited.  In  Africa,
despite their  marginalisation,  women  play  a  vital  role  in  productive
activities and in supporting families and communities. Therefore equity  and
national growth require due prominence to the specific concerns of women.

Our continent must urgently address the challenge of mastering  science  and
technology. The gap of development in the world today is a gap of access  to
science and technology. We do not,  as  a  continent,  have  the  luxury  of
delaying this access. It is critical that we close the  gap.  Our  countries
will need to overhaul their educational systems in  order  to  give  greater
attention to education in science, in engineering and in  a  wide  range  of
technical skills.

Our economic growth will have to be improved through improved  and  expanded
production  of  goods  and  services.  Agricultural  development  and   food
security can also be improved through  learning,  perhaps,  from  India  and
China. We need to encourage domestic food  production  and  to  ensure  that
food  imports  are  not  a  requirement  for  Africa.  Land  ownership   and
redistribution, plus support for new owners of  this  means  of  production,
would be part of the solutions that we need to adopt.

As the OAU found in the years of its existence,  conflict  is  the  greatest
inhibitor to development and social progress. The  African  Union  needs  to
ensure that we end conflicts on the continent. The Organisation  of  African
Unity provided the foundation for  the  pursuit  of  these  objectives.  Our
Parliament has a duty to commemorate the OAU and to ensure  positive  action
and progress in realising the new aspirations of Africa.

As we face these challenges, it is important to remember that  all  of  them
have been part of the OAU's contribution to deliberations on  the  continent
for more than 40 years. In fact, at a meeting in 1963 of the  African  heads
of state in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia,  the  Economic  Community  for  Africa
secretariat was reporting on  the  structure  of  production  and  trade  in
Africa. The commission indicated that there was a growing  need  for  Africa
to look at developing common markets, and that we needed to ensure  that  we
plan African economic progress on a continental basis.

The ECA was a body established by the Organisation of African  Unity.  Thus,
we have the record which tells us which path we should follow. All that  our
Parliament must now do is take up the cudgels of what has  been  left  as  a
legacy by the Organisation of African Unity in order to ensure  that  indeed
on our continent  we  do  see  freedom  and  democracy  thrive.  Thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]
Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, hon members and special delegates,  40  years  ago
next Sunday the heads of state of the  then  independent  African  countries
gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to found a  great  African  organisation,
the OAU, an organisation which  was  charged  with  the  responsibility  of,
amongst other things, ridding the continent of the then  remaining  vestiges
of  colonialism  and  apartheid,  promoting  unity  and  solidarity  amongst
African states, co-ordinating and intensifying co-operation for  development
and the defence of sovereignty, territorial integrity and  consolidation  of
independence of African states,  and  promoting  international  co-operation
within the framework of the United Nations.

These lofty ideals that the African leaders set for  themselves  were  based
on the historic conditions  Africa  found  itself  in  then.  These  were  a
culmination of decades of debate  on  Pan-African  unity  and  the  struggle
against colonialism.

Looking at conditions  today,  one  might  be  tempted  to  say  that  those
founding  principles  were  inadequate.  But  given  the   conditions   that
prevailed then in Africa, and looking at them  through  the  lens  of  time,
those ideals were revolutionary and need to be applauded. These leaders  and
other forces for progress on the African continent have worked  relentlessly
for the past 40 years to liberate the African continent  from  the  shackles
of colonialism and neocolonialism. That, in essence, was a  struggle  for  a
better life for the African people.

Today as we take stock of the achievements of the OAU,  we  can  safely  say
that they fought a good fight. It was a good  fight,  because  as  we  speak
today, 40 years later, Africa is liberated from Cape to Cairo.

We must pay  tribute  and  salute  the  African  countries,  especially  the
liberation committee of the OAU and  the  then  frontline  states,  for  the
unconditional  support  they  gave  us  during  our  own  struggle   against
apartheid.

The frontline states were steadfast, even at a time when  their  own  people
were being killed and maimed by the regime whose aim was to  force  them  to
expel the ANC from their countries. We owe it  to  those  who  died  in  the
frontline states to see us free to continue to fight for a  better  life  in
Africa. We have in mind here people like Samora Machel.

African leaders, since the formation of the OAU, have made several  attempts
to rid the continent of backwardness.  Between  1990  and  1995  alone,  the
Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  adopted  a  series  of
policy documents to galvanise the international  community  to  provide  the
necessary  and   requisite   resources   for   the   social   and   economic
transformation of the continent.

The demise of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries led to the  end
of the East-West conflict, thus the end of the bipolar  world  and  bringing
into being a unipolar world. The development of new democracies  in  Eastern
Europe made the world switch attention from Africa  to  Eastern  Europe.  It
became clear that European countries  would  choose  to  help  poor  Eastern
European countries rather than African  countries.  The  concept  of  common
European rule, developed by European countries, forced  African  leaders  to
have a new and fresh appraisal of the international situation.

It was therefore considered time for Africa to return to  the  principle  of
African solutions to  African  problems.  Herein  lies  the  origin  of  the
African reawakening or the African Renaissance. This takes us back to  1997,
to the ANC Mafikeng conference. There the ANC passed a  resolution  that  we
would strive for a better Africa and a better world. The  developments  that
took place on this continent after that conference, as co-sponsored  by  our
President, Comrade Thabo Mbeki, must be seen in that very light.

It is for this reason that the advent of this new century in the  year  2000
was then referred  to  as  the  African  century.  The  African  Renaissance
concept is a vision of African leaders as, I quote: ... to place  Africa  in
its rightful place among the community of nations and the continents in  the
world''.

To  realise  this  vision,  there  was  a  need  for  a  programme  and   an
institutional framework. That programme  is  Nepad  which,  as  we  are  all
aware:


  ... is a commitment and a pledge by African leaders to rid the  continent
  of poverty and to place their countries individually and collectively  on
  the path of sustainable growth and development.

They further committed themselves to good governance,  democracy  and  human
rights, as these are prerequisites for development and growth.

The institutional framework to achieve these global objectives that  African
leaders had set themselves in the AU, as the successor of the OAU,  and  all
its organs, such as the African Assembly, the Council of Ministers, the Pan-
African Parliament, are part and parcel of that. Nepad and the  AU  are,  in
essence, the continuation of the struggle for a better Africa  by  the  OAU,
albeit at a higher level and under new conditions.

We support Nepad and all its programmes. It  is  for  that  reason  that  we
support economic partnerships in the areas  of  transport  and  energy  with
countries  in  the  Southern  African  region  and  further  afield  on  the
continent.  The  partnerships  that  Eskom,   Transnet   and   other   state
enterprises are building  with  Ghana,  Nigeria,  Namibia  and  Uganda  give
material reality to a process of African development and our  commitment  to
it.

The establishment of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park between  South  Africa
and Botswana, and the more  ambitious  Gaza-Kruger-Gonarezhou  Transfrontier
Park between South  Africa,  Mozambique  and  Zimbabwe  make  even  doubting
Thomases pause to appreciate Africa's commitment  to  home-brewed  solutions
to Africa's problems. The potential is there for Africa to  become  a  world
giant, given its resources.

We want to also indicate that, yes, the potential is there, but it is not  a
bed of roses. There are problems that we need to tackle  if  we  are  to  be
equal to the high ideals we elaborated in Nepad. Not  all  the  problems  of
African countries are as a result of colonial  history.  Some  of  them  are
subjective and are caused by Africans  themselves.  The  whole  question  of
corruption,  bad  governance,  skewed   income   distribution,   coups   and
countercoups are but some of the problems that are ... [Inaudible.]

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Hon member, your  time
has expired.

Mr B J TOLO: In conclusion, we must also recognise and  remember  the  great
walls of Mapungubwe, the great civilisation of the Nile River, and the  Rift
Valley, for we are because they were. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, die OAU  het  beslis  'n  baie  belangrike  rol
gespeel om Afrika te bevry van die bande van kolonialisme  en  ook  om  deur
middel van steun van Afrikalande aan die vryheidstryd en die druk wat  hulle
uitgeoefen het op daardie lande wat steeds  die  apartheidsregering  gesteun
het, 'n groot bydrae te maak tot die  beëindiging  van  apartheid  in  Suid-
Afrika.

Dit kon egter net gebeur, omdat Afrikalande ten spyte van al  hulle  rasse-,
etniese-, godsdienstige-, politieke-, linguistiese  en  kulturele  verskille
saamgestaan het, en onder die vaandel van die OAU  'n  verenigde  front  kon
vorm, saamgebind deur  hul  passie  om  die  stryd  van  bevryding  teen  'n
gesamentlike vyand te wen.

Daardie stryd is nou verby. Vorige koloniale owerhede en  witmense  wat  van
oor die water gekom het, is nie meer die vyand nie. Daar  is  egter  nou  'n
nuwe bevrydingstryd in Afrika. Dit is die stryd teen armoede, teen  misdaad,
teen MIV/vigs  en  ander  siektes  soos  malaria  en  tering,  werkloosheid,
korrupsie, swak regering, outokrasie, skending van menseregte en  die  stryd
teen Afro-pessimisme en natuurlik ook interne etniese konflik.

Net soos wat eenheid en konsentrasie van poging en fokus  op  die  doelwitte
vir al die Afrika-lande nodig was in die  bevrydingstryd  teen  kolonialisme
en teen apartheid, is dit 'n absolute vereiste om te kan slaag in  die  nuwe
stryd.

Net soos wat dit nie in die bevrydingstryd teen  kolonialisme  en  apartheid
toegelaat is dat enkele lidlande die bevrydingstryd kon  kortwiek  of  lamlê
nie, net so kan dit nie in die  nuwe  stryd  van  Afrika  om  bevryding  van
armoede en misdaad en al die ander  dinge  toegelaat  word  nie,  omdat  die
bereiking van die groter gesamentlike doelwit wat in die belang van  al  die
miljoene mense van Afrika is, soveel belangriker is en soveel groter  is  as
die ego's en die grille van enkeles wat nog vasgevang is in stryde  van  die
verlede.

In die belang van al die  mense  van  Afrika  moet  ons  diesulkes  help  om
dringend aan te pas by en deel te word van die nuwe bevrydingstryd, of  waar
hulle nie kan of wil nie, om hulle te help om vrywilliglik die  leisels  oor
te gee aan mense wat wel  bereid  is  om  deel  te  word  van  hierdie  nuwe
bevrydingstryd. Want u sien, die sterkste ketting  van  eenheid  is  net  so
sterk soos die swakste skakel daarin.

Die lidlande van die OAU het in hulle wysheid ook ingesien dat die  OAU  die
bevrydingstryd teen kolonialisme  en  apartheid  suksesvol  afgehandel  het,
maar dat dit nie ten beste geskik was om die nuwe  bevrydingstryd  effektief
aan te pak en met sukses deur te voer nie.  En  het  daarom  besluit  om  te
ontbind en om op te gaan in die nuwe Afrika-unie wat ontwerp  is  om  daarop
te fokus om die probleme en enorme uitdagings van Afrika aan te pak  en  ook
op te los. Hulle het ingesien dat die  afwesigheid  van  'n  koherente  stel
Afrika-instellings grootliks bygedra het tot die afwesigheid van  voldoende,
volhoubare ontwikkeling en die  afwesigheid  van  behoorlike  en  volhoubare
demokrasie in die meeste lande van Afrika.

Dít is waarom die AU en die inisiatiewe soos Nepad gestig is en waarom  daar
besluit is op 'n Pan-Afrika Parlement en ander strukture.  Dit  is  nou  vir
ons as leiers om ons bes te doen om  te  sorg  dat  hierdie  en  ander  nuwe
instellings tot hul volle potensiaal ontwikkel en aangewend word, sodat  die
nuwe bevrydingstryd van Afrika ook gewen kan word.

Dit is belangrik om voortdurend te let  op  al  die  doelstellings  van  die
Afrika-unie. Ek het nie nou tyd om op hulle almal in te gaan nie,  maar  dit
is nie net toevallig dat  die  eerste  doelstelling  daarvan  is  om  groter
eenheid en solidariteit ook tussen Afrika-lande en die mense van  Afrika  te
bewerkstellig nie.

Wanneer  ons  onsself  ten  volle  in  die  stryd  inwerp  in  hierdie  nuwe
bevrydingstryd  met  die  passie  wat  ons  as  werklik  patriotiese   Suid-
Afrikaners en Afrikane betaam, soos ek hoop ons almal onsself sien, dan  kan
ons ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, the OAU definitely  played  a  very  important
role in freeing Africa from the bonds of colonialism and also, by  means  of
supporting  African  countries  in  the  struggle  for  liberation  and  the
pressure they exerted on those countries that still supported the  apartheid
government, made a big contribution to ending apartheid in South Africa.

It could however  only  happen  because  African  countries,  despite  their
racial, ethnic, religious, political, linguistic and  cultural  differences,
stood together, and under the  banner  of  the  OAU,  could  present  united
front; united by their passion to triumph in  the  struggle  for  liberation
against a common enemy.

That struggle is over now. Previous colonial authorities  and  white  people
who came from across the waters, are no longer the enemy.  Now  there  is  a
new struggle for  liberation  in  Africa,  however;  that  is  the  struggle
against poverty, against crime, against HIV/Aids  and  other  diseases  like
malaria  and  tuberculosis,  unemployment,  corruption,   poor   governance,
autocracy, the violation of human rights  and  the  struggle  against  Afro-
pessimism and, of course, also internal ethnic conflict.

Just as unity and a concentration of effort and focus on the goals  for  all
the African countries were necessary in the  struggle  for  liberation  from
colonialism  and  against  apartheid,  it  is  absolutely  essential  to  be
successful in the new struggle.

Just as it was not allowed for single countries to handicap or paralyse  the
struggle for liberation against colonialism  and  apartheid,  it  cannot  be
allowed in the new struggle to free Africa from poverty and  crime  and  all
the other things, because the bigger, joint objective is in the interest  of
all the millions of people of Africa, so much bigger than the egos  and  the
whims of individuals who are still trapped in the struggles of the past.

In the interest of all the people of Africa, we must help  these  people  to
urgently adapt to and become part of the new liberation struggle,  or  where
they cannot or do not want to,  to  help  them  voluntarily  hand  over  the
reigns of power to people who are in fact willing to become a part  of  this
new struggle for liberation. Because you see,  the  strongest  chain  is  as
weak as its weakest link.

The member countries of the OAU in their wisdom had the insight to see  that
the  OAU  successfully  completed   the   struggle   for   freedom   against
colonialism,  but  that  it  was  not  best  suited   to   effectively   and
successfully executing the  new  liberation  struggle.  And  therefore  they
decided to dissolve and to become part of the new  African  Union  which  is
designed to focus on addressing and  resolving  the  problems  and  enormous
challenges of Africa. They have seen that the absence of a coherent  set  of
African  institutions  greatly  contributed  to  the  absence  of  adequate,
sustainable development and the absence of proper and sustainable  democracy
in most of the countries of Africa.

That is why the AU and the initiatives like Nepad were established  and  why
it was decided to establish a Pan African Parliament and  other  structures.
It is now up to us as leaders to do our best to make  sure  that  these  and
other new institutions are developed and applied to their full potential  so
that the new struggle for the liberation of Africa can also be won.
It is important constantly to  take  note  of  all  the  objectives  of  the
African Union. I do not have the time now to touch on all of  them,  but  it
is not a mere coincidence  that  its  first  objective  is  to  bring  about
greater unity and solidarity amongst African countries  and  the  people  of
Africa.

When we throw ourselves fully into this new  liberation  struggle  with  the
passion becoming of us as real patriotic South Africans and Africans,  as  I
hope all of us see ourselves, then we can ...]

... then we can be encouraged by the words of John C Maxwell when he says


  ... problems are solvable. They always have an answer. Perhaps the answer
  is hidden, but there is an answer. The difficulty lies  not  so  much  in
  finding the answer, but in being unwilling to pay the price  for  solving
  it.

The question is: Are we, all of us, prepared to  pay  that  price?  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Nkk J N VILAKAZI:  Mphathisihlalo  ohloniphekileyo  neNdlu  yonke,  isihloko
esikhuluma ngaso namuhla siphakamisa sibonga  iqhaza  ebelibanjwa  yi-Afrika
iminayaka engama-40 kwabunjwa inhlangano yobumbano  yamazwe  ase-Afrika,  i-
Organisation of African Unity, i-OAU lena esizoguquka ibe yi-African  Union.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson and the House at  large,  the  topic  we  are
discussing today commends the role that was  played  by  Africa  in  the  40
years since the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)  was  formed,  which  is
now going to be known as the African Union.]

The OAU we are talking about today was founded  on  25  May  1963  in  Addis
Ababa. Its main aim was to unite and deal with common  problems  and  issues
affecting the African continent as a whole. Today is 20 May, just five  days
before the 40th anniversary of the founding of the OAU on 25 May.

Inhlangano  yobumbano  yamazwe  e-Afrika   ibaluleke   kakhulu   ngoba   ibe
yisisekelo  sokuhlangana  kubhungwe  ngezimo  eziningi   ezithinta   inhlalo
yabantu e-Afrika jikelele.

Sibathulela  isigqoko  abaholi  be-Afrika  ababamba  iqhaza  kwadaleka  lesi
siksekelo esibaluleke kangaka  okumanje  nje  sikhuluma  ulimi  lwenhlangano
yobumbano lwe-Afrika, i-African Union  ezinjongo  zayo  kungukubamba  iqhaza
elithe xaxa kuleli ebelibanjwe yi-OAU kule minyaka.

Siyazi sonke ukuthi amazwe ase-Afrika abehlaseleke  kakhulu  izifo,  indlala
nokusakazeka  kungekho  ukubumbana  nokubambisana.   Lokhu   kwenze   izinga
lomnotho  lehla  amandla.  I-OAU  ibibambe  iqhaza   elikhulu   ekubhekeleni
ukuphepha  nokukhuseleka  kwamazwe   e-Afrika.   (Translation   of   isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[The African Union is a very important organisation  because  it  forms  the
basis for discussing various situations that affect the  society  of  Africa
generally.

We commend  African  leaders  who  played  a  very  important  role  in  the
establishment of this important  institution,  which  now  talks  about  the
unity of Africa. The African Union aims to be more  involved  than  the  OAU
was.

We all know  that  African  countries  were  mostly  affected  by  diseases,
poverty and the fact that they were not united. This led  to  a  decline  in
the economy. The  OAU  played  a  crucial  role  in  monitoring  safety  and
security in African countries.]

As Africans we are all aware that the African continent has  been  afflicted
by wars, fragmentation, famine, HIV/Aids and national disasters. We do  hope
that the transformation of the OAU into the AU will promote the economy  and
development of Africa as a whole.

Sihlalo ohloniphekileyo, igalelo lale nhlangano yobumbano lwe-Afrika  i-OAU,
leminyaka  engama-40  libalulekile  kule  mikhakha.  Owokuqala,  ukuxazulula
izingxabano emazweni ase-Afrika. Okwesibili, ukubamba  imihlangano  emikhulu
ebiphuma nezinqumo  eziqondene  namasu  okuletha  intuthuko  e-Afrika  lonke
jikelele.  Okwesithathu,  amakhomishane   anhlobonhlobo   abebhekela   izimo
ezithile emazweni njengekhomishana  yokulamula  izingxabano,  eyokubuyisana,
eyezomnotho, eyezenhlalakahle,  eyezokuthutha,  eyezemfundo,  eyokuxoxisana,
eyezempilo neyezokuvikela amalungelo. Angazi ngingabala ngithini, kuningi.

Isebenzile  kakhulu  inhlangano  i-OAU  kule  minyaka  engama-40   yabunjwa,
esethemba ukuthi  inhlangano  ezongena  engumphumela  we-OAU,  yona  eyi-AU,
izondlondlobala nayo ngelayo  izinga.  Egameni  le-IFP  siyawubonga  kakhulu
umsebenzi  neqhaza  ebelibanjwe  yi-OAU   kulama-40   eminyaka.   [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, the OAU played a very crucial role with  regard  to,  firstly,
resolving conflicts  amongst  African  countries;  secondly,  holding  major
conferences  where  decisions   concerning   strategies   to   bring   about
development in the whole  of  Africa  were  made;  and,  thirdly,  different
commissions that looked after  certain  situations  in  different  countries
such as the commission for  resolving  conflicts,  reconciliation,  economy,
social  welfare,  transport,  education,  negotiations,  health  and   human
rights. The list is endless.

The OAU worked very hard during these 40 years  of  its  existence,  and  we
hope that the AU will play its part. On behalf of the  IFP  we  commend  the
work and the role played by the OAU during these 40 years. [Applause.]]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I am delivering this speech today  on  behalf  of
Ms Sandra Botha who  is  part  of  a  delegation  of  the  Joint  Monitoring
Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women,  which  has
decided to travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  They  have  done  so
using their own resources, and I believe they have done so in the  interests
of peace and unity on the African continent. I am sure all of  us  wish  the
whole delegation the best of luck in their endeavours and success.

Kofi Annan had the United Nations in mind when he delivered  his  millennium
report and said the following:


  We must adapt international institutions,  through  which  states  govern
  together, to the realities of the new era.

He might as well have heralded the formation of  the  African  Union,  which
superseded the formation of the Organisation of African Unity.

It would be entirely  misleading  to  view  the  future  of  Africa  without
acknowledging the foundations laid by the Organisation of African  Unity  or
recognising  the  vision  of  people  such  as  Kwame  Nkrumah  who  was  so
influential in forging today's unity.

As for the freedom we cherish today, some African leaders  could  take  some
credit, but it is to the African peoples that we  owe  our  real  gratitude.
These cherished  values  were  brought  about  despite  a  long  history  of
internecine  wars,   slavery,   relentless   colonisation,   and   regional,
linguistic and political differences. But, much  as  the  OAU  brought  into
being the notion of Africa as a continental entity and  political  unity  of
purpose, it was the  regime  change  in  South  Africa  which  heralded  the
beginning of a new awareness of the  need  for  deep-seated  change  in  the
governance of African states and unity on the economic front.

It is a sad fact that Africa is 30% poorer today than when the  Organisation
of African Unity was formed. Our hope of countering  this  trend  is  deeply
rooted in participation in a global economy. Multilateral institutions  need
global  strategies  which  are,  inter  alia,  dependent  on  standards   of
governance hitherto only present in African  states  in  a  very  fragmented
fashion.

Therefore, the peer review mechanism of the  new  African  Union,  with  its
express need for self-criticism  amongst  African  peers,  is  the  cardinal
element to distinguish it from the OAU which brooked no intrusion  on  state
sovereignty. Without this new element,  the  future  of  African  unity  and
freedom may well be obsolete. Thus  far  its  credibility  has  been  sorely
undermined by the overt support of Nigeria and South Africa for  the  Mugabe
regime.

Africa can take heart  from  the  continued  struggle  for  agreement  which
typifies the working of the European Union.  Every  new  membership  is  the
result of complicated negotiations, and for every  solution  a  new  problem
arises in its place. But despite differences so  vividly  demonstrated  with
regard to the invasion of Iraq, the European Union has  become  an  economic
powerhouse  and  world  power.  They  have,  however,  taken  adherence   to
transparency and standards  of  governance  which  invite  investment.  They
realise that participation in a global economy needs global strategies,  and
that progress is advanced by diversity and strengthened  by  the  acceptance
of modernisation and democracy as two sides of the same coin.

If we manage to see beyond our present  tendencies  towards  xenophobia  and
exclusion, accept the diverse  elements  which  constitute  our  demographic
make-up as an asset and not as an historic accident,  and  prevent  the  old
style of imperial leadership which focused on elite enrichment  rather  than
on the advancement of peoples, there is no reason  to  believe  that  Africa
cannot advance from its present achievements  to  even  greater  heights.  I
thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, it grieves me to say that I consider the motion  to
be   slightly   extravagant   and   an   unrealistic   interpretation    and
generalisation of the role of the OAU these past 40 years.

I think that what we need to do is to love Africa and  to  build  Africa  in
spite of its past, rather than because of its past. It would  be  wiser,  in
my view, and more productive of us to focus  on  a  hopeful  future,  rather
than trying to gild the lily of the OAU's rather flawed past.

The reality  is  that  we  have  seen  some  70  coups  d'état  by  military
dictatorships in Africa. We have seen governments preying  on  their  people
and consuming what wealth there was. With the  exception  of  a  few  states
like South Africa, Botswana and Namibia that have been exemplary,  there  is
not much for Africa to celebrate from the past, though the  future  is  much
more hopeful.

Just as the 19th century was the century of the entrepreneur  and  the  20th
century the century of management, the 21st century is the century in  which
the focus has swung to legitimacy  and  effectiveness  in  government  -  it
promises to be the century of governance.

Understandable  measurements  will   help   to   judge   that   stewardship,
performance and sustainability, and that information will  be  available  to
everybody worldwide at the click of a mouse. The  world  will  invest  in  a
country where they trust the government, the people  and  its  institutions,
governments like South Africa.  The  greater  the  trust,  the  greater  the
investment; the greater the certainty, the greater the investment. Money  is
``fungible'' it will go where the returns are highest and where  the  safety
is greatest.
The days of kneejerk loyalty to political parties are over, and also  so  in
Africa. The days when leaders could exploit and prey on their  citizens  and
then  still  expect  their  support  and  loyalty  are  over.  The  days  of
governments that govern by fear are over. The giant charade of  collectivism
was shattered when the Berlin Wall came  down  and  we  could  all  see  the
emperor was not wearing any clothes.

Unlike Africa, in South Africa we have done well these past nine  years.  We
have laid the basis for a successful society. We have laid the basis  for  a
springboard for Africa. Others can emulate  us,  others  can  join  us,  and
others can be inspired by us. We must love Africa and build Africa in  spite
of the past.

Let  us  go  forward  in  faith  and  hope  to  a  reformed,   restructured,
revitalised and improved African Union. Let us take  hands  and  build  this
great continent. Let us take hands and build this  great  country.  We  also
need to build our great institutions.
It is said today that the number of private companies that a country  boasts
is a better guide to its status  than  the  number  of  battleships  it  can
muster. It is interesting that even mighty South Africa - if you compare  it
to the Dow Jones: the first top 500 companies on  the  United  States  stock
exchange - would rank eighth in terms of its  GDP.  Harvard  University  has
roughly the same budget as the Republic of South Africa.

I say that not to demean us, but to  show  what  enormous  opportunity  lies
before us. There is indeed enormous and immense potential wealth in  Africa,
but we have to realise that even with that immense wealth of  Africa  today,
we only have a GDP less than that of little Holland, which is  smaller  than
the Western Cape, and which has a population of 27 million. So, there  is  a
great task ahead; a great challenge ahead. It beckons  us;  it  beckons  the
brave. It should inspire us. The opportunities are legion and unlimited.

The private liability company is the most radical  engine  of  progress  and
prosperity, and the key to  the  wealth  and  power  of  successful  nations
worldwide. It is interesting to see South African companies all over  Africa
starting branches and local partnerships wherever you go in Africa. This  is
the beginning, and we will be pioneers and lead the world  into  Africa  and
build this great continent. I thank you. [Applause.]

Nksz N C  KONDLO:  Mhlalingaphambili,  mandiqale  ngokuthi,  eneneni  imbali

(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Ms N C KONDLO: Chairperson, let me start off by saying  that  we  as  South
Africans come from really different  historical  backgrounds.  Listening  to
the hon member who has just left the podium saying that there is  no  reason
to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the OAU, it is  clearly  an  indication
of our different historical backgrounds in this country.]

Our country is proud to be part  of  the  African  continent.  Many  of  our
comrades and current leaders of Government,  during  our  own  struggle  for
liberation from apartheid, found various nations on  the  African  continent
more than willing to keep them safe, house them and offer them  refuge.  So,
we are indeed grateful that our leaders and  comrades  were  protected  then
and therefore able to serve us so well  in  all  their  different  areas  of
deployment.

This Africa Day is celebrated  throughout  the  continent  of  Africa  as  a
reminder of the various African nations' struggles for  democracy,  equality
and independence. On 25 May this year, at the Johannesburg Stadium, we  will
be celebrating Africa Day as  well  as  the  40th  anniversary  of  the  OAU
through music, dance and song, representing various nations  of  Africa.  On
the eve of Africa Day therefore, it is fitting that we  take  time  to  look
back on the achievements of Africa  as  it  emerged  from  the  shackles  of
colonialism to the present-day realities.

The OAU was founded in 1963 primarily to promote unity and solidarity  among
African states; to co-ordinate and intensify their co-operation and  efforts
to achieve a better  life  for  the  peoples  of  Africa;  to  defend  their
sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence; to eradicate all  forms
of colonialism from Africa; and to promote international  co-operation.  So,
the establishment of the OAU was indeed a momentous occasion  especially  in
view of the devastation and ravagement that Africa suffered at the hands  of
European invaders.

It was the conference in Addis Ababa which finally succeeded  in  overcoming
the linguistic, regional and political differences. It was  there  that  the
foreign Ministers  of  32  African  states  discussed  issues  such  as  the
creation of the Organisation of African Unity;  co-operation  among  African
states in economic, social,  educational,  cultural  and  scientific  areas;
collective defence; decolonisation;  apartheid  and  racial  discrimination;
the effects of economic grouping on  the  economic  development  of  Africa;
disarmament; the  creation  of  a  permanent  conciliation  commission;  and
Africa and the United Nations.

The heads of state  conference  in  May  1963  drew  up  a  charter  of  the
Organisation of African Unity, which was then signed by heads of  30  states
on 25 May 1963, as has  already  been  said.  Other  states  have  gradually
joined the OAU over the years, with South Africa becoming  the  53rd  member
in 1994. Since the establishment of  the  Abuja  Treaty,  which  formed  the
African  Economic  Community,  improvements  have  occurred   in   the   co-
ordination, harmonisation and progressive integration of the  activities  of
existing and future regional economic policies.

In an extraordinary summit in 1999 in Sirte,  heads  of  states,  under  the
theme, ``Strengthening OAU capacity to enable it to meet the  challenges  of
the new millennium,  concluded  with  a  declaration  aimed  at  effectively
addressing the new social, political and economic realities  in  Africa  and
the  world;  fulfilling  the  people's  aspirations  for  greater  unity  in
conforming  with  the  objectives  of  the  OAU  Charter  and   the   treaty
establishing the African Economic Community;  revitalising  the  continental
organisation to play a more active role  in  addressing  the  needs  of  the
people; meeting global challenges; and  harnessing  the  human  and  natural
resources of the continent to improve living conditions.

The OAU discussed, mediated and intervened in a large  number  of  conflicts
in Africa over the years of its existence. It imposed economic sanctions  in
volatile situations in which,  and  when,  this  type  of  intervention  was
needed. More positively, it hosted  summits  and  conferences  and  approved
plans such as the peace  plan  for  Somalia  in  1999,  aimed  primarily  at
Africa's improvement as a continent.

The AU was launched in Durban,  South  Africa,  in  July  2002.  It  is  the
successor to the OAU. The AU,  based  in  Addis  Ababa,  like  the  body  it
replaces, aims to unify 53 African member states politically,  socially  and
economically. The assembly is made up  of  heads  of  state  of  all  member
states and  is  the  most  important  decision-making  body  of  the  union.
Decisions are made by consensus or  two-thirds  majority,  and  it  has  the
function of  deciding  on  common  policies  for  the  union.  It  considers
applications for memberships, adopts the budget and directs the  process  of
conflict resolution, and appoints judges of the court of justice.

The executive council is made up of Ministers of foreign affairs and  member
states and is accountable to the assembly. The council  decides  on  matters
such  as   foreign   trade,   social   security,   food,   agriculture   and
communications. It  prepares  material  for  the  assembly  to  discuss  and
approve.  The  permanent   representatives'   committee   is   composed   of
ambassadors to the AU, and has the responsibility of preparing the  work  of
the executive council.

The commission forms the  secretariat  of  the  AU  and  is  made  up  of  a
chairperson, a deputy and eight commissioners. It deals with  administrative
issues and implements decisions of the union. It is responsible for the  co-
ordination of AU activities and meetings.

The specialised  technical  committee  deals  with  monetary  and  financial
issues, the rural economy, trade, immigration,  industry,  and  science  and
technology. The Pan-African Parliament consists of  elected  representatives
nominated  from  five  regions  of  Africa.  It  will  ensure  civil-society
participation in the AU. The three financial institutions which will be  set
up under the auspices  of  the  AU  to  provide  funding  for  projects  and
programmes are the African Central Bank, the AMF and the African  Investment
Bank.

As South Africans we have a great deal to be thankful  for,  especially  the
solid foundation set by the OAU. We  are  confident  that  the  new  African
Union, reborn out of the OAU, will assist Africa in  claiming  its  rightful
place in the global political arena. As we celebrate  this  Africa  Day,  we
are reminded  of  the  words  of  Kofi  Annan  with  reference  to  the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development, Nepad:
  Africans are addressing the conflict in their midst by coming together as
  African leaders determined to solve their own problems.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I thank the hon members for  their
participation in this debate.

As a means of beginning a commentary and response to both the hon Lever  and
Durr, I'd like  to  quote  from  this  book  that  I  have  before  me.  The
quotation, and I shall clarify exactly the intention once I  have  read  it,
reads as follows:


  The struggles of the various African peoples for liberation  and  against
  imperialism were essentially interdependent. We cannot underestimate  the
  strength of territorial nationalism and ethnic particularism  beloved  of
  Western commentators, and which the West  itself  did  a  great  deal  to
  foster and sustain.

What has been clear from the major steps forward in many  African  countries
- the Egyptian revolution in  1952;  the  independence  of  Ghana  in  1957;
Guinea's no  vote  in  the  1958  referendum;  the  winning  of  Tanganyikan
independence in 1961; the prolonged and terrible struggle  of  the  Algerian
people during the seven and a half years of their revolution, from  1954  to
1962  -  is  that  they  produced  a  chain  reaction  and  stimulated   the
development of liberation movements in what had hitherto  been  regarded  as
the almost impregnable fortresses of imperialism - the  Belgian  Congo,  the
Portuguese colonial territories, the Central African  Federation  and  South
Africa itself.

Anticolonial revolts, such as the so-called Mau Mau  revolt  in  Kenya,  and
acts of  colonial  retaliation  and  repression,  such  as  the  Sharpeville
shootings and the murder of Lumumba, became tremendously significant  within
the context of African history - thought about, talked about, and  made  the
occasion  of  demonstrations  in  Casablanca  and  Lusaka,  in  Bamako   and
Mogadishu.

As Franz Fanon has stressed, this was in marked contrast with the  situation
in the mid-1940s, when the  massacre  of  tens  of  thousands  at  Sétif  in
Algeria and in Madagascar passed almost unnoticed  outside  the  territories
concerned. By the late 1950s, in spite of all the  diversities  of  history,
culture  and  language,  the  idea  of  a  common  experience   of   Western
domination, common sufferings, interests  and  problems,  which  provided  a
solid basis for unity among  the  various  African  peoples,  had  become  a
powerful force. And the vehicle for the expression of  that  force  was  the
Organisation of African Unity. It is for that reason  that  we  debate  this
subject of commemoration today.

Those of us associated with the struggle  for  liberation  are  fully  aware
that it was in the corridors of the Organisation of African Unity  that  our
liberation movements received support, nowhere else;  that  it  was  in  the
meetings of the Organisation of African Unity that the liberation  movements
could articulate their desire for freedom; that it was in the  countries  of
the membership of the Organisation of  African  Unity  that  the  liberation
movements received succour and  support  -  not  in  Western  capitals,  but
within the OAU. It is for that reason that we commemorate as we do today.

I think it is  vital  that  we,  of  course,  do  not  fool  ourselves  into
believing that the Organisation of African Unity had no faults. We  are  not
here claiming that it was a perfect organisation in all guises. However,  we
can find no  other  example  in  Africa  of  an  organisation  dedicated  to
pursuing the unity of Africa, the freedom of all African  peoples  and,  for
ourselves, the defeat of the apartheid state in a collective African  effort
to ensure that, indeed, we achieved freedom.

It is untrue to hold the view that the West has, in some  way,  an  interest
in the progress of Africa, in the entire challenges that we face. All of  us
are aware that the West is directly interested only in itself and in how  it
can exploit Africa. It is for this reason that  we  welcome  Nepad  and  the
African Union, and the possibility they  offer  for  Africans  to  begin  to
determine their direction themselves.

We all know that we are called on by members,  such  as  the  hon  Durr  and
others, to have a regard for what is termed the free market, but  this  free
market exists on subsidy in the free-market proponents of the  West  and  on
the absence of subsidies in Africa. We suffer from this free-market  notion,
because it is free for some and not free  for  others.  It  is  patently  an
untrue model that is being sold to us, and we cannot allow ourselves to  buy
into it.

Where we will base ourselves is on  looking  at  the  degree  to  which  the
African Union, through Nepad's programme, will assist  Africa  to  begin  to
utilise the resources of our continent in the  interest  of  the  continent,
the wealth of the continent in the interest of  the  continent,  the  wealth
for the benefit of the people of the continent, rather than exploitation  by
the West.

Allow me to conclude by saying that I do have concerns about  the  march  of
South African business into Africa.  I'm  not  sure  it  has  been  entirely
beneficial. I have noted, for example, how  as  you  drive  through  Lusaka,
that there don't appear to be Zambian-owned  small  businesses.  There's  no
longer the corner cafe in Zambia. You have Shoprite,  you  have  Woolworths,
and so on. We need to begin to ask ourselves whether our march  into  Africa
is, indeed, a march that is beneficial to the countries that our  businesses
are marching into; or whether, in  fact,  the  march  introduces  monopolies
that detract  from  the  existence  of  small  businesses,  monopolies  that
destroy small entrepreneurs, monopolies that have no interest in  developing
local business strength, but are rather set to  grow  themselves  and  their
profits. This is a concern that I think our trade  and  industry  committees
should be looking into far more  carefully,  to  see  whether,  indeed,  our
march is bringing development.

In the  area  of  telecommunications,  I  understand  there  has  been  some
progress, because much of the  telecommunications  entry  has  been  on  the
basis of joint ventures. I'm  not  sure  whether  the  entry  of  our  large
department stores has been on the basis of these  kinds  of  joint  ventures
that the MTNs and others seem to have established in Nigeria,  Tanzania  and
other countries on the continent. So, I think, before we  extol,  before  we
praise, let us investigate the true nature of the entry of business and  the
relationships that it is espousing in those countries.

Of course, I have made reference to the importance of  good  governance  and
all the principles associated with that, which  Mr  Lever  referred  to,  of
transparency and accountability. Within the African Union, we would want  to
see those espoused. But  we  believe  it  is  vital,  given  the  record  of
oppression and exploitation that Africa has gone through, that  where  there
has been support for freedom and the achievement of democracy, we  recognise
those efforts. The OAU played this role, and we  cannot  deny  Africans  the
important need to begin to  say  that  in  certain  areas  there  have  been
positive examples, and these examples will hold up as our  example  of  some
success that we have had.
We cannot just lie and wallow in the quagmire of our exploitation.  We  also
need to begin to admit that there were  points  of  success  and  there  are
Africans who played an important role in ensuring  that  we  achieved  those
successes.

Again, I thank the hon members for having participated and  I  insist  that,
indeed, the commemoration of the 40-year history of  the  OAU  is  important
and that we, as free South Africans, need to recognise that  importance  and
celebrate it. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:40.
