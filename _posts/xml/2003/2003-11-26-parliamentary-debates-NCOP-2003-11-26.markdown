                CANCELLATION OF ORDER NO 2 ON THE ORDER PAPER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice  that  the
Council agrees that Order No 2 on  the  Order  Paper,  namely  the  National
Gambling Bill, not be dealt with in  today's  plenary  but  be  deferred  to
another day upon which further notice will be given.

I have concurred  with  the  Whips  from  the  different  political  parties
indicating the intention to move such a motion. Thank you.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    TRADITIONAL LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE
                               FRAMEWORK BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Chairperson and  hon
members, the discussions which  led  to  the  drafting  of  the  Traditional
Leadership and Governance Framework Bill were sometimes so acrimonious  that
many thought that today's watershed  development  would  never  materialise.
That it is happening at all is  one  of  the  monuments  to  our  collective
efforts of making our country a zone of peace,  prosperity  and  sustainable
development.

Allow me to express a hearty word of gratitude to all  traditional  leaders,
South Africans resident in traditional  communities,  statutory  bodies  and
community-based organisations which took part in the protracted  process  of
consultation which resulted in the development of this Bill.

I also have the pleasure of paying tribute to the chairperson and all  other
members of the select committee who are associated with the endeavour  which
brought us to this momentous event.

The Bill before the House seeks to give effect to sections 211  and  212  of
the  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  provisions   which
recognise the institution of traditional leadership and  mandate  Parliament
to enact legislation providing for the role of traditional leadership as  an
institution on matters affecting communities.

The Bill, however, does not purport to provide all the  details  germane  to
the role to be played by the institution. Such details are left to province-
specific  legislation  to   be   developed   and   adopted   by   provincial
legislatures.

The intention of this Bill, therefore, is to provide a framework  and  norms
and standards to which provincial legislation must strictly conform.  As  we
have said before, the architects of colonial and  apartheid  rule  in  South
Africa  succeeded  over  a  period  of  time  to  politically  disembed  the
institution of traditional leadership from its natural fulcrum  and  convert
it to an instrument for use in suppressing  the  legitimate  aspirations  of
our people.

As a matter of fact, there was a time in the history  of  our  country  when
the institution was almost indistinguishable from  the  notorious  Bantustan
system. As we talk now, the country continues to  bear  the  scars  of  this
legacy. To  this  day  many  areas  which  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of
traditional  leaders  are  characterised  by  chronic  underdevelopment  and
abject poverty. The effects of the exclusionary apartheid political  economy
endure in the form of massive  infrastructure  backlogs  and  the  attendant
problem of the inability of  many  in  those  communities  to  access  basic
services.

The Bill which we commend to you, hon  members,  approaches  these  problems
from a premise which negates the notion that there is a future in the  past.
It  accepts  the  challenge  posed  by  the  constitutional  imperative   of
banishing intracommunity cleavages, which have hitherto  made  the  goal  of
defining an optimal development strategy so elusive.

The Bill creates enabling conditions  for  the  institution  of  traditional
leadership to forge partnerships with  democratically  elected  institutions
of  government.  In  the  final  analysis,  this  is  a  framework  for  the
institution to retrace its steps and forge a new identity of  interest  with
the people.

Although the institution's  role  is  primarily  sanctified  by  custom  and
tradition, it does lend itself to playing an important advisory,  supportive
and promotional role in matters of governance. It is  our  view  that  since
customs and traditions are dynamic and evolving, it is  not  unrealistic  to
expect the institution of traditional  leadership  to  behave  in  a  manner
consistent with democracy-anchored policy approaches.

Through this Bill we seek to cause custom to evolve  in  a  direction  which
makes it an  instrument  of  promoting  participatory  politics  and  social
defence of the marginalised sectors of our  community.  This  explains  why,
amongst other things, we are providing for the establishment of  traditional
councils, which will include a component with an elective base  as  well  as
pay attention to questions of gender equity. In other words, we  resist  the
temptation to treat institutions as fixed entities.

I must emphasise, though, that the possibilities which this  Bill  envisions
will only come to fruition if  all  stakeholders  continue  to  exhibit  the
enthusiasm we saw in the  consultation  process.  For  instance,  this  Bill
adequately creates conditions for the sphere of civil society to find  space
for the advancement of popular interests. It behoves structures such as  the
Law  Commission,  the  Gender  Commission  and  similar  bodies  to   evolve
programmes through which they will empower  previously  marginalised  groups
to effectively participate in the activities of traditional  councils.  This
role does not have to await the  enactment  of  provincial  legislation.  If
anything, these bodies must empower communities to make  an  informed  input
into processes of formulating provincial legislation.

For our part, we have offered the  services  of  a  national  task  team  to
assist the provinces in the crafting  of  provincial  legislation.  We  hope
that working together we shall  be  able  to  finalise  all  the  provincial
legislation in the first quarter of the year 2004. Thank you,  Madam  Chair.
[Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Madam  Chair,  throughout  this  country's  constitutional
dispensation the issue of traditional leadership has always been  a  central
one. At almost each and every  major  occasion,  the  issue  of  traditional
leadership has always  been  addressed  -  the  significant  one  being  the
President's state of the nation address in February this year.  Needless  to
say,  the  Constitution  dedicates  Chapter  12  and   other   chapters   to
recognising, supporting and respecting traditional leadership.

The Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework  Bill  in  front  of  us
this afternoon seeks to set  work  in  motion  so  that  we  deal  with  the
recognition and transformation of the oldest governance institution  of  our
time. Undoubtedly the Bill  does  not  seek  to  create  new  traditions  or
customs. Neither does  it  create  new  leaders  in  that  institution.  The
intention is to restore strength  and  respect,  and  to  guide  by  way  of
frameworks.

Honourable intentions and commitments reflected in the preamble of the  Bill
are clearly demonstrated by the manner  in  which  the  more  senior  office
bearers in Government will deal with the various traditional events  in  the
traditional communities. For instance, the  President  will  deal  with  the
recognition of a king or queen after all the traditional routines have  been
observed and confirmed to the President. Likewise, the  premiers  will  deal
with the recognition of a traditional leader,  headman  or  headwoman  after
the  traditional  processes  by  the  traditional  communities   have   been
concluded.

Unlike in the past, the Government will never involve itself  in  the  murky
business of  creating  headmen  or  indunas.  Likewise,  the  removal  of  a
traditional  leader  will  not  be  initiated  by  Government,  but  by  the
traditional community concerned - again in terms  of  the  customs  of  that
community. Having made these  historical  commitments  and  undertakings  in
order to restore the status and dignity of  traditional  leadership  to  its
true pedestal, one would perhaps think that the Government would assume  the
role of presiding over disputes regarding traditional  leadership,  but  no,
an  independent  arbiter,  consisting   of   role-players   in   traditional
communities, handles this dispute. That is  the  Commission  on  Traditional
Leadership Disputes and Claims. Here again, the  commission  may  only  hear
matters after the traditional community  has  been  unable  to  resolve  the
issue internally in accordance with custom.

Through this Bill the Government also acknowledges some outstanding  matters
that include, among  others,  traditional  leaders  who  are  presently  not
remunerated. Having dealt with various Bills  in  the  House  ourselves,  we
should take note of the extraordinary commitment by Government  in  that  it
has made specific estimates of  the  financial  implications  of  addressing
some of these anomalies highlighted above, including  the  remuneration  and
benefits of traditional leaders. A further commitment is that there will  be
a relook at the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers Act of 1998  in  order
to accommodate traditional leaders.

The passing of this Bill does not in any way imply completion  of  our  work
on it, but rather signals the start of more serious work in  the  provinces.
We are facing reasonably tight schedules in this regard. We  are  confident,
though, that by February 2004 this task team will be  able  to  report  some
progress in this regard.

The absence of amendments from this Bill does not in any way imply  that  it
is perfect, but only signals that it is a  framework  that  will  be  worked
upon by the provinces. We commend the Bill for your approval, hon members.

Before I resume my seat, may I also  thank  the  department,  including  the
Minister, for the extraordinary hours they have worked in dealing with  this
Bill. Mr Sam Titus, Mr Kasawe, Adv Motai, Dr Bouwer  and  others  were  very
splendid in dealing with this Bill. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY (Western Cape): Madam Chairperson, Minister  Mufamadi  and  hon
members, may I congratulate the hon the Minister  on  the  Bill  before  the
House today. Not only does this Bill recognise the institution,  status  and
role of traditional leaders, but it also gives effect to the  constitutional
requirement to provide a leadership role for  traditional  leaders.  In  the
past these leaders have played a crucial role in defining  our  history  and
they remain a vital element of leadership among a vast component  of  people
in South Africa. The Bill is not unduly prescriptive.  It  rather  seeks  to
provide the national framework,  norms  and  standards  in  terms  of  which
provincial  legislation  will  be  enacted  that  will  take  into   account
provincial specifics.

Let me start by commenting on some of the technical  issues  dealt  with  by
this  Bill.  The  Premier  of  the  Western  Cape  submitted  comments   and
recommendations regarding the draft Traditional  Leadership  and  Governance
Framework Bill during July this year. I am pleased to  note  that  at  least
some of the recommendations have been accommodated in the final Bill  before
the Council. The draft Bill referred to both indigenous  law  and  customary
law. Differences in indigenous law and customary law  create  an  impression
that these terms  have  different  meanings.  Also,  in  the  South  African
jurisprudence indigenous  law  and  customary  law  have  always  been  used
synonymously.  The  recommendation  that  the  term  ``indigenous  law''  be
deleted from the Bill has been accommodated and the term  ``customary  law''
is now used consistently.

The draft Bill  required  that  at  least  a  third  of  the  members  of  a
traditional council must be women. With due  regard  to  Chapter  9  of  the
Constitution, which guarantees equality between men and women,  the  Western
Cape suggested that it  is  unlikely  that  such  a  phrase  will  pass  the
constitutional test. It has been noted that the final  Bill  addresses  this
issue by the insertion of clause 3(2)(d), which reads as follows:


  Where it has been  proved  that  an  insufficient  number  of  women  are
  available to participate in a traditional council, the premier  concerned
  may,  in  accordance  with  a  procedure  provided  for   in   provincial
  legislation, determine a lower threshold for the  particular  traditional
  council than that required by paragraph (b) ...

... that a third must be women.

However, I remain of the view that there should be equality between men  and
women and  that  a  threshold  of  50/50  be  set  subject  to  the  premier
determining a lower threshold. I have  noted  that  the  suggestion  by  the
Western Cape that the death of a member of  the  Commission  on  Traditional
Leadership Disputes and Claims, be included under the heading  Vacancies  in
clause 24 of the final Bill, has unfortunately not been accommodated. It  is
general practice for such a provision to be included.

As the Bill is a further step in defining the role of  traditional  leaders,
I am of the opinion that traditional leaders can and must  play  a  role  in
addressing the real needs of their people. Former President Nelson  Mandela,
during the inauguration of a traditional leader  in  Venda  on  28  November
1998, said:


  Traditional leaders now occupy a critical place in the great  partnership
  of all social sectors whose joint effort will make our country  just  and
  prosperous. Government alone cannot transform  this  country,  but  as  a
  united nation we will succeed.

With reference to the  creation  of  opportunities  for  women,  encouraging
participation of communities in their own upliftment and  building  capacity
for our local authorities to work with national  and  provincial  government
to meet the needs of communities, Mr Mandela said:


  Traditional leaders are well placed to help us achieve these  goals,  and
  we count on your support. Indeed, in all the major challenges facing  our
  country we know that you will help our nation to meet its goals.

I have  expressed  myself  consistently  on  the  important  role  of  local
government in  the  alleviation  of  poverty  and  I  am  pleased  that  the
framework Bill specifically deals with partnerships  between  municipalities
and traditional councils. Of exceptional importance is that the  traditional
council may enter into a service-delivery agreement with a  municipality  in
accordance  with  the  Local  Government:  Municipal   Systems   Act.   This
partnership will undoubtedly assist our rural communities in  South  Africa,
where traditional leadership is present, and will ensure that  they  receive
the necessary services which  will  remove  the  obstacles  on  the  way  to
development and prosperity.

The  framework  Bill  further  highlights  the  important   role   of   ward
committees, which we are currently implementing in the  Western  Cape.  This
Bill prescribes to traditional councils that they must co-operate  with  any
relevant ward committee, as these ward committees  must  take  into  account
the diversity of interests  in  the  ward  to  be  represented.  It  follows
logically that due recognition  is  given  to  traditional  leaders  in  the
composition of these ward committees where it is applicable.

Lastly, once again in the words of the former President,  I  appeal  to  our
traditional leaders to ensure  that  the  registration  of  voters  for  the
forthcoming election  is  a  success.  Participation  is  the  lifeblood  of
democracy and it is democracy that is bringing peace and prosperity back  to
South Africa.

In the Western Cape we have the Khoisan communities, such  as  the  Griquas,
which up to now have not received the necessary recognition.  Today  we  are
debating a Bill which in essence deals with the  framework  for  traditional
leadership, and still the issue of traditional leadership and governance  of
the Khoisan communities must be considered. The  Khoisan  communities  claim
recognition in terms of customs and tradition.

Die Khoisan het  'n  leefwyse  van  menslikheid,  sorgsaamheid,  gasvryheid,
eerlikheid en nederigheid wat oor millennia strek. Wedersydse  erkenning  en
gelykheid vir almal, veral tussen mans en vrouens, is die fondament van  die
Khoisan. Die Khoisan respekteer die wysheid van oues en het  waardering  vir
hul ervaring om probleme te hanteer. Met die 10 jaar van demokrasie wat  ons
volgende jaar vier, kan ons almal  by  die  Khoisan  leer.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The Khoisan follow a lifestyle of humaneness, caring, hospitality,  honesty
and humility stretching over millennia. Mutual recognition and equality  for
all, in particular between men and women, is the foundation of the  Khoisan.
The Khoisan respect the wisdom  of  the  elders  and  can  appreciate  their
experience in dealing with problems. With the 10 years of democracy that  we
will be celebrating next year we can all learn from the Khoisan.]

The Constitution provides for the establishment of national  and  provincial
houses  of  traditional  leaders.  Such  houses  were  established  in   the
provinces of North West, Limpopo, the Free State, Mpumalanga,  KwaZulu-Natal
and the Eastern Cape. This must be commended. In  a  nation  of  44  million
people of diverse backgrounds, origins, cultures, languages and  beliefs  it
is  important  to  ensure  that  traditional  leaders  receive   their   due
recognition. This is also in line with the vision of  the  Western  Cape  of
IKapa Elihlumayo - hope, delivery and dignity for the next decade.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]
Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. Chairperson,  ``well  done''  is
better than ``well said''. So, let's do it  because  we  can.  If  there  is
anyone who deserves these accolades, it's the hon  Minister  for  Provincial
and Local Government, together with all those who  contributed  to  drafting
the White Paper on Traditional Leadership to  the  point  where  it  is  now
where we have this Bill before us.

It was not easy. This is really a job well done. It is true  that  when  the
going gets tough, the tough get going.

This  institution  has  got  a  long  history.  This  institution  and   its
traditional leadership attracted many comments from various quarters  during
public hearings by the portfolio committee.  Some  were  not  just  comments
but, somehow, attacks on the institution and its traditional leaders.

Surprisingly, many of the  attacks  came  from  self-proclaimed  experts  on
traditional leadership. The attacks came from people who  knew  very  little
about this institution. Some would go  to  the  extent  of  ridiculing  this
institution,  thinking  that  by  so  doing,  they  would  be  seen  to   be
progressive.

I do not think that we have to worry about those  few  individuals.  Let  us
allow them to freely express their opinions. Other than that,  we  can  only
pray for them and ask the Almighty God to forgive them.

We  belong  to  an  organisation  that  has  always  been  considerate   and
consistent, the ANC. Just look at all those documents that  relate  to  this
institution that date back from 1912, when the ANC was formed. On behalf  of
all the progressive traditional leaders and their  communities,  I  want  to
convey our sincere thanks to the ANC leadership for showing  respect  and  a
keen interest in this institution.

The committee was informed that there are some areas  where  women  are  not
allowed to participate in traditional courts.  We  learnt,  again,  that  in
some areas women are not even allowed to  own  land  or  residential  sites.
This kind of practice will never enjoy our support. I want to call upon  all
those traditional leaders who are still married to that barbaric  action  or
old practice to change before they are overtaken by events.

Fortunately, some of these things are news  to  some  of  us.  That  is  the
reason why, at times, one becomes easily irritated when  general  statements
are made or when we are put in the same category.

The establishment of a traditional council will go a long way in  addressing
some of these anomalies. This is the structure  that  will  enable  men  and
women to work together as equals. I just hope provinces  and  municipalities
will empower this structure by devolving some functions to it.  If  that  is
not done, this structure will serve no purpose. The traditional council  can
only deliver if it is supported, financially, by the national or  provincial
governments or even municipalities.

We had a lengthy debate on what would cause a traditional  leader,  a  king,
queen,  headman  or  headwoman,  to  be  removed  from  their   throne.   In
particular, one of the reasons that  would  cause  them  to  be  removed  or
dethroned is found in clause 10(1)(b) and 12(1)(b), that is, on the  grounds
of physical incapacity or mental infirmity, and so on.

In our culture, those grounds cannot be used  to  remove  a  kgoshi  [chief]
from his or her position. The only comfort is that the  royal  family  would
have to pronounce itself on the matter before any  action  could  be  taken.
Let's  hope  these  clauses  will  not  be  exploited  by  those   who   are
overambitious and will do anything to see themselves in those positions.

Kings, queens or senior traditional leaders will be recognised. There was  a
time in this country when the wrong people were appointed  to  positions  of
traditional leadership. I know of many traditional leaders who were  removed
from their positions by the then chief ministers  because  they  refused  to
join those chief ministers' Mickey Mouse political parties.

Some were deposed and their brothers put in place  because  they  associated
themselves with those stooges. Some were  either  detained  or  deported  to
areas they did not know. Unfortunately, my  father  went  through  the  same
ordeal. It was argued  that  they  were  not  respecting  the  laws  of  the
country.

 This brings me to the work of the commission. This commission will have  to
show no mercy to those who agreed to be used, knowing very  well  that  they
do not qualify to be makgosis, amakhosi,  dikgosi  or  traditional  leaders.
[Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr  A  T  MANYOSI  (Eastern  Cape):  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  for
Provincial and Local Government, hon permanent  and  special  delegates,  on
behalf of the Eastern Cape province,  I  rise  to  support  the  Traditional
Leadership and Governance Framework Bill, as amended.

Our  Government  has  consistently  assured  traditional  leaders  that   it
recognises the relevance of the institution of  traditional  leadership  and
affirms  the  role  of  traditional  leaders  in  line   with   co-operative
governance, and that their role in  maintaining  the  unity  of  traditional
communities and promoting development within  those  communities  is  beyond
question.

I have no doubt in my mind that it has dawned upon all of us,  judging  from
the strenuous practical exercise which  the  Department  of  Provincial  and
Local Government and all other role-players have engaged in  over  the  past
five to six years, that the process of generating  a  legislative  framework
for the recognition, placement and defining of the roles  and  functions  of
traditional leaders, both at national and provincial levels, could not  have
been justly and adequately accomplished  and,  therefore,  detailed  in  the
Constitution at the level of the Constitutional Assembly as the  demand  had
always been made for this important matter to be addressed expeditiously.

Traditional leadership and the institution of traditional leadership  is  in
no way homogenous in our country. Therefore, it becomes  necessary  for  the
minute details of how the institution works to be left to the  provinces  to
legislate; however, within the national framework as proposed by  the  Bill.
Hence the need for the  provincial  version  of  the  draft  law  now  being
considered.

What is referred to  as  amakhosi  elsewhere  means  chiefs  or  traditional
leaders, but in other provinces, it means some spirits. Be that as  it  may,
the bones of Sekhukhune, Shaka, Dingane, Bhambatha, Hintsa  and  many  other
historical traditional governors of this land should  be  turning  in  their
graves in appreciation of the giant strides taken by Government  to  restore
the status, dignity and role of the traditional leadership  institutions  in
line with the democratic  Constitution  of  our  rainbow  nation  so  as  to
achieve uniformity in material respects.

There  is  a  mistaken  notion  or  belief  that,  from   time   immemorial,
traditional leaders and their institutions  had  always  been  undemocratic,
but this is far-fetched and far from the  truth.  Traditional  leaders  have
always worked and taken decisions in councils. Hence the old  adage  that  a
chief is a chief because of his people or his respect for the  word  of  his
people.

Therefore, it is fitting that  this  Bill  envisages  the  establishment  of
traditional councils and their functions, thus  restoring  the  status  quo,
which should work in support of and in partnership with  the  municipalities
in  the  promotion  of  development  within  their  respective   traditional
communities.

For the first time in  the  history  of  traditional  leadership,  the  Bill
addresses  the  daunting  question  of  the  exclusion  of  women  from  the
corridors  of  traditional   governance.   We   stand   for   the   sensible
acknowledgement, accommodation and promotion of a diversity of cultures  and
traditions on the one hand, and democratically elected  institutions;  none,
however, at the expense of the other.

The support given to  traditional  leaders  by  Government  in  the  various
provinces already points to  the  fact  that  Government  is  serious  about
restoring the dignity of traditional leaders,  greatly  eroded  by  previous
apartheid governments that turned traditional leaders  into  civil  servants
and messengers of government in the true sense of the word ``messengers''.

The concerns that were expressed by the prophets  of  doom  that  Government
was not serious about defining the role for traditional leaders  should  now
be withdrawn as the Bill evidently enhances rather than reduces  the  status
and role of traditional leaders.

 Whilst the previous apartheid rulers could appoint and term their  loyalist
traditional  leaders  or  headman  as  they  wished,  thus  bringing   about
resentment and dissatisfaction  within  traditional  communities,  the  Bill
clearly defines the position of traditional leadership, thereby  eliminating
confusion over who should and who should not be a  traditional  leader,  for
it is inherent in the system of traditional leadership that there  will  be,
from time to time, disputes over who is a rightful heir or  a  successor  to
the position of traditional leadership.

The Bill establishes a Commission on  Traditional  Leadership  Disputes  and
Claims which will, unlike the ad hoc mechanisms  being  employed  currently,
objectively rather than subjectively look at each case of dispute  or  claim
of traditional leadership.

The time is now over when  the  powers  that  be  would  depose  traditional
leaders and appoint whoever demonstrated loyalty to  them,  irrespective  of
what tradition and custom dictated.

The Bill also provides for a code of  conduct  for  traditional  leaders  so
that they may always be wary of what is expected of them. We  are  convinced
and confident that there is room for the institution of traditional  leaders
to be reconciled with the democratically elected  structures  of  governance
and, in the spirit of co-operative governance,  promote  development  within
traditional communities.

Without going deeply into the provisions  of  the  Bill,  the  Eastern  Cape
supports the Bill, as indicated earlier. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D AFRICA (North West): Madam Chairperson, hon Minister,  members  of  the
NCOP, allow me to express  the  appreciation  of  the  North  West  for  the
progressive manner in which the Minister and the department have gone  about
to finalise the protracted discussion concerning the Traditional  Leadership
and Governance Framework Bill.

We in the North West are satisfied that the Bill will assist us to  entrench
some of the practices and interactions that  we  have  embraced  in  working
with the institution of traditional leadership in the province, through  our
province-specific legislation. Once and for all, this Bill has succeeded  to
dispel the myth and falsehood of those who  advertised  the  view  that  the
ruling  party  is  bent  on  marginalising  traditional  leaders  and  their
institutions from the mainstream of governance and development.

In this Bill we see a progressive move to define the  space  and  parameters
within which the institution will exercise its leadership and contribute  to
governance  and  development  in  the  political  and  economic   landscape,
especially in rural areas.

Undeniably, the coalescence and co-existence of the practice of  traditional
governance with the democratic structures of government at the  local  level
will need to  be  monitored  and  supported  on  a  continuous  basis.  This
notwithstanding, since all of us understand that it is a  fundamental  human
right to have a decent life, and access to health,  education,  freedom  and
security, we also understand that neither form of government is  organically
antithetical to the other.

From the North West, we also recognise that in embracing these freedoms,  in
accordance  with  our  Bill  of  Rights,  this   Bill   stands   in   direct
contradistinction to the orgy of political  tyranny  and  dictatorship  that
has had negative and suffocating effects on many of the South African  rural
populace.

We are proud to provide evidence, as a province, of a  functional  strategic
partnership  between  democratic  Government  institutions  and  traditional
leadership. Members of this House  will  recall  that  on  the  occasion  of
delivering the statement of the national executive committee of  the  ruling
party in Rustenburg, President Mbeki  alluded  to  the  important  agreement
that was signed on the same  day  between  the  Bojanala  Platinum  District
Municipality, the Rustenburg  Local  Municipality  and  the  Royal  Bafokeng
Administration. In terms of  this  memorandum,  all  role-players  committed
themselves to exploring collaborative  ways  of  freeing  their  communities
from the miasma of underdevelopment. We can attest to  the  fact  that  this
relationship has materially affected the lives of the people  in  this  area
in a positive way.

It is therefore not accidental that  many  other  municipalities  sought  to
emulate this example. At the recent provincial Vuna Award  ceremony  in  the
province, the Greater Taung Municipality received  recognition  for  working
in a harmonious way with traditional leaders. There is therefore proof  that
traditional leaders and institutions of Government  can  work  together  for
the benefit of the communities. And,  there  is  therefore  no  evidence  to
suggest that traditional leaders have no role to play in a modern system  of
government.

As we are concluding our work in finalising this Bill, our society  is  also
engulfed by a new challenge that manifests itself in an unprecedented  level
of violence against the most  marginalised  -  women.  Minister,  we  should
invite  our  traditional  leaders  and  other  development  agents  to  join
Government and multiply our collective efforts to galvanise our  communities
in order  to  defeat  conditions  that  beget  violence  against  women  and
children. We are of the view that  our  traditional  leaders  are  essential
components of the epicentre around which the  moral  social  fabric  of  our
rural communities revolves.

The fundamental tenets of our Constitution, in terms of the rights of  women
and children, should translate into meaningful benefits for all  members  of
our society. We believe that traditional leaders can play  a  key  role  and
the  Bill  provides  an  opportunity  for  them  to  entrench  practices  of
democracy and, therefore, conditions of safety for women and children.

We in the North  West  have  consistently  refused  to  be  persuaded  by  a
misrepresentation of the institutions of traditional  leadership  as  static
organs  that  do  not  adapt   to   changing   material   conditions.   Like
developmental states, traditional leadership institutions  are  not  static.
We see the institution  as  an  integral  part  of  the  plethora  of  human
institutions whose functions and objects are located within  the  political,
cultural, historical and economic reality  in  which  the  institutions  are
immersed.

All  significant  changes  in  the   environment   will   induce   important
modifications  to  the  institutions  of  traditional   leadership   models.
Accordingly, traditional  leaders  and  institutions  could  become  pivotal
organs  that  will  assist  communities  in  the  task  of  codifying  total
realities into symbols that  generate  critical  consciousness  and  empower
them to alter their relations with nature and other economic forces.

As societies move from one epoch to another, they  require  the  development
of a flexible and critical outlook which leads to new ways of doing  things.
It is the objective reality that  human  institutions  such  as  government,
traditional institutions and churches will have to critically  engage  with.
From the point of view  of  a  developmental  state,  the  only  progressive
approach to sustained development is through making people both  the  object
and  subject  of  their  history  and  development.  In  this  equation  the
developmental role of  traditional  leaders  and  institutions  to  engender
within their respective communities a conscientious and sustainable  use  of
nonrenewable resources such as water and energy would be critical.

Furthermore, it is important to us how traditional leaders and  institutions
interact with community development challenges in  a  manner  that  enriches
their communities and in a way that will ensure that they  play  a  critical
role as motors or drivers of development and cultural emancipation.

As a developmental state, at local  level  we  have  clarity  of  mind  that
democracy is not a vaccination against poverty. It is for this reason  that,
as Government, we  have  sought  to  establish  strategic  partnerships  for
development that will assist in  freeing  our  people  from  the  chains  of
malnutrition and poverty.

As this relationship between the institution of traditional  leadership  and
the democratic Government is cemented further, we need  to  take  cognisance
that the political economy of development, with which we seek to  engage  to
better the lives of our people, is  characterised  by  relations  that  take
place at a global level. To engage with this complex and dynamic  situation,
it  will  be  necessary  for  the  institution  to  work  closely  with  the
democratically elected structures of Government and the  private  sector  in
forging strategic and innovative partnerships to explore  the  potential  of
the rural economies.

The involvement of our traditional leaders and institutions  in  engendering
a sense of responsibility, and  promoting  human  resource  development  and
education within their communities, will contribute immensely to either  the
growth or decline of the economic potential of their  localities.  In  this,
we concur with Hamsik that, ``The quality of labour,  knowledge  and  social
institutions  has  become   fundamental   to   explaining   local   economic
development.'' In this  respect,  we  look  forward  to  seeing  traditional
leaders working closely with municipalities in  an  effort  to  realise  the
human development strategies  of  their  localities,  as  contained  in  the
integrated development plans.

Minister, as Government advances in its consolidation of  the  developmental
state, the  Traditional  Leadership  and  Governance  Framework  Bill  bears
testimony to Government laying bare its  credentials  in  its  long-standing
resolve  to  find  amicable  and  adroit  resolutions  to   all   challenges
confronting our communities.  In  a  succinct  manner,  we  also  think  the
Ministry and department have done  well  to  finally  debunk  the  perennial
fulmination by some, hypnotised by their imaginary alternatives, who  sought
to trivialise the commitment by  Government  to  finding  amicable  ways  to
resolve this matter.

In conclusion, we think that the creation of a stable  platform  from  which
traditional leaders will engage with  Government  provides  the  opportunity
for  the  latter  to  focus  their  attention  on  the  mandate  imposed  by
hereditary aspects and removes the need for them to play dual roles as  both
politicians and traditional leaders.

As the North West, we welcome the introduction of the Bill to our system  of
government as an essential element in the consolidation  of  our  democracy.
With the finalisation of this Bill, we think that we will now  roll  up  our
sleeves and put our shoulders to the wheel to ensure  that  development  and
change take place in our localities. I wish to commend  the  department  and
officials for a splendid milestone in the history of our  country.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Agb Voorsitter, ons het vandag te doen met 'n  raamwerk
en nie 'n wetsontwerp wat 'n spesifieke inheemse  gemeenskap  probeer  erken
of wegwys nie.

Maar ek wil tog u aandag daarop vestig dat daar sekere  tradisionele  leiers
bestaan wat 'n bekommernis het dat sekere inheemse gemeenskappe tog  op  die
oomblik nie tot hulle reg sal kom deur hierdie wetsontwerp nie. Ek wil  maan
dat die saak  met  erns  bejeën  moet  word.  Dit  mag  nie  gebeur  dat  'n
tradisionele gemeenskap geïgnoreer word nie.

Soos die agb  voorsitter  Mkhaliphi  gesê  het,  moet  die  raamwerk  verder
ontwikkel word. Maar, Voorsitter, as 'n ere-stamhoof van die Khoisan,  sluit
ek graag aan by die agb Dowry, LUR van die Weskaap,  dat  dit  belangrik  is
dat die saak van hierdie  unieke  inheemse  gemeenskap  duidelik  gehoor  en
verstaan moet word.

In hierdie  wetsontwerp  is  daar  twee  gedagterigtings  oor  die  Khoisan,
naamlik dat wetgewing wel vir hulle  voorsiening  maak,  maar  dan  ook  dat
hulle omstandighede só uniek is dat hulle anders hanteer moet word,  en  dat
hierdie wetsontwerp op die oomblik nie vir hulle voorsiening maak nie.

Daar was reeds twee vergaderings tussen die  departement  en  die  leierskap
van die  Khoisan-mense,  en  daar  gaan  weer  'n  werkswinkel  in  Desember
plaasvind. Die uitkoms van dié vergaderings moet  gebruik  word  om  hierdie
wetsontwerp voor ons te wysig, indien  dit  nodig  is,  sodat  die  Khoisan-
gemeenskap ten volle geakkommodeer word. Op  hierdie  voorwaarde  steun  die
Nuwe NP dan hierdie wetsontwerp.

Maar, Voorsitter, die Khoisan-gemeenskap het wesenlike  aansprake  op  regte
ten opsigte van gewoontes en tradisies. Dit is  tog  die  oergemeenskap  van
Suid-Afrika. Hulle het egter spesifieke  behoeftes  en  belangstellings  wat
nog nie deur die wetsontwerp gedek word nie.

Die Nuwe NP het in die verlede en sal voortgaan om ook die  besorgdhede  van
die Khoisan onder die aandag van die relevante instansies te  bring  en  ook
om dit te bevorder. Die proses om die  Khoisan-gemeenskap  in  'n  nasionale
struktuur te akkomodeer, is  besig  om  te  ontplooi,  maar  dit  gebeur  te
stadig. Die  gesprek  met  die  departement,  gedurende  Desember,  is  baie
belangrik,  maar  'n  ernstige  gesprek  tussen  die  nasionale   Raad   van
Tradisionele Leiers en die Khoisan-raad moet ook op  'n  gereelde  grondslag
begin plaasvind.

Hierdie tradisionele gemeenskap, die Khoisan, is nie  net  goed  genoeg  dat
hulle  in  ons  landswapen  gereflekteer  word  nie,  of  dat  hul  kuns  en
vaardighede  as  toeriste-aantreklikhede  uitgestal  moet  word   nie.   Hul
tradisionaliteit moet ten volle erken word.

Die Nuwe  NP  huldig  verder  ook  die  standpunt  dat  tradisionele  leiers
verkieslik nie aktiewe partypolitieke leierskapposisies  behoort  te  beklee
nie. Dit gebeur te maklik dat die belangrike rol  wat  hulle  speel  in  die
skep van eenheid,  vrede  en  harmonie,  in  en  tussen  gemeenskappe,  deur
aktiewe partypolitieke bedrywighede ondermyn word.

Ons is egter deeglik bewus van die geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika en  weet  dat
tradisionele leiers nog lank aktief in  die  party-politiek  sal  wees.  Die
ideaal behoort egter nagestreef te word,  want  die  gemeenskappe  loop  die
gevaar dat hulle deur hul  leiers  in  onheilige  partypolitieke  alliansies
ingedwing of  ingeboender  word,  sonder  dat  die  tradisionele  gemeenskap
noodwendig enige voordeel daaruit trek, en dít net tot die voordeel  van  'n
enkele politieke leier met kwynende ondersteuning.

Die DA-IVP-alliansie is 'n voorbeeld hiervan.  Dit  is  ook  interessant  om
daarop te let dat die DA en die IVP, wat beide hierdie  wetsontwerp  in  die
Nasionale Vergadering teengestaan het, nie eers  vandag  aan  hierdie  debat
deelneem nie. Dan wonder 'n mens net wat is die  rede  vir  hul  teenkanting
teen die wetsontwerp.
Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP sal ook met  afwagting  kyk  hoe  die  artikel  185-
kommissie  die  kultuur-,   godsdiens-   en   taalaangeleenthede   van   die
gemeenskappe hanteer. Die Nuwe NP steun hierdie wetsontwerp en ons  sê:  "Ke
rona" ["We support"]. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Hon Chairperson, today we are dealing with a  framework
and not a Bill that is  trying  to  acknowledge  or  turn  away  a  specific
indigenous community.

I do, however, want to draw your  attention  to  the  fact  that  there  are
certain traditional leaders who are concerned that at present, through  this
Bill, justice will not be done to certain indigenous communities. I wish  to
caution that this matter be treated in earnest. It must not  happen  that  a
traditional community is ignored.

As the chairperson, the hon Mkhaliphi,  has  said,  the  framework  must  be
developed further. But, Chairperson, as an honorary chief of the Khoisan,  I
would like to echo the hon Dowry, MEC for  the  Western  Cape,  that  it  is
important for the case of this unique indigenous community to be  heard  and
understood clearly.

In this Bill there are two schools of thought regarding the Khoisan,  namely
that legislation does provide for them, but also  that  their  circumstances
are so unique that they have to be dealt with  differently,  and  that  this
Bill currently does not provide for them.

Two meetings have  already  taken  place  between  the  department  and  the
leadership of the Khoisan people, and another workshop will be taking  place
in December. The results of these meetings should be used to amend the  Bill
before us, if  necessary,  so  that  the  Khoisan  community  can  be  fully
accommodated. On these conditions the New NP therefore supports the Bill.

But, Chairperson, the Khoisan community has fundamental claims to rights  in
respect of customs  and  traditions.  They  are,  after  all,  the  original
community of South Africa. However, they have specific needs  and  interests
which are not yet covered by the Bill.

As in the past, the New NP will  continue  to  bring  the  concerns  of  the
Khoisan to the attention of the relevant authorities and  also  continue  to
promote them. The process whereby the Khoisan community can be  accommodated
in a national structure is unfolding, but it is happening  too  slowly.  The
dialogue with the department in December  is  very  important,  but  serious
dialogue between  the  national  Council  of  Traditional  Leaders  and  the
Khoisan council should also start taking place on a regular basis.

This traditional community, the Khoisan, is not just good enough to  feature
on our coat of arms,  or  to  display  their  arts  and  crafts  as  tourist
attractions. Their traditionality must be fully acknowledged.

The New NP is furthermore also  of  the  opinion  that  traditional  leaders
should rather not fill positions of active  party-political  leadership.  It
can happen all too easily that  their  important  role  in  creating  unity,
peace and harmony in and between communities becomes undermined by  vigorous
party-political activities.

We are, however, thoroughly aware of South Africa's history  and  know  that
traditional leaders will still be active in party politics for a  long  time
to come. The ideal ought to be pursued,  however,  because  the  communities
are  at  risk  of  being  forced  or  bundled  into  unholy  party-political
alliances by their leaders, without the  traditional  community  necessarily
profiting from it, and this only to the  advantage  of  a  single  political
leader with declining support.

The DA-IFP alliance is an example of this. It is also  interesting  to  note
that the DA and the  IFP,  who  both  opposed  this  Bill  in  the  National
Assembly, are  not  even  participating  in  this  debate  today.  One  just
wonders, then, about the reason for their opposition to this Bill.

Chairperson, the New NP will watch  in  anticipation  how  the  section  185
commission is  going  to  handle  the  cultural,  religious  and  linguistic
affairs of the communities. The New NP supports this Bill and  we  say:  "Ke
rona" ["We support"]. [Applause.]]

Cllr  S  W  MXOLOSE  (Salga):  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Chairperson,   hon
Minister, hon  members  and  special  delegates,  the  SA  Local  Government
Association is in full support of the spirit of the proposed legislation  as
it provides  for  the  transformation  of  the  institution  of  traditional
leadership so that it is consistent with the needs  of  our  new  system  of
democratic governance.

During the public hearings of the Portfolio Committee on  Local  Government,
Salga made the following recommendations in respect of the Bill.

It recommended, firstly, that the entry into service  delivery  partnerships
between municipalities and traditional councils expressly  be  made  subject
to the provisions of the Municipal Systems  Act;  secondly,  that  the  Bill
makes provision for national and provincial  funding  for  local  houses  of
traditional leaders; thirdly, that there  must  be  compulsory  consultation
with organised local government nationally, and within  the  province,  when
roles are allocated to the traditional leaders; and fourthly,  we  recommend
that paragraph 5(2)(b) be deleted in its  entirety  so  that  the  envisaged
partnership between municipalities and traditional councils  must  be  based
on the principle of mutual respect and recognition of the status  and  roles
of the respective parties.

We at Salga therefore take this opportunity to express our gratitude to  the
select committee and the National Council of Provinces  for  giving  us  the
opportunity to participate in the deliberations on this important  piece  of
legislation in which almost all of our  concerns  and  recommendations  have
been addressed, with the exception of the one that I have alluded to above.

I want to conclude by saying that traditional leadership has  a  vital  role
to play in the extension of democracy and accountability to our  traditional
communities. This Bill clearly  articulates  the  role  of  the  traditional
leadership in governance and related municipal matters which will  serve  to
bring democracy and accountability even closer to the different portions  of
our population. It is for these reasons that Salga  supports  the  principle
and material substance of the Bill. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Nksz  N  C  KONDLO:  Sekela-Sihlalo,  Mphathiswa,  ndawonye  nalo  ungenayo,
malungu ale Ndlu, mandithabathe  eli  thuba  nam  ndiphefumle  kulo  Mthetho
oYilwayo ozinjongo zikukuqinisa ubukhosi nendima yabo  kumasiko  nezithethe,
nophuhliso loluntu jikelele.

Eneneni,  ubukhosi  kudala  bukho,  buyinxalenye  yabantu  abamnyama.  Kwaye
bebufudula buyindlela yokuphila kwethu imihla ngemihla,  njengoko  kusenjalo
nangoku.  Njengayo   nayiphina   into,   ubukhosi,   ngokuhamba   kweminyaka
nangokuqhubela phambili koluntu, abumanga ndawonye.  Kwaye  bungavalelekanga
ekoneni bodwa, koko buchatshazelwa  ziinguqu  eluntwini.  Yiyo  loo  nto  ke
bungenakufana nayizolo.

Sihlalo,   ndifuna   ukubethelela   umbandela   wokuba   ingamampunge   into
yokusoloko, xa kuthethwa ngolawulo lobukhosi, kube ngathi bebungena  ntatho-
nxaxheba yoluntu ndaweni nye negalelo  labantu  kwizinto  ebezithi  zixoxwe,
kuthatyathwe  izigqibo  kuzo,  kuba  eneneni   izimvo   zabantu   ngemicimbi
yakomkhulu bezithatyathelwa izigqibo ngabantu,  kwakuba  kuxoxiwe  komkhulu.
Amaxesha amaninzi inkosi  leyo  ibiza  kuwuzisa  umcimbi  embizweni,  uluntu
luphefumle, ze sithatyathwe isigqibo.

Inye nje kuphela sihlalo apho inkqubo  yobukhosi  ibirhuqisa  umraji  khona,
kwaye  ekusenjalo  kwezinye  iindawo,  kukunganiki  oomama   okanye   abantu
basetyhini ilungelo lokuba yinxalenye  yokuthabatha  izigqibo.  [Uwelewele.]
Kwaye awusokuze ufane ubone ingabo oomama abathabatha banikwe ubukhosi.

Eyona  nto,  Sekela-Sihlalo,   eyimbambano   ebonakalayo,   njengomntu   obe
eyilandela  inkqubo  yengxoxo  ngalo  Mthetho  oYilwayo,  yeyokuba   amandla
okulawula abe kubani  na?  Kwisigaba  sorhulumente  wasemakhaya,  ezinkosini
okanye  kubameli  babantu   abanyulwe   ngabantu?   Mhlawumbi   nalo   mbuzo
ngesingawubuzi ukuba ngaba iinkosi, bekusithi  apha  ekuqhutyweni  kwezinto,
zijonge into yokuba ingaba kulungile kusini na  ukuba  zithabathe  inxaxheba
kwezo  politiko  ngokuthi   zibe   ngamalungu   emibutho   ngokuphandle   xa
zisezihlalweni zobukhosi?

Nditsho kuba, ngokwemveli, iinkosi ngabantu abamele ukuqinisekisa inkqubela-
phambili  ngokwamasiko  nezithethe,  ukuqinisekisa  umanyano  kubantu  bayo,
ukunceda iimpula zika lujaca, ikhaya lakomkhulu ebe lisoloko lishushu,  apho
kwamkelwa khona abantu. Kwaye le ndima iinkosi  kufanele  ziyidlale.  Umbuzo
ke,  Sihlalo,  ngowokuba:  xa  inkosi  izibandakanya  nombutho  wezopolitiko
ngokuphandle,inganakho  na  ukumanya  abantu  bayo  abasenokuba   kwimibutho
yezopolitiko eyahlukileyo kulowo wayo? Lo ngumba ke isebe  noluntu  jikelele
ekufanele liwujonge njengokuba kuqhutyelwa phambili nje.

Yiyo loo nto ke  ufumanisa  into  yokuba  ezinye  iinkokeli  zizisebenzisile
iinkosi khon' ukuze zifumane iinxaso. Uve ke  inkosi  isithi:  ``Abantu  bam
kule ndawo baza kuvotela la  mbutho  uthile.''  Masithembe  ke,  Mphathiswa,
okokuba la mhlathi we12 uza kuhlangabezana nawo lo mba kuba lo  gama  inkosi
iziveze  phandle  ukuba  imi  phi  kwezo  politiko,  ngokuthi  ibe  ngummeli
wabantu, kukhona indlela eza kusetyenziswa yokuhlangabezana naloo nto.

Okunye, Sihlalo, lo Mthetho oYilwayo ubandakanya izibonda. Njengomntu  ovela
eMpuma Koloni, lo mba wezibonda  ke  uthande  ukuba  yitolofiya  kuba  thina
ephondweni sibe neendidi ezimbini  zezibonda.  Ezo,  eneneni,  zingabantwana
begazi  nezo  zazihlohlwe  ngenkani   ngoorhulumente   boonomgogwana   phezu
kweentloko zabantu. Ibinga ke lo Mthetho oYilwayo, Sihlalo, awusivuseli  ezo
izibonda.

Ndiyathemba okokuba la ngcaciso yamagama  ephaya  kwesiya  sihloko  sokuqala
ithetha ngeziya zegazi. Kwaye  inga  nephondo,  xa  lisenza  umthetho  walo,
liqinisekise  ngalo  mba  kuba  ingavusa  amanxeba   xa   zinokubuya   eziya
zakhululwayo zagoduka, kungenjalo, ezaphela nokuphela koonomgogwana.

Ukuba   ndiva   kakuhle,   Sihlalo,   lo   Mthetho   oYilwayo    ungeenjongo
zokuqinisekisa  ukuba  ubukhosi  obu  bubetha  ngesingqi   esinye   nolawulo
lwabantu  ngabantu,  kananjalo  ungeenjongo  zokubuyisa  isidima   seenkosi.
Sokhumbula kaloku okokuba inkosi iyazalwa. Mandehle  ngelithi  ke,  Sihlalo,
lo  Mthetho  oYilwayo  ubuyisa  izithethe  namasiko.  Sohlala   siwakhumbula
amaqhawe   eenkosi   zezwe   lethu,   ooMaqoma,   ooSikhukuni,    ooBambatha
nooLangalibalele.

Ndikhe  ndazama  ke,  Sihlalo,  ukukhangela  iinkosi  ezazingoomama.   Hayi,
zandinqabela. Ngethemba ke lokuba lo  Mthetho  oYilwayo  uza  kwenza  sibone
iinkosi ezingoomama zithabatha ubukhosi, kwaye zisanda, hayi kuba  zibambele
oonyana okanye abazukulwana, koko zibe ziinkosi kuba ziselungelweni.

Lixesha elimnandi ke  eli,  Sekela-Sihlalo,  lokuba  siwupasise  lo  Mthetho
oYilwayo  kuba  kaloku  le  ngxoxo  yenziwa  ngethuba  leentsuku  zomgushuzo
ochasene nokuxhatshazwa kwamalungelo oomama nabantwana. Lo Mthetho  oYilwayo
ke, kuba eneneni uqinisekisa indima yoomama, belingekho  elinye  ixesha  ebe
liphucukile lokuba siwupasise ngalo  kule  Ndlu.  Ngalo  mazwi  ke  Sihlalo,
siyawuxhasa lo Mthetho oYilwayo  singu-ANC.  [Kwaqhwatywa]  (Translation  of
isiXhosa speech follows).

[Ms N C KONDLO: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, including the one who  has
just entered, hon members of this House, let me also take  this  opportunity
to  comment  on  this  Bill,  whose  objective  is  to  enhance  traditional
leadership and its role with regard to  culture  and  tradition,  and  human
development in general.

Traditional leadership has in fact been in existence for a  long  time,  and
has always been part of black people's lives. It has  always  been  part  of
our daily life, and still is. Like everything else,  traditional  leadership
has changed with time and as man developed. Because it does not exist  in  a
little corner over there, it is affected by changes  to  humanity.  That  is
why it cannot be the same as it was yesterday.

Chairperson, I want to emphasise the fact that it is  wrong  for  people  to
talk of traditional leadership  as  if  it  did  not  accommodate  community
participation, because, really, decisions on  matters  affecting  the  royal
family were taken by the people, after discussion. In most cases  the  chief
concerned would bring a matter  before  an  imbizo,  for  the  community  to
comment and take a decision on.

There is one thing that was unacceptable  about  traditional  leadership,  a
situation which still prevails in certain areas, and that is the  fact  that
women or  females  were  not  included  in  the  decision-making  processes.
[Interjections.] And you seldom find women who are traditional leaders.

The controversy around this Bill, Deputy Chairperson, as  somebody  who  has
been following discussions around it, concerns the question of  where  power
should reside. Should it reside  with  local  government,  with  traditional
leaders or with the  elected  representatives  of  the  people?  Perhaps  we
wouldn't be asking this question if traditional  leaders  were  to  consider
the wisdom of their taking part openly in politics, by becoming  members  of
political organisations.

I am saying this because traditionally chiefs  are  the  ones  who  have  to
ensure cultural progress and unity among the people,  help  the  poorest  of
the poor and make everyone feel welcome in the royal  house.  They  have  to
play this role. The question, therefore, is: If a traditional  leader  sides
openly with a particular political organisation, would he or she be able  to
unite his subjects, some of whom would  be  members  of  opposing  political
parties? This is an issue which the department and the  community  at  large
should consider as we go along.

That is why you find  that  certain  leaders  use  traditional  leaders  for
political gain. You will find a traditional leader saying: "My  people  here
are going to vote  for  that  particular  political  party."  Let  us  hope,
therefore,  hon  Minister,  that  clause  12  will  address  the  issue   of
traditional leaders openly taking  political  sides  by  becoming  political
representatives.
Furthermore, this Bill touches on the question of councillors. To me,  as  a
person  from  the  Eastern  Cape,  the  question   of   councillors   is   a
controversial one because in the province we had two kinds  of  councillors.
We had the traditional ones and those that were imposed  on  the  people.  I
hope that this Bill does not revive the latter.

I hope that the explanation in the definitions and interpretation refers  to
the traditional ones. I also hope that the province,  when  making  its  own
law regarding councillors, will do the right thing because this issue  could
open up old wounds if the ones who were imposed on the  people  are  brought
back.

If I heard correctly, this Bill aims to ensure that  traditional  leadership
and democracry operate in tandem with one another, as  well  as  to  restore
the dignity of traditional leadership. We will remember that  a  traditional
leader is a traditional leader by  virtue  of  birth.  Let  me  conclude  by
saying that this Bill is reviving our norms and traditions. We  will  always
remember the chiefs who were the heroes of  our  country,  such  as  Maqoma,
Sekhukhune, Bambatha and Langalibalele.

I tried to trace female chiefs, but to no avail. I hope that this Bill  will
lead to women taking chieftaincy, and a sizeable  number  of  them,  not  as
regents, but as fully fledged chiefs.

 This is the appropriate time, Chairperson, to pass this Bill  because  this
debate takes place against the backdrop of efforts to stop the abuse of  the
rights of women and children. Because  this  Bill  guarantees  the  role  of
women, there could not have been a  better  time  to  pass  it.  With  those
words, Chairperson, we as the ANC support this Bill. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Deputy Chairperson,  allow
me  to  thank  all  the  hon  members,  including  special  delegates,   who
participated in this discussion and, once more, to say a word of  thanks  to
the hon Mr Mkhaliphi and other members of the select  committee  for  having
brought us to this point. Allow  me  also  to  thank  and  welcome  the  hon
Minister Valli Moosa who joined us to see  the  final  stage  of  a  process
which he in fact started.

Chairperson,  given  the  time  constraints,  I  won't  really  comment   on
everything that was said by hon members. I think these are matters  that  we
will continue to discuss in future. Perhaps I just need  to  point  out,  in
view of the remarks that were made by the hon MEC Mr Dowry  and  which  were
repeated by the hon Mr  Van  Niekerk  regarding  the  the  concerns  of  the
Khoisan community,  that  at  least  four  submissions  were  received  from
Khoisan stakeholders during  the  National  Assembly  consultation  process.
They indicated, as they were making those submissions, that  they  supported
the Bill; however, they did  make  some  proposals  relating  to  amendments
which they thought would then accommodate their unique circumstances.

The portfolio committee in the National Assembly was of the  unanimous  view
that the process of consultation with the Khoisan  stakeholders,  which  was
started by the department and Ministry for Provincial and Local  Government,
must be proceeded with. We must not anticipate the outcome of that  process.
Let's see what that process yields and  then  obviously  we'll  be  able  to
contemplate the next step. However, I do take note of the remarks that  were
made by the two hon members today.

Mr Dowry also makes a proposal. In fact, he  does  note  that  many  of  the
proposals that were made by his premier were taken into account. I must  say
that not a single organisation's or individual's  recommendations  were  not
taken into account. We approached all the recommendations that were made  in
the spirit in which they were made and we took them on board  as  we  sought
to enrich the Bill before it came to Parliament. We did  take  note  of  the
proposal, for instance, that we needed to say  that  ``in  the  event  of  a
member of the commission dying, there shall be a vacancy''. We didn't  state
that in the Bill because we thought it would be  self-evident  that  when  a
member dies a vacancy arises.

Mr Dowry quoted the former President, Mr Mandela, but as he  proceeded  with
the  speech,  he  forgot  to  close  the  quotation.  I  don't   know   what
implications that has for the Hansard. Let me leave that to those  who  look
after  our  records.  But  once  more,  thank  you  very   much   for   your
participation. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I shall  now  put  the
question. The question is that  the  Bill  and  the  report  of  the  Select
Committee on Local Government  and  Administration  be  agreed  to.  As  the
decision is dealt with in terms section 65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall
first ascertain whether all the delegation heads are present in the  Chamber
to cast their provincial votes. Are all the heads present? Yes.

In accordance with rule 71, I shall allow provinces the opportunity to  make
their declaration of votes if they so wish. Is there any? There is none.  We
shall proceed to the voting on the question. I shall do this  in  alphabetic
order per province. Delegation heads  must  please  indicate  to  the  Chair
whether they vote in  favour  or  against,  or  they  abstain  from  voting.
Eastern Cape?

Mr A T MANYOSI: In support.

Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Hon members,  I
am informed that there will be one debate in respect of the  third,  fourth,
fifth and sixth Orders of the Day.

           NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: PROTECTED AREAS BILL
                   ENVIRONMENT CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL
           NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SECOND AMENDMENT BILL
             NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: AIR QUALITY BILL

(Consideration of Bills and of Reports  of  Select  Committee  on  Land  and
Environmental Affairs thereon)
The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson,  when  16-
year-old Boitumelo Rampeng  from  Gauteng's  township  of  Ga-Rankuwa  stood
before a crowd of thousands of delegates attending  the  Fifth  World  Parks
Congress in Durban recently, she had an important  message  for  the  world.
She pleaded for all of us to work tirelessly at  preserving  the  beauty  of
mother nature in order for future generations  to  reap  the  same  benefits
from the earth that we have today.

It is with a great sense of pride that I inform  this  House  that  the  ANC
Government has indeed, in the almost 10 years of  our  country's  democracy,
worked tirelessly to ensure a better life  for  all  our  people  through  a
sustained environment.

The Bills I submit before you today bear testimony  to  this.  The  National
Environmental   Management:   Protected   Areas   Bill,   the    Environment
Conservation Amendment Bill, the National  Environmental  Management  Second
Amendment Bill and the National Environmental Management: Air  Quality  Bill
are all part of the country's law reform programme.
They aim to usher in  a  paradigm  shift  in  environmental  protection  and
management, ensuring that our people's  rights  to  a  clean  and  sustained
environment, enshrined in the Constitution of our land,  are  respected  and
protected. The Bills will, once passed,  make  certain  that  Government  is
able to use tools that are necessary for environmental  justice  to  prevail
in instances in which people's environmental rights are violated.

On the question of protecting people's environmental rights, the  protection
of rights is the cornerstone of all four  pieces  of  legislation.  The  air
quality  Bill  will  replace  the  outmoded   1965   Atmospheric   Pollution
Prevention Act. Central to this Bill is the need to provide for ambient  air
quality which is satisfactory for the public health of all our people.  More
specifically, it provides for the control of pollution hot  spots,  such  as
the areas around Durban South in KwaZulu-Natal,  Milnerton  in  the  Western
Cape and other areas where local communities have  had  to  bear  an  unfair
burden of air pollution from industrial oil-refining  and  other  industrial
processes.
The Environment Conservation Amendment  Bill  corrects  past  injustices  in
which industries polluted without regard to our people's right to live in  a
waste-free environment. The health risks associated with asbestos have  been
of concern to members of the portfolio and select committees in both  Houses
for that matter. These committees and members held public  hearings  earlier
this year to discuss these concerns and propose a way forward.

It is my pleasure to announce to the National Council of Provinces  and  all
of its hon members that your concerns and your work  to  address  them  have
not been in vain. The Bill addresses this by  giving  Government  powers  to
introduce regulations to control the use of products  that  are  harmful  to
people's health and the environment, such as asbestos, plastic bags, etc.

On  the  question  of  ensuring  community   participation,   the   National
Environmental Management Second  Amendment  Bill  provides  a  platform  for
interested and affected members of society to  have  a  say  in  development
processes so as to influence and shape the final decision on any  particular
development. This way the people's  interests  are  protected  as  they  are
allowed active participation in the decision-making process.

Communities  which  were  previously  stripped  of  their  dignity  by   the
apartheid regime through forced removals in order to  make  way  for  parks,
have been empowered by our democratic system  to  reclaim  the  land.  These
communities have entrusted Government with the  responsibility  of  managing
the land on their behalf.  The  protected  areas  Bill,  which  we  consider
today, goes further by  making  them  and  other  communities  living  along
protected areas  active  partners  in  the  declaration  and  management  of
protected areas. The air quality Bill also ensures that people are  part  of
air quality management decisions that directly affect their lives.

On the question of job creation, I have received reports that  a  number  of
worthwhile developments are being bogged down by the EIA process  which,  in
some instances, has been delayed by unnecessary  bureaucratic  processes  in
various spheres of government. This amendment to the National  Environmental
Management Act  will  allow  for  a  more  efficient  EIA  procedure  as  it
streamlines  the  process,  making  it  speedier  and  cost-effective,  thus
allowing  environmentally  desirable  projects  to  go  ahead  and   thereby
providing jobs and growing the economy at the same time.

All too often I have also received reports that the  EIA  process  is  being
used by some  unscrupulous  developers  to  whitewash  certain  developments
which are, in fact,  environmentally  unsound.  The  amendment  we  consider
today lays down a  certification  procedure  to  ensure  that  environmental
assessment practitioners and consultants are properly certified  and  comply
with certain standards comparable to best practice in the world.

The anticipated legislation also provides for a  fee  to  be  paid  for  the
assessment procedure. This is  miniscule  in  relation  to  the  cost  of  a
development project in general, and the fees generated thereby will be  used
to build capacity in Government to  process  EIA  applications  and  thereby
improve service delivery. This new streamlined system will  also  encourage,
we believe, investment in the country.

The protected areas Bill also holds enormous benefits for our people  as  it
opens up opportunities for jobs through ecotourism. We can  already  testify
to the benefits of ecotourism across South Africa. Indeed,  there  are  many
success stories to tell which highlight the role of  protected  areas  as  a
contributing mechanism to Government's struggle to push back  the  frontiers
of poverty.

Our protected areas are the crown jewels in  the  crown  of  the  burgeoning
international tourism traffic which we have seen to the  country  since  the
advent of democracy. Many of the tourists that  come  to  this  country  are
drawn by the international reputation of our  magnificent  protected  areas.
The resulting in spin-offs for job creation and the  provision  of  services
are all too obvious.
Provisions in the Environment Conservation  Amendment  Bill  will  not  only
influence  people's  behaviour  towards  the  environment,  but  will   also
contribute to the greater job creation effort. The Environment  Conservation
Amendment Bill is, for the first time in South Africa's history,  placing  a
value on waste and providing an opportunity to  use  waste  as  an  economic
generator.

By way of illustration, in May this year  regulations  banning  the  use  of
thin plastic  bags  for  thicker,  more  durable,  reusable  and  recyclable
plastic bags came into effect. This was the first  time  in  South  Africa's
history that a waste product has had an economic value.

This  plastic  bag  initiative  has  not  only  resulted  in  a  significant
reduction in the level of  pollution,  but  will  now  also  result  in  job
creation through the plastic bag recycling  company  which  we  are  in  the
process  of  establishing  in  collaboration  with  organised  business  and
organised labour.

In  this  light,  the  Environment  Conservation   Amendment   Bill   allows
Government  to  impose  compulsory  charging  deposit  systems  or   related
financial measures on various waste streams.  The  revenue  generated  by  a
deposit system, for example,  will  be  used  to  pay  collectors  of  waste
products and recyclers and thus provide much-needed jobs, while at the  same
time cleaning up the environment.

I would like to recognise those  in  the  private  sector  who  continue  to
demonstrate their commitment to the  environment.  A  good  example  is  the
Collect-A-Can initiative which started just  over  10  years  ago  and  with
which I remain highly impressed. It  is  an  illustration  of  how  a  waste
stream  can  be  converted  from  a  municipal  nightmare  into   a   golden
opportunity for our people to put food on their tables.

These Bills also promote  co-operative  governance.  The  three  spheres  of
governance will now be  properly  aligned  through  the  synchronisation  of
functions and responsibilities, such as the issuing of permits by  national,
provincial and local government.

In conclusion, the theme of the Fifth World Parks  Congress  was  "Protected
Areas - Benefits Beyond  Boundaries".  As  a  country  we  have  made  great
strides towards realising  many  benefits  from  our  protected  areas.  The
National Environmental Management:  Protected  Areas  Bill  will  contribute
substantially towards ensuring that these benefits to  our  communities  are
included in our legislative system.

A year before hosting the World Parks Congress,  this  country  successfully
hosted the United Nations Summit on Sustainable  Development,  which  sought
to ensure greater commitment to the sustainability of mother earth  and  the
lives of her people. Once passed, all these  Bills  will  turn  that  vision
into action.

By passing these Bills, our pledge to  the  young  Boitumelo  is:  "We  have
heard  your  plea,  and,  yes,  it  is  our  constitutional  duty  and  your
constitutional right that it be  heeded.  We  are  seeing  to  it  that  you
breathe clean, healthy air, that  your  health  is  protected  from  harmful
waste and that you and  your  fellow  young  South  Africans  are  empowered
through environmentally sound development and through the  benefits  derived
from protected areas."

I would like to extend my gratitude to members of the select  committee  who
continued to demonstrate their unreserved commitment to promoting the  cause
of environmental  justice  in  our  country.  Without  the  support  of  the
provinces you represent, we would not have been able to make the  remarkable
strides that we as  a  country  have  made  over  the  past  nine  years  of
democracy. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Thank  you,  hon
Minister. I now call upon Rev P  Moatshe,  the  chairperson  of  the  Select
Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, Minister,  MECs,  special  delegates,  permanent
delegates present and the department, I am honoured to participate  in  this
debate.

Voorsitter, ons het 'n verlede wat ons nie kan  vergeet  nie,  maar  ook  'n
hede waarin ons almal ons hande saamgooi om 'n beter toekoms daar  te  stel.
Daar is sommige mense wat nog in die verlede wil bly,  wat  gekant  is  teen
transformasie. Maar dit is danksy hierdie Regering dat ons tot  hiertoe  kon
kom om hierdie verandering teweeg te bring en as gevolg daarvan is  ons  ook
baie bly dat daar samewerking was tussen ons komitee en die Minister  tesame
met sy departement. Ons wil ons innige woord van dank en opregte  waardering
betuig aan hulle. Ons wil ook 'n woord van dank  uitspreek  teenoor  al  die
provinsies  wat  hulle  samewerking  gegee  het  sodat  ons  'n   jaar   van
samewerking kon deurmaak. Ons dank dié God inniglik wat ons gespaar het  tot
hiertoe. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, we have a past that we cannot forget, but also  a  present  in
which all of us must work together to create  a  better  future.  There  are
certain people  who  want  to  remain  in  the  past,  who  are  opposed  to
transformation. But it is thanks to this Government that we could  get  this
far to bring about change and because of that we are  also  very  glad  that
there was co-operation between our  committee  and  the  Minister,  together
with his department. We want  to  covey  to  them  our  sincere  thanks  and
heartfelt appreciation. We also want to convey a word of thanks to  all  the
provinces who co-operated so that we could have a year of  co-operation.  We
give deep thanks to this God who spared us thus far.]

 The stage has already been eloquently set by the Minister  for  the  debate
on these four  pieces  of  legislation  that  are  before  you,  namely  the
National  Environmental  Management  Second  Amendment  Bill,  the  National
Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill, the  National  Environmental
Management: Air Quality Bill  and  the  Environment  Conservation  Amendment
Bill. We are bringing these four Bills  before  you  at  once  because  they
mainly address the same subject, but each Bill has got its own  emphasis  to
bring about change in what we are envisaging as a country, so that there  is
a better life for everyone in this part of the world.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁl: Sorry, hon Chair. Is it  in  order  for  the  hon  member
Krumbock to respond to  a  cell  phone  call  in  the  House?  Shouldn't  he
apologise?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Hon  members,  I  have
noticed that people have left their cell phones on. Would  you  please  shut
off your cell phones? And Mr Krumbock, if you are responding  to  your  cell
phone  in  the  House,  it  is  out  of   order.   Continue,   hon   member.
[Interjections.] Continue, hon member!

Rev  P  MOATSHE:  I  will  deal  first  with  the   National   Environmental
Management: Air Quality Bill, which in actual fact  provides  the  framework
for the required reform through the  establishment  of  national  norms  and
standards and a regulatory framework for an air quality management  planning
and reporting regime and numerous regulatory instruments for the control  of
air pollution and a comprehensive approach to  compliance  and  enforcement.
Cognisance should be taken of the fact that  the  current  approach  to  air
quality management  in  South  Africa  is  informed  and  regulated  by  the
Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act of 1965. That is the  APPA,  which  for
quite some time has been regarded as outdated for a number of  reasons,  not
least of these being that it cannot  accommodate  constitutional  allocation
of functions in respect of the role  of  provincial  and  local  government.
That  is,  it  has  inadequate  compliance  and  enforcement  mechanisms  to
implement the Act effectively, and a  lack  of  transparency  and  decision-
making.

A turning point was reached with the publication in May 2000  of  the  White
Paper on Integrated Pollution and Waste Management for South  Africa,  which
sidelined the APPA. Thus the National Environmental Management: Air  Quality
Bill reflects the new approach.

The National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill forms part of  a
suite of legislation established to manage the  environment.  The  framework
is  provided  for  in  the  National  Environmental  Management  Act   where
environmental management principles are set out and sections common  to  the
other legislation in this suite allocated. Included  in  the  suite  is  the
National Environmental Management: Biodiversity  Bill,  which  provides  for
the management  and  conservation  of  the  biological  diversity  of  South
Africa, the sustainable use of our biological resources, and  the  fair  and
equitable sharing of benefits  arising  from  the  use  and  application  of
genetic resources and material.

This Bill provides also for the existence  of  the  South  African  national
parks, the declaration and management of protected  areas  in  South  Africa
and co-operative governance in such declaration and management of  protected
areas.

I now come to the Environment Conservation Amendment Bill. According to  the
Bill of Rights, everyone has  the  right  to  an  environment  that  is  not
harmful  to  their  health  or  wellbeing,  and  to  have  the   environment
protected, for the  benefit  of  present  and  future  generations,  through
reasonable  legislative  and  other  measures  that  prevent  pollution  and
ecological  degradation,  promote  conservation,  and  secure   ecologically
sustainable  development  and  use  of  natural  resources  while  promoting
justifiable economic and social development.

The National Environmental Management Second  Amendment  Bill  provides  for
amendments required in order for the Act to ensure the provision of a  legal
framework for the new suite of legislation  for  the  country  to  meet  its
environmental responsibilities and functions.

 The amendment rationalises and streamlines administration  and  enforcement
provisions in the Act and is also aimed at addressing the previous  lack  of
effective enforcement and implementation of environmental laws. The  primary
advantage of this amendment is that provinces' and local governments'  staff
members who are responsible for biodiversity management  may  be  designated
as  environmental  management  inspectors  to  enforce  the  provisions   of
national environmental management legislation. Any legislation  is  as  good
as nonexistent without enforcement mechanisms.

In conclusion, as we look back on 10 years of democracy  in  our  land,  and
take stock of achievements and lessons we have  learned,  we  would  in  the
same breath want, in planning for the next 10 years, to mark  the  beginning
of a new era  in  biodiversity  management  and  co-ordinated  environmental
functions and principles by passing these four Bills. Therefore I appeal  to
this House that we unaminously, without any objection,  support  these  four
Bills. [Applause.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, thank you very much. At the outset,  I  would
like to state that the DA supports all four environmental Bills  before  the
House today. However, there are concerns and I will deal  with  them  in  my
speech. [Interjections.]

Die wetgewing op beskermde gebiede,  oftewel  "protected  areas",  maak  dit
moontlik    en    bekostigbaar    om    die    landsoppervlak    wat    deur
bewaringsorganisasies  bestuur  gaan  word  in  die  volgende  vyf  jaar  te
verdubbel.

Dit is ook gepas dat ons hierdie wetsontwerp hanteer in die jaar waarin  ons
land as gasheer opgetree het vir  die  vierde  IUCN  Congress  on  Protected
Areas. Die internasionale gemeenskap het tydens die  IUCN-kongres  onderneem
om op groot skaal te belê in beskermde gebiede.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The  legislation  relating  to  protected  areas  makes  it  possible   and
affordable to double the surface of the land that is going to be managed  by
environment conservation organisations in the next five years.

It is also appropriate that we deal with this Bill in the year in  which  we
acted as host to the fourth IUCN Congress on  Protected  Areas.  During  the
IUCN congress the international community undertook to invest  in  protected
areas on a large scale.]
Therefore the creation of mechanisms through which protected areas can  seek
funding from other sources is urgently needed.  What  concerns  me  most  is
what a Bill does not say or what it opens itself up to, rather than what  it
does say. For example, in the National Environmental  Management:  Protected
Areas Bill, in  clause  48,  it  says  "no  person  may  conduct  commercial
prospecting or mining activities". That is good.

The Bill does not specify that hunting is permitted. The problem is it  does
not specify that hunting is not permitted in national parks  and  wilderness
areas. When I asked about this in the committee, it was stated  to  me  that
the Minister is on record as being against hunting. To me, that is not  good
enough. I believe that protected areas should  be  places  where  wilderness
areas are preserved from exploitation by  forestry  and  mining  industries,
and where wildlife is kept safe from bullets, arrows, snares and traps.

The words "sustainable use" emerge in several key provisions. However,  this
Bill does not provide any definition  for  the  term  ``sustainable''.  Once
again, the Bill does not say what sustainable means or  what  is  understood
by that.

The definition of sustainability in the National  Environmental  Management:
Biodiversity Bill does not cover the definition of sustainability  given  in
the convention on  biological  diversity  which  requires  focusing  on  the
decline of biodiversity  instead  of  the  mere  maintenance  of  biological
resources.  Biological  diversity  is  more  than  the  sum  of   biological
resources. Principle 15 of the  1992  Rio  Declaration  on  Environment  and
Development states "in order to protect the environment,  the  precautionary
approach shall be widely applied".

On the National Environmental Management: Air Quality  Bill,  I  would  just
like to  mention  the  following.  Too  much  is  being  expected  of  local
authorities in terms of monitoring and  controlling  of  air  quality.  Some
local authorities can hardly manage their  own  affairs.  How  can  they  be
expected  to  monitor  complex  procedures  associated  with  air   quality?
Secondly, I think there  should  be  more  emphasis  on  monitoring  of  the
pollution point - that is where it  is  all  happening  -  rather  than  the
ambient  quality.  Thirdly,  I  think  the  Minister  is  given   too   much
discretion. He "may" do certain things, where we believe he "should" do it.

The Environment Conservation Amendment Act makes  three  discret  amendments
to the  Environment  Conservation  Act.  The  most  important  is  that  the
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism is the proper  authority  to
control all and any form of pollution, including  and  especially  hazardous
waste.

In the end, I would just like to say that environmental protection  is  only
as good as the law on which it is based. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western Cape): Thank you, Chairperson. Laat  ek  aan  die
begin sê [Let me say from the outset] "We support all four Acts." There  are
certain problems we are experiencing, but we will sort them out.

In the first place, in terms of the protected areas Bill, only the  national
Minister may appoint a broad range of people as management authorities;  the
MEC is still only entitled to assign the management of a protected  area  to
an organ of state. In our opinion, the provincial MEC will be closer to  the
conservation agencies and landowners' communities on the ground, and  should
also be able to appoint management authorities.

In addition,  there  is  no  differentiation  of  management  frameworks  in
accordance with different tasks of protected areas, making  stewardship  and
incentives  very  difficult  to  realise.  Otherwise,  we  think  that   the
problematic areas will be ironed out in the implementation of the Bill,  and
we support the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill.

When it comes to the Environment Conservation Amendment Bill, my  department
has no comment on the content of the three amendments  contemplated  in  the
Bill. All three amendments are logical and fit in with  the  current  policy
framework for integrated pollution and waste management in the  Republic  of
South  Africa.  My  department  would,  however,  like  to  comment  on  the
implications of especially the amendment of section 20 of Act  73  of  1989,
which deals specifically with waste management. We are  aware  that  in  all
probability the function contemplated  in  section  20,  once  it  has  been
transferred from the Department of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  will  be
devolved to the nine provinces.

This devolution of  section  20  to  the  provinces  will  have  significant
financial and human resources implications for the provinces. As  such,  the
constitutional principle of "funds follow function" should be adhered to  in
order to successfully implement section 20 of the  Environment  Conservation
Act.

Furthermore, our department  would  like  to  suggest  that  a  transitional
period for the handover of functions from the Department  of  Water  Affairs
and Forestry to the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, and  in
all likelihood the nine provinces, be  contemplated.  The  reason  for  this
transitional period is so that the staff of the Department of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism and the nine provinces are able to work with  the  staff
of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry  and,  in  so  doing,  build
their  capacity  to  perform  the  necessary   functions   effectively   and
economically. The Department of Water Affairs and  Forestry  can  work  away
the landfill permit backlogs that have accumulated over the  years  so  that
the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and the  nine  provinces
do not inherit these backlogs.

When it comes  to  the  third  Bill,  the  Western  Cape  has  undertaken  a
comprehensive analysis  of  the  National  Environmental  Management  Second
Amendment Bill on each occasion. Essentially,  our  comments  have  remained
consistent due to inadequate revisions being made to the Bill. If  the  Bill
is promulgated in its current form, several  contradictions  will  exist  in
the law. This is of no benefit in  assisting  the  national  and  provincial
departments in achieving effective environmental management and  sustainable
development.
There are a number of  issues  of  principle  where  the  department  is  at
variance with the content of the Bill. Many of  these  issues  of  principle
are based on the practical experience of the department in dealing with  the
current environmental  legislative  regime,  particularly  the  current  EIA
regulations. The department is currently involved in a  lawsuit  in  Pringle
Bay where many of the  issues  raised  in  the  comments  on  the  Bill  are
relevant. This is but one example of the nature of the practical  experience
and lessons learnt from  which  the  department  has  drawn  in  formulating
comments on the Bill.

The nature of the competent authority is ambitious;  examples  are  provided
in the table where  the  MEC  and  the  Minister  are  referred  to  as  the
competent authority, yet the definition given in section 1 -  activities  to
which the legislation will apply - is not clear. Firstly, listed  activities
are poorly defined. In the second place,  reference  is  made  to  class  of
activities and not to policy, programme, plan or project. No  definition  or
context is provided for any of these items. The department has not  provided
alternative wording for the clauses of the Bill which are  of  concern,  the
reason being that these concerns are matters  of  principle  rather  than  a
question of wording.

When it comes to the National Environmental Management:  Air  Quality  Bill,
the reform of the current Atmospheric  Pollution  Prevention  Act  has  been
long awaited. The new air quality Bill is therefore necessary to  align  our
Constitution with the National Environmental Management  Act.  The  National
Environmental  Management:  Air  Quality  Bill  further  also  supports  the
current policy framework provided by  the  integrated  pollution  and  waste
management policy. My  department  is  aware  of  the  implications  of  the
National Environmental Management: Air Quality Bill, especially in terms  of
improvements to the current system.

The major implication  of  this  new  piece  of  legislation  is  the  human
resources capacity and other financial resources which would be critical  to
perform the functions as indicated in the Bill.  My  department  has  raised
the issue of unfunded mandates with the Department of Environmental  Affairs
and Tourism before when we commented on  the  many  draft  versions  of  the
Bill. Funds therefore should follow  function,  otherwise  we,  once  again,
have legislation that cannot be properly implemented.

Voorsitter, ek wil net  in  my  eie  moedertaal  vir  Minister  Valli  Moosa
hartlik bedank vir die geleentheid wat ek gehad het om saam met hom  in  die
samewerkende regering van die Nuwe NP en die ANC in die  Wes-Kaap  te  dien.
Ons ondervinding was dat  by  Minmec'e  mnr  Valli  Moosa  altyd  billik  en
regverdig  opgetree  het.  Sy  visie  en  versiendheid   vir   toerisme   en
omgewingsake sal baie gemis word. Ons weet nie of  ons  volgende  jaar  weer
bymekaar sal kom nie, en daarom wil ek net namens  die  Wes-Kaapse  regering
vir Minister Valli Moosa sê  baie  sterkte,  baie  voorspoed.  Ons  is  baie
jammer dat u omgewingsake en toerisme vaarwel roep, maar wees verseker,  ons
het waardering vir wat u gedoen  het  in  hierdie  portefeulje.  Baie,  baie
dankie daarvoor. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, I would just like to thank Mr Valli Moosa heartily in  my  own
mother tongue for the  opportunity  I  had  to  serve  in  the  co-operative
government of the New NP and the ANC in the Western Cape. Our experience  at
Minmecs was that Mr Valli Moosa always acted fairly and justly.  His  vision
and far-sightedness in respect of tourism and environmental affairs will  be
greatly missed. We do not know whether  we  will  get  together  again  next
year, and therefore I would just like to say to  Minister  Valli  Moosa,  on
behalf of the Western Cape government, everything  of  the  best  and  great
success. We sincerely regret your bidding environmental affairs and  tourism
goodbye, but rest assured, we have great appreciation for what  you  did  in
this portfolio. Thank you very much for that. [Applause.]]

Mr  G  B  BHENGU  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Thank  you,  Deputy   Chairperson.   The
provincial standing committee on the National Council of Provinces  mandated
me as a special delegate to support the National  Environmental  Management:
Air Quality Bill, the nature conservation management Bill and  the  National
Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill,  and  then  mandated  me  to
read to your good House a statement from the portfolio  committee  regarding
this protected areas Bill.


  The province of  KwaZulu-Natal  hereby  wishes  to  express  its  serious
  concern regarding the process followed by the NCOP  Select  Committee  on
  Land and Environmental Affairs with regard to the National  Environmental
  Management: Protected Areas Bill [B39-2003], with specific  reference  to
  the consideration, or rather the lack thereof, given to the KZN proposals
  on the Bill during the negotiating mandate and final voting mandate stage
  of the select committee deliberations.


  The select committee, at its meeting held on 12 November 2003 to consider
  the negotiating mandates from the provinces, did not fully  consider  the
  KZN proposal, and cited insufficient time as the reason for not doing so.
  This KZN finds unacceptable, particularly since the meeting adjourned  at
  lunch time. Instead, the select committee proposed that the Department of
  Environmental Affairs and Tourism consider the KZN proposal  and  respond
  thereto. This we consider to be tantamount to abdicating the  committee's
  responsibility to the department.


  On 18 November 2003 the KZN NCOP committee received a fax from the select
  committee, attaching what was referred to  as  the  amendments  from  the
  negotiating mandates  on  which  the  committee  achieved  consensus.  It
  referred to the protected areas Bill, among others. However,  the  letter
  clearly records that  the  select  committee  did  not  discuss  the  KZN
  proposals.


  This is further amplified by a letter  from  the  North  West  Provincial
  Legislature dated 19 November 2003, and tabled  at  the  select  commitee
  meeting on 24 November 2003, wherein it states that following the KwaZulu-
  Natal proposed amendment to the Bill, which our committee clearly refused
  to discuss, KZN maintains that the failure and/or refusal by  the  select
  committee to consider this proposal amounted to a serious miscarriage  of
  justice. Not only was  KwaZulu-Natal,  as  a  province,  deprived  of  an
  opportunity of stating its position, but we  had  made  some  substantive
  proposals without which we consider the Bill to be  seriously  flawed  in
  certain major respects.


  The select committee has not had the benefit of  hearings.  The  document
  faxed to KZN on 18 November 2003 from  the  select  committee  ostensibly
  contained the department's view on the KZN proposals, although two  vital
  proposals listed in the KZN negotiating mandate  were  not  addressed  in
  this document at all.


  Of the assumption that the document indeed represented  the  department's
  view,  the  KZN  portfolio   committee   on   nature   conservation   and
  environmental affairs, as  well  as  the  KZN  NCOP  committee,  met  and
  considered these proposals. The  KZN  NCOP  delegates  were  subsequently
  mandated to support the Bill subject to certain  amendments  proposed  by
  KZN, as set forth in the document  entitled  Final  Voting  Mandate.  The
  document was submitted to the select committee before its  meeting,  held
  on 24 November 2003, to consider the province's  final  voting  mandates.
  Some of the amendments proposed in the document contained alternatives to
  the original proposal contained in the negotiating mandate.  However,  at
  its meeting held on 24 November 2003, the committee refused  to  consider
  new proposals, and the department was not asked to comment thereon.  This
  was another opportunity lost to the select committee.


The select committee generally failed to consider the KZN  proposal  at  its
meeting held on 24 Novemebr 2003. The KZN delegation  was  not  afforded  an
opportunity to reopen the discussion or to take the  committee  through  its
proposal. Instead, a new document was circulated as being the ...

[Interjections.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Hon Chair, with due respect to the hon member, Mr  Bhengu,  I
wonder if there is any way  that  the  Chair  can  protect  us,  the  select
committee, because some of  the  allegations  are  serious  and  others  are
faulty and erroneous. Although we have freedom  of  expression,  these  were
not shared in the committee.  So,  I  just  wanted  to  know  what  kind  of
protection we can have through the Chairperson for the committee on this.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Can we allow Mr Bhengu  to  finish,  then  we
look at the report after that, and then we make a ruling after that.

Mr G M BHENGU  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Thank  you,  Chair.  As  I  stated,  I  was
directed to read a statement from the  province.  This  is  not  a  personal
input. I continue:


Instead, a new document was circulated as being the  department's  response.
The department was asked to  address  the  committee  on  each  of  the  KZN
proposals, and ...

[Interjections.]

... contained in the original negotiating mandate.

[Interjections.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chair, I think we need to know at  what  stage  the  member  is
going to begin to debate the Bill. May we please know?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, will you continue.

Mr G M BHENGU (KwaZulu-Natal): I came here as a special delegate to put  the
point of view of the province. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Don't respond to  them.  Continue  with  your
speech. [Laughter.]

Mr G M BHENGU (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you.

The province of KZN feels that  it  has  been  severely  prejudiced  in  the
process, and that on both the  occasions  mentioned,  the  select  committee
failed or refused  to  hear  the  province,  or  to  properly  consider  its
proposals. For this reason we,  as  a  province,  have  been  left  with  no
alternative but to abstain from voting on the Bill.

Before I resume my seat, I must take this opportunity  to  congratulate  ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your time has expired.

Mr G M BHENGU (KwaZulu-Natal): Despite the disturbances?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your time has expired.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I'd like to say that my best wishes  go  out  to
you, Minister, as well. You have done a  great  job.  You  really  have.  We
appreciate it and we wish you well.

This Bill, of course, is only a  beginning,  and  is  enabling  also  for  a
family of Bills. I  am  going  to  speak  particularly  about  the  National
Environmental Management: Air Quality Bill, which is really a beginning,  an
enabling Bill. Important though it is, the real work is yet to come  -  much
of it at local authority level and in terms of  the  concurrency  provisions
in Schedule 4, Part B, of the Constitution. This is all logical and good.

However, as my hon colleague here the hon  Mrs  Versfeld  said,  very  often
there is a mismatch between the relative players - the local  authority  and
the polluter - in terms of their ability to  do  oversight,  their  relative
influence, and  so  on.  There  are  heavyweight  people  involved  in  this
business, Minister. This is why the central Government is going to  have  to
play a key role.

The sources and causes of air pollution are manifold. Interestingly  enough,
we have partial responsibility for the production of  oxygen,  because  most
people don't realise that in the South Atlantic,  in  the  South  Pole,  the
krill produce more oxygen than the rainforests  produce.  So,  South  Africa
has a very direct responsibility there in seeing that  the  krill  resources
are not attacked. That, in turn, will reflect upon air quality.
Air pollution is probably the  last  effectively  unregulated  part  of  our
global natural environment. I  would  say  it  is  the  last  frontier.  The
trouble  with  air  pollution  is  that  everybody's  business  is  nobody's
business. One jurisdiction cleans air, only for it to  move  away  with  the
prevailing  wind,  which,  in  turn,  ushers  in  the  pollution  from   the
neighbouring areas. That is why the various states  in  the  US  are  taking
each other to court on these issues.

Though I am against overregulation,  I  wish  to  state  categorically  here
today that experience has shown that polluters will pollute unless  the  law
stops them. Everyone pays lip service to good  air  quality,  but  few  will
voluntarily make the investment. "You do it  first",  is  what  people  say.
"Not now"; "Only on new plant"; "Later"; "Let's phase it in"; "Give us  five
years"; and, "We cannot do it  because  we  are  going  to  be  uneconomical
compared to China".

That's nonsense, Minister.  This  is  because  you  can  look  at  the  most
successful economies in the world; the  most  successful  societies  in  the
world. They have the cleanest air in the  world  and  they  are  the  people
making the biggest investment in improving air quality in the world.

So, for us to fall for those arguments that you will hear from  industry  as
you go forward ... Don't fall for it, Minister. They will say  to  you  that
it can't be done - "We  don't  have  the  technology."  They  will  say  the
footprint is too big. They'll say, "Let's do trials first." That takes  them
10 years; and they keep you on a string. Don't do it,  Minister.  Give  them
the cold-turkey treatment you gave them with the plastic bags.  [Inaudible.]
We support this legislation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, Minister  Moosa  and  colleagues,  the  four
environmental  Bills  being  debated  today,  namely  those   referring   to
protected areas, conservation,  and  air  quality  as  well  as  the  second
amending Bill of the National Environmental Management Act, are  once  again
so closely interlinked that is only logical for them to  be  dealt  with  in
the same debate.

 The National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill forms  part  of
a suite of legislation established to manage the  environment.  In  essence,
the Bill seeks to bring the system of protected areas  in  line  with  South
Africa's new constitutional and legal order.  Accordingly,  it  consolidates
and rationalises existing legislation on protected areas,  whilst  providing
for the declaration and management of protected  areas  and  establishing  a
national system of protected areas as part  of  a  strategy  to  manage  and
conserve our beautiful country's wonderful biodiversity.

The Environment Conservation Amendment Bill deals with matters  relating  to
waste management and pollution control, and specifically seeks, firstly,  to
provide for the transfer of the  administration  of  waste  sites  from  the
Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry  to  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism;  secondly,  to  provide  for  the  empowerment  of  the
Minister of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  to  make  regulations  to
control certain products that may have a harmful or  detrimental  effect  on
the environment or human health if and when they  reach  the  waste  system;
and, lastly, to  provide  for  the  empowerment  of  the  Minister  to  make
regulations to use financial mechanisms to encourage  the  reuse,  reduction
or recycling of specific waste types.

These amendments have been considered necessary as  the  provisions  of  the
Environment Conservation Act, Act 73 of 1989, are  not  adequately  able  to
give effect to the Government policy of  integrated  waste  management.  The
primary objective is therefore ... [Interjections.] Chair, could you  please
ask the hon members to have respect ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Conroy, you are protected. Could the  hon
members please behave. Rev Chabaku and Ms  Sono,  could  you  please  behave
because your voices are  too  loud.  You  are  disturbing  the  hon  member.
[Interjections.]

You can continue, Dr Conroy.
Dr E A CONROY: Apology accepted.  The  primary  objective  is  therefore  to
further facilitate general policy on integrated pollution control and  waste
management. The National Environmental  Management:  Air  Quality  Bill  was
introduced as a section  76  Bill  by  the  Select  Committee  on  Land  and
Environmental Affairs at  the  request  of  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism.

For many years the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention  Act  of  1965,  or  the
APPA for short, provided a sound basis  for  air  pollution  legislation  in
South Africa. However, its emphasis on  point-source  emission  control  has
become outmoded and ineffective due  to  the  development  in  environmental
thinking about air quality control. Insufficient  attention  was  previously
paid to the ability of the receiving environment to cope with the  pollution
emitted from the different point sources.

The National Environmental Management: Air Quality Bill replaces  the  APPA.
The  fundamental  difference  between  the   APPA   and   the   Bill   under
consideration is that the latter addresses the adverse impact  of  emissions
into the receiving environment and sets stricter standards for ambient  air.
It is noted that the preamble to the Bill states that air pollution  carries
a high socioeconomic and environmental cost which is  seldom  borne  by  the
polluter and that the burden of health  impacts,  associated  with  polluted
ambient air, falls most heavily on the poor.

It is therefore to be hoped that the Bill  will  ultimately  enable  ambient
air quality standards which are not harmful to the health of  not  only  the
privileged but also, more so, the disadvantaged sections of  our  community,
and wellbeing to become the norm in all communities and moreover  to  ensure
that this is  achieved  in  a  manner  which  will  facilitate  and  enhance
sustainable development.

The National Environmental  Management  Act  of  1998,  or  Nema  as  it  is
normally referred to, gives a legal framework to the state's  constitutional
obligations  in  terms  of  managing  the  environment.  In  terms  of   the
Constitution every South African is guaranteed the right to  an  environment
which is not harmful to their health and wellbeing.

In order to streamline the implementation of Nema,  chapter  5  of  the  Act
required amendment. The National Environmental Management  Second  Amendment
Bill is therefore a further attempt to fill  some  of  the  gaps  that  have
already  been   identified   in   respect   of   efficient   and   effective
administration and enforcement of  environmental  legislation.  The  New  NP
supports these Bills. [Applause.]

 The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you  very  much,  Dr  Conroy.  Rev
Chabaku,  I  am  not  sure  why  you  left  the  Free  State  for   Gauteng.
[Interjections.] You are disturbing Gauteng. I am sure you will go  back  to
the Free State. [Laughter.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chair, I rise on behalf of the Limpopo legislature  to
support these four Bills tabled before us here this afternoon.

These  Bills  have  been  subjected  to  scrupulous  interrogation  at   the
committee stage by almost all members of the select committee.  However,  it
is regrettable that some provinces have expressed exception to  the  passage
of  these  Bills.  The  passage  of  these  Bills  and,   importantly,   the
implementation thereof, are aimed at  assuring  everyone  the  right  to  an
environment that is not harmful to their health or  wellbeing.  To  have  an
environment protected against  degradation  is  a  constitutional  right  of
everyone in South Africa.

The four Bills address a wide range of issues. There  are,  however,  silent
issues I would like to raise. Firstly, it is noted  with  appreciation  that
the establishment of the transborder protected areas is a boon  to  mankind.
They have provided a link between the  citizens  of  South  Africa  and  the
citizens of neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe, Mozambique  and  Botswana.
They promote peace among people, communities  and  nations  because  of  the
common heritage these countries share.

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has made a  breakthrough
in demonstrating the Government's willingness and commitment  to  conserving
nature and preserving life on this  planet  through  the  establishment  and
sustainment of protected areas.

The other issue I wish to highlight is  that  indigenous  people  should  be
encouraged to own and manage their sacred places, their  archaeological  and
cultural heritage and their ceremonial objects. Sacred  places  need  to  be
identified and designated and  should  enjoy  legal  protection.  Indigenous
people should access fauna and flora and other natural resources  which  are
indispensable to their economy and rituals which take place at their  sacred
places. Laws have to be enacted to  acknowledge  the  importance  of  sacred
places.

Indigenous people  should  participate  effectively  in  the  management  of
protected areas.  A  concern  is  expressed  regarding  the  absence  of  an
instrument to protect the intellectual property of  indigenous  people  with
regard to their traditional knowledge,  innovation  systems  and  biological
resources in order to guard aginst what we call "biopiracy activities".
I would like to make a few comments on poverty and protected  areas.  It  is
argued that protected  areas  cannot  operate  as  islands  of  conservation
divorced from the  socioeconomic  environment  within  which  they  operate.
Poverty,  hunger  and  land  degradation  have  a  profound   influence   on
biodiversity and protected areas. Hence the adage that  the  hungry  stomach
knows no appetite.

Poverty  is  characterised  by,  inter  alia,   a   lack   of   assets   and
opportunities, vulnerability, absence of power  or  voice.  Protected  areas
can make a significant contribution  to  the  alleviation  of  poverty.  The
Makuleke community, as the Minister knows, is a case in point.

To what extend are our local communities linked to  these  protected  areas?
Most local communities are located around  protected  areas  and  have  very
limited development  opportunities.  Given  that  protected  areas  generate
significant economic and social benefits, they  are  ideally  positioned  to
contribute towards poverty reduction.

Another issue I wish to highlight is  a  natural  threat  to  the  protected
areas, a matter of great concern. This is the  global  climate  change  that
can alter the  physical  parameters  of  our  environment.  As  the  climate
changes, so do the ecosystem and species. A need  for  the  introduction  of
new strategies with heavy cost implications to  manage  protected  areas  is
bound to occur. As  a  result  of  the  changes,  the  outbreak  of  unknown
diseases and invasive island species are bound  to  occur,  aggravating  the
financial burden on the state.

Another area of great concern is the  unacceptable  quality  of  atmospheric
gas concentration which causes global climate change,  in  turn  leading  to
the extinction of species. Climate change  precipitated  by  the  industrial
carbon monoxide levels may result in high mortality of fauna and  flora.  As
we heard yesterday, the Beijing and Montreal  protocols  stand  to  regulate
substances that can deplete the ozone layer and thus expose the  human  body
to destruction by the sun's rays.

In the context of what I have said, Minister, the need for  the  passing  of
these Bills cannot be overemphasised. The Limpopo legislature  supports  the
passing of the four  Bills  with  no  reservations.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

[Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL:  Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson,  for  granting  me  this
opportunity to participate in  this  debate.  The  respected  Minister,  hon
Valli Moosa, has spoken. He spoke quite clearly and it was  perfectly  clear
to everyone what the aim of the Bills that we are discussing is,  and  where
they are leading the vast land of South Africa. The Chairperson and hon  Rev
Moatshe have also clearly stated their views;  he  even  expressed  them  in
Afrikaans so that all South Africans would understand.]

I would like to introduce my speech by quoting the following words:


  The people of South Africa overwhelmingly voted for the ANC in  1994  and
  in 1999. These people believed, as they do now, that the policies of  the
  ANC are a correct response to South Africa's challenges.

This is a quotation from Sephadi. Those who do not  know  Sephadi  must  not
think that it's an endangered species of animal somewhere.  Sephadi  is  the
official journal of the ANC caucus. We would  encourage  members  even  from
other parties to read that journal. It's available free of charge.
It is in that context that these Bills respond to global challenges that  we
have in terms of the protocols and treaties to which we are  signatories  as
a country. They also respond to the World Summit on Sustainable  Development
Declaration, the World Parks Congress and the national  imperatives  of  the
country.

These Bills also  ensure  that  legislation  dealing  with  the  environment
conforms  to  the  constitutional  framework.  For  example,  the   National
Environmental  Management:  Air  Quality  Bill  repeals  the  outdated   and
unconstitutional APPA  of  1965.  The  APPA  is  the  Atmospheric  Pollution
Prevention Act, because it may be mistaken for Apla, which was the  military
wing of the PAC.

Before my time is over, I must put the record straight. As the  spokesperson
for this committee  -  actually,  I  was  just  recently  appointed  by  the
Chairperson before we came to the Chamber - in a situation  where  you  have
the DA, ACDP, and all other parties supporting  this  Bill,  all  the  other
eight provinces supporting this  Bill,  and  you  have  a  province,  which,
correctly so, has a democratic right  to  abstain,  it  is  not  correct  to
mislead this House and the country by abusing the platform provided by  this
debate by saying that they were prejudiced or discriminated against.

When you check the statement from KwaZulu-Natal - I must  say  upfront  that
we really appreciate the work that they do,  because  they  always  come  up
with amendments and they always  send  special  delegates  -  we  must  also
encourage that those special delegates that they  send  must  be  consistent
when dealing with one Bill. Unlike in a situation where,  when  there  is  a
briefing, you have hon member A coming; and on negotiating mandate it's  hon
member B, and for the final mandate it's hon member C, and naturally,  there
will be some flaws  and  disjointed  facts.  Then,  it  also  questions  the
quality of feedback that is given to that particular legislature. As  I  was
coming here, one  member  said  that  the  involvement  of  the  DA  in  the
government of that province may also be causing such problems. [Laughter.]

When you look on the first page at the covering letter, it says  the  select
committee failed and/or refused to hear the province. I just took it as  the
statement being badly drafted, because if they say we  failed  to  hear,  it
means we've got some form of disability; or if we refused to hear, maybe  we
closed  our  ears  in  the  committee  meeting,   but   they   had   written
presentations and so on.

It must also be stated that they sent voluminous  amendments,  which  we  do
appreciate  and  we  gave  time  for  the  department  to  look  into  those
amendments that the committee did not have time to look into. That was  very
fair, to say that the department must not just  respond  on  their  feet  so
that they have time to apply their minds  and  correctly  respond  to  those
amendments.

It is also in that light that we accepted a lot of those amendments.  I  can
simply say that out of five amendments, four of them were accepted.  But  it
is surprising that they even  abstained  from  supporting  those  amendments
which we did accept.

We are prepared, as members  of  the  committee,  together  with  the  other
provinces, to support their amendments which we did accept. They  must  also
respect our democratic right to say that after we had interacted  with  some
of the  amendments  we  could  not  accept  all  of  them.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson,  let  me  at
the outset express gratitude to those who participated  in  the  debate  and
also to those who have expressed kind words. I just want  to  start  off  by
quoting what the hon Nyakane said. He said: ``The need for  the  passage  of
these Bills cannot be overemphasised.'' Those are the words  which  he  used
and I want to agree with those words  fully.  These  are  very  far-reaching
Bills. They take the environmental regime in this country  to  new  heights.
These are also Bills which are dealing with matters which are right  at  the
frontiers of environmental protection.

You know, often people talk about international best practice.  We  are  the
frontrunners of that international best practice. There  isn't  much  better
practice in many other parts of the world which we can really fall back  on.
So indeed this is very bold and it requires a tremendous amount of  courage.
I think it is understandable, as we have seen through  the  debates  in  the
select committee and in the provinces on these Bills, that there would be  a
degree of hesitation and nervousness about these Bills. But  the  protection
of the environment, as we have displayed in  the  nine  and  half  years  of
democracy, does require courage and  where  we  are  able  to  display  that
generally the people of this country have come  out  in  support  of  strong
leadership on the protection of the environment,  and  this  is  what  these
pieces of legislation indeed give us.

Without responding to all the speakers - because much of what has been  said
has been stated and debated in the select committee - I should just  say  to
the hon Bhengu that how he feels about some of the matters  that  he  raised
is understandable. However, as far as my information is concerned -  I  have
been monitoring the process as it went through the select  committee  -  all
proposals that were tabled in the select committee were circulated  and  the
department had given consideration to all of the proposals, whether  or  not
they were asked to do so. But generally the department was always  asked  to
do so by the chairperson.

I am also led to understand that the committee had given due regard  to  the
amendments that were tabled by everybody and in many cases  the  amendments,
including those amendments from KwaZulu-Natal, were  accepted.  I  must  say
that this is not the place to say, ``we tabled an amendment  which  was  not
accepted by the select committee''. That is not a good enough reason not  to
support legislation. It's not a good enough reason. One has got to  look  at
the overall thrust of legislation. In fact, nobody here knows what  I  would
propose as legislation to  Cabinet  and  which  parts  of  that  legislation
Cabinet may not accept. That  does  not  mean  I  am  going  to  reject  the
legislation, because everything that you propose doesn't  get  accepted.  It
happens in all committees and in all collectives as such.

But we were bound to have a situation  with  these  pieces  of  cutting-edge
legislation in which there would  be  vibrant  debate.  I  must  assure  the
Council that, on my part, I had taken  extreme  care  over  a  period  of  a
number of years to discuss and debate these matters at the  executive  level
through the Minmec. In fact, about  two  years  ago  I  convened  a  special
weekend workshop of MECs that took place in the Eastern  Cape  -  I  do  not
remember the exact date now - hosted by the hon  Godongwana.  We  spent  the
entire weekend just talking about the protected areas Bill, because  of  the
far-reaching nature of this. And of course what this Bill does is  to  place
additional responsibilities on all of  us,  because  it  implements  to  the
fullest the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

It places additional responsibilities on the citizens of this  country,  the
private sector, local government, the  provinces  and  national  Government.
There is no way in which we can want to advance the cause  of  environmental
protection without taking on  additional  responsibilities  and  duties  and
everything that goes with it. So it is not a good  enough  argument  to  say
that a Bill would place more responsibility  on  us  and  therefore  we  are
worried about accepting it. Are we only  going  to  pass  legislation  which
doesn't leave us with more responsibility? I think that  is  something  that
has to be taken into account.

On the question of hunting, I must just say to the  hon  Versfeld  that  our
position is absolutely clear. When it comes  to  national  parks,  they  are
incompatible with hunting. But bear in mind that as we  sit  here  there  is
hunting going on in this country. Depending on who you  speak  to  and  from
what point of view, from what religious and  philosophical  point  of  view,
different views would be expressed on  that  particular  matter.  What  this
legislation now  does  is  that  it  empowers  Government  to  regulate  the
question of hunting even beyond national parks, if need be. It  provides  us
with that opportunity. That is what it does. You are  quite  right  that  it
doesn't say that hunting is illegal as such. It disallows it as far  as  the
national parks are concerned, and I can assure you that  the  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism is not going to change the  approach  that
we have taken up to now.

On the question of the definition of sustainable use,  it  is  defined  very
clearly in the  National  Environmental  Management  Act  and  there  is  an
internationally  accepted  concept  of  sustainable  use,  which  was  again
endorsed by  the  global  community  at  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development, and that is that  human  beings  cannot  exist  other  than  by
making use of  natural  resources.  We  breathe  the  air,  we  deplete  the
nutrients in the soil when  we  plant  our  vegetables  and  whatever  other
foodstuffs that we need to plant, and we  use  coal  and  oil  in  order  to
generate energy. We constantly use  and  deplete  the  resources  of  planet
earth.

Sustainable use is a point of view which is now globally accepted, that  is,
that you can use natural resources in a sustainable manner  -  in  a  manner
which will not deny future generations the use of them. And that  is  really
the challenge that we have. I think this House knows very well - because  we
have debated it before - about the  tremendous  challenge  we  have  in  the
sustainable use of our marine resources. It is an  uphill  battle.  We  have
had great difficulty, but we have taken on that challenge and we  have  said
we are not going to take so much fish from the sea that  it  will  deny  the
fish stocks the ability to replenish themselves from season to season.  It's
not an easy thing to do, and politically it is a difficult thing to  do,  as
everybody knows. But it's a challenge that we have taken  on,  because  it's
the right thing to do, it's the moral  thing  to  do  and  our  Constitution
requires us to do that.

I am very pleased that we have also  been  able  to  consider  the  National
Environmental Management: Air  Quality  Bill.  It's  about  time  that  this
country had a decent air quality protection  regime.  The  old  Act  is  one
which is completely outdated, which  really  makes  it  impossible  for  the
authorities to deal with plants and enterprises that have been  spewing  out
unacceptable emissions, particularly  in  urban  areas,  which  affects  the
lives of people very directly.
The hon Nyakane also  raised  the  question  of  intellectual  property  and
indigenous knowledge. The Department of Science and  Technology  is  in  the
process of developing detailed legislation on  the  question  of  indigenous
knowledge,  the  protection  of  indigenous  knowledge  and  the  rights  to
indigenous knowledge. This goes beyond  the  question  of  the  environment,
because it goes right across many fields, particularly the  cultural  field.
And the view of Government is that we need to deal with this very  difficult
area. It is an extremely difficult area to deal with  and  to  actually  put
into legislation, but we should deal with that in a comprehensive manner.  I
can assure you that that is something that is being dealt with.

The hon Gelderblom raised the question of funds following functions.  I  can
assure you, as you know I have done at our Minmec meetings, that it  is  the
policy of national Government that funds must follow functions. That is  the
policy and it's one which will be implemented. You are quite right that  the
legislation itself does not delegate the management  of  landfill  sites  to
provinces. So as we look at  the  legislation  here  provinces  cannot  ask:
Where  is  the  money?  Because  the  legislation  which  the   Council   is
considering today is not delegating anything to provinces. But what it  does
is that it creates the possibility  for  delegation  to  provinces  at  some
point in the future.

And this matter arose because provinces themselves raised this  question  at
the Minmec many years ago. I can remember  very  clearly  that  the  Gauteng
province said  that  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  had
inherited this function somehow but  it  was  better  suited  to  provincial
departments. That is how we began this whole process  of  policy-making  and
decided to move it to Environmental Affairs and  Tourism,  so  that  certain
categories of landfill sites, especially those that do not deal  with  toxic
waste, etc, could possibly be delegated to provinces,  and  that  is  indeed
the vision.

I think you made a useful comment that there should  be  a  good  transition
period between the two departments. Let me assure  you  that  we  will  take
that into account. The director-general is here. He heard your  comments  on
that also and we will ensure that funds do follow  functions.  But  bear  in
mind that provinces themselves have expressed the  view  to  me  that  these
functions  are  underfunded.  So  it  becomes  a  complicated   bureaucratic
exercise but we must take it on. The fact that  it  is  complicated  doesn't
mean that we should run away from it.  Some  of  these  functions  have  not
necessarily been adequately budgeted for and that is partly the  reason  why
this legislation becomes important.

I must express gratitude to Rev Moatshe and his  select  committee  for  the
tremendous amount of work that they have done and the time and  energy  that
they have put into this legislation. And I can assure you  that  we  have  a
wonderful team in the department - the director-general  and  his  team  who
are here. They are a great team. You know many of  my  fellow  environmental
ministers around the world - including those in Europe - always  say  to  me
they wish they had experts  like  we  have  in  this  Government  when  they
interact with this team.

So they have done a tremendous job, but I think had  it  not  been  for  the
select committee we would not have been where we are  today.  So  thank  you
very much, and I can assure you that when future generations look back  they
will indeed say that this select committee was  bold  enough  to  take  far-
reaching  decisions  which  will  leave  a  historical  mark.   Thank   you.
[Applause.]

Debates concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the debate. I  shall  now  put
the question in respect of the third Order. The question is  that  the  Bill
be agreed to. Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  all
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
Are all delegation heads present?

HON MEMBERS: Yes.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: In accordance with  Rule  71  I  shall  first
allow provinces the opportunity to make their own  declaration  of  vote  if
they so wish. Gauteng?

Declarations of vote:

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chair of Chairs, hon Minister and members,  Gauteng  wishes
to state that they do not disagree with or oppose  policies  of  the  Bills,
but because of bureaucratic processes they were not able  to  give  a  final
mandate.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  We  shall  now  proceed  to  voting  on  the
question. KwaZulu-Natal?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: IKwaZulu-Natal iyavumelana nalawa  amathathu.  Ngizowasho.
Iyavumelana ne National Environmental Management Second Amendment  Bill  ...
[Ubuwele-wele.] [KwaZulu-Natal agrees with these three. I  will  name  them.
It agrees with the National Environmental Management Second  Amendment  Bill
... [Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Member Vilakazi, we are going  to  deal  with
the Bills one by one.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Yinye  abangavumelani  nayo,  abayiqhelisayo.  Yileya  ...
[Ubuwele-wele.] [There is one which they  do  not  agree  with,  which  they
reject. It is that ... [Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Qha.  Masivumelane  kuqala  ukuthi  sizobheka
umthethosivivinywa ngamunye ngendlela elandelana ngayo. [No.  Let  us  agree
first that we will consider each Bill individually according  to  the  order
in which they appear.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Ngiyathokoza kakhulu. [I am very happy with that.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, die veerteenwoordigers van  die  Noord-Kaap
op die komitee distansieer hulle van die aantygings  van  KwaZulu-Natal  ten
opsigte van  die  prosedure  wat  die  gekose  komitee  gevolg  het  om  die
voorgestelde  wysigings  van  die  provinsie  te  akkommodeer  of   nie   te
akkommodeer nie. Die Noord-Kaap-afvaardiging bedank die voorsitter  vir  die
leierskap wat hy in die proses getoon het, die wyse waarop  hy  die  besware
hanteer het en die tyd wat hy afgestaan het om  die  voorgestelde  wysigings
van die provinsies, veral KwaZulu-Natal, te hanteer. Dit is prysenswaardig.

Die aantygings van KwaZulu-Natal en nou van Gauteng is aantygings  teen  die
Nasionale Raad van Provinsies se bevoegdheid  om  wetsontwerpe  te  hanteer.
Gelukkig is dit duidelik dat ten opsigte van hierdie saak  en  KwaZulu-Natal
dit eerder 'n  terugwys  is  na  'n  "fight-back"  mentaliteit  wat  in  die
provinsie posgevat het, wat hulle isoleer en ondoeltreffend maak.  Ons  hoop
dat die benadering gou sal verdwyn. Die Noord-Kaap bedank  die  Minister  en
die departement vir hulle betrokkenheid  by  ons  omgewing.  Die  Noord-Kaap
steun die wetgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the representatives of the  Northern  Cape
in the committee  wish  to  distance  themselves  from  the  allegations  by
KwaZulu-Natal with regard to the procedure the select committee followed  to
accommodate or not to accommodate the proposed amendments of  the  province.
The Northern Cape delegation thanks the chairperson for  the  leadership  he
displayed in the process, the manner in which he dealt with  the  objections
and the time that he sacrificed to deal with the proposed amendments of  the
provinces, especially KwaZulu-Natal. This is commendable.

The allegations by KwaZulu-Natal and now by Gauteng are allegations  against
the competence of the National Council of  Provinces  to  deal  with  Bills.
Fortunately it is clear that with regard to this matter  and  KwaZulu-Natal,
it points instead to a  "fight  back"  mentality  that  has  arisen  in  the
province, which isolates them and renders them  ineffective.  We  hope  that
the approach will disappear soon. The Northern Cape thanks the Minister  and
the department for their involvement in our environment. The  Northern  Cape
supports the legislation.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, we  will  then  now  proceed  to
voting.  The  third  Order  of  the  Day  is  the   National   Environmental
Management: Protected Areas Bill that we will be voting on. I  shall  do  so

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Western Cape will support.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Eight provinces have voted in favour and  one
abstained. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms  of  section  65.
[Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mrs J  N  VILAKAZI:  Excuse  me,  Chairperson,  for  KwaZulu-Natal  I  said:
Siyaziqhelanisa. That means we abstain.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Okay,  that  means  seven  provinces  are  in
agreement and two are abstaining.  Nevertheless,  the  Bill  is  agreed  to.
[Applause.]

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

I shall put the question in  respect  of  the  fourth  Bill,  that  is,  the
Environmental Conservation Amendment Bill. The question is that the Bill  be
agreed to. Question put: That the Bill agreed to.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  the
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make declarations of vote if they  so  wish.  We  shall  now  proceed  to
voting on the question. I thought that Gauteng ...

Declaration of vote:

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chair, I just wanted to confirm to the Chair  that  Gauteng
would abstain in respect of all four Bills.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Can we do so as we call Bill by Bill?

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Okay.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  We  shall  now  proceed  to  voting  on  the
question. I shall do so  in  alphabetical  order  per  province.  Delegation
heads must please indicate to the Chair  whether  they  vote  in  favour  or
against or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Okay. Eight provinces have voted  in  favour.
I therefore declare the Bill ... [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: You didn't call the Western Cape.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I didn't call the Western Cape? I  am  sorry.
The Western Cape?

Mr C ACKERMANN: Are you doing so now?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, I am doing so now.

Mr C ACKERMANN: The Western Cape supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Eight  provinces  have  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms of section 65. [Applause.]

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

I shall now put the question in respect of the fifth Order. The question  is
that the Bill be agreed to. Question put: That the Bill be agred to.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  the
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
They are all present? I shall first allow the provinces the  opportunity  to

Constitution. [Applause.]

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Chairperson, with due respect, I think  it  is  important
that a clarification  should  be  made  on  the  declaration  from  Gauteng,
whether they are speaking about bureaucratic processes within  the  province
or they are saying it is a bureaucratic  process  in  the  NCOP  or  in  the
select committee, because it may leave an impression that  our  bureaucratic
processes in the select committee have maybe prejudiced them.

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chair, I think it is within the Gauteng province.

             ELECTION OF PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT REPRESENTATIVES

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, Chairperson. We have to place  these
names before the House, given that the decision is  not  one  which  we  can
take in respect of section 75 or section 76 procedures. It  therefore  would
be a decision taken in terms of section 65  of  the  Constitution.  We  have
previously agreed the composition of the five representatives  to  the  Pan-
African Parliament. We now have names  on  which  the  Houses  must  decide.
Members will  recall  that  our  five  representatives  to  the  Pan-African
Parliament are designated by Parliament. Therefore, both  Houses  decide  on
our representatives.

The reason that the Houses are making the decisions separately is linked  to
the fact that both in our Constitution and our Rules we do not as  yet  have
a provision or procedure for joint decision-making  by  the  Houses  sitting
together. We therefore decide separately on the proposed  nominees.  I  wish
to propose the nominees individually  to  allow  the  provincial  delegation
heads an opportunity to indicate their views on the nominees  by  voting.  I
would put as the first nominee, Dr Frene Ginwala.
Question put: That the nomination be agreed to.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  all
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
Are they all present? In accordance with Rule 71 ... [Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I am afraid the Western Cape is unable  to  take
a decision because they did not have the opportunity of  consulting  on  the
matter. It is not that I am against it. It is just that I  don't  know  what
to do and there has been no consultation. So, I am afraid  I  would  not  be
able to participate and neither would my colleague. I don't think so.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Can I call  upon  the  Chairperson  of
the NCOP?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Really the Chair  should  decide  this  matter.
There have been various meetings at which the procedures have  been  agreed.
Provinces have participated in those meetings. It is a matter today  for  us
to determine the  representatives.  These  are  the  names  we  are  putting
forward and the provinces must indicate a view. Political parties and  Whips
of both Houses have had an opportunity to consider  these  matters,  and  we
are therefore now at a point where we must decide.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We are proceeding. In accordance  with
Rule 71,  I  shall  now  allow  provinces  the  opportunity  to  make  their
declarations of vote, if they so wish. There is none. We shall  now  proceed
to the voting on the question. I shall  do  so  in  alphabetical  order  per
province. Delegation heads must please indicate to the  Chair  whether  they
vote in favour or against or abstain from voting on the  name  of  Dr  Frene
Noshir Ginwala. Can I call upon the Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Besiyinxalenye yesigqibo  ngoko.  Siyalixhasa  igama  lakhe.
[We were part of the decision, so we support her name.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?
Rev M CHABAKU: Re tla reng? Re a e tlatsa. [Do we support? We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Gauteng e a tlatsa. [Gauteng supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Siyavuma. [Supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Limpopo?

Mr M I MAKOELA: Ke laka leo. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mpumalanga?

Ms M P THEMBA: Elethu. [Supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Northern Cape?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Re a dumela. [Supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: North West?

Rev P MOATSHE: Ke ya rona. [Supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?

Mr K D S DURR: We support.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: All nine provinces have voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the nomination of Dr Frene Ginwala agreed to in  terms  of
section 65 of the Constitution.

Nomination accordingly agreed to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Can we proceed, hon Chair?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I nominate  with  great  pleasure,
the hon Mninwa Johannes Mahlangu.

Rev Chabaku, I think that we are all South Africans.  Basotho  le  Batswana.
[Sothos and Tswanas.] We are a rainbow  nation.  We  have  to  accept  that.
Thank you very much.

Hon Chairperson, let me  thank  you  for  putting  the  names  of  the  five
delegates from the South African Parliament to  represent  us  in  the  Pan-
African Parliament. We hope  that  they  will  carry  the  mandate  of  this
Parliament and will represent us honestly  in  the  Pan-African  Parliament.
Thank you very much for putting the names forward. [Applause.]

       CONSIDERATION OF TENTH REPORT OF WORKING GROUP ON AFRICAN UNION

Mr M J MAHLANGU:  Thank  you,  Chairperson,  once  more  for  giving  me  an
opportunity to pronounce myself on the Tenth Report of the Working Group  on
the Pan-African Parliament. Before I do that, do allow me an opportunity  to
thank the Chairperson of  the  NCOP,  who  nominated  me  to  represent  the
Council and the Parliament of South Africa in  the  Pan-African  Parliament,
and furthermore, to thank you all  -  all  provinces  and  members  of  this
Council - for supporting my name so that I should go and  represent  you  in
the Pan-African Parliament. I wish to thank you dearly. [Applause.]

Chairperson, allow me also to thank you and every one  of  the  members  for
the fact that you actually voted for all the names of the  people  who  will
be representing the South African Parliament at the Pan-African  Parliament.
I think it's a wonderful achievement and I also wish to  congratulate  those
members from the National Assembly who will be going  together  with  me  to
represent you at the Pan-African Parliament. I once more wish to  thank  you
as members of the Council.

Having said that, you would realise that we have followed all  the  criteria
set out in the protocol. When I tabled the eighth and the ninth  reports  in
this House, and when I repeatedly - I think twice - briefed the  members  of
the Council, I did indicate what would be the criteria  for  electing  these
members to  represent  the  South  African  Parliament  at  the  Pan-African
Parliament. One of those criteria was that  the  members  must  reflect  our
political diversity. I am sure you have realised the five members  that  are
elected do reflect the political diversity. You are  aware  that  there  are
three members that come from the ruling party and two that come  from  other
political parties. If I am not mistaken, Dr Geldenhuys comes  from  the  New
NP and Prof Hariett Ngubane comes from the IFP. So, we have tried  and  this
is what you have done. You have reflected the requirements of the  protocol,
that we should have that political diversity represented at the  Pan-African
Parliament.

The other criterion which is quite important, and which is required  by  the
protocol itself, is that at least one  of  the  five  members  should  be  a
woman. South Africa has actually set a record, as  we  have  agreed  in  our
Parliament that out of the five members of the  delegation,  three  will  be
women. We have satisfied that agreement. We have  three  women  amongst  the
five members of the delegation that will represent  us.  I  think  that's  a
great achievement. I would want to see what other parliaments are  going  to
do. I think we are going to be the first  one  to  have  three  women  in  a
delegation of five. But let's wait and see when we go there.

Having said that ...

Mr P A MATTHEE: That makes your election even more impressive.

Mr M J MAHLANGU: Is that so? Let me indicate that these  members  that  have
been elected today will have to join the Working Group on the African  Union
forthwith so that they begin to acquaint themselves with all the  work  that
has been done, and  the  discussions  which  have  been  undertaken  by  the
Working Group on the African Union. Secondly, they will have to have  access
to all the documents, not just those which served before the working  group,
but also the protocol itself, so that  they  can  begin  to  do  some  work,
preparing for our participation in the inauguration session in  Addis  Ababa
next year.

Let me come to the report itself, just to make  one  or  two  comments.  You
will remember that I said to you in this House that the inauguration of  the
Pan-African Parliament would take place late in January. The suggestion  was
that it would be the third week of January. There has been a change and  the
announcement has been made. The inauguration of the  Pan-African  Parliament
will only take place in March 2004.  And  the  venue,  I  repeat,  is  Addis
Ababa, in Ethiopia.

The following issues are being discussed by the working group and they  have
not been finalised. Firstly, there is the issue  of  the  draft  oath.  What
should the oath look like? When the people take the oath in an  inauguration
session in March, all of them will have to take the oath. We are  discussing
a draft and other parliaments are also discussing it.  At  the  end  of  the
day, we will have to agree on a common oath that all  of  us  are  going  to
take when we come to the Pan-African Parliament.

The second issue that we are discussing is that of  the  theme.  What  theme
are we going to debate when we come to the Pan-African Parliament? We  as  a
Parliament need to know it, particularly  what  it  will  be  at  its  first
sitting. We will have to think and say what it is that we want to  tell  the
African people about  the  Pan-African  Parliament  itself.  The  discussion
around that during this morning's session in  the  working  group  was  that
perhaps we should not be specific on the theme at  the  present  moment.  We
would like to look  at  the  broad  vision  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament
itself, so that people begin to grasp why we have  formed  this  Pan-African
Parliament and what its vision is. Broadly,  people  will  begin  to  debate
that, but it will be in a very broad sense. We are not going  to  draft  the
vision and say that this is the vision. But the theme  will  revolve  around
the vision of the Pan-African Parliament itself.

The other issue which is still being considered, is the types of  committees
that we would like to set up in the Pan-African Parliament. The  very  first
meeting will have to come out with a few committees that will deal with  the
issues of the Pan-African Parliament. First and foremost we  would  like  to
look at, for example, the business committee that  will  take  care  of  the
business of the Pan-African Parliament. We would like  to  come  up  with  a
committee which would perhaps be the rules committee, which  will  begin  to
draft the rules of the Pan-African Parliament, so that we can be in  such  a
position that when we debate, we do it according to the rules, and  when  we
take decisions, we are guided by the rules as to how we take decisions,  and
many other related matters.

But those  committees  aside,  the  Pan-African  Parliament  will  begin  to
reflect on which other portfolio committees  it  would  like  to  establish,
such as a human rights portfolio committee perhaps, or a  gender  committee.
I am just putting those as an idea. But we will have  to  reflect  on  which
other committees we would like to establish when we  go  there,  because  we
will need these committees to do some work, once the Pan-African  Parliament
has adjourned.

 The last issue that I would like to indicate, and which the  working  group
is dealing with, is the resolution of the joint committee which we  need  to
establish in Parliament. I reported  to  you,  when  I  deliberated  on  the
eighth and the ninth reports,  that  we  would  like  to  establish  such  a
committee. The committee that we would like to establish would  be  a  joint
one, and would actually look at  how  we  will  receive  mandates  from  our
parliaments, and what the mechanisms of accountability  and  reporting  back
to our parliaments could be. So, that committee will be established and  the
members will then, together  with  the  committee,  sit  down,  discuss  and
reflect upon the issues.

We have not finalised all the issues that I have just  reported  on  to  the
Council. They are before the working group  and  we  will  deal  with  these
issues. I suspect that the working  group  might  be  called  earlier.  They
might even want to meet once or twice during the recess because there is  an
enormous amount of work that they have  to  do  and  they  have  to  prepare
themselves for the inauguration session in March.

Having said that, I want to end by saying that all five members,  if  I  may
take this opportunity, will be dedicated and loyal, and will work with  very
great enthusiasm to represent our country  and  our  Parliament.  We  commit
ourselves to come back to our Parliament, to report  and  share  ideas  with
you. We will remember that when we  go  there,  it's  a  matter  of  sharing
ideas. It's a continental organisation where we will debate issues and  come
back and give feedback to our parliaments.

I wish to take this opportunity to say thank you  very  much.  I  move  that
this Council should adopt the tenth report. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  all
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.


In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make declarations of vote, if they so wish.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order: Amongst  the  Whippery
we also agreed that parties, if they wished, could contribute here.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, this is dealt with  in  terms  of
section 65 of the Constitution. Whatever the Whips have decided, the  ruling
and the rule is that we have to follow the  Constitution  of  this  country,
namely section 65, in dealing with the matter. It's not a party  matter.  It
is a matter that has to be dealt with in terms of  section  65.  I  am  sure
that we are not going to argue about that, Mr Van Niekerk. Can we proceed?

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow the provinces to make  their
declarations of vote, if they so wish. We shall now proceed  to  the  voting
on the question.  We  shall  do  so  in  alphabetical  order  per  province.
Delegation heads should please indicate to the Chair whether  they  vote  in
favour or against or abstain from the voting. Eastern Cape?

         Amendment Bill [B  41B  -  2003]  (National  Assembly  -  sec  75),
         referred to it, reports that it has agreed to the Bill.


         The Committee, however, wishes to report further, as follows:


         The Committee, during the course of its deliberations on the  Bill,
         raised  a  number  of  questions  regarding  certain  clauses  and,
         because of time restraints, requests the Department to report  back
         to this Committee on these issues as early as possible  during  the
         2004  session  of  Parliament,  and  where  necessary   to   submit
         appropriate legislative proposals:


         (1)     Clause 4 of the Bill amends  section  60  of  the  Criminal
              Procedure  Act,  1977  (Act  No.  51  of  1977),  by  obliging
              presiding officers to take a pre-trial  services  report  into
              account during bail proceedings if such a report is available.
               The purpose of a pre-trial services report is to  assist  the
              court in making a decision regarding the release of  a  person
              on bail.  The Committee notes the  request  of  the  Portfolio
              Committee on Justice and  Constitutional  Development  in  its
              report on the  Bill  that  the  Department  must  undertake  a
              feasibility study of  rolling  out  the  existing  four  pilot
              projects sites relating to pre-trial services with the view to
              eventually having comprehensive pre-trial  services  available
              at all courts in the country.   This  Committee  requests  the
              Department, during this feasibility study, to also  look  into
              the linkages between the pre-trial services  project  and  the
              Aphis Project and, in the process thereof, to undertake a cost
              benefit analysis  of  both  projects  to  ensure  that  scarce
              resources will not be inappropriately utilised if there  is  a
              duplication of processes or if the one  project  seems  to  be
              better placed than the other to  achieve  the  goals  set  out
              above.


         (2)       Clause   5   deals   with   problems   surrounding    the
              interpretation of section 276 of the Criminal  Procedure  Act,
              1977.   While  endorsing  the  amendment  in  principle,   the
              Committee requests the Department to  consider  and  submit  a
              minor amendment to the proviso contained in the clause as soon
              as circumstances permit, to the effect that a  court  may  not
              impose the punishments referred to in the said section 276  if
              the court is obliged to  impose  a  sentence  contemplated  in
              section 51(1) or (2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,  1997,
              and not if the court intends to impose such a sentence, as the
              proviso is currently worded.


         (3)     Clause 6 of the Bill entitles victims of crime  to  have  a
              say when the accused person  in  question  is  considered  for
              parole or correctional supervision by a Parole  Board.   While
              welcoming a provision of this nature, the Committee raises the
              following questions:
              *   Why is this right only limited to victims of crime who are
                present when sentence is imposed?


              *   Should a mechanism not be put in place in the  legislation
                that  will  ensure  the  confidentiality   surrounding   the
                identity and whereabouts of any victim who supplies  his  or
                her name and address?


              The Committee requests the Department to take these issues  up
              with the Department of Correctional Services  and  to  address
              them by way of appropriate legislative proposals which must be
              submitted to Parliament at  the  first  available  opportunity
              during the 2004 session of Parliament.  The following  wording
              could possibly be considered as a basis for this purpose:


                "(e)The directives contemplated in this subsection -
                    (i)     must provide for prescripts to ensure that  the
                           identity and whereabouts of  any  complainant  or
                           relative,  as  the  case   may   be,   are   kept
                           confidential;  and
                    (ii)    may provide for prescripts on how a complainant
                           or relative may be informed of his or  her  right
                           as contemplated in this section if he or she  was
                           not in court when the court sentenced the  person
                           in question.".


              Pending the enactment of amending  legislation  to  deal  with
              confidentiality of victims, the Department, when  implementing
              this legislation, must put administrative measures in place to
              ensure that confidentiality is maintained.


         (4)     Clause 11 deals with provisions in the Divorce  Act,  1979,
              revolving around the sharing of pension benefits  on  divorce.
              The Committee  requests  the  Department  to  investigate  the
              possibility of allowing the spouse who is not a  member  of  a
              pension fund to gain access to her or his share of the pension
              benefit at the time of divorce and not only when  the  pension
              benefits eventually accrue to the spouse who is  a  member  of
              the fund.


         (5)      Clause  25  is  an  empowering  provision,  allowing   the
              Minister for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,  when
              making  regulations,  to  criminalise  any  act  or   omission
              contemplated  in  the  regulations  dealing  with  manuals  as
              contemplated in the Promotion of Access  to  Information  Act,
              2000.  The Committee, while recognising the fact that numerous
              Acts of Parliament and subordinate legislation already empower
              members of the Executive to make regulations which criminalise
              various acts or omissions,  raised  a  concern  regarding  the
              desirability of creating  offences  in  terms  of  subordinate
              legislation, which is not easily accessible to members of  the
              public.  The Committee consequently requests the Department of
              Justice and Constitutional Development, or possibly the  South
              African Law Reform Commission, to  initiate  an  investigation
              into the desirability and even the  constitutionality  of  all
              provisions of this nature on the Statute Book.
         Report to be considered.
