Mr J DURAND: Mevrou die Speaker,  hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Huis namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel dat  die  Huis
die sperdatum vir motorlisensies bespreek. [Madam  Speaker,  I  hereby  give
notice that I shall move on behalf of the New NP at the next sitting of  the

                     OLYMPIC TORCH TO COME TO CAPE TOWN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with pride that the Olympic torch is coming to  Cape  Town  for
       the first time with the 2004 Olympic Games and that this is also  the
       first time that the torch will be carried to the African continent;


  (2) further notes that this will give selected South  Africans  from  all
       walks of life an opportunity to carry the sacred flame, which will be
       carried by almost  10 000  people  during  the  65-day  international
       relay; and


  (3) believes that this is a great honour for South Africa.

Agreed to.

                              CRICKET WORLD CUP

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) thanks the South African team for participating in the Cricket  World
       Cup competition and, although they have not progressed to  the  Super
       Sixes, for doing their best for our country;


  (2) extends its congratulations to the teams  who  went  through  to  the
       second round of the competition; and


  (3) thanks all the visiting spectators for their support and  hopes  that
       they will have a good time in our friendly country.

[Applause.]

Agreed to.

The SPEAKER: We will now proceed to members' statements.  Hon  members,  you
are reminded that each statement  made  will  not  exceed  one  and  a  half
minutes.

          EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR CONVERSION OF DRIVERS' LICENCES

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms H F MATLANYANE (ANC): Madam Speaker,  I  would  like  to  welcome  Acting
Minister of Transport, Comrade Jeff Radebe's  announcement  on  Friday  that
there would be a two-months extension on the deadline for the conversion  of
drivers' licences. I believe this was a wise course  of  action,  given  the
possibility of the danger of serious disturbances as frustrations built  up.


However, the postponement must not be misinterpreted to  be  giving  way  to
lawlessness. I  hope  the  message  is  clear:  Government  means  business.
Government cannot deliver if the public does not co-operate. We all need  to
be responsible citizens. The build-up of  queues  was  caused,  essentially,
not by Government inefficiencies, but by hundreds of  thousands  of  members
of the public failing to convert their licences, despite the  fact  that  we
all had five years to do so.

Obviously, Government must work continuously to improve the efficiencies  of
services at testing centres, but above all, we urge all those who  have  not
yet converted their drivers' licences to use this two-month grace period  to
do the right thing. I thank you. [Applause.]

                   TELKOM'S LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr R J HEINE (DP): Madam Speaker, it is indeed a  landmark  in  our  history
today to see the listing of Telkom on the stock  exchanges  in  Johannesburg
and New York. For the first time since the  ANC  became  the  Government,  a
public listing of a parastatal has taken place.

We want  to  congratulate  Government  on  this  bold  step.  Despite  stern
opposition from some quarters, including  members  of  their  own  alliance,
they stood their ground.  [Interjections.]  This  is  about  empowering  the
people, and not only a black elite. The DA has been  in  support  of  public
participation all along. Notwithstanding the depressed market  conditions  -
and much could be argued about the timing of the listing - we maintain  that
this is absolutely the way to go.

The focus and the  energy  that  has  been  directed  at  a  successful  IPO
(Independent Producers' Organisation) must  now  be  turned  to  encouraging
competition where  previously  the  state  had  a  monopoly.  The  licensing
arrangement for the second network must therefore be  finalised  in  a  fair
and transparent way, and it must  be  done  soon.  The  real  benefits  from
privatisation come not just from selling  off  assets,  but  from  increased
competition in the market and a wider choice for the consumer.

We would like to appeal to the  Minister  for  Public  Enterprises  and  his
Cabinet  colleagues  to  follow  this  process  through,  and  not   to   be
sidetracked by opponents of privatisation. The announcement about  Eskom  is
the first step and Transnet, Eskom and other state enterprises  must  follow
soon. I thank you. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

                  REBUILDING OF HOUSES DESTROYED IN FLOODS

                            (Members' Statements)

Mr B M DOUGLAS (IFP): Madam Speaker, the community of Ga-Mmotle  Village  in
Moretele, North of Pretoria, voluntarily came together last year to  rebuild
houses that were destroyed by floods in 1998. After realising that it  would
take some time for the RDP housing project to  rebuild  their  houses,  they
took it upon themselves to do the job as quickly as possible.

Their efforts and commitment have paid off as they  have  managed  to  build
approximately 121 houses of good quality that are double  the  size  of  the
previous RDP houses, with the same R16 000 housing  allowance  allocated  to
each recipient.

What is good  about  the  housing  project  is  the  active  involvement  of
beneficiaries. The fact that the  project  is  regularly  audited  minimises
chances of  fraud,  as  compared  to  the  RDP  projects.  Also,  those  who
volunteer to build are paid a sum of money for every house completed.

Such housing projects should  be  applauded  and  encouraged,  as  they  are
setting a good example of what our communities can achieve  when  they  join
hands in line with the Government's policy  of  Vukuzenzele  and  the  IFP's
policy of self-reliance. I thank you.

Ms Z A KOTA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the people of Ga-Mmotle Village  in  North
West have taken up the spirit of Letsema in a serious  and  meaningful  way.
In 1998 a flood washed away  154  dwellings  from  this  village,  and  left
families without shelter.  North  West's  government  allocated  about  R2,5
million to replace these dwellings.
Through their dedication, the Ga-Mmotle Villagers have prevented  the  abuse
of their subsidy by rebuilding their houses. In  a  volunteer  campaign  121
houses have been built and have already been handed over to  their  rightful
owners. After completing each house, the volunteer builders were given  R250
as part of job creation and incentives. These houses are 42  square  metres,
which is bigger than the normal 30 square metre RDP houses. The  good  thing
is that villagers had a say in how these houses should be  built,  and  they
used their own hands to make their houses exactly as they wanted them.  They
call upon communities to emulate this good example.

I want to congratulate, in particular, Regina  Mkonyane,  who  has  led  120
volunteers to victory, and her team, the housing committee, as well  as  the
Thabo Housing NGO. We call upon the Department of  Housing  to  ensure  that
these houses do pass the test in terms of  norms  and  standards,  and  call
upon other departments to assist the community in  terms  of  infrastructure
such as water, electricity and sanitation. This is in  line  with  the  IDP.
Phambili  [forward]  with  the  spirits  of  volunteers   and   Vukuzenzele,
phambili! [forward!]

Hon MEMBERS: Phambili! [forward!]
[Applause.]

                 SA GOVERNMENT'S POSITION REGARDING ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr B L GELDENHUYS (New NP): Madam Speaker, there  is  a  well-known  saying:
Never say never, and especially in politics. One should never say  never.  I
was, therefore, very surprised to hear the hon Minister of  Foreign  Affairs
say on national television that the Government of South  Africa  will  never
criticise Zimbabwe as long as the ANC is in power, because  Zimbabwe  has  a
democratically elected government.

First of all, Zimbabwe does not have a  democratically  elected  government.
[Interjections.] A rigged election will never pass the test of a  democracy.
[Interjections.] Secondly, if the South African Government is serious  about
implementing the objectives of the Constitutive Act of  the  African  Union,
and if they are serious about honouring the Nepad declaration  on  democracy
and political governance, then  they  must  be  prepared  to  criticise  the
government of Zimbabwe. [Interjections.]

Thus far the government of  Zimbabwe,  under  the  leadership  of  President
Mugabe, has already transgressed seven of the 14 objectives of  the  AU,  as
outlined in  the  Constitutive  Act.  It  has  already  abandoned  the  very
important principles of good governance, democracy,  the  rule  of  law  and
press  freedom,  as  required  by  the  Nepad  document.   [Time   expired.]
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

                                GANG VIOLENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms A VAN WYK (UDM): Madam Speaker, a section  of  our  population  is  being
held hostage by gangs. Every week they  witness  innocent  bystanders  being
killed in the crossfire between rival gangs. Their lives are  dominated  and
controlled by gangs and their activities. This section of our nation is  not
free yet. They have not benefited from a better life and a democracy.

The Minister of Safety and  Security  made  a  statement  during  the  JCPS-
briefing, namely that concentrated actions on gang  violence  have  resulted
in the lowering or stabilising of violent crimes.  What  these  concentrated
actions are, is entirely unclear. We have not  seen  any  such  concentrated
actions, neither have the communities living in  places  such  as  Manenberg
benefited from them.

For years now,  the  UDM  has  been  calling  for  a  multidisciplinary  and
integrated approach to  deal  with  gangs,  organised  crime  and  the  drug
trafficking that provide the bulk of their finances. It is necessary  for  a
criminal justice response to be combined with social  upliftment.  It  means
better  and  more  police  and  prosecution  work,  as   well   as   drastic
improvements in social infrastructure. Not only do we  need  to  take  these
criminals off the street, but Government must turn  these  communities  into
places where youth at risk are provided with opportunities  and  facilities,
other than gang life.

As it stands, Government is losing the war  against  gangs.  Not  only  does
Government fail  to  assist  communities  in  reclaiming  the  streets,  but
Government is also failing in preventing gangs  from  expanding  their  turf
into new areas such as Sea Point. The  essence  of  the  zero  tolerance  or
broken-window approach is to prevent crime from spreading  into  new  areas.
The moment that crime, even if  it  is  the  petty  vandalism  of  a  broken
window, goes unpunished by Government, criminals start  taking  over.  [Time
expired.]

                         BLACK CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr K A MOLOTO (ANC): Madam Speaker, in the past  black  people  were  denied
opportunities  in  the  accounting  field.  In  view  of  this   denial   of
opportunities under successive apartheid governments, the ANC is pleased  to
know that 25 black trainees achieved a 1,2%  pass  rate  in  the  qualifying
examination for chartered accountants. This is a clear indication  that  all
South Africans, regardless of their racial background, are capable if  given
an opportunity. We need to emphasise that  these  numbers  are  not  enough.
However,  we  are  encouraged  to  learn  the  SA  Institute  of   Chartered
Accountants  has  committed  itself  to  increasing  the  number  of   black
chartered accountants in the country.

South Africa needs the  services  of  chartered  accountants  to  strengthen
financial management in the private and public sectors. We call  upon  young
people, especially  from  the  historically  disadvantaged  communities,  to
seize the opportunities  created  by  the  democratic  Government,  to  make
inroads  into  career  paths  which  they  were  denied  by  the   apartheid
government. We further call on all stakeholders, business in particular,  to
provide training for black youth to  become  future  chartered  accountants.
Thank you.
                      A POLICY FOR SALE OF STATE ASSETS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ (FA): Madam Speaker, the sale of state  properties  by  the
members of the ANC elite and their  close  relatives  is  questionable.  Any
property which is sold to a  government  insider  without  a  proper  tender
process being followed has  the  potential  to  defraud  the  taxpayer,  and
particular care must be taken to avoid this.

Pressure from the DA with regard to the sale of a house  in  Port  Elizabeth
to the President's wife ensured that Mrs Mbeki did not resell this house  at
a profit. Instead, she sold the house back to the  state  at  no  profit  to
herself, and only a minor cost to the taxpayer.

But why did this situation  even  arise?  Was  any  undue  pressure  put  on
officials to approve this sale without following the public tender  process,
and who applied the pressure? Certainly the transfer cost should  have  been
recovered. The Federal Alliance believes it is vital  to  draw  up  a  clear
policy regarding the sale of state assets to  politicians,  public  servants
and their family or friends. This will avoid any hint  of  corruption  in  a
sphere where questionable deals are taking place.

The Federal alliance calls on Government to give  a  clear  answer  to  this
statement. Thank you.

                             FUNDING OF SCHOOLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss S RAJBALLY (MF): Madam Speaker, the MF  calls  on  the  House  and  the
Minister of Education to discuss and reconsider the formula for  funding  of
schools.

Black African children attending  former  House  of  Delegates  schools  are
classed into  an  artificially  advantaged  sector  to  their  disadvantage.
Tariffs of school fees and other means to be met are barely manageable.

Further, the employment of teachers according to the Employment Equity  Plan
has arisen as a major issue.  An  underemployment  of  Indians,  whites  and
coloureds by 5692 is estimated within the plan of the  Education  department
for 2000-2005. The MF support attaining equity,  but  not  at  the  cost  of
sidelining the  minorities.  We  are  a  rainbow  nation.  We  are  here  to
represent all South Africans, no matter what colour  or  creed.  Thank  you,
Madam Speaker.

                         PALESTINE-ISRAELI CONFLICT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M RAMGOBIN (ANC): Madam Speaker, seven  people  were  killed  as  Israeli
tanks raided two refugee camps in  Gaza  Strip  on  Sunday,  3  March  2003.
Israeli troops entered the Nusseirat and El Bureij refugee camps  on  Sunday
morning, blowing up two houses in El Bureij camp according to witnesses.  At
least two of the dead, a 14-year-old boy who was shot and a  pregnant  woman
whose house collapsed on top of her,  were  civilians.  The  mounting  death
toll in both Gaza and West Bank serves only  to  deepen  the  anger  of  the
Palestinians and escalates the levels of  violence  at  a  time  when  Prime
Minister Sharon and his cabinet should be  making  every  effort  to  resume
peace talks with the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.

While we are reservedly  condemning  suicide  bombings  and  other  acts  of
violence that deliberately target noncombatant civilians, the  intransigence
of the Sharon government, which refuses to negotiate  or  even  explore  the
possibilities of talks with the Palestinian authorities, has compounded  the
situation and made the region more volatile.

We welcome the Palestinian delegation  which  is  visiting  our  country  to
study our peaceful transition  to  democracy,  and  our  Constitution  which
protects human rights. This  reflects  the  commitment  of  the  Palestinian
people to peace, and is consistent with  the  thousands  of  South  Africans
that marched in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg calling for  world  peace
and condemning US military aggression against  the  people  of  Iraq.  Thank
you.
                                  ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C W EGLIN (DP): Madam Speaker, I have no doubt  that  millions  of  South
Africans would have been shocked  to  hear  Foreign  Affairs  minister  Zuma
saying that an ANC Government would never condemn the Zanu-PF government  of
Zimbabwe.

Because, in doing so she has damaged South Africa's  stature  as  a  country
committed to democracy, human rights and rule of  law.  She  has  undermined
South Africa's efforts to attract foreign investment, and she has  shed  the
pretence of objectivity, and with  this  the  ability  of  South  Africa  to
influence events in Zimbabwe to the benefit of the region as a whole.

By putting the ANC Government firmly in the Zanu-PF camp, the  Minister  has
ensured that the  Government  will  be  seen  to  be  sharing  some  of  the
responsibility for the grossly undemocratic actions of the  Zanu-PF  regime,
or, at the very least, giving that regime  the  South  African  Government's
silent consent.

Heaven  help  Nepad  when  our  Government,  a  leading  promoter  of   that
programmme, is seen  to  be  condoning  the  violation  of  the  very  Nepad
principles in the case of Zimbabwe. The Government must stop treating  Nepad
as if it were an  old-pals  backslapping  club.  Instead,  treat  it  as  an
instrument of promoting and developing through adherence to  the  principles
of democracy, good governance, human rights and sound economic management.

                      HORIZONTAL PROMOTION OF EDUCATORS

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Madam  Speaker,  I  am  on  horizontal  promotion  of
educators.

Our education system has been robbed of dire skills  in  maths  and  science
over a long period of time. This trend has been caused by maths and  science
educators looking for more lucrative jobs in the private  sector,  depriving
our school system of an essential national economic priority.

Another factor worsening the situation has been the  loss  of  educators  to
promotion posts, which means more accent  on  management  than  teaching  in
class. The new vision to introduce horizontal promotion to  ensure  constant
active teaching has come in the nick of  time  when  there  is  a  drive  to
nurture skills for natural sciences and information technology.  We  believe
that the world, which has been narrowed down to a powerful  global  village,
will also accommodate our country as a developing entity.

The introduction of the performance-based annual increases may not  be  good
news to the teacher union movement, but it will also inculcate  a  sense  of
duty to most educators. Performance-based incentives  have  become  part  of
the competitive corporate world, and the introduction of such in  the  civil
service will conscientise educators that the civil service is also  a  place
of survival. Therefore, working hard pays. Thank you.

                        MINIMUM WAGE FOR FARMWORKERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M J  G  MZONDEKI  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  the  Government,  through  the
Department of Labour, will make 1200 inspectors  available  to  ensure  that
farmers comply with the new minimum  wage  for  farmworkers.  This  sectoral
determination is taken to protect about 1,2 million  vulnerable  farmworkers
countrywide, most of whom used to be paid in kind in the form  of  maize  on
the maize farms, or wine on the Cape winelands.

We want to praise the Minister for taking these  bold  steps  to  end  these
practices on farms. The Minister further warned farmers who fail  to  comply
with the new minimum wages, set at R800, 00  per  month  for  permanent  and
temporary  workers  in  urban  areas  and  R650,  00  per  month  for  rural
farmworkers, will be prosecuted. This follows  the  recent  announcement  by
the Minister of  making  it  compulsory  for  all  domestic  workers  to  be
registered and to contribute to the Unemployment Insurance Fund by  1  April
2003.

The Minister, however, has invited all farmers that have  economic  problems
to apply for economic exemption. I thank you.

                                 DA ALLIANCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C B HERANDIEN (Nuwe NP): Speaker,  die  Nuwe  Nasionale  Party  het  met
belangstelling kennis geneem van die verwikkelinge binne die DP-DA  geledere
in  die  Wes-Kaap.  By  die   onlangse   provinsiale   leiersverkiesing   in
Stellenbosch is mnr Theuns Botha, 'n oud NNP-lid, tot DA-leier in  die  Wes-
Kaap verkies.

Die NP glo dat dit vir die ou  DP-DA  Prog-komponent,  soos  die  agb  Colin
Eglin, Ken Andrews, James Selfe, Helen Zille, 'n bitter pil moet wees om  te
sluk, veral omdat dit so veelseggend is dat weer  eens  'n  oud-NNP-lid  nou
die DA-leisels in die Wes-Kaap oorgeneem het.

Die NP glo ook dat dit die DP-DA twee keer sal laat dink oor die  beweegrede
agter sommige NNP-lede se besluit om in die DA agter  te  bly,  en  alhoewel
die DA glo die besluit was DA-lojaliteit-gebasseerd,  is  dit  vir  die  NNP
baie duidelik waar hierdie lede se lojaliteit eintlik is.

Die NP wil die DP-DA graag herinner aan die  Trojaanse  perd,  en  vind  dit
ironies dat die DP-DA, wat destyds gehoop het dat hulle die NNP sou  insluk,
nou hulle eie medisyne moet sluk. Die agb leier van die opposisie, mnr  Tony
Leon, sal wys wees as hy met een oog oop slaap.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Speaker, the NNP have taken note with great  interest  of
the complications within the DP-DA ranks in the Western Cape. At the  recent
provincial leadership election held in  Stellenbosch,  Mr  Theuns  Botha,  a
former NNP member, was elected as DA leader in the Western Cape.

The NNP believes that for the former DP-DA Prog component, such as  the  hon
Colin Eglin, Ken Andrews, James Selfe, Helen Zille, this has to be a  bitter
pill to swallow, especially because it is so significant that a  former  NNP
member has now yet again taken over the DA reigns in the Western Cape.

The NNP also believes that this will make the DP-DA think  twice  about  the
motive behind some of the NNP members' decision to remain  in  the  DA,  and
although the DA believes the decision  was  DA  loyalty-based,  it  is  very
clear to the NNP where these members' loyalty actually lies.

The NNP would like to remind the DP-DA of the Trojan  horse,  and  finds  it
ironic that the DP-DA, that previously hoped that they would swallow up  the
NNP, now have to take their own medicine. The hon leader of the  Opposition,
Mr Tony Leon, would be wise to sleep with one eye open.]

                            MINISTERS' RESPONSES

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, so as to avoid  confusion,  may  I
ask for your ruling. There were two interventions, and two  separate  topics
were raised. Is it in order for me to use this  occasion  to  reply  to  two
different topics?

The SPEAKER: Address yourself to one topic. When  you  have  completed,  you
will have your two minutes, and then you can start the next one.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you, that is very kind of you. I  knew  you
were a gentle lady. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: I am going by the Rules, Minister Asmal!

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I am sure there is no discretion used there.

                             FUNDING OF SCHOOLS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: In relation to the hon  Rajbally's  intervention,
I reject the idea that there is any form of discrimination against  Indians,
whites and coloureds as far as the recruitment of teachers is concerned.  It
is inflammatory in the extreme to use the privileges of this House to  refer
to such matters.

The appointments are done in an  open  fashion,  and  the  appointments  are
necessary, because we  need  to  place  teachers  in  particular  areas  and
schools  where  their  skills,  their  aptitude  and  their   insights   are
necessary. I think it is important that we should understand that.

It is quite clear that, throughout South Africa, there are people who  don't
wish to work in townships and rural areas. I think we need  to  correct  the
assumption that there is discrimination.

When I was a schoolteacher, we were - to use an unhappy word -  deployed  by
the provincial administration. We had to work where we were  sent.  This  is
totally different now. Now you can apply and have a choice  and  preference,
and this creates a large number of difficulties.

In relation to the fees in  the  funding  of  schools,  you  may  know,  hon
Rajbally, that yesterday we released a major document about the  funding  of
schools and in there, we effectively say that in the  poorest  of  the  poor
schools, there should be no fee  payment  of  any  kind.  The  state  should
ensure that there is a national fund or national allocation which will  meet
the needs of the students in the poorest areas, as they would  meet  in  the
richer areas. This is open for discussion, and I hope we will have a  debate
in Parliament, as the New NP asked in their motion last week.

So, in relation to these matters, equity has not resulted in  discriminatory
practices in our country. On the contrary, many schools refuse  to  use  the
principles underlying the Employment Equity Act in the  appointment  of  the
teachers.

The SPEAKER: We now proceed to your second answer.

                      HORIZONTAL PROMOTION OF EDUCATORS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: The hon  member  raised  the  issue  of  what  is
called a `horizontal promotion'. Well, I  am  not  so  sure  whether  I  can
distinguish between the horizontal and the vertical, although I do not  like
teachers to be involved in vertical exercises.

The issue is that the Council of  Education  Ministers  has  announced  that
there will  be  promotion  for  teachers  regardless  of  whether  they  are
involved in administrative work in schools.  This  is  a  happy  conclusion,
because teachers were excluded from the normal incremental payments  of  the
Public Service. That is why it has been announced now, because  we  are  now
able to treat teachers separately and differently from the Public Service.

Incentives are vital in this area, and as I said to this House  some  months
ago in my budget speech, we must work on the  basis  of  incentives  to  get
teachers to rural  schools  and  township  schools,  not  because  they  are
hardship schools - we must reject the idea that there are  hardship  schools
since there is enormous performance, wonderful performance taking  place  in
many of the schools like in Phola Park and Ivory Park. So,  we  must  reject
this idea that only in the sylvan groves at the foothills of Table  Mountain
or in Durban North are there schools that are performing very well.

The important thing is that we want mathematics and science teachers  to  be
given incentives. This is a matter under  discussion  with  the  unions.  We
hope that there is an agreement very soon on this.

We are also using the incentives of the National  Financial  Aid  Scheme  to
allocate R50 million to people who choose teaching as  a  first  profession,
to capture the young people, to capture  their  enthusiasm  and  to  capture
their possible contribution to the teaching  profession.  We  hope  the  R50
million will be used up this year, and we will increase the R50  million  to
get more younger teachers into the profession.

                                GANG VIOLENCE

                            (Minister's response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, I  am  rather  surprised
at the remarks the hon Annelizé Van  Wyk  has  made.  I  am  sure  that  she
herself is surprised that she made that observation. [Laughter.]

She should know that  we  have  mounted  operations  in  the  past  to  deal
precisely with the matter that she is raising. The successes we have  scored
have translated, amongst others, into the fact that we have  some  of  these
gangster leaders behind bars. She is aware of this.

She is also aware that our crime-combating strategy has indeed dealt with  a
lot of crime - serious and  violent  crime.  We  have  scored  the  kind  of
successes that I have referred to.

What is going to happen is that  tomorrow  there  is  going  to  be  further
interaction between the portfolio committee and myself. I  want  to  discuss
this and other matters that relate to our crime-combating strategy  but,  as
I said, it is true that we are not going to be able  to  completely  destroy
crime in South Africa. There is no situation anywhere  in  the  world  where
this has been achieved.

What we have been able to do to date is that  we  have  indeed  reduced  the
levels of crime in South Africa, and we are continuing  to  ensure  that  we
bring about stability in our country by dealing with  some  of  the  crimes,
amongst which is the one she has referred to. The  fact  of  the  matter  is
that in order for us to ensure that, indeed, the reduction of crime is  even
greater than what the situation is to date, we need  co-operation  from  all
role-players - our  people  in  the  areas  where  they  live,  where  crime
happens. We need intelligence from people; information on which we can  base
arrests. We need co-operation, and fortunately, this  kind  of  co-operation
has been  available  from  the  various  political  formations  to  get  co-
operation from the members of the various parties as part and parcel of  our
partnership in the fight against crime.

            MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF ROAD SAFETY IN SOUTH AFRICA

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, let me first of all use  this  opportunity  to
wish our comrade Minister Dullah Omar well. We trust that  he  will  make  a
speedy recovery. We discussed this topic with him, way back in January,  and
the importance of having this debate in the National Assembly. I  know  that
he would dearly have loved to have  been  present  to  participate  in  this
debate.

I have here a comprehensive  ``December  2002  Report  -  Fatal  Road  Crash
Report and Statistics'', prepared by the national Department  of  Transport.
It has statistics on all fatal accidents that  happened  in  December,  this
festive season, on the types of vehicles involved, the hours of the day  and
days of the week, in order to establish statistical patterns that can  guide
us in our strategies.

Before we go into that,  however,  it  is  very  important  for  us  all  to
remember something else behind the statistics, and here it is, the  list  of
names of the deceased people:


  M V Shabalala, driver; B C Mdunge, age 43, passenger; H A Ngcobo, age  8,
  passenger; B P Nxumalo, age 4 months, passenger ...

The report states:


  N1 between Worcester and Rawsonville. Clear sky, dry road. Five  vehicles
  involved, 11 fatalities, including one Land Rover  Freelander  ...  Mr  R
  Cloete, driver; Mrs Cloete, passenger; Monique Cloete, age 2,  passenger;
  Andre Beukes, age 4, passenger ...

And so it goes on, and on, and on. The young and the old, black  and  white,
fancy car or not  so  fancy  car  -  they  are  all  here  in  the  list  of
fatalities.

In December last year, in the midst of the  festive  season,  1  216  people
lost their lives in road crashes. It is  not  entirely  clear  whether  this
represents an increase over the previous year or a slight reduction,  but  I
don't think we should get  too  fixated  on  year-to-year  comparisons.  The
basic fact is that every road fatality is a tragedy and there are  too  many
tragedies on our roads  every  single  day,  not  just  during  the  festive
season, but every month and every year.

In 1998, the last year for which we have the most comprehensive  statistics,
over 9 000 people were fatally injured on  our  roads.  That  is  the  rough
equivalent, Minister Asmal, of 9 average schools being  wiped  out  in  road
fatalities  every  single  year.  In  the  course  of  this  high  level  of
fatalities taking place over the  December  festive  season,  there  was  an
important public debate and public concern, quite legitimately.  There  were
those, of  course,  who  simply  blamed  Government  or  the  Department  of
Transport, or who called for the resignation of the Minister  of  Transport.
Others blamed the public, or particular categories of drivers, or  vehicles.
Minibuses, by the way,  are  often  assumed,  somewhat  inaccurately  as  it
happens, to be almost the sole cause of road accidents.

As our contribution to this very important national concern,  the  Portfolio
Committee on Transport began this year by holding public  hearings  on  road
accidents. We thought it was very important that we do this. We invited  the
national Department of Transport, the SA  Bus  Owners  Association,  the  SA
National Taxi Council, the AA and others to make presentations.  Four  basic
things emerged from these presentations.

Firstly, those outside of Government pleaded with  us  not  to  abandon  our
strategies. Notably the AA and the SA  Bus  Owners  Association,  or  SABOA,
both independent and  nongovernmental  entities,  said  quite  categorically
that, whatever the disappointments and frustrations,  we  must  not  abandon
the Arrive Alive campaign or the Road to Safety strategy. SABOA said in  its
input that for the first time in South Africa we now  have  a  comprehensive
and coherent strategy to deal with road safety. They urged us not  to  throw
it all away in desperation and  start  again.  Similar  to  the  theme  that
President Mbeki has taken up on a broader canvas, they have  also  urged  us
on by saying that the policies and strategies are good, but  that  sometimes
the implementation is lacking. I will come back to that in a moment.

Secondly, we need to be realistic about the South African  reality.  We  are
not alone in the world in facing this terrible scourge of fatalities on  our
roads. Apparently 1,2 million people  died  in  road  accidents  around  the
world. In some countries one in every 10 hospital beds is  occupied  by  the
victim of a road traffic crash.

Ninety per cent of all traffic casualties occur in  low  and  middle  income
countries, like our own, and in our country we have  a  particularly  lethal
combination of factors. In his State of the Nation address  President  Mbeki
referred to a dual economy; a modern  and  relatively  globally  competitive
economy on the one hand and desperate marginalisation  and  underdevelopment
on the other. This dual reality plays itself out quite dramatically  on  our
roads.

At the heart of the apartheid-era social engineering  was,  of  course,  the
removal of thousands and thousands  of  Black  people  from  town  and  city
centres and their displacement to very distant  peri-urban  townships.  They
were close enough for the long daily commute to work, but far enough  to  be
coercively controlled. The very design and location of many of the  freeways
was quite deliberately  done  as  part  of  this  strategy  of  containment.
Freeways ring these townships, designed like  medieval  moats  around  those
old castles, now not to keep invaders out, but rather to keep  the  township
dwellers bottled up in times of so-called emergency. Today we still have  an
impressive  network  of  national  high-speed  freeways  that  border  huge,
sprawling, peri-urban and poverty-stricken townships and squatter camps.

No wonder, in these conditions, that  a  shocking  40%  of  road  fatalities
involve pedestrians. There is a dramatic link  with  this  social  geography
which we have inherited. The point I'm trying to make here is that the long-
term sustainable solution to  road  safety  is  necessarily  linked  to  the
broader struggle and  overall  effort  at  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty and also to the integrated and  human-friendly  development  of  our
living spaces.

The third point that emerged was  the  critical  issue  of  changing  public
attitudes,  or  moral  regeneration.  According  to  statistics   the   main
contributors to road crashes are, first of all, driver factors in  some  80%
to 90% of cases, followed by vehicle factors in some 10%  to  30%  of  cases
and, finally, road environment in  5%  to  15%  of  cases.  Obviously  these
things overlap in many cases. Addressing road safety  means  addressing  all
of these challenges, whether it be by checking up on the  roadworthiness  of
vehicles, by repairing the potholes in our  roads  or,  above  all,  as  the
statistics would suggest, by beginning to change the attitudes  of  all  our
road users, both drivers and pedestrians.

What can we do? We must press ahead  in  a  very  determined  way  with  the
Arrive Alive messages. Minister Asmal, we need to put  even  more  resources
into the school road safety  programmes  that  we  have  started.  In  their
presentation to the portfolio committee the AA suggested a particular  focus
this year on seat belts. The law now states that the wearing of  seat  belts
is compulsory, not only in the front seats, but also in the rear.  How  many
times do we see very young kids bouncing around loose in the back of a  car?


Above all, we in the ANC are in agreement with many others who say that  the
key factor in changing road behaviour lies in much more  effective,  intense
and visible enforcement on our roads. At the moment  enforcement,  where  it
does exist, is almost entirely confined to speed traps by  way  of  cameras.
In terms of trying to change behaviour, it is infinitely more  important  to
stop speeding drivers and engage them, checking on  other  matters  such  as
seat belt compliance or alcohol blood levels and so on. Getting  a  fine  in
the post two months after the event when you have forgotten  even  where  it
happened is the least likely way  to  make  us  more  thoughtful  about  our
driving behaviour. [Applause.] The main point is to  change  behaviour,  not
to trap drivers secretly, on the quiet, and then to post  them  a  fine  two
months later.

This brings me to the fourth and final point that we wish  to  underline.  I
particularly want to address  our  colleagues  in  Government.  We  need  to
implement the Road Traffic Management Corporation,  or  RTMC,  Act.  Traffic
policing  is  a  provincial  and  local  government  competency.  There  are
currently more than  200  different  traffic  policing  authorities  in  our
country, with  little  co-ordination  between  them  and  no  uniformity  in
training. It is a real problem, and to address  it  this  National  Assembly
passed the RTMC Act in 1999. The idea was to encourage co-operation  between
the different spheres of government.  For  reasons  that  are  not  entirely
clear to us, progress in setting up this RTMC has been, to put it  politely,
exceedingly slow. I surmise that the problem could  be  that  at  provincial
and local government sphere levels there is a reluctance to  pool  resources
or to surrender  exclusive  control.  If  this  is  the  case,  then  it  is
exceptionally short-sighted.

I was pleased to note that finally, in the middle of last year,  a  CEO  was
appointed for this RTMC, but eight months have  passed  since  then  and  he
remains on his own in an office. We urge our comrades in  government  please
to take this matter of implementation very  seriously.  Of  course,  traffic
officers can't occupy every inch of the road network and at the end  of  the
day it comes down to our collective behaviour,  but  let  us  at  least  not
allow it to be said that any of us did not do what we needed to do in  order
to end this terrible carnage on our roads. [Applause.]

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, it is a real pity that  Minister  Dullah  Omar
is not in the House to participate in this debate today. If he  is  watching
on TV, let me take this  opportunity  of  wishing  him  well  and  a  speedy
recovery.

In order to put this debate in perspective I  won't  dwell  on  figures  and
statistics, as, despite Arrive Alive  having  been  in  existence  for  many
years, it is only this  year  that  they  can  reliably  substantiate  their
accident reports. This in itself makes a  mockery  of  any  previous  claims
that we are winning the war against the  carnage  on  our  roads.  The  fact
remains that we have an unacceptably high rate of accidents  and  deaths  on
our roads, and one death is one death too many.

The question is whether  Arrive  Alive,  which  costs  taxpayers  over  R250
million, has been effective in reducing our  accidents  and  deaths  on  the
roads. Arrive Alive started  its  initiatives  in  1997,  and  in  2000  the
Minister released his Strategy 2000: An End to  Carnage  on  South  Africa's
Roads. In this  document  the  Minister  declared,  ``We  have  reached  the
crossroads in road safety in South Africa''. He then went on to spell out  a
number of steps he would be taking in changing legislation and  regulations,
coupled to an  all-out  offensive  against  lawlessness  on  the  roads  and
corruption in various parts  of  the  system.  This  would  include  stiffer
penalties and the pursuit and imprisonment on corrupt officials. He put  the
blame on a number of factors: overloading, corruption in obtaining  drivers'
licences and fraudulent testing, registration and licensing of  unroadworthy
vehicles.

What has been said here was in 2000. Let us now look at  what  the  Minister
says three years later. He said this on national radio  and  in  the  media,
and I quote:


  The reasons for the high record of  road  deaths  on  our  roads  can  be
  attributed to corruption and fraud at the vehicle  testing  stations  and
  licensing stations; the reckless and bad behaviour of our drivers brought
  about by our historical past; the  unprofessional  and  poor  quality  of
  traffic officers; the lack of adequate  road  safety  education  for  our
  pedestrian population.

He then went on to appeal to citizens to enter the debate  and  put  forward
their suggestions.

It sounds familiar. The question is: How  far  have  the  Minister  and  his
department gone in eliciting stakeholders' opinions in this regard  or,  for
that matter, bringing  the  culprits  to  book?  I  think  not  enough.  The
Minister and his advisers have looked at  all  the  theoretical  methods  of
reducing the carnage, but have failed to deliver on their theories.  Let  me
say why.

As an opposition party the DA has gone out of its way to interact with  road
traffic stakeholders in order to find answers,  and  their  suggestions  and
technology proposals which  have  been  presented  to  the  department  have
fallen on deaf ears. Many of these innovations have not even been given  the
decency of a reply or, for that matter, a presentation,  despite  my  appeal
to the portfolio  committee.  This  is  totally  unacceptable.  Technologies
which in a very small  way  can  eliminate  or  avoid  accidents  cannot  be
ignored. Let's look at some of these technologies.

There are standardised computer  programmes  which  have  been  devised  and
which can eliminate fraudulent licence testing. There are devices which,  at
a small cost, can  eliminate  overloading  on  public  transport  and  heavy
vehicles. There  are  high-tech  video  cameras  which  can  expose  traffic
offenders and bring them to book as admissible evidence in court. There  are
automated daytime running switches which  ensure  that  lights  come  on  at
different levels of visibility, day and night, which  are  known  to  reduce
vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to pedestrian crashes by up to 40%  in  other
countries. There are effective and accurate mobile  weighbridges  which  can
be placed strategically to apprehend evaders of fixed weighbridges.  Need  I
go on?

I'm not saying that all these innovations are cost-effective  or  practical,
but by not evaluating them in terms of their use are we not  writing  out  a
death sentence for some innocent motorist,  passenger  or  pedestrian  whose
life could have been saved if these devices could  be  used  and  legislated
for?

Let me turn to the aspect of zero tolerance. How does  the  Minister  expect
zero tolerance to become a reality when he does not  have  the  capacity  of
traffic officers on the road to enforce the law?  Unless  we  can  apprehend
and bring  to  book  these  offenders,  bad  behaviour  on  our  roads  will
continue. I travelled extensively over the recess in most of the  provinces,
and during my travels I saw only two Arrive Alive  stations  and  only  four
traffic policemen. This was during the peak of the Arrive Alive campaign.

Officers I spoke to told me of their dilemmas of  getting  sufficient  staff
onto the national roads, their demotivation brought about by  nonpayment  of
overtime and ad hoc deployments at very short notice. If we are to create  a
well-motivated and professional traffic department,  every  province  should
have adequate manpower to  cover  their  areas  of  jurisdiction.  Good  co-
ordination and planning could ensure regular patrols and  shifts  throughout
the year. Visible policing creates a calming effect  on  motorists,  and  if
they were doing their jobs vehicles which were  overloaded  or  unroadworthy
should never start the journey.

What about the introduction of unmarked or nonuniformed police  officers  or
traffic officers patrolling our roads, or  using  video  cameras  to  record
offences? Whilst in Johannesburg I was given the opportunity of riding in  a
demonstration vehicle fitted with a  high-tech  video  camera,  and  in  the
duration of my trip I witnessed over 30 offences being  committed  in  front
of my eyes. The fines which  could  have  been  accumulated  on  that  small
journey would have gone a long way in paying for the equipment.  Why  aren't
we using this technology, like so many other countries?

No, Minister, the time has come for you to get tough and to relook  at  your
strategies to reduce road deaths. What  happened  to  the  need  for  public
transporters to have a certificate of roadworthiness prior  to  registration
or annual licensing? It doesn't appear to be a criterion any more.  And  yet
I am aware that firm proposals have been presented to the Minister  and  his
department to put in place  enough  vehicle  roadworthy  testing  facilities
around the country to  deal  with  the  problem.  It  is  unacceptable  that
unroadworthy buses and taxis can travel across the width and breadth of  our
country without having gone through vehicle roadworthy testing.

Let me turn my attention to the  Road  Traffic  Management  Corporation,  or
RTMC. The Act creating this corporation, as was mentioned  by  my  colleague
earlier, was passed by this House in 1999 to  regulate  the  appointment  of
the  CEO  and  managers  of  the  functional  units  and  to   empower   the
shareholders' committee. Yet the shareholders' committee was  only  formally
constituted on 18 November 2002.

In the same document which I spoke about earlier, the Minister talked  about
a vigorous new initiative to reorientate our  entire  road  safety  strategy
around these bodies, such as the  Road  Traffic  Safety  Board,  AARTO  Road
Traffic Infringement Agency and the  Road  Traffic  Management  Corporation.
Where are these bodies now, some three years down the line? In a  report  to
the portfolio committee on 29 January 2003, the  CEO  of  the  Road  Traffic
Management  Corporation  reported  that  of  the  R57  million  needed,  the
national Department of Transport had only allocated R6 million to  start  up
this corporation.

How serious are we if we can't even effectively budget for  this  particular
corporation? One of the most important functional units of the  RTMC  is  to
look at traffic law enforcement and the training of traffic  personnel,  yet
no one can tell me whether we have sufficient numbers  of  traffic  officers
or what the optimum required numbers  are.  Surely  this  in  itself  is  an
indictment on the department and its agencies as, without visible  policing,
the battle can never be won and  Arrive  Alive  will  continue  to  fail  in
bringing down deaths on our roads.
The mission of the department as articulated in the  1996  -  and  I  stress
1996 - White Paper on Transport to bring down crashes, deaths  and  injuries
on South African roads by 5% year on year until 2005, I believe, has  failed
dismally. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I would like to start by saying that  it  is
a great pity that the hon Minister of Transport cannot be with us today  for
this debate. As we all know, the  Minister  is  receiving  treatment  for  a
serious illness and on behalf of the IFP, I want to  take  this  opportunity
to wish him a speedy and full recovery so that he may resume his  duties  in
the near future.

Road safety has for far  too  long  been  a  so-called  challenge  in  South
Africa. Every year and specifically in the holiday season,  members  of  the
public become either spectators, as the death toll mounts  and  is  reported
in the media, or road accident statistics themselves.  And  every  year  our
traffic authorities make special plans and  spend  millions  of  rands  with
very limited success in bringing down the death toll.

This is a thoroughly depressing state of affairs  and  underlines  my  point
that road safety can no longer be  described  as  merely  a  challenge.  No,
Madam Speaker, the clear  absence  of  safety  on  our  roads  must  now  be
described as a national crisis. It is a national crisis because of the  loss
of life, the huge financial and economic costs and the seeming inability  of
the authorities to tackle the problems head-on and to solve them.

The Arrive Alive campaign is a good  idea  on  paper,  but  it  has  failed.
Instead of bringing down the death toll on our roads,  it  appears  to  have
become a very expensive collector and  disseminator  of  statistics.  Surely
this was never the intention, but unfortunately it has become the reality.

The failure of Arrive Alive is but one element of  the  general  failure  of
strict law enforcement on South Africa's roads. We  have  more  than  enough
traffic laws and regulations on the statute books. In  general,  these  laws
are very good laws, on paper at least, but their enforcement leaves much  to
be  desired.  In  my  opinion,  this  failure  of  traffic  law  enforcement
constitutes a national crisis.

Most, if not all the members of this House,  have  seen  the  impunity  with
which  motorists  flout  our  traffic  laws.  Speeding,   drunken   driving,
unroadworthy vehicles and overloading are just some of the more brazen  acts
of lawlessness.

Lawlessness on our roads has reached the  stage  where  a  minibus  taxi  is
overloaded to the extent of 46  passengers,  and  the  operator  is  driving
under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  Stories  abound  of  so-called  vehicle
swapping for roadworthy tests where a perfectly healthy  vehicle  is  tested
in the place of a road wreck which then obtains the roadworthy certificate.

Motorists are trapped at speeds in  excess  of  200km  per  hour.  Dangerous
overtaking  manoeuvres  are  the  order  of  the  day,  adequate   following
distances are not maintained, road conditions  such  as  rain  or  wind  are
simply not taken into account. Lanes are changed without a  second  look  or
indication of the intention to change. Such is the nature of the  Wild  West
lawlessness we witness on our roads.

This lawlessness has even extended to the traffic authorities  in  the  form
of corruption. One example of this corruption  among  traffic  officials  is
commonly called ``the extra page in the ID book'', in other  words,  a  R100
or R200 note for the officer to look the other way. It is impossible to  say
with any accuracy how much corruption occurs  in  the  traffic  authorities,
but even one instance is one too many.

Yes, it is true that  South  Africa  needs  many  more  and  better  trained
traffic officers, but even thousands of extra  traffic  officers  will  mean
nothing if they do not enforce the law.  Extra  personnel  may  improve  the
visibility, which is important, as  the  chairperson  said  of  the  traffic
authorities, but only if the traffic officers actually  take  to  the  roads
and enforce the laws where the motorists are breaking them.
There is only one way in which we will stop the carnage on  our  roads,  and
that is the strictest possible application and enforcement of  the  law.  It
is all very well for the  authorities  to  publicly  state  that  they  will
follow a zero-tolerance approach to traffic offences. I  would  rather  they
change that to a no-mercy approach.

Most of us would agree that part of the road safety problem is the  absolute
disdain and disrespect with which many motorists treat our traffic laws  and
our traffic officers. Public  appeals,  advertising  campaigns  and  special
projects have not  had  the  desired  effect  of  instilling  a  culture  of
obedience and compliance among motorists, that much is clear.

In my opinion, such a culture of obedience will only be achieved  through  a
no-mercy approach to law enforcement. Clearly, the possibility of injury  or
death is not enough to  deter  motorists  from  flouting  the  law.  Perhaps
public fear of traffic officers and the sure knowledge of massive  penalties
and even imprisonment will have the desired effect.
I would also like to deal  with  the  issue  of  pedestrian  deaths  on  and
alongside our roads. We know that pedestrian deaths make  up  a  very  large
proportion of all road deaths in South  Africa.  In  many  instances,  these
deaths are  the  result  of  lawlessness  and  negligence  on  the  part  of
motorists, but in many other instances, negligence and alcohol  abuse  among
pedestrians are also to blame.

It is a fact of South  African  life  that  many  informal  settlements  are
situated next to busy roads. It is also a fact that many residents of  these
settlements have to walk to and from the nearest  available  transport  hub,
be it a taxi rank, bus terminal or train station. We  therefore  have  large
numbers of pedestrians along some of our busiest roads.

Madam Speaker, in conclusion, the other day I  saw  a  poster  dealing  with
road safety. It said:``Don't just talk about road safety. Let's do  it!''  I
could not agree more, but I want to change this slogan  just  a  little  bit
and say:``Don't just talk law enforcement. Enforce it now!''

Madam Speaker, seeing that this is the last time for the foreseeable  future
that I will be speaking from this podium, as I will become a member  of  the
KwaZulu-Natal  legislature,  allow  me  to  say  to  all  my   friends   and
colleagues: ``Goodbye, totsiens, salani kahle nonke.'' [Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  also  wish  the  Minister  of
Transport, Mr Dullah Omar, a speedy recovery. The New NP welcomes this  very
important debate that has been put on the Order Paper by the Chief  Whip  of
the Majority Party.

The issue of road safety in South Africa affects every single one of  us.  I
do not think there is not  a  person  who  has  not  been  affected  by  the
terrible carnage on our roads. We view visible traffic law enforcement as  a
critical element in any active road safety project.  One  must  ask  whether
the Government is serious about law enforcement on our  roads.  Taking  into
account all the factors, the answer must be a decisive no!

Despite ongoing calls from Government for voluntary compliance with  traffic
rules by road users,  the  general  pattern  of  lawlessness  on  our  roads
continues. According to the Automobile  Association  there  seems  to  be  a
perception amongst road users, and drivers in particular, that  speed-camera
prosecutions are virtually the sole element of traffic law enforcement.

Last year South Africa had to make do  with  only  3 055  traffic  officers.
This means that there was only one traffic officer  for  every  2 030  legal
vehicles on our roads, even during the festive  season,  when  thousands  of
people lost their lives on our roads.

According to the answer to a parliamentary question tabled by my  colleague,
the hon Mr Niemann, during May 2002, there were 1 769 vacant posts and  only
241 positions were planned to be filled. The AA has asked for an  additional
9 000 on its wish list. This  is,  in  fact,  only  a  drop  in  the  ocean.
However, this could be a good start, considering that the more than  500 000
road accidents per year are costing taxpayers more  than  R16  billion.  The
cost of lives lost is beyond calculation. Projects, strategies  and  planned
action have no meaning if there  are  no  foot  soldiers  to  implement  the
existing excellent law effectively.

I am told by the  traffic  authorities  that  rendering  a  service  in  the
Western Cape alone requires 1 500 additional traffic officers. The  plan  is
to bridge the shortfall by phasing in the additional staff over a  five-year
period. In the meantime lives are lost due  to  a  lack  of  manpower,  poor
equipment and low morale in the service.

Two years ago I met a provincial traffic chief from Mumbai, India,  here  in
Cape Town during the festive season. He mentioned to me that during the  two
weeks he was here he never saw a single traffic officer!

Not so long ago a minibus taxi was pulled off the road  near  Laingsburg  on
the N1, and 45 passengers tumbled  out.  This  included  27  adults  and  18
children. This minibus taxi must have travelled  500  kilometres  before  it
was stopped. What was more serious is the fact that  the  driver  was  under
the influence of alcohol.

Following on from law enforcement is the  issue  of  corruption.  We  should
take a strong stand against any form of corruption,  especially  where  road
safety is concerned. Fraudulently obtained  certificates  of  roadworthiness
and drivers' licences continue to make a  mockery  of  the  Road  to  Safety
strategy, and  effectively  negate  the  efforts  of  dedicated  people  and
institutions who have the safety of our people  at  heart.  Only  this  past
Monday, two former employees of the Isipingo vehicle  testing  station  were
found guilty of 676 counts of vehicle-roadworthiness  fraud  in  the  Durban
Magistrates' Court.

The critical area of road safety education should  be  expanded  to  include
ongoing driver education. We  support  the  AA's  proposal  that  compulsory
advanced and defensive driving certification be a prerequisite to  obtaining
a driving instructor's certificate. Currently a driving instructor  requires
no additional qualification in order to instruct learner drivers.

Road safety must become an integral part of the school curriculum,  so  that
becoming safe road users and the dangers associated with using roads  should
be inculcated in children  from  a  young  age.  In  Scotland  they  have  a
``Children's Traffic Club'', for  example,  where  the  children  are  given
books and toys with the object of being taught about road safety.

Finally, the  Arrive  Alive  campaign  places  almost  no  emphasis  on  the
roadworthiness of vehicles. We must definitely place more emphasis  on  this
aspect. Overloading of vehicles is hardly given attention, and this  is  one
of the major causes of minibus taxi accidents. I thank you.

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and  hon  members,  as  we  debate
road safety today we should  be  mindful  of  the  fact  that  road  traffic
accidents do not only occur during the festive season,  but  throughout  the
year. Therefore, whilst it is essential to embark on  intensified  selective
law enforcement during the festive season, it is also important to  continue
with law enforcement in the  same  spirit  throughout  the  year,  including
embarking on drunken driving blitzes from time to time.

More than 95% of road traffic accidents occur as a direct result of  traffic
violations  and  transgression  of  traffic  regulations.   These   can   be
attributed to two or more simultaneous human factors such  as  recklessness,
inconsiderate driving behaviour, inappropriate speed for  the  circumstances
and driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a  drug  that  has
narcotic effects.

All of these are major contributory  factors.  This,  therefore,  calls  for
vigorous law enforcement. Similarly, we are  also  faced  with  the  vehicle
fitness aspect, as well as the bad state of  roads,  particularly  those  in
the rural areas, where emergency  vehicles  like  ambulances  cannot  render
essential services because they are inaccessible.

The UDM, therefore, calls on  Government  to  seriously  consider  upgrading
such roads. This is especially so when one  considers  that  every  road  in
South Africa was designed in such a way that there should  virtually  be  no
accidents if every road user complies with the rules  and  regulations.  The
nonvisibility of  traffic  officers  calls  on  Government  to  employ  more
traffic officers,  to  ensure  the  effective  and  smooth  running  of  the
departments.

Whilst we have no problem with the use  of  cameras  to  measure  speed,  we
would, however, like to encourage traffic departments to make  use  of  law-
enforcement officers as cameras are seen by  many  as  a  revenue-generating
measure rather than a law-enforcement one, and this  invokes  more  contempt
and wanton disregard for speed limit signs.
In an effort to combat the road carnage,  we  call  on  all  road  users  to
strive to prevent accidents and to make the roads a safer  place  to  travel
on for all those who use them, as every good attempt on the part of  traffic
departments can  only  be  successful  if  the  public  gives  its  complete
support. This is the time to be united, even  if  we  speak  with  different
voices or there are differences in emphasis. We would  also  like  to  thank
the Department of Transport for the last-minute  reprieve  on  licences  and
hope that motorists will take advantage of this. I thank you.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the  ACDP  wishes  Minister  Dullah
Omar a speedy recovery, and we hope to see him in Parliament very soon.  The
carnage we witnessed on our road in the past years has  rated  South  Africa
among the worst in the world.

Questions are asked: Who is accountable and responsible? Who at the  end  of
the day must take responsibility, especially for the fact  that  the  Arrive
Alive campaign is  not  working?  Surely  Government  must  be  the  primary
responsible and accountable agent?

Millions of rands are spent on strategic plans and programmes, yet it  seems
as if we are losing this battle. There is weak enforcement of  the  law  and
there are corrupt officials, while crime lords and  syndicates  control  the
social service resources, all of which has a direct impact  on  the  poorest
of the poor. Speed, alcohol abuse and the ineptitude  of  drivers  are  also
the main contributors to road deaths.

Vehicles that should never have passed the  roadworthiness  test  are  prime
killers on our roads. Taxis and buses are overloaded and  operate  on  roads
that are well below safety standards. One of the reasons for the  number  of
inept drivers is the easy access to drivers' licences. Like the credit  card
system at the moment, they are made available through corrupt practices  and
certain criminal activities.

One of our primary  responsibilities  as  Government  is  to  root  out  the
corruption that is perpetrated by a handful of people  who  have  no  regard
for the social wellbeing of our citizens. The ACDP  recommends  that  annual
random checks be done on public transport vehicles such as taxis  and  buses
to see if they are roadworthy when owners come to renew their  licences.  In
other words, with each reminder for new  licences,  a  random  selection  of
drivers should be checked annually so that roadworthy  certificates  can  be
issued before licences are renewed.

There should also be commitments from provincial  governments  to  keep  our
roads in good condition. Drivers guilty of  excessive  speed  and  substance
abuse must have their cars impounded for a period of at  least  seven  days,
and should be forced to do community service.

Lastly, visible policing by traffic officials to impose heavy fines  on  law
breakers must also be carried out by our department. Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]
Mnr P  J  GROENEWALD:  Mevrou  die  Adjunkspeaker,  die  onderwerp  wat  ons
vanmiddag hier bespreek, is om die  uitdaging  van  padveiligheid  in  Suid-
Afrika te aanvaar. Eerstens wil ek van my kant  af  die  agb  Minister  baie
gelukwens. Ek wil hom gelukwens met sy eerlikheid,  want  die  agb  Minister
het in die Sunday Times eerlik erken dat die Kom Veilig Daar-veldtog  misluk
het. Dis nie aldag dat 'n mens 'n ANC-minister kry wat so eerlik is nie.

Die vraag is, wat is die uitdagings vir  padveiligheid  in  Suid-Afrika?  Ek
gaan drie aspekte noem, en ek is oortuig  dat  as  hierdie  drie  uitdagings
aanvaar word, daar beter padveiligheid en 'n drastiese afname  sal  wees  in
die sterftes op ons paaie. Die eerste is die toestand van ons paaie in Suid-
Afrika. Daar is vele motoriste wat letterlik van  slaggat  na  slaggat  moet
ry. As 'n mens in die nag ry en jy ken die paaie nie  behoorlik  nie  en  jy
weet nie waar die slaggate is nie, en daar kom 'n voertuig van voor,  sê  ek
vir u, is dit 'n gevaar. Die tweede is die tekort aan verkeersbeamptes.

Derdens, en baie belangrik, is  dat,  soos  Arrive  Alive  sê,  regstellende
optrede die skuld moet  kry  vir  die  onbevoegdheid  van  sommige  van  ons
verkeersinspekteurs. Ek dink dis 'n skande as 'n verkeersinspekteur 'n R200-
boete aan 'n motoris uitskryf omdat sy remligte slegs werk  as  hy  die  rem
trap, of 'n R200-boete uitskryf en sê die truligte werk net as  die  kar  in
trurat is.

Dit is 'n bewys dat die ANC-regering moet ophou om soos 'n volstruis met  sy
kop in die sand te kyk na regstellende optrede en  behoorlik  bevoegde  lede
moet oplei om behoorlike wetstoepassing te doen. Eers as ons dít  doen,  sal
daar beter padveiligheid  wees  op  ons  paaie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Deputy Speaker, the subject under discussion  here
this afternoon is accepting the challenge of road safety  in  South  Africa.
Firstly, I personally wish to congratulate the hon Minister warmly.  I  want
to congratulate him on  his  honesty,  because  the  hon  Minister  admitted
openly in the Sunday Times that the Arrive Alive campaign has failed. It  is
not often that one comes across an ANC Minister who is that honest.

The question remains, what are the  challenges  for  road  safety  in  South
Africa? I am going to list three aspects, and I am convinced that  if  these
three challenges are adopted,  there  will  be  better  road  safety  and  a
drastic decrease in deaths on our roads. The first is the condition  of  our
roads in South Africa. There are many motorists  who  must  literally  drive
from one pothole to the other. If one drives at night,  and  has  no  proper
knowledge of the roads and one does not know where the potholes are,  and  a
vehicle approaches one, it poses a danger. The second  is  the  shortage  of
traffic officers.

Thirdly, and very  importantly,  is  that,  as  admitted  by  Arrive  Alive,
affirmative action should be blamed for the  incompetence  of  some  of  our
traffic inspectors. I think it is a shame if a  traffic  inspector  fines  a
motorist R200 because his brake lights only work when he applies brakes,  or
issues a R200 fine and says that the reverse lights only work when  the  car
is in reverse gear.

This is proof that the ANC Government should  stop  looking  at  affirmative
action like an ostrich with its  head  in  the  sand  and  must  train  duly
competent members to perform law enforcement. Only when we  have  done  this
will there be better safety on our roads.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I call upon the hon Mbombo to address the House.

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Mrs N D MBOMBO: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of women!]

Madam Deputy Speaker,  every  year  some  900  people  are  killed  in  road
accidents and thousands  more  injured,  be  they  pedestrians,  drivers  or
passengers. These accidents not only impact financially on the economy,  but
also emotionally on the families and relatives of those who  are  killed  or
injured.

The high levels of road accidents cannot be left to continue or  be  allowed
to increase. We have to find  ways  of  curbing  road  accidents  and  adopt
measures that will enable us to  see  the  high  levels  of  road  accidents
decrease. It was out of this desire that the Road to  Safety:  2001  -  2005
was launched in November 2001.

The Road to Safety Strategy was implemented to address the issue  of  safety
on the roads of South Africa. It addresses  three  critical  areas  of  road
safety, namely the road environment, the road  user  and  the  vehicle.  The
road safety programme focuses its intention on fraud and corruption  in  the
areas  of  driver  training  and  licensing,   vehicle   testing   and   law
enforcement. It also focuses on the strengthening of the regulation of road-
based freight and public transport modes.

The Road to Safety, 2001-2005  can  make  short-term  to  medium-term  gains
through the proposed interventions. However,  the  struggle  to  change  the
attitudes and culture of the users of our roads will take much  longer.  The
Government is doing all it can, but the users of our  roads  -  pedestrians,
passengers and drivers - all have to play their part in helping to make  our
roads safer for all those who use them.

The national Department of Transport has taken upon its shoulders  the  task
of making the public aware of its  strategy  to  make  our  roads  safe  for
pedestrians as well. However, there are certain operational issues, such  as
driving hours,  measures  to  combat  driver  fatigue,  and  vehicle  safety
monitoring, which need regulating, and these should be included  in  a  code
of practice.

Users of passenger transport are  still  ill-informed  regarding  acceptable
service and safety standards  and  have  no  easy  avenue  when  exposed  to
danger. For this reason, the passenger charter is proposed.

There are projects that were implemented during the course of 2002, and  the
implementation goes on, such as the  training  of  drivers;  professionalism
among driving licensees; refresher courses;  professionalism  among  vehicle
examiners; and investigation of testing stations and  their  standards.  The
Government is doing all  it  can  to  help  us  with  this  Road  to  Safety
Strategy.

There are still projects to be implemented, that is road  safety  education;
identification  of   hazardous   locations;   pedestrians'   and   cyclists'
visibility; raising awareness of the Arrive Alive Campaign  to  24  hours  a
day,  seven  days  a  week  and  the  whole  year  round.  There  are   also
multipurpose road blocks,  law  enforcement  and  information  centres.  Our
roads should be checked and upgraded, not forgetting our driving schools.

The Government also has a programme called ``Arrive Alive Again''.  This  is
a year-long programme which focuses on the reduction of road  accidents.  In
the past years this programme succeeded in raising  the  awareness  of  road
safety amongst the users of our roads.

The Arrive Alive Campaign  will  have  achieved  its  goal  when  we  see  a
reduction in road accidents, when drivers,  pedestrians  and  cyclists  take
the issue of road safety seriously, and work together  with  the  Government
to reduce road accidents.

Ngalo mzuzu mandicele ukubulela  koogxa  bam,  kumaqabane  nakuMgcinisihlalo
ngokunikwa   ithuba   lokuba   nam   ndiphose   esivivaneni,   ndinqwenelele
uMphathiswa uDullar Omar ukuba achache msinyane.

Kwakhona,  mandiphose  esivivaneni  ngokuthi  ndivakalise  ilizwi  lovelwano
kwabo baswelekelwe zizihlobo zabo  ezindleleni  nasezimotweni.  Siyile  Ndlu
noRhulumente sivelana nabo. Amanxeba abo, ngawethu. Intlungu yabo, yeyethu.

Mandingabalibali  nabasezibhedlele  abalimeleyo.  Nabo  ndithi   mabachache.
Sinabo ezingcingeni zethu.  Ndiyabulela,  Mhlalingaphambili.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[At  this  moment  I  would  like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  thank  my
colleagues, comrades and the Chairperson for allowing me time to say  a  few
words, and to wish the hon the Minister Dullah Omar speedy recovery.

Furthermore, I would like to express my condolences to friends and  families
of those who lost  their  lives  in  road  accidents.  This  House  and  the
Government are with them during this time of mourning. We share their pain.

I could not possibly forget those that are lying  injured  in  hospitals.  I
wish them a speedy recovery, too. We have them in our thoughts.  Thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker and hon members, may  I  on  behalf  of  the
UCDP wish the affable Minister Omar  a  speedy  recovery.  The  past  summer
festive season was the worst ever in so far as road  carnage  is  concerned.
Almost double the number of accidents occurred during the  period,  compared
to the corresponding period the year before.

However, much blame has to be put at the door of Government for the  matter-
of-fact like manner in which the Arrive Alive  campaign  is  being  handled.
Instead of handling the campaign  as  a  year-round  process,  it  is  being
treated as an event during festive seasons only. Lengths of roads are  death
traps marked with dungeons which are mistaken for potholes.

It has to be borne in mind that the legitimate object of  Government  is  to
do for the community whatever they  need  to  do  but  cannot  do  in  their
separate or individual capacities.  Roads  are  an  example  of  that  which
Government has to take responsibility for.

In instances where tarmac road surfaces are in good  condition,  most  often
they are not clearly marked, and such conditions lend themselves to  hazards
in inclement weather. Poor driving skills account  for  most  accidents,  as
drivers indicate their actions, instead of their intentions.

It is also true that most motorists do not accept  the  responsibility  that
goes with driving a motor vehicle. Some drive while under the  influence  of
liquor; others keep driving even when visibility  is  poor,  when  they  are
tired or drowsy; some drive without drivers' licences;  while  others  drive
unroadworthy contraptions that are hazards to the road itself.

We call on all traffic officers to live up to  their  calling.  They  should
control traffic, instead  of  watching  from  under  marquees  in  a  group.
Visibility of traffic officers will reduce accidents on our roads.  I  thank
you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, Minister Dullah  Omar,  the  MF  says
may Allah show his most merciful blessing on you for your speedy recovery.

How easily in our hustle and bustle to get to our destination we tend to  be
reckless and forget about road safety. How often  in  the  morning  news  on
television and radio do we hear reports of road  accidents  and  fatalities?
It is a reality from province to province.  The  pleasing  thought  is  that
there were no road accidents reported in either The Star or the  Cape  Times
today.

What is horrific is the summary of fatalities in the various provinces  from
1 January 2003 to 28 February 2003, totalling  961.  Crashes  totalling  768
were reported in various provinces. This is scary.

But a lot has  been  done  to  try  and  change  that  by  our  Ministry  of
Transport, from national to provincial and local governments. In  Cape  Town
we have seen an increase in the number of municipal traffic officers,  which
has increased the level of awareness of road safety  and  road  regulations,
something which provinces should look into adopting earnestly. The  changing
of driving licences to the new system has also created a  greater  sense  of
responsibility, and the threat of penalties has certainly instilled  greater
discipline in road users.

The MF expresses its support for the Arrive Alive  campaign  and  all  other
initiatives to make commuting safer for all. It is felt that the  threat  of
heavy fines is a good tool to ensure  safe  driving.  However,  it  is  your
responsibility as a driver to take the necessary steps and precautions  each
time you get into your car, not only for yourself,  but  for  others  around
you. Nothing is more precious than life, so don't rush,  take  it  easy  and
arrive safely. Thank you.

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  the  2002  Road  Accident  Fund
Commission report on the causes of accidents presented  to  His  Excellency,
the President of the Republic of South Africa states, and I quote:


  Contributory causes of accidents differentiate between human, vehicle and
  road environment.

The report goes on to state, and I quote again:


  The key driver factors identified include speed, the influence of alcohol
  or drugs, fatigue and basic driver  competence.  Vehicle-fitness  factors
  include  inflated  tyres;  smooth,  worn-out  or  wrong  tyres;   vehicle
  overloading;  poor  brakes;  faulty  steering;  poor  lights  or  vehicle
  visibility;  and  poor  general  maintenance  of  vehicle   parts.   Road
  environmental factors include  poor  maintenance  of  the  road  surface,
  resulting in potholes and poor ride quality.

These are the factors that have been identified by this commission, and  our
strategy should include curbing them to make sure that our roads  are  safe.
The four human factors  mentioned,  ie  speed,  alcohol,  drugs  and  driver
competence, can, in fact, be controlled. Therefore, we have to  bring  about
measures to ensure that our people do not die.

But the problem is that most of  our  traffic  cops  have  been  trained  to
monitor speed only. In many instances they hide behind trees and  once  they
have got you, they forget that they  have  to  monitor  other  factors  that
bring about death on our roads. Many accidents are caused by  taxi  drivers,
because of the volume of passengers they carry. That is why  the  statistics
become relatively high.

To the extent that all road accident factors mentioned  apply  to  the  taxi
industry as well,  and  because  of  its  volume  of  passengers,  the  taxi
capitalisation programme should be speeded up. This  should  be  accompanied
by the training of taxi drivers on all aspects of road usage. The  licensing
of new drivers should be monitored, so that drivers should carry proper  and
authentic drivers' licences. I thank you.

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Hon Deputy Speaker ...

Hon MEMBER: Malibongwe! [Praise it!]

Ms M P COETZEE-KASPER: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of the women!]

Hon Deputy Speaker, members, we are nearing Easter and I think this  is  the
right time that the Chief Whip has brought this  to  the  attention  of  the
public.

According to our  mindset,  our  thinking  as  the  public  about  the  road
accidents, the carnage, it is the Government's responsibility to reduce  the
carnage, to protect the public and  to  save  the  lives.  Even  though  all
measures have been taken to reduce fatal accidents, the sole  responsibility
still lies within us, as road users. Everyone is responsible for  their  own
safety when driving or crossing a road or a street.

We know that there are factors that may cause the accidents but  should  the
blame be put only and solely on  Government  and  the  national  department?
Personally I disagree, because  of  fact  and  not  fiction.  It's  not  the
Government, it's not a department who sits behind that  wheel,  who  crosses
the road. It's the individual who is among the public  out  there.  It's  me
and it's you. I point one finger at you - the rest are pointing at me.  That
says, take responsibility - be accountable.

Let's look at the national road strategies which were put in place  and  the
Road Traffic Accident Investigation and Reconstruction  document  of  31-10-
2002. This is proof of the carnage. Compare these figures with the  previous
years where  there  were  no  comprehensive  detailed  statistics.  This  in
reality means that accidents have declined, although not with what we  would
like to see, but there is a change.

Dit wil nie sê ons kan nie meer doen  om  te  voorkom  dat  meer  mense  hul
lewens verloor nie, maar wat is ons  as  padverbruikers  se  voorneme?  Soos
elkeen van ons gewoonlik 'n resolusie neem aan die einde Desember  van  elke
jaar, so moet ons elke oggend ook 'n resolusie neem wanneer ons in  die  pad
val - of dit te voet of te motor is.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[That does not mean that we cannot do  more  to  prevent  more  people  from
losing their lives, but what is our intention as road  users?  In  the  same
way as each of us usually makes a resolution at the end  of  December  every
year, so we should also make a resolution every morning when we set  off  on
the road - whether it is on foot or by motorcar.]

The other strategy of the department is to counter  the  carnage,  which  is
called Road to Safety for the  next  five  years  from  2001  to  2005.  The
starting point in the implementation of national reform is to allow  a  more
comprehensive and co-ordinated approach to road traffic management.

Ons weet hoekom baie voetgangers sterf. My voorsitter  het  alreeds  hieroor
gepraat, maar ek wil meer breedvoerig daaroor gaan, omdat  alle  planne  van
massavervoer naby of in die omgewing  van  500m  van  die  swart  woonbuurte
gebou is, soos in die geval van stede. As ons kyk na die nuwe pad wat  verby
Century City of verby die Casino gaan, watter  woonbuurte  is  naby  daardie
paaie? Dit is ons swart woonbuurte, en dít is  eintlik  die  oorsaak  waarom
voetgangers aan hulle dood kom. Ek noem dit  ook:  Elke  plaaslike  regering
moet kyk na hulle bouplanne, kyk na hulle infrastruktuurplanne. Vanaf  1994,
die meerderheid van die plaaslike regerings het nog nie daarna gekyk  en  'n
verandering gebring aan dié planne nie en die  paaie  is  die  belangrikste,
want dit neem die lewens van ons gewone burgers,  van  die  werkers  en  van
ouers. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We know why many pedestrians die. My chairperson has already  spoken  about
this, but I want to discuss it in further detail, because all plans of  mass
transport are built about, or in  the  vicinity  of,  500m  from  the  black
residential areas, as in the case of cities. When we look at  the  new  road
that runs past Century City or past the Casino, which residential areas  are
near those roads? It is our black residential areas, and  that  is  actually
the reason why pedestrians lose their lives.  I  also  mention  this:  Every
local  government  must  look  at  its   building   plans,   look   at   its
infrastructure plans. Since 1994 the majority of local governments have  not
yet looked at them and changed these plans,  and  the  roads  are  the  most
important, because they take the lives of  our  ordinary  citizens,  of  the
workers and of parents.]

I would like to approach the road carnage  from  a  different  angle.  Every
driver  and  pedestrian  should  be  a  responsible  person.  This   ANC-led
Government doesn't want to see people dying like  flies  but  are  our  road
users responsible? Has our freedom given the road users the freedom  not  to
care about the other person or is it just  a  matter  of  ignorance  of  the
rules and law because it's the ANC Government?

To the public, I want to assure them that Government  is  busy  implementing
the Road Accident Investigation and Reconstruction Strategy. But  -  a  very
big and bold but - what are you doing on the road? Just here  in  the  city,
Cape Town, the pedestrians don't care if the traffic lights are green for  a
driver. They walk at ease and the majority of them  are  not  even  elderly.
It's young adults and the youth. The driver of the vehicle must  wait  until
they have passed at their own pace. The taxi-drivers in the morning  and  in
the afternoon during peak traffic just pass. You must give way.  What  about
the next driver behind you? They just want to pass.  Is  this  part  of  the
traffic  rules?  No,  it's  not.  It's  misbehaviour  of  the  driver.  It's
misbehaviour of the pedestrians.

As ek aan die publiek moet vra hoeveel meer geld moet  ons  nóg  spandeer  -
waar is die agb Farrow? - om die paaie nóg veiliger te  maak,  sal  ons  dan
versigtiger ry of loop? Sal ons dán  alle  reëls  en  regulasies  gehoorsaam
onder die ANC-regering? Of is dit 'n kwessie  van  ek  gaan  nie  binne  die
perke van die spoed hou nie, ongeag of ek self dood kan gaan? Die  persepsie
van die publiek is dat ons nie veel doen nie. As  ons  nie  veel  doen  nie,
waarom het ons die AA gevra, wat elke jaar vir ons 'n uiteengesette  verslag
gee van wat huidiglik die oorsake van ongelukke is? Ons het  die  SAPD,  ons
het die geneeshere, ens. Waar langafstandspaaie  onbruikbaar  is,  word  dit
nagesien. Waar skiet ons tekort,  Adjunkvoorsitter,  lede?  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[If I were to ask the public how much more money we still have  to  spend  -
where is the hon Farrow? - to make the roads even safer, will we then  drive
or walk more safely? Will we then obey all the rules and  regulations  under
the ANC Government? Or is it a question of my not being willing to  keep  to
the speed limits, regardless of whether I myself could die?  The  perception
of the public is that we do not do much. If we do not do much, why  have  we
asked the AA, which gives us  a  detailed  report  every  year  of  what  is
currently causing accidents? We have the SAPS, we  have  the  doctors,  etc.
Where long-distance roads are unusable, they  are  repaired.  Where  are  we
lacking, Deputy Chairperson, members?]

The starting point of this strategy is the implementation  of  institutional
reform to allow a more co-ordinated approach to road traffic management.  In
doing so, the AA regularly commissions studies into  road  safety.  In  2000
three  studies  were  handed  to  the  Minister  of   Transport.The   global
perspective is that by 2020 the figure of road injuries and deaths  will  be
number three in the world.

I want to propose a harsh punishment. Offences  of  drunken  driving,  first
time - R5 000; second time - take licence away for five years; third time  -
for life. Sleeping and driving, first time R1  500;  second  time  -  R3000;
third time - take licence away for life. Overloading, first  time  -  R5000;
second time - take licence away for five years; third time  -  take  licence
away for life. Take away that licence. Reckless driving,  take  the  licence
away even for the first time - take it away. [Applause.] Under influence  of
medication I think when you get medication  the  doctor  tells  you  not  to
drive - at least just give R1 500 for the first time; R3000 for  the  second
time; R9 000 for the third time and for the fourth  time  take  the  licence
away.

Because of all these causes we face a deadly road that all road  users  have
to fear. Some of us will blame the road environment or  the  vehicle,  which
is correct. But what about  the  road  users,  drivers,  pedestrians?  [Time
expired.] I thank you.

The MINISTER OF  MINERALS  AND  ENERGY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  I'm
standing in for Minister Radebe, who was supposed to stand in  for  Minister
Omar, who is recovering at home. We wish him well, and  we  really  wish  he
were here. Minister Radebe is on his way to New York to list Telkom after  a
successful listing on the JSE this morning, whose shares  started  to  trade
at the level at which we wanted them to trade this morning.  So  it  was  an
exciting opening. [Applause.]

I am here representing my two brothers, and they ain't heavy.

I want to start off by making remarks based on some of the comments made  by
certain members, particularly about the Arrive Alive campaign,  because  the
impression that has been created is that the response of the  department  is
only the  Arrive  Alive  campaign.  There  are  a  number  of  comprehensive
initiatives that are being implemented by the  department,  and  the  Arrive
Alive campaign is but one; it's more visible, but it's not  the  be-all  and
end-all, and I think it's important to note that.

I think the hon member Redcliffe's  comment  needs  to  be  taken  seriously
regarding the traffic official from Mumbai. I would also like to suggest  to
the hon member that if he has not been to Mumbai he should do  so  in  order
to see how traffic works there. I think that would be an interesting  lesson
to learn.

I also want to highlight the seriousness of the subject  we  are  discussing
today. In December when we were witnessing the accidents and the  tragedies,
there was a tendency to focus  on  this  as  a  Government  problem,  almost
absolving the driver. There was also always  a  tendency  to  focus  on  the
Minister as if he were behind every wheel that was on  the  road.  This  was
extremely unfair, and, again, it absolved the driver.

I think what we saw this week in the long licence queues gave  us  a  sample
of the kind of driver we are dealing with and the  need  for  us  to  ensure
that we focus on driver education, and that we ensure that  they  also  take
responsibility and do not pass the buck, as the last speaker said.

So we have just finished another festive season. During the period  December
2002 and January 2003, many people lost their lives and many  more  families
were plunged  into  trauma  and  sadness  due  to  road  traffic  accidents.
According to the records of the Department of Transport, 1 210 persons  lost
their lives in 969 fatal road accidents during the December holiday  period.


This shows an increase of 34 fatal accidents  or  an  increase  of  3,6%  in
comparison with the same period the previous year. Of  the  persons  killed,
25,82% were drivers, 34,54% were passengers in or on  vehicles,  and  39,64%
were pedestrians. The severity of the rate of  accidents  in  terms  of  the
number of persons killed per fatal  accident  decreased,  however,  by  4,6%
from 1 031 in December 2001 to ...  I  am  sorry,  I  don't  understand  the
statistics.

It should be noted that  the  number  of  fatal  accidents  must  be  judged
against the backdrop of the increase in the number  of  vehicles  registered
in South Africa, the increase in the traffic volume as well as  the  vehicle
kilometres travelled over the festive  season.  Currently,  Government  does
not have a mechanism for monitoring the actual vehicle kilometres  travelled
on a continuous basis. This limitation means that accurate  comparison  from
year to year on the growth of the accidents cannot be measured.
The number of fatal accidents in terms of the number of registered  vehicles
shows an increase of 14,13% to 15,86% fatal accidents for every 10 000 self-
propelled registered vehicles during December 2003.

The important lesson to draw from here, and an observation that hon  members
should make, is that the  number  of  fatal  accidents  is  not  necessarily
higher during the month of December when compared with any  other  month  of
the year. Considering the number of monthly  fatal  accidents  per  province
throughout the year, it is evident that there are many months in  which  the
number of accidents is actually  higher  than  December.  These  months,  in
particular, are June and August when the days are shorter during the  winter
months and more vehicles travel during the hours of darkness. There is  also
more smog and mist on the road during that time.

There is a correlation between where the accidents happen, the  people  that
are affected by these  accidents  and  the  socioeconomic  circumstances  of
those people. There is also an interesting comparison between  South  Africa
and countries of the same level of economic development, such as Brazil  and
Turkey, where there is a highly developed economy on  the  one  hand  and  a
very underdeveloped economy on the other, and  where  you  have  people  who
live in  those  extreme  circumstances.  So  we  must  not  attribute  these
challenges only to the matters that are strictly to do  with  transportation
and the roads. It's part of the macroeconomic challenges  that  we  face  in
South Africa and the improvement of the quality of life of our people.

We need to ask ourselves how these  accidents  happen  and  why.  Statistics
have shown that in the order of 95% of all accidents happened  as  a  result
of a traffic offence. In the reports provided by the SAPS to the  department
it is clear that that is indeed true. It should  be  noted  that  statistics
have shown that an accident seldom happens because of one  factor  only.  In
most cases it is two or three, even a culmination of more factors.

The majority of  accidents  happened  because  of  reckless,  negligent  and
inconsiderate driver behaviour  that  can  be  related  to  an  offence.  An
unroadworthy vehicle with defective lights,  smooth  or  worn  tires  and  a
braking system that does not function properly further  contributed  to  the
number of accidents.

A detailed analysis of 21 fatal accidents in which more  than  five  persons
were killed was done. The  driver-related  factors  in  these  accidents  in
which a total of 149 persons were killed showed that 31%  of  the  accidents
happened because of unsafe and illegal overtaking  of  other  vehicles,  23%
related to speed and 15% related to alcohol. Fatigue played a role in  about
18% of these accidents, of which 66% happened  at  night  on  intercity  and
interprovincial roads.

So, clearly, the issue of driver responsibility and some of the issues  that
were raised by the last speaker are quite critical.

It was also found that, on average, overtaking offences increased  and  that
barrier lines are ignored by many drivers. This explains the high number  of
gruesome head-on accidents which usually claim the  lives  of  most  of  the
vehicle occupants.

With regard to alcohol, it was found that, on average, for the country as  a
whole, about 10% of drivers of vehicles and 7%  of  pedestrians  exceed  the
legal limit. For drivers this figure was highest in the Western Cape - yo  -
namely 21%, and it was about 20% for pedestrians  in  Gauteng.  On  average,
about 8% of drivers were found to be driving without a  valid  licence.  The
survey pointed out that  disregard  for  red  traffic  signals  is  a  major
contributory factor to accidents in cities and towns, and that  this  is  on
the increase. Speed also remains  a  problem,  with  about  44%  of  drivers
exceeding the speed limits. The statistics go on and on.

So, improving the safety of all South African road users in the new  century
presents an enormous challenge, a challenge we as  Government  are  prepared
to meet together with the community and  the  transport  industry.  However,
safety in everyday practice is a  shared  responsibility  of  the  different
spheres  of  Government  as  well  as  the  different  stakeholders  in  the
community and outside Government.

The  department  has  a  number  of  intitiatives  and  projects  that   are
addressing these challenges. There is  research  that  is  being  undertaken
which addresses the causes of accidents;  there's  a  fostering  of  greater
community  participation  and  partnerships  in  improving  road  safety;  a
promotional  and  educational  campaign  is  being  conducted  in  order  to
influence and modify road-user behaviour; and investment is  being  made  in
road design and road safety in order  to  improve  sites  with  car  crashes
occurring more frequently.

However, there were a number of proposals which were made  by  hon  members,
especially the chairperson, including certain  observations  that  he  made.
I'm sure that the department has taken note of that and  that  the  Minister
will be able to take note of them and do whatever he has to do in  order  to
improve the situation. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                       DEEDS REGISTRIES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

There was no debate.

Bill read a second time.

                            USURY AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  colleagues,  the
Usury Act regulates  the  limitations  and  disclosure  of  finance  charges
levied in respect of money-lending, credit and leasing transactions.

As at June 1999 money-lending transactions in  respect  of  which  the  loan
amount is below R10 000 are exempted from the provisions of  the  Usury  Act
on certain conditions.  In  terms  of  the  exemption,  money  lenders  must
registered with the regulatory institution recognised  by  the  Minister  of
Trade and Industry, and must conform to certain standards of conduct.

The  Micro  Finance  Regulatory  Council  (MFRC)  is  the  only   regulatory
institution that can register money lenders. The  mandate  of  the  MFRC  is
currently to ensure compliance with the provisions of the  exemption  notice
by registered lenders, while the DTI is responsible for those money  lenders
that remain unregistered.

The DTI has performed a number  of  proactive  inspections  of  microlenders
over the past three years. However, a large  number  of  these  microlenders
exist and many remain unregistered. For this reason it is the  view  of  the
DTI that additional enforcement capacity is necessary, to  ensure  that  the
abuses of microlenders can be effectively dealt with.

The purpose of the amendment is to  amend  the  Usury  Act  to  enhance  its
enforcement capacity by providing  the  regulatory  institution,  the  MFRC,
with inspection powers in terms of the Usury Act, and also to  provide  that
persons other than Public Service officials can be appointed as  inspectors.
The amendments propose that the Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  MFRC  be
given the same powers to appoint inspectors and require information  as  the
current registrar of the Usury Act.

The Bill defines, for the sake of  clarity,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,
inspector and the regulatory institution, and amends the definition  of  the
registrar. The definition of the registrar is being amended to  include  the
Chief Executive Officer, but this only in so far as the  powers  to  appoint
inspectors and obtain information from parties and declaratory  orders  from
a court of law apply.

I am of the view that the proposed amendments will enhance our  capacity  to
enforce  the  Usury  Act  and  protect  consumers  from  unscrupulous  money
lenders. The Bill would enable the Government to  discharge  its  duties  in
the most resourceful, efficient and cost-effective manner possible.

I welcome the request and the interest shown by the portfolio  committee  in
the overall approach we should be taking to the question of  interest  rates
and credit  law  reform.  We  have  now  had  some  experience  of  the  new
dispensation where we attempt to register microlenders, and I  think  it  is
appropriate to do what we are currently  doing,  which  is  to  undertake  a
review of this  whole  area.  We  will  certainly  be  coming  back  to  the
portfolio committee with our views of what may be necessary changes.

I would like to thank the portfolio committee and others for  their  support
in this respect. I think it is important that we add additional  impetus  to
our ability to please the microlenders. [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  1992  the  previous  government
published a notice which conditionally exempted  money  lenders  engaged  in
transactions below  R6000  from  the  provisions  of  the  Usury  Act.  More
specifically, loans of less than R6000 were exempted from the provisions  of
the Act, which  capped  interest  charges,  provided  that  those  who  were
engaged in this activity complied with minimal conditions  relating  to  the
provision of written notification to clients informing them  of  the  extent
of their liability, and abided by a three-day cooling-off period.

Coming  at  a  time  when  the  formal  banking  industry  was  increasingly
withdrawing from the provision of services to  lower-income  customers,  the
1992 exemption notice was a major  spur  to  the  emergence  of  a  sizeable
microlending industry in  this  country.  By  2001  registered  microlenders
alone were dispersing an estimated R10 million  in  loans  each  month,  and
this was an industry with a combined turnover totalling over R14 billion.

The microlending industry has become something of a double-edged  sword.  On
the one hand it provides access to  much-needed  credit  for  poorer  people
excluded from the facilities of the  formal  of  banking  industry.  On  the
other hand,  the  microlending  sector  has  been  severely  criticised  for
widespread malpractice and the exploitation of borrowers. What we have  seen
is the emergence of an industry providing mainly  consumer  credit  to  wage
and salary individuals and those in  receipt  of  welfare  payments,  rather
than funds for developmental or productive activity.

Among the abusive practices that have been  reported  over  the  years  have
been the withholding of IDs, bank cards and pin numbers, as well as  strong-
arm enforcement tactics, the harassment of persons  in  pension  queues  and
the charging of extremely high interest rates of over 30% a month.

The relationship between lenders and  borrowers  is  an  inherently  unequal
one. This was recognised even in biblical times. At this  point  I  want  to
quote from the Bible, but before I do so, I just want to point  out  that  I
am not about to walk over to the ACDP!

Today's lesson, then, is from the Book of Proverbs 22:7,  and  it  reads  as
follows:


  The rich man lords it over the poor, the borrower is the lender's slave.

That is the end of the lesson! Money-lending is, in short, an activity  that
has long been recognised - even from ancient times - as being  in  desperate
need of regulation to protect borrowers  against  abuse  by  lenders  in  an
inherently  unequal  relationship.  It  is  also  in  need   of   prudential
regulation.

The DTI is responsible for the administration of the  Usury  Act,  and  made
its first logical  consumer  protection  regulation  by  way  of  a  revised
exemption notice which was published in July 1999, following, I  might  add,
hearings in  portfolio  committee  of  the  previous  parliament.  The  1999
exemption notice raised the ceiling for eligible loans from  R6 000  to  R10
000. However, it required any business taking advantage  of  this  provision
to affiliate to an approved regulatory institution.

The revised exemption notice also set an interest rate cap at 10  times  the
prime lending rate for institutions operating  under  this  provision.  Most
unfortunately, in my view the court struck down this provision on  technical
and procedural  grounds.  As  the  Minister  indicated,  the  Micro  Finance
Regulatory Council was later designated as a regulatory agency, in  term  of
the exemption notice, and has been up and running for some years now.  Among
the other things that it proscribes is  the  practice  of  withholding  IDs,
bank cards and pins by its members,  and  it  has  introduced  a  system  of
administrative fining.

A major loophole in existing legislation is that the MFRC has  not  had  any
jurisdiction outside of its registered membership base. It has not  had  any
authority to act against unregistered microlenders who may  be  contravening
the Usury Act. Enforcement of the terms of the  conditional  exemption  from
the Usury Act have been the exclusive  prerogative  of  a  small  number  of
inspectors employed by the department as public servants. The  present  Bill
aims to close this loophole  and  take  a  step  towards  a  more  effective
enforcement of regulations by allowing the CEO of  a  recognised  regulatory
agency to appoint persons other than public servants to carry out  the  task
of inspectors.

The committee agreed with the proposals  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of
regulation in this way,  and  was  unable  to  agree  with  those  who  made
submissions to us suggesting that because of alleged irregularities  in  the
MFRC and the DTI's inspectorate, some of which were  clearly  unfounded,  we
should reject this Bill. This Bill will be a step forward, in particular  in
enabling us to act more effectively against unregistered microlenders.

I want to suggest that one of the  early  targets  of  investigations  ought
perhaps  to  be  looking  into  the   activities   of   those   unregistered
microlenders who claim to be abiding by the provisions of the Usury  Act  by
charging formerly designated interest rates in line with the Usury Act,  but
also then impose a series of additional charges on top of  those.  The  Bill
will be a step forward, but it won't be a  panacea  of  all  the  very  real
problems.

I am pleased to see that the Minister indicated  that  there  is  a  broader
review of the regulations. The  department  also  told  us  that  they  were
considering redrafting the Usury Act to provide for regulation by way of  an
act of Parliament rather than an exemption notice. Certainly, the  committee
looks forward to engaging further on these matters.

In the meantime, we commend this Bill to the House. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The Rev Meshoe seems  to  be  thinking
that you were talking about good deeds, instead of legal deeds!  [Laughter.]


Mr C M LOWE: Deputy Chairman, Mr Minister, the intention  of  this  Bill  is
quite laudable and the philosophy of outsourcing the oversight  function  to
a nongovernmental body, the Micro  Finance  Regulatory  Council  (MFRC),  is
welcome. But behind the good  intentions  lies  a  failure  to  consult  any
parties other than the MFRC, and the ominous tale of  intrigue  and  failure
to act by the department.

Despite being statutorily obliged to, the  DTI's  Usury  Act  registrar  has
failed to provide consumers with the protection,  regulation  and  oversight
function they are entitled  to.  In  some  instances  where  allegations  of
contravention have been made, the MFRC stands accused  of  not  acting  with
the same vigour against  larger  banks  and  financial  houses  as  they  do
against smaller lenders, or any vigour at all.  The  registrar  of  the  DTI
appears reluctant to undertake such investigations.  Whatever  the  reasons,
not a single proactive inspection has been carried out by the  registrar  in
the past seven years.

In a letter to the editor of  Rapport  in  May  2000,  the  Director-General
excuses us by saying, and I quote:


  The fact that the majority of the South African population still does not
  have access to the formal banking sector, played a contributing  role  in
  the decision not to prioritise alleged contraventions by large  financial
  institutions towards a small, well-educated minority group.

This frankly racist remark completely ignores  the  fact  that  80%  of  the
microloan industry is controlled by  the  registered  commercial  banks  and
implies that if you are a member of a small, well-educated  minority  group,
then you are actually a second-class citizen and the  state  will  take  its
time protecting you, if it does so at all.

Where accusations of overcharging  have  been  brought  to  the  registrar's
attention, she has simply failed to act. An example is Saambou Bank,  which,
for seven years until February 1999,  ignored  a  Reserve  Bank  warning  to
credit bond-holders with early repayments before calculating interests  due.
Why did the registrar or the MFRC not act? At  what  cost  to  the  taxpayer
must the Saambou curator now sift through the mess and repay clients of  the
former building society money that they were overcharged?

Frankly, it is no surprise that the registrar  failed  to  respond,  because
she was impossible to reach. The  DTI  had  no  less  than  eight  different
numbers for her, all of which  went  unanswered.  Neither  the  department's
call centre nor their communications staff knew how  to  get  hold  of  her.
They did have a number that actually belonged to a frustrated Department  of
Agriculture official, who has been trying for two years  to  get  the  Trade
and Industry staff to stop referring such calls to him.

Under the registrar's tenure case files have  been  lost;  there  have  been
five known complaints about poor service lodged with the  public  protector;
and even a charge of defeating the ends of justice  laid  against  her  with
the  SAPS.  Finance  Minister  Trevor  Manuel  correctly  said  that  public
servants who did not do their job should resign.

The DA believes he should go further. Public servants who  fail  to  deliver
service, who  appear  to  wilfully  obstruct  the  law  and  fail  the  very
consumers who pay their salaries,  should  be  fired.  But  far  from  being
fired, the registrar has not even been  disciplined,  but  simply  moved  to
another department. There is still time to correct that, Mr  Minister,  sir.
In the immortal words of your colleague, ``it is the right thing to do.''

The Bill seeks to sweep the DTI's shortcomings under the  carpet.  It  fails
to address the charges of favouritism or the calls for an enquiry  into  the
MFRC. It does nothing to prevent speculators from continuing  to  borrow  at
market rates and lend in the micromarket  for  exorbitant  profits.  The  DA
opposes the Bill.

I would also at this stage like to thank the Trade  and  Industry  portfolio
chair, Dr Rob Davies, and his colleagues for welcoming me so warmly  to  the
committee.  My  appreciation  to  my  predecessor,  Nigel  Bruce,  for   his
groundwork on which my contribution today is based. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Mr Deputy Chairman, the IFP will support the Usury  Amendment
Bill, although certain questions can  be  asked  about  the  appointment  of
inspectors from the private sector  to  assist  the  existing  inspectorate,
particularly their appointment from the macrofinancing sector itself.

I am, however, confident that the Minister and the department would be  able
to sort out any irregularity, should it ever occur.  The  hon  Dr  Buthelezi
previously said Minister Trevor  Manuel  is  probably  the  most  successful
Finance Minister. Today I want to pay tribute  to  the  hon  Alec  Erwin  by
stating that he is probably the  best  Trade  and  Industry  Minister  ever.
[Applause.]

This is probably my last speech  in  this  Parliament,  so  I  indulge  your
patience if I deviate slightly. I have served on the Portfolio Committee  on
Trade  and  Industry  since  1994.  During  that  period  we  naturally  had
differences of opinion, but by far, in the majority  of  cases  we  were  in
agreement with each other. In this committee we  experienced  a  significant
degree of openness, and I even had the opportunity to have some of my  ideas
taken on board and even implemented.

My thanks to the chairman, Rob Davies, and other members of  the  committee.
We had indeed become a wonderful team, as well as friends. Can I also  refer
lightheartedly to our team effort in going  to  Belfast  under  the  capable
leadership of the hon Connie September? I think this will  rate  as  one  of
the most memorable occasions ever.

After 22 years in active politics, 16 of which were in this Parliament,  one
becomes part of the furniture and it may be time to move on.  I  can  surely
say that I have had hundreds of friends in this Parliament and not a  single
enemy. Political opponents, yes, but  after  the  debates  we  could  always
shake hands and be friends.

To all members and colleagues, thank you for your  friendship,  particularly
the parliamentary golf club and my golf colleagues.  May  I  also  thank  my
party, the IFP, particularly my leader, Dr  Buthelezi,  and  the  leadership
for the confidence they have shown in me by deploying  me  in  the  Kwazulu-
Natal legislature? I can only give my best, and hope that my  presence  will
make a positive contribution in Kwazulu-Natal.

Vele kollegas en vriende het dikwels gewonder waarom ek altyd  Engels  praat
in die Parlement en waarom ek meesal in Engels debatteer.  Feit  is,  meeste
van my kollegas in die IVP is Zulusprekend, en 'n mens  het  maar  'n  soort
lingua franca nodig. Uit respek vir hulle  wonderlike  toegewydheid  en  hul
beleefdheid teenoor my al die tyd het ek besluit dat ek  maar  altyd  Engels
sal praat. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Many colleagues and friends have often wondered why I always speak  English
in Parliament and why I debate for the most part in  English.  The  fact  is
that most of my colleagues in the IFP  speak  Zulu,  and  one  does  need  a
lingua franca. Out of respect  for  their  wonderful  dedication  and  their
unfailing politeness  towards  me  I  decided  that  I  would  always  speak
English.]

In conclusion, may I pay tribute to the Speaker and the Deputy  Speaker,  as
well as the Secretariat. Your courtesy and dedication have been  an  example
of how the Speaker's chair should be handled.

Thank you, colleagues, go  well.  I  wish  you  the  best  for  the  future.
Totsiens, baie dankie, ngiyabonga kakhulu. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think, on behalf of  all  the
members, I can say to the hon member, ``Hamba kahle!'' [Go well!]

Dr R T RHODA: Chairperson, usury is interest at a much higher rate than  the
law allows. A usurer is a person who charges more  than  the  maximum  legal
rate. I am  told  that  in  biblical  times  this  was  forbidden,  but  was
permitted later during the time of the Roman Empire.

In general people regarded interest and usury as  synonymous  up  until  the
middle ages, because most of the borrowers were - and  still  are  -  people
who needed money to obtain the necessities  of  life.  A  difficulty  arose,
however, because the risk and cost of  making  these  small  loans  were  so
great that legitimate  dealers  would  not  handle  such  loans.  This  gave
illegitimate loan sharks their opportunity.

The Bill is an amendment to provide for persons other  than  public  service
officials to be appointed  to  inspect  the  activities  of  a  moneylender,
credit guarantor or lessor. In our townships,  where  people  have  suffered
economic deprivation for  several  generations,  the  money-lending  culture
enables the poor to cope with their extreme circumstances. This, of  course,
allows the moneylender to thrive like hell.

In townships moneylenders are moneymakers. Payday is rip-off day.  One  only
has to visit  the  payout  points  on  payday  to  witness  this  truly  sad
situation. Payday is moneylenders day, as the moneylenders descend on  farms
to intimidate and harass the people. Moneylenders in the guise of  vegetable
vendors, fish vendors, tavern operators and informal  traders  descend  like
vultures and vampires upon the frail, weak and  defenceless  pensioners  and
other social grantees, only to strip them clean and force them back  into  a
state of total dependency and indebtedness on these rogues.

The same drama plays itself out month after month,  unfortunately.  They  do
this ruthlessly, fearlessly and without shame, and at times  they  are  even
assisted by security officials who are supposed to  be  actually  protecting
them by securing the area. These security officials go in and actually  help
the loan sharks to get the money out of these poor souls.

Unfortunately, however, the culture of moneylending, like any other  culture
or tradition, is self-perpetuating. Collectively,  we  must  find  ways  and
means to break this moneylending  culture,  which,  of  course,  is  closely
linked to poverty, as we all know. We must  try  to  help  and  educate  our
people to discipline themselves and  try  to  budget  more  carefully.  This
culture can only be broken, I suppose, once there  is  more  employment  and
less dependence on social grants.
The New NP supports the amendment. I thank you.

Mr T  ABRAHAMS:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  allow  me,
firstly, to wish both the hon Hennie Bekker and Oom Jan well  in  their  new
venture. They are both very good friends and opponents. We will miss you  in
the National Assembly. Our loss is KwaZulu-Natal's gain.

I must mention that I stand here in the place of Mr Cedrick Frolick, who  is
the member of the UDM on the committee. I am the alternate,  as  Mr  Frolick
cannot be here today.

The Usury Amendment Bill before this House today seeks to extend the  powers
of the CEO  in  the  office  of  the  registrar  to  allow  him  to  appoint
additional inspectors from outside that office, to  assist  with  monitoring
the compliance of microlenders with the Usury Act and regulations.

The powers that this Bill grants lead in essence to the outsourcing of  this
function, in order to address  the  lack  of  capacity  in  the  registrar's
office, which currently has only 15 inspectors at its  disposal.  Monitoring
the microlenders' compliance within the usual prescriptions is a  vital  and
necessary function that cannot under any circumstances be neglected.

Too many South Africans have been preyed upon  by  ruthless  individuals  in
the microlending sector, causing untold  damage  to  their  livelihoods  and
health. In addition, the industry  plays  a  significant  role  in  bringing
millions of marginalised South Africans into the economic mainstream.

Harmful business practices undermine  this  vital  role  and  discredit  the
valiant  efforts  of  human  and  responsible  microlenders.  The  Bill  is,
therefore, necessary and the party will support  it,  but  we  must  caution
that candidates must be stringently evaluated to ensure that only people  of
the highest integrity are selected.

It is especially important that nobody is selected for such  a  position  if
that person has a direct pecuniary interest in  the  microlending  industry,
in order to avoid conflicts  of  interest.  Government  must  be  thoroughly
aware of and alert to the potentially damaging ... [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chair, the MF supports  the  Usury  Amendment  Bill.
The MF has always stood firm  on  the  question  of  the  community  working
closely with the Government and vice versa, as well as co-operation  between
the public and the  private  sectors.  In  the  light  of  this,  the  Usury
Amendment Bill  is  supported,  since  it  positively  influences  relations
between the public and private sectors.

While the MF does support  the  Usury  Amendment  Bill,  concern  is  hereby
expressed that it allows the registrar to  delegate  or  assign  powers  and
duties, not only to public servants, but to someone in the  private  sector.
The question should be asked here: Who shall these officials,  in  turn,  be
accountable to, and what mechanisms are in place to  ensure  efficiency  and
accountability?

The MF feels that this is extremely important, and needs to be  dealt  with,
noting the importance of making this sector efficient. Further, it  is  felt
that an outside eye  to  inspect  the  activities  of  moneylenders,  credit
grantors and lessors may put a tight spin  on  their  activities.  But  what
mechanisms are in place to ensure proper control over  inspectors  from  the
private sector, and to prevent corruption?

Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you,  hon  member.  The  next
speaker is the hon September. I think she might tell us a little  bit  about
her visit to Ireland!

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Deputy Chairperson, we are dealing with  the  Microlending
Bill, not Ireland!

Let me take this opportunity to say to Oom Hennie ...

... ek dink ons gaan jou definitief mis. Dis 'n jammerte dat jy weggaan  uit
die Nasionale Vergadering. Jy was 'n regte staatmaker in die komitee as  dit
gekom het by wetsontwerpe en so aan, maar laat dit  goed  gaan  in  KwaZulu-
Natal. Ek hoop ons sien jou in ons banke in 2004. (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[... I think we are definitely going to miss you. It is a pity that you  are
leaving the National Assembly. You were a real  stalwart  on  the  committee
when it came to Bills and so on, but I wish you  well  in  kwaZulu-Natal.  I
hope we will see you there in our benches in 2004.]

The amending Bill allows for persons other than Public Service officials  to
be appointed as inspectors to inspect  activities  of  moneylenders,  credit
grantors and lessors.  The  South  African  financial  sector  is  generally
perceived to maintain a bias against black people, women and youth  who  use
some form  of  small-scale  lending  or  microfinancing  to  start  a  small
business, or those who need student fees, burial fees, and so on.
In South Africa, microlending is a billion-rand industry and plays  a  major
role in the economy. Already in 1999 the Minister of Finance stated  in  his
Budget Speech, and I quote:


  Too many people have become hostage to unscrupulous  moneylenders.  There
  is a place for the microlending industry, but we will  not  tolerate  the
  blatant exploitation that appears to be taking place at the moment.

The majority of complaints about alleged contraventions  of  the  Usury  Act
relate to microlending regulations. It remains the duty of the registrar  of
the Usury Act in the Department of Trade  and  Industry  to  protect  people
such as  pensioners,  the  illiterate  and  the  poor  against  unscrupulous
lenders. To explain this, I would like to  turn  to  some  surveys  that  we
conducted when I was still in the clothing and textile industry.  Certainly,
it shows that microloans are a major issue, if not the biggest  contributing
factor, when it comes to absentees in factories.

When workers cannot meet their financial commitments,  they  would  turn  to
microlenders for help and get further and further into this debt  trap.  The
ease with which one can acquire a  loan  from  these  lenders  makes  people
approach a different lender time and  time  again,  which  results  in  this
process repeating itself again and again. When  hidden  charges  are  added,
workers don't know how to get out of this debt trap.

We also find that some microlenders still keep their clients' IDs  and  bank
cards. After the lenders have collected their  share,  the  workers  collect
the change, if any. Although this is  all  against  the  law,  workers  will
allow this practice to continue as they  are  desperate  to  get  access  to
credit. Some of them end up having garnishee orders taken against them.

This cycle of misery is continuing in the area of microlending. We  are  not
crossing over to the ACDP, but I  also  want  to  quote  from  the  Book  of
Matthew in this instance, where it says that when Peter,  James  and  others
were in an economic crisis trying to fish for the whole  night,  fishing  in
shallow water, they did not catch any fish. Jesus came  and  said  to  them,
``Go deeper.'' That is  unlike  the  unscrupulous  lenders  who  are  taking
people even out of shallow waters to go and try the dry land. [Applause.]

The measures to control moneylenders remain weak and the  amendment  to  the
Usury Act will allow for some form of regulation  of  the  industry  in  the
form  of  the  inspectors.  These  inspectors  should   proceed   into   the
investigation stage well aware that they will receive proper  protection  by
a law that is transparent and fair.

Because of the kind of problems that we are  experiencing,  we  as  the  ANC
would like to make a number of proposals to take  on  board.  Some  of  them
would be that the lending institutions must have a clear  mandate  in  terms
of their  development  role  and  that  the  regulatory  framework  for  the
financial sector must  be  made  accountable,  responsive,  transparent  and
development-focused.

The Government must start making available the announcement  that  was  made
by the President on the Apex Fund that the Banks Act be reviewed  to  create
an abling environment for the financial institutions to lend to  poor  women
with savings and that the interest exemption  requirement  for  microlenders
under the Usury Act be revisited.  People  must  also  be  educated  on  the
dangers that pyramid schemes pose for the poor  population.  Here  again  we
are saying that this could be done through our constituency offices.

I  would  like  to  conclude  by  saying  that  the  financial  legislation,
regulations and  rules  are  necessary  to  help  control  the  microlending
industry in South Africa. Therefore, we would welcome a much  broader  input
into the Bill, unlike the amendment  we  had.  The  proposals  that  we  are
making could later surface into the overall Bill.

On the questions raised by the new member of our committee,  I  do  want  to
assure the Minister that all these areas - eg the failure to consult  or  to
protect the registrar - were all dealt with  in  the  committee.  They  were
answered  very  well  by  the  relevant  officials   from   the   Minister's
department. It is unfortunate that the member was not in the meeting at  all
to listen to all of this,  and  one  is  quite  surprised  that  he  is  now
opposing something that he didn't even listen to in the meeting.

I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank
those speakers who supported this amendment. It is a limited  but  necessary
amendment, in my view. I am somewhat inspired by all the Biblical quotes.  I
do feel tempted at times that I should do what Christ himself did, and  that
is  to  go  and  clean  out  the  moneylenders,  because  this  industry  is
problematic. But it does, at the same time, in many respects fulfil  a  very
important function in our  society,  as  the  hon  member  Connie  September
indicated.

One of the things that I have  been  very  pleased  about  in  my  years  as
Minister of Trade and Industry  is  the  very  constructive  role  that  the
portfolio committee has played time and again on  critical  issues  such  as
small business. They have made important inputs. I would urge them  in  this
whole area to do the same, ie to think about this matter very carefully  and
assist us to make a better law.

I know the hon member Louw is a new member of the committee, and I  hope  he
won't take exception to the advice I am going to  give  him.  I  do  believe
that one of the qualities of this committee has been  a  careful  assessment
of everything that is put before it. Do not listen  to  everything  you  are
told by vested interests that come before this committee.

In fact, more thought should have been given to  this.  An  important  point
was being made, but in a very jumbled fashion, and that is that there is  an
overlap between the regulation of the financial institutions, the Usury  Act
and consumer protection.

It has been a source of concern, as pointed out by  the  Nel  commission  as
well, that you can have a position where things fall between the gaps.  They
are not quite covered by the Usury Act or by banks supervision, and we  need
to look at this matter. It is  something  that  the  National  Treasury  and
Trade and Industry are looking at.

In any event, many of the issues that have been raised by the hon member  in
fact fall under another jurisdiction. What we need to  do  is  to  harmonise
this control in order to ensure that we  protect  the  consumer.   For  that
reason I am extremely puzzled: If the member has some doubts about  it,  why
is he not supporting a further attempt to regulate the industry? Really,  to
me this is quite bizarre.

Hennie Bekker, thanks for your  support,  and  not  just  because  you  said
something nice about me. You are  precisely  one  of  those  members  who  -
continuously, throughout the years - have made constructive points,  debated
the matters and addressed the issues. Obviously, in this area of  trade  and
industry there would always be times when we score political points or  play
politics. But at the root of what we are doing - and I think  the  committee
has done this very well - is that we try to build a better economy.

I think the role that you have played in this has been  great.  I  wish  you
well in my home province. I hope you play the same role there, because  that
is a province with great potential in its economy that must be realised.

Let me also assure hon member Abrahams  that  we  will  make  certain  these
people are of high standing. I  have  been  very  pleased  with  the  MFRC's
conduct. I think that the chief executive and his team are brave.  They  are
very committed to the regulation of this industry in a fair and honest  way.
We will certainly put in people who can carry out their  duties  trustfully,
faithfully and with determination.

This is a massive industry. There are many, many players who pop up all  the
time. I think it is correct that  the  community  should  help  us,  as  was
suggested. We need to deal more with complaints, that is why we  are  trying
to extend the number  of  inspectors  we  can  draw  upon  and  to  use  the
undoubted expertise that the MFRC has built up in  its  short  lifespan.  We
will work on that.

Hon Connie September, the question of credit at the micro level is one  that
we have been looking at closely. The purpose of the Apex Fund is to try  and
support those financial institutions at the micro  end  that  extend  credit
for productive activities  as  well.  I  think  this  is  one  of  the  real
challenges we face.

Far too much in this industry is for personal  financial  problems.  In  any
society with poverty or problems it is inevitable that this will  be  there.
We must, therefore, regulate any form of lending to the individual. But  one
of the challenges we are trying to address now is to ensure that  we  extend
credit at the micro level for activities that will build  up  the  work  and
productive base of the people that are borrowing.

Again, I will call on the committee to use its wisdom and  give  us  advice.
Thank you very much for supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Democratic Party dissenting).

The House adjourned at 16:32.

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     Letter from the Minister of Communications,  dated  26  February  2003,
     tabled in terms of section 65(2)(a) of the  Public  Finance  Management
     Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the delays in the  tabling  of
     the  Reports  and   Financial   Statements   of   the   Department   of
     Communications and the Universal Service Agency:


         Dear Madam Speaker


         The Annual Report of the Department was duly compiled and given  to
         a BEE service provider contracted to  do  the  layout,  design  and
         printing.


         Unfortunately  the  contractor  took   almost   three   months   in
         attempting to execute the project and thus  causing  the  delay  in
         meeting the deadlines of producing and tabling of the report.


         The Universal Service Agency had problems  with  the  publisher  of
         the Annual Report and they  had  to  engage  another  publisher  to
         complete the work.


         It is due to these  unforeseen  circumstances  beyond  our  control
         that the report was not tabled timeously as required  in  terms  of
         section 65(2) of the PFMA.


         Kind regards


         Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, MP
