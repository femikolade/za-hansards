                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  I  intend  moving
the following motion on the next sitting day in terms of Rule 66:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Auditor-General has produced a special report which  attacks
           certain  members  of  Parliament,  including  the  hon  Raenette
           Taljaard;


       (b)  he states that Rule 66 has been breached in that the allegations
           about his conduct were not made by way of a  substantive  notice
           of motion;


       (c)  the ANC  specifically,  and  the  Chief  Whips  generally,  have
           permitted a situation to develop where  provisions  of  Rule  66
           have been trivialised in that there had been no debates  in  the
           House following  substantive  notices  dealing  with  this  very
           issue, such notices having been given both by the  hon  Raenette
           Taljaard and the mover of the present motion;


       (d)  when Parliament reduces the effectiveness  and  the  meaning  of
           introducing a substantive motion by  preventing  it  from  being
           debated, it exposes all of those who enjoy the protection of the
           Constitution to being  attacked  under  parliamentary  privilege
           without  the  National  Assembly  having  the   opportunity   of
           examining and considering the allegations, or  of  accepting  or
           rejecting the allegations;


       (e)  this is also unfair  to  MPs  who  raise  serious  issues  in  a
           responsible way with the intention of having them debated;


       (f)  this failure by the National Assembly has undermined the  values
           of the Constitution and is to be deprecated; and


       (g)  therefore rejects the Auditor-General's  criticism  of  the  hon
           Raenette Taljaard and resolves to appoint an  ad  hoc  committee
           representative of all parties and with representatives of  Scopa
           and the Portfolio Committees  on  Finance,  Defence,  Trade  and
           Industry and other appropriate departments  to  investigate  the
           allegations surrounding the arms deal itself and the editing  of
           the  JIT  report  by  the  Auditor-General  either  on  his  own
           initiative or at the instance of anyone else.

[Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, could I address you  on
a point of order?

An HON MEMBER: No, you may not. Sit down!

The SPEAKER: No, I will decide whether he may  address  me  on  a  point  of
order. I am not sure who made that comment, but  that  comment  was  out  of
order! [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, there  are  two  issues
that I would like to bring to your attention. Rule 66 is  about  reflections
upon judges, now ...

The SPEAKER: Mr Nhleko, if  you  are  commenting  on  the  content  of  that
resolution it is out of order. The notice has been given in  terms  of  Rule
66. The practice is that the Speaker  then  looks  at  the  content  of  the
motion to decide whether or not it is something given  and  therefore  needs
further consideration. But if you are commenting on a  procedure,  which  is
what points of order are about, I will hear you.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Yes. The issue is that Rule 66  refers
specifically to reflections upon judges. We are asking you,  Madam  Speaker,
to look into the matter whether  the  content  of  the  motion  itself  does
actually tally and align with regard to Rule 66, and  that  with  regard  to
the last passage of the same ...

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Mr Nhleko, that is not a point of order, but I  will
happily receive a letter from you in terms of guidance on  how  to  consider
that motion. We will happily do that, so please address me on it.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, may I address you on the issue?

The SPEAKER: No, I have already said that I will  look  at  the  motion  and
respond to it. I will hear people in writing,  not  in  a  debate  here,  on
whether it was in order or not, or whether it fell under Rule 66 or not.
Mr  D  H  M  GIBSON:  Yes,  perhaps  Mr  Nhleko  should  read  Rule  66  ...
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: No, Mr Gibson, you  are  out  of  order!  [Interjections.]  Hon
members, I also want to indicate to you that I have previously said that  we
need to look  at  a  proper  procedure  for  Rule  66  in  the  Joint  Rules
Committee, because we have not got a  procedure  on  it.  But  I  will  make
specific responses in terms of that particular notice of motion.

       geval het en die wêreldwye roem wat hulle verwerf het.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  five South African red wines were selected as winners  in  their
           class during the International Wine and Spirits  Competition  in
           France; and


       (b)  the red wines  are  from  Hamilton  Russel  near  Hermanus,  the

  (2) congratulates the respective wine farms on  the  honour  bestowed  on
       them and the worldwide fame they have achieved.]

Agreed to.

  SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM - MS B THOMPSON DESIGNATED AS NEW REPRESENTATIVE
                                OF PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That  the  House,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  National  Council  of
  Provinces, designates Ms B  Thompson  to  replace  Ms  S  N  Ntlabati  as
  representative  of  Parliament  in  the  Southern   African   Development
  Community  Parliamentary  Forum  in  terms  of  article   6(3)   of   the
  constitution of the said forum with immediate effect.

The SPEAKER: Are there any objections to that motion?

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, even though it was not  discussed  with  the
Official Opposition we have no objection. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you, if there are no objections, that motion  is  adopted
and Ms Thompson will be part of the delegation of  this  Parliament  to  the
SADC Parliamentary Forum. Are there any other motions on the Order Paper?

                 MR E M SIGWELA APPOINTED ACTING CHAIRPERSON
                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without  notice:



  That the House elects Mr E Sigwela to preside during today's  sitting  of
  the House when requested to do so by a presiding officer.

The SPEAKER: Has that been agreed? [Interjections.]  I  thank  you  all  for
this great co-operation and agreement. He will then be the Chairperson  when
we require him. I hope he will be able to maintain order in the  House  with
this spirit of  camaraderie,  which  looks  like  an  end-of-term  schoolboy
approach to what is going on!

                             WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N F MATHIBELA (ANC): Madam Speaker, on this day, 26 June 2003, all of  us
remain proud and continuously dedicated to the just and necessary  cause  of
economic and social development for all South Africans. The role  of  women,
as has always been the case, becomes central. The Congress of the People  in
1955 and the adoption of the Freedom Charter by the ANC in  1956  epitomised
the important role women have continuously played in the  transformation  of
our society. Throughout the process women played  a  critical  role  in  the
mobilisation of people's demands.

Our  democracy  has  created  structures  and  institutions,  a  process  of
engaging issues of gender and the rights of children, especially  the  girl-
child. As our economy continues to grow, so does the need to empower  women,
to skill, educate and train them as part  of  a  broader  process  aimed  at
ensuring that there shall be work and security for all and that  the  people
shall share in the  country's  wealth.  The  Freedom  Charter  serves  as  a
guiding  light  in  building  and  consolidating  our  cherished  democracy.
[Applause.]

                           THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G B D McINTOSH (DA): Madam Speaker, two days  ago  the  US  Secretary  of
State Colin Powell wrote as follows in The New York Time:


  South Africa and other African countries are increasingly  concerned  and
  active on Zimbabwe, but they can and should  play  a  stronger  and  more
  sustained role that fully reflects the urgency of Zimbabwe's crisis.

There is some progress, with Zanu PF announcing yesterday that  it  will  be
prepared to enter a government of national unity even though it is  not  yet
prepared to look at the reasonable demand  by  the  MDC  of  a  transitional
government prior to fresh and free elections.

However, it is clearly vital that President  Mbeki  explains  how  he,  when
President Bush visits South Africa  within  a  few  days,  will  answer  his
legitimate questions on what South Africa, as  the  economic  giant  in  the
region, is doing  to  address  as  fast  as  possible  the  urgent  economic
knockdown, human suffering and human rights  abuses  in  Zimbabwe.  Southern
Africans also would like to know what those answers will be. [Applause.]

                         INVENTION OF SAFER PARAFFIN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs L R MBUYAZI (IFP): Madam Speaker, there is a new invention coming up  in
the form of a safer paraffin fuel aimed at making paraffin stoves safer  for
the poor people who use them. This comes after it has been found  that  many
paraffin stoves are lethal and responsible for thousands of deaths in  South
Africa, especially in the slums.

The conception of a safer  paraffin  fuel  by  Zinc  Energy,  the  invention
company, incorporates the use of briquettes and a gel as ingredients in  the
new invention. Zinc Energy has come up with two types of  briquettes  -  one
is solid and one is in  honeycomb  form.  These  briquettes  are  made  from
various low-quality minerals such as coal discard. It is reported that  they
dramatically reduce dangerous emissions and can be ignited easily.
The SABS and  the  Council  for  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  have
successfully tested the product and  seem  to  agree  that  this  technology
would save lives and protect  the  environment.  We  look  forward  to  this
invention and believe that  its  revolutionary  characteristic  will  indeed
save the lives of vulnerable people and also protect our  environment  which
is dearly needed to sustain future generations.

                        EMALAHLENI LOCAL MUNICIPALITY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B MTHEMBU (ANC): Madam Speaker, the tide has turned at  Emalahleni  Local
Municipality. We would like to bring to the  attention  of  this  honourable
House some exciting developments and achievements that confirm  the  clarion
call by our President and the  endeavours  of  many  public  representatives
which are currently unfolding at the  Emalahleni  Local  Municipality  which
consists of Witbank and the surrounding areas.

The Emalahleni Local Municipality achieved the  following:  It  successfully
and with ease merged three former TLCs in all respects in line with the  new
demarcations  of  wall-to-wall  municipalities;  it  participated   in   the
treasury-piloted DA-map  system  of  municipal  financial  management  which
assisted a great deal in resuscitating finances from a cash-book balance  of
R10 million to R34 million in a single financial year; and it  managed  with
the help of all  on  board  to  achieve  an  average  of  86%  payments  for
municipal services which has seen a growth in  payments  from  62%  to  104%
over the last financial year. The municipality has successfully  implemented
the  free  basic  service  plans  including  a  set  tariff  for  water  and
electricity. The councillors and people of Emalahleni deserve applause.
[Applause.]

                           MR TONY LEON AND THE DP

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP):  Madam  Speaker,  last  week  the  hon  Leon  had  the
following to say during the discussion of the President's Vote:


  It is under President Mbeki's watch that South Africa has moved from  the
  politics of the rainbow nation and reconciliation to the politics of race
  labelling and race baiting.

The hon Leon's outburst confirms what Ken Owen had to say about him:


  His style is that of a cocky little bantam, his  weapons  of  choice  are
  cleverness and historical contempt. He gets up black people's noses in an
  extraordinary way and the chemistry between him and Mbeki  is  the  worst
  South Africa could possibly afford at this juncture.

How can the hon Leon accuse the President of using the race  card  when  the
opposite has been proved? The  hon  Leon  is  the  leader  with  the  second
highest right-wing support. The DA's fight-back campaign has been proved  to
be a fight-blacks campaign. [Interjections.]

They use Zimbabwe for their own political agenda to spur on black fear.  The
hon Leon is right when he says: "He ignites the fires of hatred and  despair
that South Africans have worked hard to extinguish." But,  he  is  referring
to the wrong man. He should refer to himself. [Applause.]

The DA's poor attempt to remain the dealer of the  race  card  is  laughable
but then again also understandable, coming from a party  that  has  made  no
contribution to bridging divisions in South Africa. [Applause.]

                        GAMBLING IN THE WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S N SWART (ACDP): Madam Speaker, as producer price inflation  hit  a  30-
year low in May this year, economic experts say that the  result  of  better
interest rates should be to put extra money into consumers' pockets to  help
them get out of  debt.  But,  even  a  strong  economy  cannot  reverse  the
crippling  effect  gambling  is  having  on  people's  welfare.  With   over
R6 billion being spent  on  gambling  in  2001  and  over  70%  of  gamblers
spending money in casinos rather than  on  household  necessities,  gambling
continues to ruin people's budgets and lives, particularly the poor.
The ACDP therefore commends the City of Cape Town on its investigation  into
the link between casinos, the Lotto and other  forms  of  gambling  and  the
nonpayment of R2,5 billion in municipal accounts. Cape  Town  City  Director
of Income, George van Schalkwyk, reports that from information gleaned  from
council customers who are coming to  make  arrangements  to  pay,  the  link
appears to be real. He recounted one such incident in which a woman came  to
see the department and told them that  she  could  not  pay,  but  when  she
opened her purse a casino most-valued-guest gold card  fell  out.  According
to him church groups have also informed the council that since  the  opening
of Grand West the need for food packages has increased.

The Western Cape proposal to roll out 3 000 limited payout slot machines  is
a further example of the greed governing the  thoughts  of  those  entrusted
with the welfare of South Africans. The ACDP is of the view that  by  taking
advantage of many people's misguided and desperate hopes of  winning  money,
the Government is conveying the message that revenue from gambling  is  more
important than the welfare of South Africa's people. [Applause.]
                        CRICKET FACILITY AT MANENBERG

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D A A OLIFANT (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  on  25  June  2003  the  Manenberg
community on the Cape Flats witnessed the opening of a cricket  facility  as
part of a project which will benefit 12 schools in  the  area.  The  opening
was also attended by the Minister of Sport and Recreation.

We rise to commend all stakeholders, the community, the ANC-New  NP  Western
Cape provincial government and local business for this initiative of  social
partnership. We believe that such community  initiatives  coupled  with  the
SAPS operation to clean up will go a long way towards eradicating  crime  in
Manenberg.

We also believe that sport has a critical role to play  in  combating  crime
as it is through sport that we can claim our children back from the  streets
and in a way contribute to the moral regeneration campaign. [Applause.]

                  UKKASIE ARTS FESTIVAL AT WEMBLEY, LONDON
                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr  P  J  GROENEWALD  (VF):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  jaarlikse  UKkasie
Kunstefees  sal  vanjaar  weer  vanaf  11  tot  13  Julie  by  die  Wembley-
konferensiesentrum te Londen gehou word. Talle uitstallers en  verskeie  top
Suid-Afrikaanse kunstenaars sal vanjaar weer  aan  die  fees  deelneem.  Die
fees is ook 'n geleentheid waar  ons  plaaslike  kunstenaars  hulle  talente
verder kan ontwikkel. Hierdie Afrikaanse kunstefees, wat vanjaar  die  derde
keer plaasvind, het sedert dit die eerste keer  in  2001,  ook  te  Wembley,
gehou is  geweldig  gegroei  en  word  jaarliks  deur  duisende  jong  Suid-
Afrikaners wat in Londen werk, bygewoon.

Die VF is van die ontstaan daarvan betrokke by die fees en sal  soos  vorige
jare weer 'n stalletjie by die fees beman. Die VF is trots  om  hom  met  'n
fees van sulke hoë gehalte te vereenselwig en wil  die  hoop  uitspreek  dat
die fees net van  krag  tot  krag  sal  gaan  en  nog  baie  jare  lank  sal
plaasvind. Ons wil  dan  ook  vir  Maryna  Blomerus,  hooforganiseerder  van
UKkasie, en haar span sterkte toewens met die fees, en ons glo  dat  vanjaar
se fees, soos die vorige twee, 'n  reusesukses  sal  wees.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD (FF): Madam Speaker, the  annual  UKkasie  Arts  Festival
will again be held this year from 11 to 13 July at  the  Wembley  Conference
Centre in London. Many exhibitors and  various  top  South  African  artists
will again be participating in this festival  this  year.  The  festival  is
also an opportunity for our local artists to further develop their  talents.
This Afrikaans arts festival, which this year will be taking place  for  the
third time, has, since it was held for the  first  time  in  2001,  also  at
Wembley, grown tremendously and is  attended  every  year  by  thousands  of
young South Africans who are working in London.

The FF has been involved with the festival since its inception and will,  as
in previous years, again have a stall at the festival. The FF  is  proud  to
be associated with a festival of such high quality and wants to express  the
hope that the festival will go from strength to strength and  will  continue
to take place for many years to come. We also want to wish Maryna  Blomerus,
the chief organiser of  UKkasie,  and  her  team,  every  success  with  the
festival, and we believe that this year's festival, as  was  the  case  with
the previous two, will be an enormous success.]

                 GAMBLING IN WESTERN CAPE - REVIEW OF POLICY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr  J  BENJAMIN  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  in  the  light  of   the   current
unemployment rate  in  our  country  and  the  negative  social  effects  of
gambling on the poorer section  of  our  community,  the  ANC  welcomes  the
decision  by  the  Western  Cape  government  to  review,  with  a  view  to
rescinding, the  1997  decisions  by  the  former  DA-controlled  government
concerning the roll-out of slot machines and the building of  more  casinos.
[Interjections.] We believe that there is overgambling in this province.

The ANC is committed to building  a  healthy  livelihood,  and  not  to  the
impoverishment of our community. [Interjections.] The ANC does  not  support
the flooding  of  gambling  machines  into  our  rural  areas,  but  we  are
committed to the development of our rural areas and to  the  views  recently
expressed  by  Minister  Zola  Skweyiya  in  this  regard.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

             LABOUR LEGISLATION AND JOB CREATION IN SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C M LOWE (DA): Madam Speaker, Cosatu has attacked the DA for calling  for
sweeping changes to South Africa's labour system in  order  to  create  jobs
and get people back to work. While Cosatu is quick  to  defend  those  lucky
enough to be in their magic circle of employment, they ignore the  7 million
South Africans who do not have jobs and those who have given up any hope  of
ever finding a job thanks to the unfriendly labour regime.  [Interjections.]
By ignoring the jobless outside their magic circle, Cosatu is  failing  them
and it is failing South Africa.

Unlike Cosatu, the DA does care about the millions of people  without  jobs,
and our call to roll back inflexible labour laws, to  cut  red  tape,  scrap
Nedlac and introduce a two-tier labour market  will  mean  millions  of  new
jobs and thousands of small business opportunities.  [Interjections.]  South
Africa's job crisis requires  bold  and  innovative  attention  and  radical
surgery, and it is time that the ANC and Cosatu also spoke up for those  who
do not have jobs and not just for the lucky few who do. [Interjections.]

              SEXUAL ABUSE IN SOUTH AFRICA - INCREASED EXPOSURE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr  U  ROOPNARAIN  (IFP):  Madam  Speaker,  it  has  been  reported  at  the
International Conference on Sex and Secrecy in Johannesburg this  week  that
the rate of  child  rape  cases  in  our  country  had  increased  by  400%.
According to police statistics, 40% of rape victims are girls under the  age
of 12 years. Clearly this is a serious cause for concern as there  are  many
unreported cases. Also it makes it very  difficult  for  victims  to  report
cases of sexual abuse as they are usually dependent on the perpetrators  who
are known to the family.

One would argue that these things are not  new  in  this  country,  but  the
truth  is  that  such  incidents  have  been  happening  in  the  past.  The
difference is that  our  people  are  beginning  to  learn  to  expose  such
incidents, unlike in the past when everything was kept secret. Such  reports
paint a dismal picture of our country and tarnish the efforts  made  at  all
levels to fight this vile disease.

The Government is to be applauded for the role it has played over  the  past
years in educating our communities about the rights of the most  vulnerable,
but more needs to be done to ensure that these children reap the  fruits  of
a life of dignity and self-worth. We believe that mothers  should  take  the
lead in ensuring a safe refuge for their children.

               MAPUTO CORRIDOR - CROSS-BORDER TRAFFIC CONTROL

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof S S  RIPINGA  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  the  objectives  of  the  Maputo
Corridor are to encourage and promote cross-border trade, to boost  tourism,
to attract investment, to achieve regional integration and also  to  promote
the broader objectives of Nepad. Unfortunately  the  new  visa  requirements
flowing from the revised immigration laws of Mozambique have placed  serious
constraints on the free movement of trade through the Maputo Corridor.

The  ANC,  whilst  acknowledging  that  cross-border  traffic  controls  are
necessary, appeals to the Department of Trade and Industry and all  relevant
departments to intervene and stop the detrimental  effects  and  frustration
experienced by the imposition of this legislation.

           GAMBLING MACHINES IN KWAZULU-NATAL AND THE WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (Nuwe NP): Speaker, studies het getoon dat  meer  as
62% van werklose Suid-Afrikaners deelneem aan die lotery en dat meer as  67%
van diegene wat minder as R500 per maand verdien op hierdie manier dobbel.

'n Groter bron van kommer vir die Nuwe NP is egter die erkentenis deur  meer
as 71% van mense wat dobbel dat indien  hulle  nie  hul  geld  op  dobbelary
uitgegee het nie, hulle dit sou gebruik het vir huishoudelike  benodigdhede.
Dit is dus baie duidelik dat ons met 'n situasie op hande  sit  waarin  baie
huishoudings bereid is om hulle kinders se volgende maaltyd op te offer  vir
die geringe kans op rykdom.

Die ANC-Nuwe NP-regering in die Wes-Kaap het daarom  onderneem  om  te  keer
dat 3 000 dobbelmasjiene  by  onder  meer  kroeë  en  klubs  versprei  word.
Premier Marthinus van Schalkwyk van die  Wes-Kaap  het  ook  gevra  vir  die
hersiening van dobbelwetgewing.

Die IVP-DA-regering in KwaZulu-Natal beplan egter om 9 000 masjiene  in  die
provinsie toe te laat. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit toon baie duidelik dat die  IVP
en die DA nie  die  beste  belang  van  arm  mense  op  die  hart  dra  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Terwyl hulle besig is om vingers te wys en links  en  regs
karaktermoord te pleeg deur beterweterig vir almal te vertel hoe hulle  moet
regeer, kan hulle nie eens  in  die  provinsie  waar  hulle  aan  bewind  is
verantwoordelik regeer nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Daar is 'n goeie Afrikaanse uitdrukking wat sê: "Slim  vang  sy  baas."  Dis
wat met die DA-IVP gaan gebeur  in  volgende  jaar  se  verkiesing  waarvoor
hulle reeds  so  hard  baklei.  Baie  dankie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans member's statements follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Speaker,  studies  have  shown  that  more
than 62% of unemployed South Africans participate in the  lottery  and  that
more than 67% of people who earn less than R500 per month  are  gambling  in
this manner.

A greater cause for concern for the New NP is,  however,  the  admission  by
more than 71% of people who gamble that if they had not  spent  their  money
on gambling, they would have used it to purchase household  necessities.  It
is therefore very clear that we have a situation on  our  hands  where  many
households are prepared to sacrifice their  children's  next  meal  for  the
slight chance of riches.

The ANC-New NP government in the Western Cape has  therefore  undertaken  to
prevent the distribution of 3 000 gambling machines to, among  others,  bars
and clubs. Premier Marthinus van Schalkwyk of  the  Western  Cape  has  also
asked for the review of gambling legislation.

The IFP-DA government in KwaZulu-Natal is, however, planning to allow 9  000
machines in the province. [Interjections.] This indicates very clearly  that
the IFP and the DA do not have the best interests of poor people  at  heart.
[Interjections.] While they are pointing fingers  and  committing  character
assassination left, right and centre by telling everybody all-knowingly  how
they should govern, they cannot even govern the province in which  they  are
in power responsibly. [Interjections.]

There is, however, a good Afrikaans expression  that  goes:  "Slim  vang  sy
baas." [One can be too clever.] This is what is going to happen to  the  DA-
IFP in next year's election, for which they are already  fighting  so  hard.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, the ID's slot would have been taken by  the
ACDP, but they do not wish to use it, so the ANC may make a statement.

                ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE AND STABILITY IN AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr R M MOROPA (ANC): Thank you, Madam Speaker. More than  forty  years  ago,
in 1955, the people of South  Africa  gathered  in  Kliptown  to  adopt  the
Freedom Charter, and made a commitment to Africa and  the  world  that  when
freedom was achieved and a democratic state was established  we  would  work
tirelessly with other African countries and countries around  the  world  to
establish peace and resolve international disputes by  negotiation  and  not
war.

Our efforts in Africa and the world are underpinned by  this  understanding:
"There shall be peace and friendship!" In line with this clause the ANC  has
been facilitating peace on the continent. The people  of  Angola  have  laid
down their arms and rolled up their sleeves in an effort  to  rebuild  their
country. We salute the Angolans for this and we guarantee  our  support  for
their efforts.

The people of the Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  are  progressing  towards
achieving peace and stability. A government of national unity will  soon  be
established in that country.  The  transitional  government  in  Burundi  is
another example of our efforts  to  find  solutions.  The  solution  of  the
crisis in Sudan is within reach. Progress is  also  being  achieved  in  the
Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone  to  secure  peace  and  the  establishment  of
governments of national unity.

We salute the  collective  wisdom  of  those  African  patriots  who  worked
tirelessly to realise the dream of our forebears.

           THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND SOUTH AFRICA, IN
                  RELATION TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

                           THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, let us get a  few  points  straight.
South Africa, the United States of America and Zimbabwe are members  of  the
United Nations Organisation. When any issue, such as the  Zimbabwean  issue,
is tabled in the United Nations, all three nations  get  an  opportunity  to
address it there. [Interjections.] Order, please. When,  in  the  past,  the
issue came  to  the  floor  of  the  United  Nations,  all  three  countries
addressed the issue there.

Secondly, with regard to South Africa, both Zimbabwe and  South  Africa  are
members of the Commonwealth. When an issue is tabled  in  that  multilateral
forum, we address the issue there. South Africa, as a matter of fact,  is  a
member  of  the  tripartite  that  is  dealing  with  that  issue,  at   the
Commonwealth. Zimbabwe and South Africa are members of  the  African  Union,
and when that issue comes to the floor to debate  there,  we  deal  with  it
there.

Now, at the present time, the visit of President Bush  to  this  country  is
about strengthening bilateral relations between South Africa and the  United
States of America.

The US is not here as a school principal, to  find  out  from  the  students
what they have been doing. We are an independent country and we will act  in
multilateral forums and regional formations, as we see  fit.  Therefore,  we
are not about to account to anybody outside the multilateral forums. We  are
not under that obligation. It is misleading to create  the  impression  that
South Africa is accountable to the United States, as to  what  it  is  doing
about Zimbabwe. [Applause.]

                         CAPE FLATS CRICKET PROJECT

                        CRICKET FACILITY AT MANENBERG

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  would  like  to
register appreciation for the statement  that  has  been  made  by  the  hon
Olifant about the cricket project on the Cape Flats.

Indeed, whereas it is the responsibility of the police to  ensure  that  our
people enjoy safety and security through  policing,  it  is  important  that
projects like this one are, in fact, established in our country as part  and
parcel of the instruments we should use to combat crime. I, therefore,  want
to appeal to all of us here, that when we go on  break,  during  recess,  we
check areas  where,  indeed,  Government  can  establish  projects  of  this
nature, so that, as a united people working on the ground, we  can  continue
to fight crime. [Applause.]

                          GAMBLING IN WESTERN CAPE

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT:  Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  to  voice  my
appreciation for the statement by the  hon  J  Benjamin,  on  the  issue  of
gambling. I think I would  also  like  to  say  that  I,  and  I  think  the
Government as a whole, appreciate the statement and the  position  that  has
been taken by the government of the Western  Cape  on  this  issue,  because
they have shown some leadership.

Beyond any reasonable doubt, I think the Government, when we agreed on  this
issue of gambling, mostly thought that it would be done  in  a  manner  that
was more humane and in a manner that  would  necessarily  provide  what  was
supposed to have been provided.

However, at the present moment, I think, it is being taken a little bit  too
far. To have all these daily  lottos,  these  one  arm  bandits  -  about  a
million of them - released amongst the poorest of the poor,  becomes  a  bad
sign for me.

If they were released in Sandton, in Bishop's Court, or some of  those  rich
places where the DA rules, like Waterkloof, it would have been much  better.
[Interjections.] But the worst part  of  it  all  is  that  they  are  being
released in places where people have nothing to eat,  where,  for  the  most
part, the target, we know, is  the  pensions  of  elderly  people  or  child
support grants. I think this is wrong and I think it should  be  opposed  as
much as possible.

I also think that the ANC and the New NP in the Western Cape have shown  the
way. Other provinces should follow suit,  specifically  Mpumalanga  and  all
the others. [Applause.] With that, Madam, I would say I thank you.

                              CHILDREN'S RIGHTS

                        SEXUAL ABUSE IN SOUTH AFRICA
                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: There was  also  a  statement  that  was
issued by the lady  from  the  IFP  there,  on  the  issue  of  children.  I
appreciate that and on  behalf,  basically,  of  Government  and  all  right
minded people, men and women of goodwill, I submit that we all  really  have
to take a stand on the plight of  our  children,  throughout  this  country,
specifically now that we are going to do our constituency  work.  The  thing
that should come first is our children.

I hope the hon Leon will check whether the girl or lady who works  with  his
girlfriend  in  his  garden,  really  does  get  a  child   support   grant.
[Applause.]

               SPECIAL PROTECTION SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES
                           SEXUAL OFFENCES COURTS

                            (Minister's Response)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Speaker, we would like to endorse the statement of the  Minister  of  Social
Development, in that we are in agreement with  the  statement  on  rape.  We
continue to be concerned about unreported rape cases, but have expanded  our
mechanisms faster than ever before to meet the needs of people.

Despite the concern about unreported rape cases, we  would  like  to  inform
this House that more  people  than  ever  are  turning  to  our  courts  for
remedies in these situations. We now have  40  sexual  offences  courts  and
three Thuthuzelo clinics in full operation. Yesterday,  we  had  a  Canadian
representative here who has brought the  good  news  that  we  will  receive
additional funding from Canada for the expansion of our  Thuthuzelo  courts,
which is a welcome piece of news. In addition,  yesterday  the  unit  agreed
with us on a policy for strengthening ties between themselves and the  child
protection unit that forms an important link in this process.

I would like to agree with the statement that the  role  of  the  public  is
particularly important and, as we move  in  our  constituency  work  towards
Women's Day on 9 August, I would appeal to every member  of  this  House  to
take the message home, that  these  matters  should  be  reported  and  that
people have the right to insist on special protection from  our  court,  and
we need to put our children, women and disabled people in this area of  law,
as an absolute priority. We as a department do this  by  ring-fencing  money
in our budget and we call upon hon members to put the women and children  in
their community first.

        INTERNATIONAL DAY ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ILLICIT TRAFFICKING

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker and hon  members,  we  are
here  today  to  join  the  world  community  of  nations  in  marking   the
International Day against Drug Abuse. This is indeed  an  important  day  in
the calendar of the United Nations, humanity at  large  and  not  least  our
country in particular. This day highlights the fact that drug abuse as  well
as its illicit trafficking has indeed become one of the  biggest  challenges
facing humanity in the 21st century.

When the UN decided in 1987 to give attention to this  issue  by  dedicating
this day as the International Day against Drug Abuse, it sought to  call  on
and challenge humanity to  build  an  ongoing  awareness  and  consciousness
amongst the people of the globe that drastic steps and measures ought to  be
taken as a matter of priority to arrest the  proliferation  of  drug  abuse,
noting that this phenomenon had consequences for the  world  that  were  far
too ghastly to contemplate. The questions arising today are:  What  have  we
as South Africans done to confront this challenge? What more still needs  be
to done to deal with the issue of drug abuse and  illicit  trafficking  even
more effectively?

It would not be an exaggeration if I were to  say  that  South  Africa  has,
since the United Nations passed the resolution, done a lot  to  tackle  this
scourge, though there is still more work that  needs  to  be  done.  The  SA
Government from 1994, in particular, has made sure that this issue  receives
priority attention nationally, throughout  the  African  continent  and  the
globe.  South  Africa  has  also  been  very  central  to  regional  African
initiatives, including the drafting of the Côte  d'Ivoire  Declaration  last
year. South Africa is a signatory to almost all UN Conventions  on  narcotic
drugs. Our country is also taking an active part in the African  subregional
and regional matters relating to the fight against drug and substance  abuse
and trafficking.

South Africa has taken part in  all  major  global  deliberations  aimed  at
devising strategies to confront the drug scourge. Recently, a South  African
delegation played  a  significant  role  in  the  46th  Session  of  the  UN
Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna which, amongst others,  took  serious
resolutions and signed  a  declaration  to  fight  this  scourge  in  a  co-
ordinated global manner.

Even more importantly, the  Government  ensured  the  establishment  of  the
Central Drug Authority which, in partnership with the  UN  Office  on  Drugs
and Crime, civil society and other structures of society, has been  involved
in the development of programmes and strategies  to  deal  effectively  with
this problem as well as highlighting its dangers  through  public  awareness
programmes. I am happy to announce that one of these programmes, namely  the
Ke Moja anti-drug campaign, has been launched this morning at the City  Hall
in Cape Town, which is committed, under the banner  of  ``Let's  Talk  About
Drugs'', to engage in massive campaigns throughout the  country  to  prevent
drug abuse.

What is even  more  significant  is  that  this  day  coincides  with  South
Africa's Freedom Day. On this day, as one of the members has said, 48  years
ago, the people of South Africa, under the leadership of  the  ANC  and  the
Congress Alliance declared for all in  the  world  to  know,  their  Freedom
Charter, a charter that continues to inform the freedoms we now enjoy  under
our democracy. More importantly, this day also comes  against  the  backdrop
of  two  significant  developments,  namely,  Youth  Day  and  a  month   of
commemorations and celebrations  as  well  as  the  Growth  and  Development
Summit. More importantly, 1 June  was  International  Children's  Day.  This
also reflects the recognition that the issue of drug  abuse  is  intricately
and inseparably linked to socioeconomic challenges like unemployment,  which
are facing mostly the youth of our country.

The Growth and Development Summit and Youth Month are very important  events
and are intertwined in the overall quest of our Government and society as  a
whole to build a better life for all, especially the youth.  The  youth  are
the backbone of the  social,  economic  and  political  development  of  any
nation, particularly South Africa. It is mostly the youth that  is  affected
negatively by this scourge. Research conducted by the South African  Medical
Research Council and the Institute for Security Studies  in  2001  indicates
that those who abuse drugs are starting to do so at a  younger  age.  It  is
also estimated that the abuse of drugs costs the country  over  R11  billion
per annum. Drug and substance abuse often leads  to  absenteeism  from  work
and lower productivity.

We dare not forget that South Africa has been a free,  nonracial,  nonsexist
and democratic country for almost ten years, due  largely  to  the  sterling
contributions and supreme sacrifices made by the youth  of  our  country  in
various epochs of our history. We are talking of the generations  of  Nelson
Mandela, Dorothy Nyembe and Oliver Tambo, Chris  Hani,  Solomon  Mahlangu  -
the list is endless. Men and women who risked their lives so that all of  us
can enjoy the sweet fruits of liberty.

Apartheid is gone forever and we are indeed free at last. Yet  its  legacies
are still very much with us, including racism which some of us want to  deny
ever existed. They urge us to gloss over it as if it  was  an  insignificant
incident in our history. Worse still, they urge us to forget  and  not  talk
about it. We owe it to our children and future generations not to  do  that.
History teaches that to uproot any social ill,  including  racism,  we  must
confront it head-on, talk about it and expose its negative societal  effects
so that future generations dare not allow it to  resurface  in  our  country
and anywhere else on the planet.

The same goes for the problem of drug and substance abuse. We need to  raise
this issue even more vigorously in rural and urban areas, in rich  and  poor
communities, in schools, faith institutions, etc. This is in recognition  of
the fact that drug abuse and illicit trafficking is quite pervasive. It  has
penetrated most of our societal institutions, including schools  and  faith-
based institutions.

We witness drug syndicates mushrooming all over South Africa.  The  Southern
African region and  not  least  the  African  continent  have  become  major
outlets and producers of illicit drugs. Billions of rands are  made  out  of
this criminal activity. This has led to more social and moral  degeneration.
Research also shows that drug abuse also leads to the spread of  the  killer
disease HIV/Aids, as it often leads to  impaired  reasoning  and  judgement.
The use of injections further aggravates that problem.

Research also shows that there is also a correlation between drug abuse  and
the increase in crimes such as motor vehicle theft, rape, domestic  violence
and  housebreaking.  This   situation   has   been   worsened   by   complex
socioeconomic challenges like unemployment,  poverty,  HIV/Aids,  which  are
devastating many families and communities and are threatening to tear  apart
our very social fabric. We therefore need to act decisively now rather  than
later.

An integrated and comprehensive approach is  needed  to  solve  the  matter.
Special emphasis ought to be placed on  preventive  programmes  that  should
encompass economic, political and social as well as cultural  interventions.
Public awareness on this issue will  be  intensified  in  a  more  targeted,
aggressive and sustained way. We need role models that  will  help  us  turn
the tide  against  a  false  and  dangerous  consciousness,  which  is  fast
gripping our youth especially in the urban areas, namely `it is cool  to  do
drugs'.

To the youth of our country I want to say, drug abuse is a killer,  a  crime
and a social ill that often leads  to  violence,  including  gang  violence,
murder, domestic violence, rape as well as the abuse of women and  children.
It leads to absenteeism and  lower  productivity  at  work,  which  is  very
costly to the economy. Drug abuse often leads to the  painful  breakdown  of
families and tears  apart  the  moral  and  social  fabric  that  makes  our
country. In  essence,  drug  abuse  has  far-reaching  negative  and  social
effects and consequences for the youth and future of our country.

We must stop drug abuse now. Its proliferation must be  fought  with  vigour
now more than ever. Members of Parliament, individual families,  communities
and society as a whole, must get involved in this  fight.  We  all  need  to
make sure that we talk about this problem and its dangers  in  our  families
and communities. Even more importantly, we need to make sure  that  we  stop
drug abuse.
If we want to succeed and sustain this fight, we need to ensure that  it  is
integrated into our  overall  efforts  in  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, and thus the  reduction  of  unemployment  and  the  fight  against
HIV/Aids. Critical to our success in this direction, will be the  following:
strengthening the criminal justice system;  strengthening  co-operation  and
co-ordination of our strategy with  subregional  and  international  bodies,
agencies and institutions, including  the  UN;  building  awareness  of  the
dangers of drug abuse in all  spheres  of  our  society;  strengthening  the
moral regeneration programme and movement, giving  particular  attention  to
informing, educating and mobilising the  children  and  the  youth  in  this
scourge. Let us remember the old saying: `ligotywa  liselitsha'  [make  them
familiar with the situation whilst they are very young.]

In conclusion, I call on all parliamentarians  and,  most  importantly,  the
youth formations, faith-based organisations, community-based  organisations,
NGOs, labour, business and all spheres of government to be involved  and  to
fight this battle with us so that all of us can finally realise  our  common
vision of building a caring society and a better life for all. [Applause.]

Mrs  G  M  BORMAN:  Deputy  Chairperson,  the  DA  welcomes  the  Minister's
statement today. Thank you for that. But it is a pity  that  the  race  card
was raised again. If the ANC-led Government focused on issues, people  would
actually  get  delivery  on  the  ground.  That  would  make  a  difference.
[Interjections.]

As a mother who has been through those painful years of  teenage  rebellion,
when children are experimenting with their choices, I want to say that  this
subject today is very relevant. According to a report by  the  International
Narcotics Control Board, South Africa has  become  the  cocaine  trafficking
capital of Africa, as West African  criminal  organisations  have  moved  to
take advantage of the country's borders and ports. The US  Drug  Enforcement
Agency says Nigerian syndicates control about 80% of the  illicit  trade  in
cocaine in South Africa and reports by the British police warn  that  Durban
could become another Bogota with a looming drug war  over  turf  within  the
next five years. In fact, South Africa has become a  major  gateway  through
which illicit drugs move to the rest of the world. What control do  we  have
at the border posts?

The drug trafficking activities of organised  crime  groups  are  linked  to
numerous other criminal acts, as  the  Minister  has  already  pointed  out,
ranging from car hijacking and robberies to the smuggling  of  arms,  stolen
cars, endangered species and precious  metals.  South  Africa  now  features
prominently in international drug trafficking networks.

The rise of substance abuse poses  a  real  threat  to  the  future  of  our
country as children become the victims  of  drug  lords  and  peer  pressure
encourages excessive drinking. There is  a  strong  link  between  drug  and
alcohol use and the transmission of HIV. This is mostly  due  to  high  risk
sexual behaviour while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It has  been
demonstrated that unprotected sex is more  common  under  the  influence  of
drugs due to loss of control.

On a display board outside the old chamber, and I hope all the members  have
seen it, the Department of Social Development has a poster  displayed  which
has the following words:


  Only you control your choices, be prepared to stay in control.

It also says:


  Apart from the things that they do to your body, they also cost a lot  of
  money. Some people turn to crime to pay for their  addiction.  They  take
  away the control you have over yourself, your choices  and  your  future.
  They make you more likely to say `yes' to unprotected  sex,  which  could
  lead to unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/Aids.
  Drug addiction rips families apart and leads to heartbreak and despair.

I would hope, hon Minister, that this is going into all our schools as  part
of the awareness campaign. Thank you for listening.

This morning the Ke Moja (no thanks, I'm  fine)  Campaign  was  launched  in
Cape Town after a successful pilot project was  initiated  in  Tshwane  last
year. It aims to empower at  risk  youth  to  make  responsible  choices  by
providing them with  accurate  information  and  drug  awareness  resistance
skills. It is hoped that this programme will eventually cover the  whole  of
South Africa. The theme  for  International  Drug  Awareness  Day  today  is
`let's talk about drugs'. Parents are challenged to talk to  their  children
about drugs and alcohol.

The  control  of  substance  abuse  is  a  collective  responsibility.   The
Government, schools, NGOs, churches,  other  faith-based  organisations  and
families all  have  a  part  to  play  in  teaching  our  children  to  make
responsible choices. Our children need role models, people who will lead  by
example. Who do they have to look up  to?  The  DA  will  support  and  work
towards any efforts to alleviate  the  suffering  and  pain  caused  by  the
excessive use of drugs and alcohol. [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, I am not rising on a point of  order,  but  I  do
just want to say to the hon Minister that the hon Gloria  Borman  made  some
very important points to which the Minister was not listening.  He  was  too
engaged in a discussion with the Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party,  and  I
urge him to read the hon member's speech to ascertain what she had to say.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON: Order! I think you made your point even  earlier.
He heard you.

Mrs  I  MARS:  Thank  you,  Deputy  Chairperson.  Hon  Minister  of   Social
Development and colleagues, the  theme  for  the  UN  International  Day  on
Substance Abuse and Illicit Trafficking sends a very strong message  to  all
of us.

As the speaker before me said, the theme is ``let's talk about  drugs''.  We
need to know that globally an  estimated  200  million  people  use  illicit
drugs. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher.  This  means  that
almost 5% of the global population  are  involved  in  the  use  of  illicit
drugs. These figures highlight the fact that illicit  drug  trafficking  has
become an ever-expanding international menace to  our  global  society,  and
extremely profitable - that is for the syndicates and the traffickers.

The damage to society, as a whole, cannot be estimated. However, the  damage
to the social fabric of our society presents a grim picture. Every  user  of
illicit drugs affects their immediate family and community by bringing  them
closer to the criminal elements who, with the drug syndicates,  control  the
supply lines on which the user depends. Car hijacking, rape,  burglary,  and
prostitution are all directly connected to drug use.

Unfortunately, many drug users start very early in  life  and  many  parents
remain ignorant of this fact until it is  too  late.  Social  occasions  and
peer pressure are used to  introduce  our  young  people  to  the  so-called
recreational drugs. We need to be aware that many of our  children  live  in
households where alcohol is used excessively. Hospital records confirm  that
many  trauma  patients  are  injured  as  a  result  of  excessive   alcohol
consumption, which led  to  violence.  However,  more  recent  records  also
reveal that many trauma patients test positive for illicit drugs.

We have to strengthen our young people to understand the dangers of  illicit
drugs so that they are strong enough to resist the temptation. Young  people
often think that they  are  only  trying  drugs  for  fun,  and  erroneously
believe that they remain in control. We have to talk  to  them.  We  support
the drug abuse campaign which was recently launched by the hon Minister.

The state, therefore, has a huge responsibility. The state  security  organs
need to hunt down the drug lords, and identify and close  supply  lines.  We
cannot allow reckless, profit-orientated international gangsters to use  our
country as a field of operation. The IFP pleads that  our  police,  security
forces, and  the  criminal  justice  system  be  empowered  with  additional
resources to extend their operations in a manner which will put  an  end  to
the current threat to the safety and security of our youth.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Deputy Chair, a young  boy  watches  the  rush  hour
traffic, but nobody seems to see him. He lives in a murky world of his  own,
which he creates each time he sucks on the plastic bag  containing  glue  he
carries with him. When reality sets in he just has to take another  gulp  to
return to  a  temporary,  hazy  comfort  zone.  This  carries  on  until  he
collapses on the pavement in a muddled state - still nobody sees  him.  This
boy stands a mere 500 metres outside this House, and he is not  alone.  With
him is a larger group of faceless, desperate and hopeless children,  who  we
are failing. This is their reality and we can no  longer  drive  past  them,
and pretend they do not exist.

No talking or policy document will change their  lives.  They  cry  out  for
help; they cry out for action. Thousands of them walk  the  streets  of  our
cities while they are supposed to be at  home  or  at  school.  How  can  we
expect these children to say: ``No thanks, I'm fine.''  How  can  we  expect
them to make the right decision when weakened  family  bonds,  a  legacy  of
unemployment,  social  injustice  and  no  safety  net   have   created   an
environment where drug use offers an escape  from  the  harsh  realities  of
everyday life.

Given the formidable array of obstacles  still  facing  the  emerging  South
Africa, some people might say: ``Why  should  we  worry  about  this  abuse,
because it is not really that serious.'' This  view  would  be  very  short-
sighted. There are many ways in which drugs can affect crime, and  the  fact
is that people on drugs - just like people on alcohol -  act  in  ways  they
ordinarily do not. The Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Research  Group  has  been
conducting a serious of studies on the  link  between  substance  abuse  and
sexually risky behaviour among adolescents. [Time expired.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon members, in his opening speech at the  recent
international Conference on Drug Routes, President Jacques Chirac of  France
said: ``Drugs are a form of gangrene  that  threatens  all  countries.''  He
went on to say:


  International organised crime is growing rich from drug  trafficking.  It
  generates terrible corruption. The mafias  controlling  drug  trafficking
  are the same ones trafficking in persons and weapons, and  all  kinds  of
  other criminal activities. Their many  facets  can  threaten  efforts  to
  build up governments and democracy in new  countries.  They  are  worming
  their way into the core of the world  economic  system,  bringing  crime,
  violence and anarchy. It is our duty to muster our defences against these
  destabilising forces.

The metaphor that drug abuse is like a gangrene is very helpful. Society  is
an organic system, and it is not only made up of matter and  other  material
attributes. People make up a large proportion of our society.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Geagte Voorsitter,  almal  stem  saam  dat  dwelmmiddels
vernietigend is, en net hartseer tot gevolg het.  Verskeie  voorstelle  word
altyd gemaak oor hoe om jou kind se gedrag te bepaal, hoe om op  die  uitkyk
te wees vir tekens van misbruik ensovoorts.

Die VF is van mening dat die rol van ouers onderbeklemtoon  word.  Die  eise
van ons samelewing het tot gevolg  dat  die  ouer-kind  verhouding  aangetas
word, want beide ouers moet werk om die pot aan die  kook  te  hou.  Wanneer
ons aandag moet gee aan ons kinders en hul probleme is ons soms te  moeg  of
te besig. Ouers moet sorg dat daar meer tyd gemaak word vir hul kinders,  én
om aandag te gee aan hul probleme.

As ons kinders genoeg aandag en liefde kry  van  hul  ouers  sal  hulle  nie
eksperimenteer met dwelms om sodoende uiting te gee aan  hulle  verlorenheid
nie. Die boodskap van die VF is kort  en  duidelik:  Ouers,  wees  lief  vir
julle kinders, en wys  dit  vir  hulle.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)
[Mr  P  J  GROENEWALD:  Hon  Chairperson,  we  all  agree  that  drugs   are
destructive, and only lead to heartbreak.  Various  suggestions  are  always
made about how to determine one's child's behaviour, how to be on the  look-
out for the signs of abuse, etc.

The FF is of the opinion that the role of parents is being understated.  The
demands of our  society  adversely  affect  the  parent-child  relationship,
because both parents have to work to  earn  a  living.  When  we  must  give
attention to our children and their problems, we are sometimes too tired  or
too busy. Parents should see to it  that  they  make  more  time  for  their
children and give attention to their problems.

If children get enough attention and love from their parents, they will  not
experiment with drugs in order to give expression  to  the  fact  that  they
feel lost. The message from the FF is short and clear:  Parents,  love  your
children and show them you do.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, Resolution 42/112 of the General  Assembly  of
the United Nations that mandates member states to observe  26  June  as  the
International  Day  on  Substance  Abuse  and  Illicit  Trafficking,  is   a
milestone in the effort to have sober, diligent and vigilant nations. We  in
the UCDP have always encouraged abstinence or, at least, temperance  in  the
use of substances. We maintain that, be it alcohol or nicotine,  it  defiles
the body, soul, and mind.

While we in the UCDP maintain that all  role-players  in  society  must  act
responsibly, the Government must likewise govern  well,  and  put  in  place
programmes to combat the  increasing  drug  menace  to  nations  across  the
globe. The security forces  of  this  country  should  hunt  down  all  drug
pushers, and let them rot in prison with their wares.

While the United Nations calls  on  governments  to  make  a  commitment  to
reduce the supply of and demand  for  drugs  by  2008,  we  put  it  to  our
Government  that  drug  abuse  is  illicit  and  should  have  been  stopped
yesterday already.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. The MF applauds the SAPS  on
their crackdown on the trafficking of illegal drugs. The  antidrug  campaign
has been in full swing to rid South Africa  of  substance  abuse.  Community
awareness  on  the  subject  has  successfully  rescued   many   from   this
temptation.

However, substance abuse and illicit trafficking are still a  harsh  reality
in both poverty stricken and affluent areas, especially amongst  our  youth.
The MF calls on those  concerned  to  make  an  effort  to  investigate  the
symptoms, effects, dangers and withdrawal of substance  abuse,  so  that  we
may reach out and help those victims who  are  in  need.  The  MF  calls  on
communities to work with the SAPS in getting rid of these  drug  traffickers
who are a menace to society.

The MF supports the department in all its efforts  against  substance  abuse
and illicit trafficking. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, the NA wants  to  congratulate  the  hon  Minister
Skweyiya on the principled stance he took today on the  issue  of  gambling,
and on social and moral issues in general. We appreciate it, hon Minister.

Die NA ondersteun 'n holistiese benadering tot die probleem van  dwelms.  In
dié verband wil ons waarsku dat die poging van Minister Asmal  om  godsdiens
uit skole te verwyder, die probleem gaan vererger. Hy gaan  'n  vakuum  laat
wat gevul gaan word deur die god van dwelms. Moraliteit kan  alleen  verhoog
word  wanneer  daar  godsdienstige  verankering  spesifiek  en  nie  in  die
algemeen is nie.

Verder, Voorsitter, dissipline moet terugkom in ons samelewing.  Ons  totale
samelewing het geliberaliseerd geraak:  alles  word  toegelaat,  alles  word
permissief  en  ons  kinders  dink  dit  mag  dan  gebeur.  Ons   moet   die
gesinswaardes herstel - die gesin as bakermat van die samelewing  -  en  ons
moet omstandighede skep waarin gesinswaardes weer  bevorder  kan  word.  Die
hantering van werkloosheid en misdaad en die handhawing van wet en  orde  in
die algemeen is noodsaaklik.

Die NA doen 'n beroep op almal wat  'n  rol  speel,  kom  ons  gee  vir  ons
kinders vleuels maar ook ankers dat hulle  verankerd  kan  bly  en  nie  kan
twyfel in hierdie dinge nie.  [Tyd  verstreke.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The NA supports a holistic approach  to  the  problem  of  drugs.  In  this
regard we want to issue a warning that the effort of Minister Asmal to  have
religion removed from schools is going  to  aggravate  the  problem.  He  is
going to leave a vacuum which will be filled by the god of  drugs.  Morality
can only be enhanced when there is  religious  anchoring,  specifically  and
not generally.

Furthermore, Chairperson, discipline must return in our society.  Our  total
society has become liberalised: everything is  allowed,  everything  becomes
permissible and our children think that it may then happen. We must  restore
the family values - the family as the birthplace of society -  and  we  must
create circumstances in which family values can be promoted  again.  Dealing
with unemployment and crime and the maintenance of law and order in  general
are essential.

The NA appeals to everyone who can play a role, let  us  give  our  children
wings but also anchors so that they may remain anchored and cannot have  any
doubts regarding these things. [Time expired.]]

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI: Chairperson, before I start my speech on  this  day,  I
want to say that on this  day  the  Western  Cape  Women's  League  will  be
holding a memorial service for Mrs Mildred  Holo,  affectionately  known  as
MaHolo, at Zolani Centre in Nyanga this  afternoon.  MaHolo  died  over  the
weekend, and will be buried on Saturday, 29 July, at  her  home  in  Nyanga.
Hamba kahle qhawe lamaqhawe. [Farewell, hero among heroes.] We  will  always
remember the struggles you waged against apartheid and  the  fight  for  the
emancipation of women.

Imizamo yakho kunye namanye  amaqhawe  okulwela  inkululeko  yabafazi  yenze
ukuba  namhlanje  isininzi  sabafazi  ePalamente  nakoomasipala  sibonakale.
Eminye yaloo mizabalazo ibilwelwa nguMaHolo yile sithetha  ngayo  namhlanje.
Ukupheliswa  kokusetyenziswa  kweziyobisi  eluntwini  kuba  kuko  okubangela
ukuxhatshazwa  kwamakhosikazi  nabantwana  ngamaxesha  amaninzi,  yinxalenye
yayo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Your efforts and the struggle you and other heroes and heroines  waged  for
women's emancipation resulted in a considerable number of women  being  seen
in Parliament and in municipalities. Today we can see the  evidence  of  the
struggle that Mrs Holo participated in. In many  instances  substance  abuse
resulted in the abuse of women and children, and Mrs Holo  was  among  those
who fought against it.]

Today is the International Day on Substance Abuse and  Illicit  Trafficking.
We remember those who died, particularly children who  were  caught  in  the
crossfire, when gangsters under the influence and drug dealers  fought  over
their turf, and young children lost their lives in the process.

Many families are broken, and children suffer because one  or  both  of  the
parents are involved in substance abuse. In many areas  on  the  Cape  Flats
the  drug  lords  have  portrayed  themselves  as  role  models   in   these
communities. They drive flashy cars, thereby influencing young people to  go
their way. In some cases they approach needy families who borrow money  from
them to pay school fees, or money for food for  their  children.  In  return
these youngsters become their agents in selling the drugs at school.

One teacher commented that children come into the class totally spaced  out,
looking like zombies. We went to investigate  and  discovered  that  another
child is selling blue gum laced with LSD. This  teacher  reported  it.  What
may sound like a story line in Yizo  Yizo  was  a  reality  in  one  primary
school. And in this case, in the Western Cape,  the  youngest  addict  being
rehabilitated for abuse is nine years old.

While alcohol abuse is an old  story,  drugs  have  spread  to  all  schools
turning South Africa into some form of transit  area  for  drugs.  And  this
trade is co-ordinated largely by the gangsters. We also have to look at  the
Internet and television which are also blamed for spreading this scourge.

I want to make a special appeal to the youth of this country  to  take  note
of those who are bent on  destroying  this  country,  not  to  use  them  to
further their aims. Substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drugs, is  one
of the main components of crime in this country.

Perhaps we need to ask ourselves why people  use  drugs.  Perhaps  they  are
feeling stressed, they want to imitate other people,  they  want  to  forget
about their worries for a while, they want to  please  their  friends,  they
think it is cool to be high or they  want  to  experiment.  Sometimes  they,
particularly girls, are in relationships with other people who  sell  drugs,
and in some cases they want to prove that they are  grown  up  and  in  high
school. Whatever the reason, the fact of the matter is  that  drugs  destroy
the nation, and are the cause of the many problems we face in  this  country
as a nation.

Whilst the focus is on known substances like alcohol and  drugs,  there  are
others that may not be listed  but  are  just  as  dangerous.  In  a  recent
article Cape Town police warned  parents  about  a  particular  plant  which
would make their children high but also had deadly consequences.  The  juice
of this plant is known as moonflower. At present there  are  seven  children
reported to be in hospital after consuming moonflower. I want to  appeal  to
the Minister to investigate this plant because the consequences  will  later
be the responsibility of the Department of Social Development.

Many cases of rape and neglect by parents are the result  of  one  or  other
kind of abuse. In such cases we appeal for the improvement  of  the  justice
system, and a minimum sentence must be set as a deterrent. While  there  are
good security checks at our airports and harbours  to  apprehend  those  who
bring drugs into this country, we think more security checks have to be  put
in place on local public transport. Long distance buses, like Intercape  and
Greyhound, do not have security checks, and  are  seen  as  a  safe  way  to
convey drugs between cities and towns.

In a recent article Bobby  Hamman,  the  National  Director  of  Drug  Wise,
reported on date-rape drugs such as  sleeping  tablets,  tranquillisers  and
liquid ecstasy that are mixed with alcohol. This  is  added  to  a  victim's
drink with another substance. Once taken, the  concoction  leads  to  memory
loss for a long period. He said people subjected to  this  type  of  mixture
often find themselves in  unfamiliar  places  with  clear  signs  of  sexual
abuse, or rape, but no idea of what happened.

This morning Minister Zola Skweyiya launched an antidrug campaign, Ke  Moja,
which means `thank you, I'm fine'. And it gives young people  the  right  to
say no  to  drugs.  As  women,  mothers,  and  parents,  we  also  have  the
responsibility to warn our children against the effect of drugs of  whatever
kind. We have to raise this vigorously in  our  constituencies,  both  rural
and urban, and in rich and poor communities. This is in recognition  of  the
fact that drug abuse and illicit trafficking are  quite  pervasive.  It  has
penetrated most of our society and institutions, including schools.

We have to report to the police all unlawful acts  of  drug  syndicates  who
bring women from neighbouring countries, and other countries abroad, to  use
them as sex slaves. The recent programme about  women  from  Mozambique  and
Taiwan is a case in point. Police must also  get  their  act  together,  and
deal with those of their colleagues who connive with the drug syndicates  in
committing these acts that destroy our nation.

To the youth of our country, in support of the call by the Minister, I  want
to say, drug abuse is a killer. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

             PREPARING TO CELEBRATE THE FIRST DECADE OF FREEDOM
                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr  L  CHIBA:  Thank  you,  comrade  acting  Deputy  Chair.   Comrades   and
colleagues, my contribution to this debate centres on  tracing  the  origins
and briefly sketching the history of 26 June, that is Freedom  Charter  Day.
But before doing so, I wish to point out that exactly 48  years  ago  today,
in 1955, delegates from  across  the  length  and  breadth  of  our  country
gathered in Kliptown at the Congress of the People to  discuss,  debate  and
adopt the Freedom Charter.

Several delegates who attended that gathering are sitting here in the  House
today as members of Parliament.  Among  them  Mama  Bertha,  Comrades  Billy
Nair, Albertina Luthuli, Ben Turok, Dr Essop Jassat and Joe  Matthews.  Both
Comrades Ben and Billy addressed the congress. Comrade  Ben  moved  for  the
adoption of the clause, 'The people shall share in  the  country's  wealth'.
Comrade Billy seconded the motion.

For background information it is necessary to mention that  three  important
political developments in the late 1940s served to lay  a  solid  foundation
for the dynamic political developments of  the  1950s.  The  first  was  the
joint  declaration  of  co-operation  of  March  1947  between  the  African
National Congress and the South  African  Indian  Congress,  more  popularly
known as the Dadoo-Guma-Naicker pact. The  historical  significance  of  the
pact lies in the fact that it paved the way for a co-operative  relationship
in the joint struggles of 1950, during the defiance  campaign  of  1952  and
during the campaign of the Congress of the People in 1954 and 1955.

The second was the people's assembly for votes for all  in  May  1948  which
adopted the People's Charter. This charter  proclaimed  the  belief  in  the
ideals of democracy and the belief in the principles of  the  government  of
the people by the people and for the people. It pledged that people  of  all
races would not rest until  they  had  won  the  right  to  vote.  Both  the
proclamation and the pledge are reminiscent of the preamble and  the  pledge
of the Freedom Charter adopted seven years later.

Thirdly, the impact of the adoption on the 1949 programme of  action  cannot
be   underestimated.   The   hitherto   moderate   tactics   of   petitions,
representations and deputations by the ANC were replaced  by  the  far  more
militant tactics  of  mass  action  such  as  boycotts,  strikes  and  civil
disobedience.

Early in 1950 several leaders such as JB Marks, Moses Kotane  and  Dr  Yusuf
Dadoo were served  with  banning  orders.  The  Transvaal  African  National
Congress,  the  Johannesburg  District  of  the  Communist  Party  and   the
Transvaal Indian Congress convened to defend  the  Free  Speech  Convention.
They announced that on May Day there would be  a  stayaway,  firstly,  as  a
protest against the banning of our leaders  and,  secondly,  in  support  of
higher wages. Although the strike was a success, the day ended  in  tragedy.
As a result of police action, 19 workers were killed and 30 injured. At  the
time of this tragedy, the National Party of the time was about to  introduce
two Bills, the Unlawful Organisations Bill and the Group Areas Bill.

The ANC met  in  an  emergency  session  and  after  consultation  with  the
Communist Party and the Indian Congress, it  declared  26  June  1950  as  a
national day of protest and  mourning.  This  was  the  first  strike  on  a
national scale and laid the foundation for joint action among the  different
racial groups in planning and executing civil disobedience.

The next important milestone was the preparation for the defiance  campaign.
A joint planning committee of the ANC and the  Indian  Congress  issued  the
campaign's basic plan in terms of which  an  ultimatum  was  sent  to  Prime
Minister Malan to repeal certain unjust  laws.  These  laws  were  the  Pass
Laws, the Group Areas Act, the Suppression of Communism  Act,  the  Coloured
Voters Act, the Bantu Authorities Act and the Stock  Limitation  to  Prevent
Overgrazing Act.

Needless  to  say  the  ultimatum  went  unheeded  and  the  laws   remained
unrepealed. This paved the way for the launching of  the  defiance  campaign
on 26 June 1952, which was the second anniversary of  26  June.  Disciplined
batches of volunteers went into action. The first  batch  of  52  volunteers
was led by the late Comrade  Walter  Sisulu  and  Nana  Sita  into  Boksburg
location without having the necessary permits.  By  the  time  the  defiance
campaign was called off several months later more than 8 000 volunteers  had
defied the various unjust laws  and  had  been  arrested  and  sentenced  to
various terms of imprisonment.

The historical significance of the campaign resides in  the  fact  that  for
the first time the African, Coloured and Indian  people  had  engaged  in  a
joint struggle on a national basis  under  common  leadership.  Two  further
points need to be emphasised. Firstly, that nine years  into  our  democracy
not only have the unjust laws which had been  the  target  of  the  defiance
campaign been removed from the Statute Book but scores of  other  pieces  of
discriminatory and oppressive legislation have  also  been  abolished.  But,
secondly, despite the abolition of such legislation  and  despite  the  many
achievements we have talked of during the past nine  years,  the  legacy  of
apartheid continues to impact  negatively  on  the  lives  of  many  of  our
people. Just as freedom-loving people united in the struggle  against  those
unjust laws  nearly  fifty  years  ago,  similarly,  it  is  imperative  for
everyone today to be united in  the  struggle  to  abolish  that  legacy  of
apartheid as speedily as possible so that we can justly claim that  we  have
finally pushed back the frontiers of poverty in order  to  ensure  a  better
life for all our people.
A further milestone was the formation of the Congress  Alliance.  The  three
years that followed the defiance campaign saw the  formation  of  the  South
African Coloured People's Organisation and the  South  African  Congress  of
Democrats. Together with the ANC  and  the  South  African  Indian  Congress
these organisations collectively became  known  as  the  Congress  Alliance.
This was the structure that prompted the campaign for the  congress  of  the
people.

It was Professor ZK Matthews of the ANC who proposed that the  ANC  consider
convening a national convention, a congress of the people  representing  all
the people of this country to draw up a freedom charter for  the  democratic
South Africa  of  the  future.  The  ANC  accepted  the  proposal  and  made
preparations to organise a congress of the people whose main task it was  to
draw up a freedom  charter.  Accordingly,  people  were  called  upon  on  a
countrywide basis to express their views,  demands  and  aspirations  for  a
future  democratic  South  Africa.  These  were  gathered  by  an  army   of
volunteers at meetings and rallies, in house to house visits, in  factories,
in churches, at sporting events and so on. It was  on  the  basis  of  these
demands  and  hopes  that  the  Freedom  Charter  was  originally   drafted,
discussed and finally  adopted  at  the  Congress  of  the  People  held  at
Kliptown on 26 June 1955, the fifth anniversary of 26 June.

Both the intensity and the extensiveness of the campaign reminds one of  the
extensive public participation undertaken by  the  constituent  assembly  to
ensure that the people of South Africa had a  say  in  designing  their  own
constitution. Up to 1994 26 June was celebrated  as  Freedom  Day  in  South
Africa and on that day all freedom-loving people rededicated  themselves  to
the struggle for freedom.

In his book on the Congress of the People, Comrade Ismail Vadi outlined  the
historical significance of the following: that the campaign of the  Congress
of the People and the  Freedom  Charter  introduced  within  the  liberation
movement a degree of ideological uniformity  and  cohesion  that  had  never
existed before; that the Freedom Charter today remains unique  as  the  only
South African document of its kind which adheres  to  democratic  principles
as accepted throughout the world;  that  the  charter  is  the  foundational
document, providing clear policies, aims and objectives  and  serving  as  a
vision of a post-apartheid South  Africa;  and  that  the  Congress  of  the
People had placed the  question  of  social  transformation  firmly  on  the
agenda of the liberation movement.

May I conclude by saying that for decades the Freedom Charter  has  inspired
revolutionaries in our country to reach the greatest heights  of  dedication
to sacrifice for a noble cause and continues to serve as a beacon  of  light
to all of us. During the four decades between the adoption  of  the  charter
and the advent of democracy countless numbers of our  people  had  made  the
supreme sacrifice. The greatest tribute that we can and must  pay  to  these
fallen heroes and heroines of our struggle  is  to  ensure  that  the  noble
ideas for which they laid down their lives so selflessly  become  a  reality
for all our people. That is a revolutionary duty and  obligation  which  has
been thrust upon those of us  who  have  survived  and  have  witnessed  the
miracle of 1994. It is a revolutionary obligation which we dare not fail  to
honour. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, the DA is delighted  to  participate  in  this
debate on preparations to celebrate  the  first  decade  of  freedom.  On  a
lighter note, we will  also  be  delighted  to  be  participating  in  these
preparations. It is called electioneering, something the  DA  is  very  good
at,  and  because  we  have  an  excellent  case.  We  believe  that   these
preparations will yield many dividends for the DA in the  form  of  a  large
numbers of extra members in this House. So, we will have many  more  reasons
to celebrate. No doubt we will have many such debates in this House  in  one
guise or another between now and 27 April next year.

Seriously though, the DA believes  that  indeed  we  have  many  reasons  to
celebrate the first decade  of  freedom  and  much  to  celebrate.  We  have
achieved so much that all South  Africans,  every  member  of  this  rainbow
nation, can take credit  for  and  can  be  proud  of.  We  have  a  vibrant
democracy,  a  constitutional  state,  the  rule  of  law,  an   independent
judiciary, including a constitutional court which magnificently upholds  and
develops  our  very  progressive  Constitution,   winning   admiration   and
accolades around the world. We are developing a human rights culture, and  a
gender-friendly body of laws and institutions which are  the  envy  of  many
countries.

We  have  a  market-oriented  macro-economic  system  that  is   universally
approved of. Our tourism, which should be a mainstay of our  economy  is  at
last developing in this direction under an able Minister. As we mature as  a
nation we believe that in  all  our  rich  diversity  we  are  beginning  to
respect and value each other more. Yes, the framework is outstanding.  There
is a lot to celebrate.

But, unfortunately, there is also a dark underside to this  golden  picture,
the major element of which is an out of control, escalating crime  situation
which poses a threat to everything  we  have  achieved.  It  undermines  the
infrastructure we are building up. It discourages investment. It  encourages
skills and capital flight and  yet  the  ANC  Government,  since  1994,  has
doggedly refused  to  put  adequate  resources  into  the  criminal  justice
system. [Interjections.]

Our Constitution makes it clear that it is the government's duty  to  ensure
the safety of its citizens, and in this it has failed dismally. The Bill  of
Rights guarantees everyone the right to freedom and security of  the  person
and the right to be free of all forms of violence.  Quite  the  opposite  is
true as we live in fear of being a victim of  violent  crime,  but  the  ANC
Government  has  lost  touch  with  what  ordinary  South  African  citizens
experience. [Interjections.]

According to recent research by  the  Institute  of  Security  Studies,  the
total number of crimes for the year ended July  2002,  the  last  for  which
statistics are available,  was  a  whopping  2,5  million  recorded  crimes,
representing a 20% increase since 1994, and at the same time a 33%  increase
in violent  crime  in  that  period.  While  the  most  recent  year-on-year
increase was 1%, indicating that some crimes are stabilising at the rate  of
5 600 per 100 000 they are stabilising, at a very high rate.

All of us know this from  personal  experience.  We  hear  complaints  about
crime ceaselessly in our constituencies. If they are lucky  enough  to  have
escaped crime themselves, our constituents have friends and family who  have
experienced serious violent crime. Then there is the scourge of  baby  rapes
and sex crimes  against  children  very  much  on  the  increase,  which  my
colleague the hon Waters will be dealing with.

The Minister of Safety  and  Security  has  an  ostrich  approach  to  crime
statistics. If one cannot see them, crime will go away. Well,  Minister,  it
has not. All the DA's visits to police stations in our  constituencies  tell
another story. The station commanders we visit are  quite  frank  about  it.
Crime is becoming worse and  their  personnel  and  material  resources  are
becoming less. And the results are there for all to see.

Police stations visited by the DA during our recent anticrime  campaign  are
between  30%  and  50%  understaffed.  There  is  a  chronic   shortage   of
detectives, and  there  are  some  rural  areas  where  the  detectives  are
handling  200  dockets  each.  Unless  the  community  police  forums   have
sponsored cars, there is a chronic shortage of vehicles. And the  same  goes
for cellphones and faxes and any hi-tech tracking facilities.

Because of poor policing and  under  par  prosecuting,  criminal  cases  are
moving at a snail's pace through the courts. Worse still,  there  is  a  low
conviction  rate.   Court   productivity   is   low   because   of   chronic
understaffing. The Director-General, in a recent human  resources  audit  in
the Department of Justice,  found  that  the  department  was  understaffed,
relatively unskilled and therefore ill-prepared to fulfil its mandate.

Winning the war against crime  urgently  requires  a  full-scale  effort  to
reduce crime visibly and dramatically. The DA has  a  plan  and  during  the
celebrations and the preparations for the celebration of  the  first  decade
of freedom, we will be making sure that the public knows all about it. As  a
start, we want to recruit 36 000 more police officers so that we  will  have
150 000 policemen and policewomen visibly on the  streets.  [Interjections.]
A DA-led government will ensure that the second decade of freedom would,  as
far  as  crime  is  concerned,  be  far  better  than  the   first   decade.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Prof H NGUBANE: Deputy Chair, Ministers, Deputy Ministers and colleagues,  a
week ago, when President Mbeki responded to the debate  on  the  Presidency,
he said:


  When we speak of racism and racial stereotypes we do so because  we  know
  the hurt caused to those who are victims of this racism.
The Minister of Home Affairs, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, speaking  in  Parliament
in the context of the Presidency debate, had this to say:


  Our people need the full measure of attention which  our  Government  can
  give them, and we hope that the Presidency will be able  to  provide  its
  tested and strong leadership to move the country forward on the  path  of
  development at a much faster pace, and on the basis  of  a  vision  which
  allows us to draw value from being Africans, born and bred in the  unique
  country of South Africa.

I am quoting the pronouncements of the two leaders  to  indicate  that  both
are underlining the fact that after 10 years of democracy there  is  a  huge
area of socioeconomic and political experience which needs  attention.  Thus
preparations to celebrate the first decade of  freedom  are  not  undertaken
under the illusion that all is rosy. Such preparations  are  of  two  kinds.
The one kind is the physical infrastructure such  as  monuments.  The  other
aspect of preparation is directing the focus on what we  want  to  celebrate
and how to achieve it.
Yesterday I had the unique opportunity of participating in a workshop  which
combined both approaches. The Freedom Park Trust, under  the  leadership  of
Dr Wally Serote, is tasked with the setting up of physical  structures  such
as museums, memorial structures and a garden of remembrance, which  will  be
the national focal point of celebrations next year. As part of  the  ongoing
programme of consultation and sharing information with all  the  sectors  of
society, Freedom Park had organised a workshop for a large number of  women,
including colleagues from this House.

What came up during discussions was the view  that  South  African  society,
especially the black section, is still deeply  traumatised  by  the  various
unspeakable and unmentionable acts  of  abuse  during  apartheid.  As  women
spoke, one after another, it became evident that there is  still  this  vast
task of managing the trauma, especially among black women. It  became  clear
that emotionally the celebration of  ten  years  of  freedom  is  first  and
foremost a very personal one.

I began to think of at least two ostensibly ordinary  issues  that  I  would
like to celebrate. These are that at last I have  a  country  where  I  feel
that I really belong. [Applause.] And also that I no longer live in fear  of
constant harassment by the police. These are the issues  which  I  can  talk
about. There are those issues that are so painful that it  is  not  possible
to talk about them. This was the experience also of  most  women  who  spoke
their minds at the workshop yesterday.

The two freedoms that I will  be  celebrating  stem  from  my  own  peculiar
circumstances. I was a student at the  University  of  Natal,  which  was  a
white university and therefore black students were not allowed.  But  a  few
very good professors  -  incidentally  they  were  all  women  professors  -
offered to give lectures in the afternoons and evenings to  black  students.
And some of us were part of that arrangement.

I was going to these lectures, but I needed to catch  a  train  which  would
arrive back at the station of my destination  before  the  curfew.  And  the
curfew was 10 o'clock. If I missed that train and got a train  that  arrived
at 10:10, I would find that the police would be lining up on  the  platform,
I could not get to the taxis, and then I would be dragged and  bundled  into
the police van, which would drive around looking for more  people  who  were
to be arrested. And ultimately, after midnight if we were  lucky,  we  would
be expected at the police station to pay the admission of guilt fine and  be
released. I think it is this particular situation which made me very  afraid
of the police and it is this particular experience which made  me  underline
the fact that I feel free from fear of the police.

The other instance was that I could not actually say I have a home, or  that
I am a citizen of South African in the full sense. And as a  student  abroad
I would be with other African students from Nigeria or from Ghana who  would
be boasting about the very  good  jobs  they  would  be  getting  when  they
completed their studies and went back home. I found that I could  not  boast
about that. I could not expect to get a good job in South  Africa.  I  would
remain and look for jobs abroad. And these things were very painful  to  me.
So I wanted to share this.  I  am  not  making  it  a  TRC,  but  the  women
yesterday  made  it  very  clear  that  perhaps  the  women   have   special
experiences which need attention. [Applause.]

Mrs J CHALMERS: Chairperson, comrades and colleagues, I was born long  years
ago, a child of apartheid, born in the 1930s,  schooled  in  the  1940s  and
1950s. It was an education that viewed the history of our land  through  the
eyes of white educators.  This  history  set  down  stories  of  the  Dutch,
British and French settlers in South Africa, stories of  frontier  wars  and
of changing rule under colonial rulers, who for the most  part  managed  our
country according to the whims and policies of politicians,  many  thousands
of miles away, stories of conquest and slavery.

So it went on, the history of the colonisation of South Africa,  stories  of
settlers, of the discovery of riches under the  soil,  and  the  battle  for
possession of those riches. This is a battle that  is  still  being  fought.
But no stories were told to us  of  how  these  accounts  of  conquests  and
exploration, and the accumulation of the wealth this land had to offer,  was
affecting the lives of the majority, the black majority of  South  Africans,
who were not indeed even allowed to claim that title.

As a prominent Nationalist Party politician put it in the 1970s:
  If our policy is taken to its full conclusion,  there  will  not  be  one
  black man with South African citizenship. There would then be no longer a
  moral  obligation  on  our  Parliament  to   accommodate   these   people
  politically.

That education had nothing to do with enabling us  to  become  the  sort  of
citizens of this land, who could make free and informed choices  of  how  we
wished to live out our lives here. It also had nothing to do with freedom.

I lived in the city of Port Elizabeth where,  in  my  early  childhood,  the
opportunity  existed  for  interaction  with  various  cultures  and  racial
groups. South End was a vibrant place, alive with  different  languages  and
music. Children had only to hop over the next  door  neighbours's  fence  to
share a different part of the South African world as it was  then.  On  this
day, in 1955, there was an upwelling of conviction and hope as  people  from
across the length and breadth of  our  country  came  together  to  lay  the
foundation for a  new,  nonracial  and  democratic  South  Africa,  and  the
Freedom  Charter  was  born.  Then  in  1959  Hendrick  Verwoerd  made   the
definitive speech that gave final implementation to the policy  of  separate
development, in its most absolute form. This must happen, he  said,  because
what was the alternative? It  was  an  unacceptable  and  even  unimaginable
situation where there would be "A South African army  and  a  South  African
police force, under  Black  generals;  an  air  force  under  a  Black  air-
marshall; a Government with  Black  Cabinet  Ministers;  a  Parliament  with
Black Members of Parliament; administrators  and  mayors,  all  Black.  With
such an end in view what hope would there be for the White man?"

He went on to say that the Bantu did not want  mixed  governments.  We,  the
white minority, for the most part led extraordinarily privileged  lives.  As
the shutters came down and  the  laws  became  more  and  more  binding  and
restrictive, we were bound from birth to death to conform  or  pay  a  heavy
price. We were told: "Obey or you could lose  your  freedom."  The  majority
complied because the price of disobedience was high, and we  had  been  told
for 40 years how dire the consequences would be under black majority rule.

Life was comfortable and the reigns of power, financial and political,  were
firmly held in white hands. But it was not freedom. Perhaps some members  of
the white community, even now, choose to remain with the shutters down.  But
those of us who had a copy  of  the  Freedom  Charter  safely  tucked  away,
during those arid and violent decades, always kept sight of  the  vision  of
the land shared, of equal rights for all, of a culture  of  learning,  where
those closed doors would  be  open,  of  houses  and  health,  and  no  more
ghettos, and most wonderful of all, of peace and friendship amongst all  our
people. We kept sight of this vision even though it seemed  agonisingly  far
removed from the reality of the life we were leading  and  the  risks  those
near and dear to us were taking, and those who were prepared to  lose  their
lives and who did lose their lives. I am thinking here of  my  dear  friends
Matthew Goniwe, Fort Calata and so many other great comrades.

So when a miracle happened, and the time came to take  the  Freedom  Charter
out of its hiding place, and to sit and read  it  openly  in  the  sunshine,
each one of us had to consider how  to  bring  those  high  ideas  into  our
lives. How we could assist in enabling  them  to  happen  and  make  them  a
reality. A reality that would build a South Africa that had been fought  for
for so hard and so long. The land of our hopes and dreams. Of  course  there
has been only one way to achieve  this,  by  joining  hands  and  minds  and
working collectively and  co-operatively  with  one  another  to  build  our
nation. It is an ideal that has not been easy to achieve, we  never  thought
it would be easy, but we are getting there. The victories are there for  all
to see.

Clean water for  more  than  nine  million  people  who  lacked  it  before,
electricity for more than  two  million  and  telephones  for  1,5  million.
Schools and universities have been desegregated, and  the  general  literacy
rate has improved substantially. We have a system of free health  care.  Our
economy, which was in desperate  straits,  has  been  placed  on  a  healthy
footing and trade barriers have been lifted. We  have  the  most  democratic
Constitution  in  the  world,  and  various  institutions  to   ensure   its
effectiveness.

We have got rid of the old apartheid laws and abolished the  death  penalty.
The list of achievements  is  long.  Miraculously  we  have  done  all  this
without bloodshed. So the Government  is  doing  what  governments  do,  and
better than a great many, in the face of huge  odds  and  with  so  much  to
learn. Battling decades of a carefully created  culture  of  dependency,  of
neglecting housing, rural roads, schools, huge numbers of unskilled  labour,
and the homelands heritage of new supernumeraries. All this at a  time  when
globalisation of the world economy is the order of the day.

For me, the changes in how they affect  my  life  have  been  overwhelmingly
positive and exciting. I feel so fortunate to be able to participate in  the
transformation of our land, attempting to always  bring  the  big  questions
and challenges back to the micro level,  because  truly,  that  is  where  I
think real change can begin. Growing up from grass-roots level, those  seeds
of change that withered and often died 50 years ago, have now sprouted,  and
the face of South Africa is changing fast.

In my constituency, the town council consists of 10  members.  The  majority
are comrades with struggle backgrounds, some are farmers. I knew this  small
town  in  the  old  days,  when  there  was  absolutely  no  interaction  or
socialising between different sectors of the community, except on a  master-
servant basis. Those days  have  now  gone.  Yes,  and  there  is  still  an
enormous  amount  of  work  to  be  done,  but   a   sound   financial   and
administrative foundation has been laid to be built on, where  before  there
had been a crumbling and disinterested administration.

The councillors  come  from  very  diverse  backgrounds,  some  with  useful
skills, others have had to knuckle down  and  acquire  them.  But  they  are
working together, attempting  to  understand  and  trust  one  another,  and
accept where they are  coming  from;  learning  how  to  read  and  draw  up
budgets; how to improve staff  efficiency  and  manage  discipline;  how  to
advertise tenders; how to manage tough potentially  conflicting  situations;
how to market their towns; and so important, how to communicate  with  their
constituencies and report back  and  include  them  in  the  decision-making
processes.

As I speak today, a small team consisting of  a  farmer,  a  businessman,  a
councillor, and an official, is visiting Stellenbosch,  to  be  given  clear
direction on fruit growing in my constituency. And I know this  will  really
bear fruit. The challenges are many. As is happening in  many  rural  towns,
Aids sufferers are coming back to their roots, some to  die,  others  to  be
cared for by their families. The clinics function effectively, but with  the
huge workload, it puts pressure on the small nursing staff. Doctors  are  in
short supply, but we are encouraged by new developments in the  province  to
get doctors into the rural areas.

Acceptable houses have been and are being built, but as a new home owner,  a
woman, said to me: "The Government is building urban towns, urban houses  in
rural areas, but we need bigger stands of land around our  houses,  so  that
we can feed ourselves from small vegetable plots. We  need  tanks  for  rain
water, that will make a difference to us." She will raise this at  the  next
council meeting she attends and she will be heard. What is happening  in  my
constituency is not unique, it is being  duplicated  throughout  the  length
and breadth of South Africa.

Despite what the DA says, the negative picture it likes to paint of life  in
our country, a new land is being built. In the schools and universities,  on
the farms and in town halls, read the books  being  published  and  see  the
pictures being created of this new South Africa. Watch the children at  play
and listen to the music out there, and mingle with the  people  walking  the
pavements and one is left in no doubt whatsoever.

Chairperson, today, 48 years after the Freedom Charter was adopted,  at  the
Congress  of  the  People  in  Kliptown,  the  spirit  that   created   that
extraordinary document is alive and well, and  on  its  way  to  becoming  a
reality in our beloved land. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND:  Mr  Chair,  during  the  debate  of  the  Minister  of  Social
Development on drug abuse I thought I  should  ask  the  DA  what  they  use
because something puts them very  high  above  the  real  realities  of  the
issues in this country. [Applause.] Over the past nine years the  Government
has had much success in ensuring growth and development in our country.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, please take your seat.

Mr M J ELLIS: I certainly do believe, Sir, that what the hon Durand said  is
absolutely unparliamentary. He is suggesting that the DA uses some  form  of
substance and obviously that cannot be true.  I  seek  your  guidance,  Sir.
[Interjections.]

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, if time allows could I repeat what I said and  you
can guide me.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, may I ask the hon member a question?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We are giving him an opportunity,  hon
Ellis. Will you take your seat, Mr Ellis?

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, I said during the debate I needed to  ask  the  DA
what they are on because they  seem  to  be  flying  much  higher  than  the
realities in this country? [Laughter.]

Mr M J ELLIS: That is exactly the point, Mr Chairman. There is a  suggestion
that the DA might be under some kind of illusion. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  member,  any  reference  to  what
might be termed or interpreted as the use of any substance that might  cause
one to be other than normal might be considered to be  unparliamentary.  Can
you withdraw what you said?

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, self-hypnosis is not a  substance,  nor  is  self-
delusion.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, can you withdraw?

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, I will withdraw if you insist. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Thank you very much.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, may I ask the hon member a question?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Do you want to take  a  question,  hon
member?

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, my time is running out. At the end of my speech  I
am willing to take all questions from the DA.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Very well.

Mr M J ELLIS: May I ask the hon member how much time he has, Sir, so  I  can
keep a careful watch on time and note whether he has time at the end of  his
speech. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Mr Ellis, let us  ask  the  member
to proceed and not waste any more time.

Mr M J ELLIS: Thank you, Chair.

Mr J DURAND: Over the past nine years the Government has  had  much  success
in ensuring growth and  development  in  our  country.  It  has  taken  this
country from the brink of bankruptcy at the  end  of  1993  to  any  finance
minister's dream economy. It has achieved  political  stability  and  social
peace,  virtually  wiped  out  the  inherited  debt,  ensured  microeconomic
stability, increased the fiscus,  lowered  taxation,  ensured  macroeconomic
stability, increased social  spending,  broadened  the  welfare  net,  while
giving due weight to maintaining  and  improving  excellent  infrastructure.
All this has been achieved on the basis of a  prudent  socioeconomic  policy
directed at achieving a stable, efficient, open and growing economy.

Since 1994 annual growth has averaged 2,7%. Last year South  Africa  enjoyed
a growth rate of 3% - one of  the  highest  growth  figures  in  the  world.
Compare these figures with, for example, the European Union's  1%,  Europe's
0,8% or Latin America's -0,5%. In the coming year South Africa is poised  to
grow by a further 3%.

South Africa specifically has been significantly successful in  key  sectors
of the economy such as agriculture, internal  trade,  tourism,  finance  and
real estate and business  services  all  driven  by  government  policy  and
active promotion of the country. This last year's investment  growth  across
the economy rose by an estimated 6,3%. Thus successes have had a  consummate
impact on job creation with the number of employed persons  growing  by  17%
from 1995 to 2002.

Yet despite the achievements, to date  the  backlogs  and  relatively  small
base of the economy leave the country still facing huge  challenges.  Simply
put, the exceptional performance of the economy has not matched  the  growth
in the labour market, especially in the context of the young-age profile  of
and growth in the population and the shedding of jobs in  efficient  sectors
of the economy. The result has been a rise in the unemployment  rate,  which
currently stands at 30%. This compared to a  comparable  developing  country
such as Brazil with 17,9%.

Other countries  have  managed  to  vanquish  the  problem  of  unemployment
through concerted national effort. Take the case of  Ireland.  In  the  mid-
eighties, Ireland's unemployment rate was 17,5%, a rate far higher than  the
European average of 10% at that time. In the end the formula  which  finally
made the  difference  in  Ireland  included,  inter  alia,  an  increase  in
government spending on programmes designed to mobilise  the  labour  supply,
improved job skills and the increased efficiency  of  labour  markets,  wage
increase moderation by  organised  labour,  various  incentives  to  attract
labour-intensive investment in specifically identified  niche  growth  areas
of the economy and the  tightening  of  unemployment  benefits.  Since  1993
Ireland's economy has grown at  rates  in  excess  of  8%  per  annum  while
employment grew by 25% by 1998.

It is thus clear that we are on the right track, but  there  are  challenges
facing this country and despite all these successes  there  are  still  some
South Africans who seem forever determined to project our country  as  being
the worst in the world. In many respects  regardless  of  facts  and  actual
realities this determination to ensure that our country is  seen  -  and  we
heard it earlier from the DA - as the capital of everything  bad,  covers  a
number of areas including crime and disease. Much of this effort  is  driven
by the centuries old racist convictions about what black people are and  how
they behave. Any incident is therefore seized upon to  reaffirm  the  racist
stereotypes.

Finally, Chairperson ... [Interjection.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, I rise on a point of order.

The CHAIPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Proceed, hon member.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARVELD: Is it permissible for the hon member, Mr  Grobler  to
liken the hon member Durand to a dog?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Take a seat, hon  Durand.  Hon  member
can you please explain your remark.

Mr G A J GROBLER: I never said he is a dog, Chair.  I  used  the  expression
... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The remark I heard  was  something  to
do with "oubaas se honne".

Mr G A J GROBLER: Yes, when somebody is very kind and  nice  to  people  and
very obedient.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, if you  are  likening  the
member to "oubaas  se  honde"  that  is  unparliamentary.  Will  you  please
withdraw?

Mr G A J GROBLER: I withdraw.
The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Thank  you.  Please  proceed,  hon
member.

Mr J DURAND: The racial stereotypes still being maintained  by  the  DA  are
that we are either apes or dogs. We understand that. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Proceed.

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, finally I want to  quote  from  a  letter  by  the
President:


  Bearing in  mind  all  these  considerations  and  given  our  unwavering
  commitment to ensure the transformation of ours into a nonracial society,
  we were greatly encouraged by the efforts of the New NP to rid itself  of
  its racist past - they are all there. We saw the New NP as  an  important
  player in the critically important struggle to create a  nonracial  South
  Africa. We were and are very willing to work with the New NP  to  achieve
  this objective. Some have sought to counterpose such united action with a
  need for strong political opposition to the ANC. It is argued  that  this
  is more important than the unity of all political forces in  our  country
  to defeat and root out the scourge of racism. Naturally  those  who  make
  this argument know nothing about the impact of racism on the overwhelming
  majority of our people. To  them  this  becomes  a  matter  of  secondary
  importance which can and should be superseded  by  other  considerations.
  This is what stands at the heart of the decision of the ANC to work  with
  the New NP in the Western Cape and elsewhere in our country.

Mr Chairperson, fortunately there are South Africans of  goodwill  that  are
committed to working together to create a  nonracial  South  Africa  in  the
next ten years of freedom, that will push back the frontiers of poverty  and
create a nonracial society.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Ministers and  members,  there  is  no  doubt
that much progress has been made since we became  a  free  nation  in  1994.
When we prepare to celebrate the first decade of freedom we  must  celebrate
the victories, but we must also be mindful of all the challenges facing  our
young nation. We must not view lightly the great sacrifices that  have  been
made by all those who  have  contributed  to  the  freedom  of  our  nation.
Although political freedom is crucial to  a  nation,  it  is  not  the  only
freedom to be cherished. Freedom must be  viewed  holistically.  It  is  not
enough for our nation to be politically free. Our nation must also be  freed
from the shackles of  poverty,  hunger  and  unemployment.  No  nation  will
remain free without virtue or morality in the people.

It was the moral strength of  ordinary  citizens  that  broke  the  back  of
oppression in our nation. History has shown that virtue and character  in  a
people is the basis of happiness in a society and  is  absolutely  necessary
for a state to remain free. A truly free nation will have a concern for  the
common good above their own self-interests. It will  say  no  to  greed  and
self-enrichment and it will be noted as a nation which  has  a  concern  for
the poor and the exploited, the very young  and  the  very  old,  especially
those who are defenceless. A truly free nation is one which has  leaders  in
government who are  exemplary  -  leaders  who  will  not  violate  the  law
themselves, who will not use their positions to  enrich  themselves  at  the
expense of the electorate,  who  will  not  succumb  to  the  temptation  of
bribery.

As political leaders we must remain positive about our nation. South  Africa
is a great nation. Despite our poverty, our crime rate,  our  problems  with
HIV/Aids, we will remain a great nation if we are prepared  to  collectively
address the obstacles and challenges that may threaten our future freedom.

Mr M J MALAHLELA: Iyo khali  ikwakwa  yo  khali  intabeni.  Hau!  Bark  wena
darkie bark au na  lizwe.  Companero  si  ys  ba  bonga  ngani  ama  Cubano,
Tabaresh si ya ba bonga ngani ama Soviet, Nongonongo si yo  ba  bonga  ngani
ama Swahili. [The sound of the rifle shall resound. It will  reverberate  in
the mountains. Hawu! Bark, you darkie, bark.  You  have  no  land.  What  is
freedom? Companero, how shall we ever  thank  the  Cubans?  Nongonango,  how
shall we ever thank the Swahili?]

I am deeply honoured to be  participating  in  this  debate  today,  because
while I am conversing with  you  from  this  podium,  conveying  this  royal
message about the people's march to mark a decade of freedom,  young  people
of my age, black in general and African  in  particular,  are  battling  the
scourge of poverty, malnutrition and underdevelopment.
The scourge was bankrolled by the exploitation of my  working-class  parents
by capital, and perfected  by  the  entrenchment  of  apartheid  colonialism
since 1652 and 1948 respectively. It is because of this scourge  of  poverty
and underdevelopment that we took a  vow  this  year,  as  my  working-class
parents did on 26 June 1955, to push to the doldrums.

From our fairest Crocodile, the  silent  Kei,  the  brilliant  Limpopo,  the
smiling  Orange,  the  enduring  Olifants,   to   our   fine   Tugela,   the
pronouncements permitted my working-class parents to  say  themselves,  from
this  grandiose  natural  beauty,  that  the  people   shall   govern.   The
pronouncements were not a pipe dream  but  a  call  to  action,  because  my
working-class parents were no longer prepared to live the same old way.  Not
only were my working-class parents, whose labour power  was  exploited,  not
prepared to live the same old way, but they were also not prepared  to  live
under the same old order. Not only were they not prepared to live  the  same
old way under the same old order, but so too were they not  prepared  to  be
governed by the same old pack. The people shall govern.

I - and the young people of South Africa and Southern Africa -  am  indebted
to the blood of Peter Nchabeleng, Andrew  Mehlape  and  Ngoako  Malepe:  the
blood that dripped onto the  fertile  ground  for  revolution,  the  fertile
ground that shook the elementary particles of exploitation  of  my  working-
class  parents'  labour  power  by  capital,  thereby  deforming   apartheid
colonialism and declaring for the  world  to  know  that  the  people  shall
govern.

I am politically free today and so are you.  You  and  I  are  free  because
Solomon Mahlangu sacrificed his blood for the nourishment of the  tree  that
bore the fruits of liberation. You and  I  are  free  today  because  Oliver
Tambo and the ANC were there. You and I are free today because  freedom  and
the ANC are two sides of the same coin. The people shall govern.

You and I have a special  duty  and  must  sacrifice  in  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty, the poverty  bankrolled  by  the  exploitation  of  my
working-class  parents'  labour   power   by   capital   since   1652,   the
beneficiaries of whom are aligned in opposition to this democracy under  the
false pretext of being democratic.
We must push back the frontiers of poverty not only because we are  products
of hunger. We must push back the frontiers of poverty not  only  because  we
are products of social  injustice.  We  must  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty not only because we are victims of tyranny. We must  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty not only because we come from  an  apartheid  land.  We
must push back the frontiers of poverty because we never chose to  be  poor.
We must push back the frontiers of poverty, the poverty  bankrolled  by  the
exploitation  of  my  working-class  parents'  labour  power  by  racialised
capital. We must push back the frontiers of poverty because we are  our  own
liberators and, just as we liberated ourselves  from  conquest  colonialism,
we can liberate ourselves from hunger, malnutrition, starvation and want.

In so doing we shall be reaffirming the pronouncements of  the  Congress  of
the People, further reaffirming for the martyred heroes, the Goniwe,  Somoza
and Rubeiro families, that the spilling of their blood was not in vain.  The
people shall govern.

In December 1982, when addressing more than 10 000 people who  attended  the
funeral service in Maseru, Lesotho, of  ANC  members  massacred  by  raiders
from the SA Defence Force,  the  erstwhile  president  of  the  ANC,  Oliver
Reginald Tambo, said, and I quote:


  The Freedom Charter  is  an  instrument  of  peace  in  South  Africa,  a
  prescription to end  racist  and  imperialist  domination  over  Southern
  Africa. To fight for the demands elaborated in the Charter and if need be
  to die in that fight is therefore to fight and to die for peace,  for  an
  end to a system that is at once  brutal,  incorrigible  and  incomparably
  inhuman. That inhumanity is demonstrated in the heroic  bodies  that  lie
  before this gathering here today.

Those heroic bodies will not turn in their graves,  because  the  future  of
this country is in good hands, and that which they died for blossoms  before
my eyes to see and reverberates through my ears to hear.

The Local Government: Municipal Structures Act, signed  with  the  blood  of
Onkgopotse Tiro,  confers  power  on  the  people  so  that  the  Integrated
Development Plan we pursue is the dictate of the people in  reaffirming  the
pronouncements of the Congress of the People in pushing back  the  frontiers
of our poverty, bankrolled by the exploitation of my  working-class  parents
by racialised capital. The people shall govern.

The South African Schools Act, signed with the blood  of  Andrew  Zondo  and
Vuyisile Mini, confers power on the school governing bodies  constituted  by
different categories of our working-class communities. We  confer  power  on
the people not only because we are uneconomic about power, but, further,  to
avert 16 June 1976 so that the Andrew Zondos of  today  and  tomorrow  learn
that the aim of education is to teach children  to  love  their  people  and
their culture, and to honour human brotherhood, liberty and peace.

Power has been conferred  on  the  people  in  their  different  communities
through the regulations of the South African Police  Service  Act  of  1995,
signed with the  blood  of  Barney  Molokoane,  Clifford  Brown  and  Ronald
Malapa. The  establishment  of  community  policing  forums  represents  the
cherished ideal that all the people shall take part  in  the  administration
of the country. This, indeed, is a break with the past, because my  working-
class brothers and sisters have had our working-class  parents'  yesteryears
maimed, massacred, butchered and martyred by  those  responsible  for  their
security. The people shall govern.

That the National Council  of  Provinces  did  embark  on  an  excursion  to
interact countrywide with my working-class parents,  brothers  and  sisters,
black in general and  African  in  particular,  is  a  confirmation  of  the
pronouncements of the Congress of the People in Kliptown. The  people  shall
govern.

That the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs is  currently  in
Limpopo doing oversight work on the department's capacity to deliver IDs  to
the people - just interacting with the masses of  our  people  -  is  indeed
confirmation of  the  pronouncements  of  the  Congress  of  the  People  in
Kliptown, 26 June 1955. The people shall govern.

That the first citizen of a liberated people's democratic Republic of  South
Africa has embarked on an excursion, through presidential imbizos,  just  to
listen  to  the  aspirations  of  my  working-class  parents,  brothers  and
sisters, is indeed confirmation of the pronouncements  of  the  Congress  of
the People in Kliptown. The people shall govern.

We reaffirmed the pronouncements of the Congress  of  the  People  in  April
1994. We, further, unequivocally and without  any  equivocation,  reaffirmed
the said pronouncements in June 1999. You, the young people of  a  liberated
people's democratic Republic of South Africa, and I must  pledge  to  strive
together, sparing neither strength nor courage to push  back  the  frontiers
of our poverty.

By reaffirming the pronouncements of the Congress of the People  next  year,
2004, the people shall govern. In  this  context  we  are  therefore  saying
freedom is the appreciation of reality. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, the aluminium anniversary of  any  institution
is very important as it shows  that  entity  is  solidifying  from  a  fluid
state.  The  10th  anniversary  of  democracy  in  our  country  has  to  be
celebrated in style. Preparations have to be made so  that  as  we  go  into
this period, the us and them dichotomy should  not  persist.  As  we  go  to
celebrate this occasion it should be as a united nation,  a  nation  with  a
common agenda, with no reference to differences on grounds of  colour,  race
and even world view.

We can best be prepared to celebrate our first decade of democracy if we  go
into it with great determination to respect others and to  serve  diligently
in all our roles. While we  are  at  pains  to  transform  institutions,  we
should not lag behind in undergoing transformation in our  outlook  to  life
and relations with our compatriots. It will be in the interest  of  us  all,
particularly those in Government, to shed  their  holier-than-thou  attitude
that tends to pervade our society. The best  preparation  for  that  quantum
leap is the development of our human resource base.  We  may  have  all  the
infrastructure but if our human resource is found wanting, we shall  achieve
very little.

A ten year old  person  starts  to  learn  to  conduct  himself  or  herself
responsibly and likewise it would  be  expected  of  us  to  show  signs  of
development towards maturity by taking steps against whoever  oversteps  the
mark. We should rid ourselves of the denial mode when two issues are  raised
against us by taking pride in our numbers.
Finally, let us prepare to go into the next  decade  with  the  emphasis  on
maturity and not majority. Let us go into the  next  decade  by  emphasising
health and not wealth to our people.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson,  the  10th  anniversary  of  our  freedom  is  a
significant milestone. It is a time to pause and  check  our  direction  and
readjust if possible. It is a moment of  rejoicing  because  the  sweat  and
blood of yesteryear have become tears of joy. The granite wall of  apartheid
has fallen. It was a miracle but it  was  a  hard-won  victory,  a  struggle
waged by men, women and children.

What has changed then? We now have human dignity in the place  of  history's
worst dehumanisation. We now have the  vote  and  can  serve  in  leadership
positions in the state and in Parliament. But, do we  have  any  significant
change in the lives of our people? The safe barometer  of  change  is  those
who were and still are at the bottom of oppression. They see the  fruits  of
freedom being enjoyed by members of Parliament and the elite  group  of  the
nation. They see water reaching them and  the  dark  parts  of  our  country
twinkling with new electric lights.
Land which is the cornerstone of the liberation struggle is  far  away  from
them. The mkhukhus, mjondolos or amatyotyombe are still reserved  for  them.
I am certain that if we could take 10 white South Africans and  all  members
of this House and let them live in the mjondolos for one  month,  the  whole
land policy of our country would change within a week.

The evergrowing population of our informal settlements or squatter camps  is
a sore indictment of our new democratic  dispensation.  Unemployment  is  on
the increase, rendering many healthy South Africans jobless  and  desperate.
Aids is taking a heavy toll on the population particularly the poor and  the
youth. Let us rejoice but let us  change  our  direction  and  the  pace  of
transformation.

Ms L L MABE: Chairperson, briefly I want to inform some of my friends on  my
left that I grew up in an area where I woke up at 6 o'clock in  the  morning
to go and fetch firewood in the forest and return at 11 o'clock. I would  be
gone for two hours to fetch a bucket of water, which held 10 litres, from  a
borehole. Unfortunately, I did not have access to tap water as some  members
did. Evenings would be spent waiting at boreholes to get a  drop  of  water.
My friends had access to clean tap water.

When I went to Johannesburg I  saw  a  big  difference.  There  were  bright
lights and I came from a dark area. I was also fearful  that  I  might  come
across things that could injure and even  kill  me.  But,  when  I  went  to
Johannesburg, I envied those bright lights. I then became  conscious  before
the age of 10 that if I wanted to live in this South Africa, then  I  should
ensure that I became part of those who intended to change it. That is why  I
am here. I grew up in Tlhabane and I am proud of that fact.

In his speech President Mbeki indicated that racism continues to be a  daily
reality for  the  majority  of  South  Africans.  The  legacy  of  apartheid
continues  throughout  South  Africa's  institutions  and   even   in   this
Parliament. Communities and attitudes such as those displayed  by  those  to
my left affect black people in general and Africans in  particular.  Unequal
access to  wealth,  services  and  opportunities  deny  black  people  their
rights. Some members rejoice when access to wealth is denied.  That  is  why
some members choose to make a noise. Our people do not  have  constitutional
rights to access wealth. But, the ANC will ensure that black South  Africans
will have access to wealth which belongs to all South Africans.

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

Ms L L MABE: The hon member can shout as much as he likes  but  all  of  us,
black and white, will be proud to be South  Africans.  The  world  does  not
belong to him alone. [Applause.]

At the beginning of this year President Mbeki called upon us  to  push  back
the frontiers of poverty. Indeed, the ANC is committed to pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty. When the ANC came into power in 1994, it  had  a  plan
and various documents. These started with the Freedom Charter, the  RDP  and
other ready-to-govern documents. These gave  the  ANC  the  directive.  This
directive did not come from the ANC but from the  masses  of  this  country.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Mabe, please  take  your  seat.  I
want to appeal to hon members not to drown out the speaker  at  the  podium.
Let us allow the hon member at the podium to be heard. There is  an  ongoing
commentary from my left and I have to appeal to members  to  desist.  Please
proceed, hon Mabe.

Ms L L MABE: Before 1994 we did not have access  to  land.  Profitable  land
was reserved for a certain group of our population. As Africans we now  have
access to land. This has been made possible by the restitution of  land.  We
can own land and we are proud of that. We hope  that  this  Government  will
accelerate land distribution to blacks. This has been made possible  by  the
support programmes which this Government consciously  implements  to  ensure
that all of us will benefit.

In the rural areas we did not have infrastructure. Our parents  had  to  use
their own money to build schools and clinics. At this moment the  Government
is making a conscious effort to ensure that  rural  people  have  access  to
clinics and schools. Even  though  these  things  happen,  there  is  a  big
challenge facing the ANC-led Government that land must  be  made  accessible
to more people in this country, even better than  it  is  being  implemented
now.

Most people in the rural areas and townships have access to  clean,  running
water. They also have access to electricity. Those who  depended  on  stream
water have access to clean water. This gives them dignity as  human  beings.
Diseases such as cholera have declined. I want to admit to the  public  that
we as the ANC-led Government still have to do a lot  in  ensuring  that  all
our people have access to clean water and proper sanitation to prevent  them
from contracting diseases. They should get decent houses so that people  who
build houses and abuse the resources  of  the  Government  should  be  dealt
with. This will ensure that our people get decent houses. The ANC  does  not
like some of the things these contractors are doing.

Our people have access to health. Pregnant women ...

An HON MEMBER: You must shoot them down.

Ms L L MABE: Yes, hon member. You must shoot them down before I start  doing
so. Our people have access to health. They can go to clinics and  hospitals.
Pregnant women and children can be attended to without paying. Who pays  for
this? Our Government is paying.
Right now we have reproductive rights as women. These  rights  were  enjoyed
by certain people. Right now they  say  the  ANC  is  a  killer  because  it
supports choice. Fortunately, women can think for themselves and we  have  a
right to choose. I also want to remind  members  that  as  long  as  poverty
continues to be our number one enemy in this country, the ANC will not  rest
to ensure that this enemy is destroyed.

I want to remind members that my grandparents used to get a pension of  less
than R200. They got a third or - maybe I am not well informed -  they  could
have been getting a quarter of what white people received. Today I am  proud
that an ordinary grandparent living in a rural area gets  the  same  pension
grant that a white person who lives in the suburbs  gets.  I  also  want  to
remind members that I am proud that poor people have access  to  food.  Poor
people and children have access to social grants. This will enable  them  to
go to school and get a plate of food in the evening.

I want to remind members that the ANC does not want a social welfare  state.
We want a developmental state to ensure that people should go and  work  for
themselves and not become dependent on social grants that are given to  them
by the Government. These grants are there to  help  them  for  a  particular
period to enable them to have something to live on.

I want to remind members that some members  are  propagating  that  what  is
happening in the mines, is going to kill the economy. We are  not  going  to
listen to the members on my left. As this Government we are going to  ensure
that blacks get access to mining.  They  own  the  assets.  Women  also  own
assets in mines. It is not only some members of our community who are  going
to own these assets. The DA does  not  have  equal  representation  in  this
House. Yet, it is through the ANC that we see so many women  represented  in
civil society, Government and the private sector. It is because of  the  ANC
that right now we have women Ministers, mayors who are  women.  The  DA  did
not come up with such a policy. [Applause.]

President Mbeki said that African  women  constitute  the  majority  of  the
poor, particularly in rural areas. They are found in the  lowest  paid  jobs
and continue  to  fight  poverty,  illiteracy  and  poor  health,  including
HIV/Aids. [Interjections.] Members on my  left  continuously  make  a  noise
about  HIV/Aids.  They  mislead  people  by  not  telling  them  that   this
Government has a policy. It is doing a lot in ensuring that  it  deals  with
this scourge. It also ensures that it  educates  people  so  that  they  can
understand better. We will continue to inform our people and  not  undermine
their capacity and dignity.

Finally, in the preamble  to  the  Freedom  Charter  we  pledged  to  strive
together,  sparing  neither  strength  nor  courage,  until  the  democratic
changes set out in the Freedom Charter have been won. Until we win  them  we
will not give in to whatever these members are saying or doing. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. We  have  come  a  long  way  since
1994. In fact, it is a bit  hard  to  believe  that  almost  10  years  have
passed. However, what is believable is where  we  are  today  and  what  the
strength of our nation has built us into, and continues  to  do  so.  It  is
almost 10 years into a democracy that has gained us the respect globally  as
a government for the people, by the people.

Today, we stand here proud of the democracy we have achieved but  our  pride
shall be upheld by the memory  of  and  gratitude  for  all  those  who  had
sincerely dedicated their lives to the freedom of our nation. I  have  tears
in my eyes at the thought of the suffering, the hardship and  the  sacrifice
so many endured to achieve what we have today and what we are today.

All those in the struggle fought for the  freedom  we  celebrate  today  and
today we shall strive to keep the freedom and to protect our people  as  one
nation, regardless of colour  or  creed,  to  uphold  our  Constitution,  to
ensure democracy and  to  inculcate  a  better  life  for  all  through  the
alleviation of  poverty  and  social  development.  We  have  the  power  to
institute a state where all is one and one is all. As a nation, we have  our
challenges of which poverty, unemployment, and  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic  are
some.

However, the MF believes that the unity we have as a nation and as  a  House
holds a common interest for a better life for all. Those  hurdles  shall  be
overcome. The MF celebrates our decade of freedom proudly and  prepares  for
another victory towards democracy, to close all the gaps in racism,  and  to
work closely with the Government of  today  to  achieve  this  freedom  once
again for the people of South Africa,  especially  for  those  who  suffered
under the apartheid regime.

Mr M STEELE: I am  proud  to  represent  in  this  House  the  tradition  of
nonracial, liberal politics which in my home city  goes  back  many  decades
and included in earlier times such distinguished  South  Africans  as  Edgar
Brookes, Selby Msimang and Alan Paton. I am also  happy  to  celebrate  with
the House the constitutional provisions which have given us nearly 10  years
of freedom, equality and the rule of law.

My enthusiasm for the Constitution has, however, to be tempered by  concerns
at the manner in which the country is being governed at this  time.  As  the
novelist E M Foster puts it: two cheers for  democracy  -  one,  because  it
admits variety and two, because it permits criticism, unless one belongs  to
the ultraleft. The third cheer would be for a  Government  which  had  truly
advanced the spirit of the Constitution but that commitment  appears  to  be
waning fast.

From the collapse of the neocolonial order based on racial divisions,  South
Africa  has  experienced  in  quick  succession  the  euphoria  of  national
liberation and then the consolidation of power in the hands of a new  elite.
We had our Prague Spring when we were the rainbow  nation,  now  we  have  a
return to centralised authority and  the  co-opting  of  the  timid  by  the
ruling party.

After the optimism of 1994, a pervasive disillusionment has  set  in  across
the country. This is not a contrived  pessimism,  it  is  evident  on  every
radio talk show and  in  every  newspaper  letters  column.  We  ignore  and
dismiss  these  sentiments  at  our  peril.  The  credibility  gap   between
politicians and the public is wider  now  than  at  any  time  in  the  past
decade.

I believe three factors have contributed  to  this  public  disillusionment.
The first is undermining electoral accountability. Our electoral  system  of
proportional representation has elevated party power over accountability  to
the voters. The system gives  maximum  representation  to  every  party  and
minority group, but it takes public representatives away from the  judgement
of the voters. Most  submissions  to  the  Slabbert  Commission  called  for
electoral reform -  a  call  which  has  fallen  on  deaf  ears.  The  local
government model which mixes  ward  with  PR  councillors  could  have  been
extended to the national and  provincial  parliaments.  The  voters  believe
that they have been ignored and it is little wonder that  they  then  reject
the political process.

The second is floor crossing. Business Day of  March  2003,  commented  that
floor crossing does not go down well with your  average  South  African.  My
party supported the principle of floor crossing where reasons of  conscience
so dictate, but the practice  has  also  been  open  to  abuse.  The  public
perceive floor  crossing  as  being  motivated  by  expediency  rather  than
principle and the efforts of the ANC and their new partners  to  achieve  by
defection  what  they  could  not  achieve  at  the  ballot  box  are   well
documented.

The third is corruption. A study by UNISA academics in 2002  concluded  that
political elites from all parties including the ANC believe that  corruption
is on the increase in South Africa. This conclusion is  shared  by  ordinary
voters who see insiders benefiting from  corruption  and  therefore  retreat
further into cynicism as a consequence.

American academic E M Uslaner of the American Political Science  Association
said last year that societies like our own with high  levels  of  inequality
and low levels of trust  have  more  corruption  while  those  with  greater
individual freedom and strong property rights have less. It  has  also  been
shown in a number of studies that countries with a high level of  corruption
have lower levels of public support for  the  political  system.  These  are
matters which should be of concern to all of us.

All parties and particularly the ruling party  have  the  responsibility  to
take  these  issues  seriously  and  restore  public   confidence   in   the
institutions of our democracy. Failure to do so will see the voters  passing
judgment on those they hold most  accountable.  In  the  words  of  Lawrence
Schlemmer: ``... our  new  democracy  markets  itself  as  a  representative
democracy but powerful priorities are steering it  towards  an  elite-driven
racial oligarchy...''

Before we can uncritically endorse the celebration of our  10th  anniversary
of constitutional freedom, we have a duty to ask  whether  a  more  or  less
open and a more or less fair and genuinely competitive society is  emerging.
Give us the evidence  that  we  are  moving  towards  an  open  society  and
evidence that we can see and believe. Give the people a  genuine  desire  to
celebrate 10 years of constitutional freedom.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Chairperson, comrades and hon members, I  would  like  to
start by congratulating the hon Mr Steele on  making  his  first  speech  in
this House, but I would like to exclude any congratulations on  the  content
of his speech. [Laughter.]

Nine years ago, the African sun rose and shone brightly  over  our  land  as
the African continent gave birth to a  new  democracy.  A  birth  for  which
millions of our people had dreamed and prayed. On that day, the  peoples  of
our land celebrated the birth of the new South Africa  and,  for  the  first
time, experienced the true warmth of the African sun. An African  dream  had
been born and the dawn of the African century was drawing near.

As a South African who has lived in the apartheid era  and  has  experienced
nine years of the new South Africa under the ANC, I can  honestly  say  that
the South Africa of today is a vastly changed and better country  than  that
of the one pre-1994. [Applause.]

As a young child I could never understand why when I went to the  shop  with
my mother, we could go in the front door and yet when I went with  the  lady
who helped to clean our home, we had to go to a side window. My first  visit
to Soweto was in 1976 at the age of eleven. I clearly remember that day  and
despite being so young, I was made to feel so welcome.

Why, I asked, did we have to live in separate areas?  In  1976,  my  parents
could only find two restaurants  in  Johannesburg  that  would  allow  South
Africans to eat together. In order to correct the painful injustices of  the
past, changes have had to be made.

We have inherited the legacy of apartheid. To change  this  legacy  requires
that each one of us participates actively in contributing positively to  the
success of our country. Many South Africans are assisting, but  it  requires
an even greater effort by each one of us.

Now, nine years into  our  young  democracy,  we  need  to  reflect  on  the
progress and advances that we have made. Changes have been brought about  in
our economy and steps have been taken and continue to  be  taken  to  ensure
that all the peoples of our land are able to participate  in  it.  Over  the
past nine years the South African economy has been acknowledged  as  one  of
the most well run and managed.

Mr Michael Coulson, deputy editor of the Financial Mail, wrote in 2002:


  There is no doubt that the achievement of fiscal and financial discipline
  has been one of the great achievements of the ANC Government since 1994.

The book, South Africa, the Good News, says:


  There can be little doubt that the team managing our economic health  are
  the finest ever to have done so for South Africa. They are hailed locally
  and their counsel is sought increasingly in various international forums.

[Applause.] Due to the fiscal policies of our country,  inflation  has  been
brought down, interest rates have come down and our  country's  debt  levels
have  been  reduced.  Just  yesterday,  the  Producer  Price  Index   levels
announced were at 30 year lows. These are achievements we can be proud of.

South Africa,  spearheaded  by  the  efforts  of  President  Mbeki  and  our
Government, has begun to play prominent international  roles,  chairing  the
Non-Aligned  Movement  and  the  African   Union.   Major   United   Nations
conferences such as the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  and  the
World Conference against Racism have been held in our country.

South Africa is playing a leading role through Nepad in the  development  of
the continent. Our advice is sought by countries throughout the world  on  a
range of issues. Through  the  efforts  of  the  South  African  Government,
investment and export opportunities  for  South  African  companies  are  at
levels not experienced before in our history. This is an achievement we  can
be proud of.

Tourism is becoming one of the major industries in our country. People  from
across  the  globe  visit  our  shores  and  experience   the   beauty   and
friendliness of our land and its people.  This  is  generating  a  range  of
business opportunities  for  all  South  Africans.  South  Africa  is  being
recognised as a leading player in the hosting of  international  conferences
and events,  generating  millions  of  rands  for  our  economy.  These  are
achievements we can be proud of.

Our sporting teams are competing in the international arena. Since 1994,  we
have won the Rugby World Cup, the African Cup of Nations and gold medals  at
the Olympic Games. We have seen many of  our  sporting  teams  and  men  and
women beating the best in the world. Some  of  the  most  memorable  moments
must have been watching Josiah Thugwane winning  the  Olympic  marathon  and
Penny Heyns winning double gold at the Olympics.

Sporting events have seen our  nation  united  as  never  before.  Who  will
forget the Rugby World Cup or the African Cup of Nations victories? If  only
we could show the same patriotism and unity for our country  as  we  do  for
our sport. Our national flag has reached  the  top  of  the  world  and  has
travelled to outer space. Surely, these are achievements  we  can  be  proud
of.

If we take ourselves back to 1990, who would  ever  have  imagined  that  we
would be able to talk about these momentous achievements and  progress  that
our country has made in a mere nine years! Together with these and  all  the
other achievements which previous comrades have spoken about, we have  every
reason to feel proudly South African.

Whilst there has been remarkable progress in our country, there is still  an
enormous amount of work to be done. Recently, campaigns  have  been  started
by South Africans calling for people to come  back  home,  to  the  land  of
their birth, to help make our country a winning and successful nation.

Our President has said that our  Government  supports  the  call  for  South
Africans to come back home. This is a clear indication that this  Government
is for all the people of our land. Too often we  hear  some  South  Africans
constantly waging a war of negativity  about  our  land.  Yes,  we  do  have
challenges but they are not insurmountable. We are  implementing  programmes
to address these challenges and we as a nation will succeed.

If only these individuals would realise the immense  harm  and  damage  they
cause to our land. If only they could be positive and lend a  helping  hand.
One of the negatives of the past nine years has  been  the  degeneration  of
the DA into a negative, destructive and unpatriotic party.  [Interjections.]


I am reminded of the conversation I had with Mr Wynand Malan in  July  1990.
He had just resigned as a member of Parliament and as co-leader of the  then
DP. At the time he indicated that the DP was dying. How right  he  was,  the
DP of 1989 had died. It had  and  has  become  a  right  wing,  conservative
party,  longing   for   the   benefits   they   enjoyed   under   apartheid.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

I am further reminded of a resolution that was put forward at the  DP  youth
congress in July 1990 which called for the DP to disband and join  the  ANC.
This was angrily rejected by the leadership of the  DP.  This  was  a  clear
indication  that  the  DP  wanted  to  remain  a  narrow   minority   party.
[Interjections.]

At the time the ANC was unbanned, comments were made by members  of  the  DP
that this was in fact not what they had wanted. Clearly,  the  DP  found  it
expedient to call for the unbanning of the  ANC  whilst  at  the  same  time
enjoying the benefits of apartheid and they would have preferred the  status
quo to remain. [Applause.] In fact, it is becoming  more  and  more  evident
that the DA of today would prefer to still be calling for the  unbanning  of
the ANC as this would enable them  to  continue  enjoying  the  benefits  of
apartheid. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: You were a part of it.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: I was never a part of it.

In a few months time we will have to make choices about the  future  of  our
country. These will include the choice to be a true patriot, the  choice  to
be proud of our President and  the  choice  to  be  proud  of  our  country.
[Interjections.] I made my choice a long time ago, to be part of  a  winning
nation, to be proud of South Africa, to support and work for my country  and
to  be  part  of  the  majority  and  not  the  minority.   [Interjections.]
[Applause.]  Today, I want to call on  South  Africans,  and  in  particular
white South Africans, to join me ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Please take  your  seat,  hon  member.
Hon members, the interjections are totally out of hand. The speaker  at  the
podium cannot be heard and I think he is battling to complete his speech.  I
do not think that is fair on him. Hon members, I must  appeal  to  you,  for
the second time, to please stop the heckling that has  now  emerged  and  is
totally out of hand. Please continue, hon Schneemann.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Chairperson, today I want to call on South Africans,  and
in particular white South Africans, to join me in the choices  I  have  made
and join me in supporting the  ANC.  They  are  choices  one  cannot  regret
making.

In conclusion, after  nine  years  of  democracy  and  one  year  before  we
celebrate our first decade of freedom, the peoples of our land bask  in  the
warmth of the African sun. They share and enjoy the richness of the  African
soil. They have been restored to their rightful place as the true  sons  and
daughters of this, our South African land. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon members. Hon members,  when
the  Chair  calls  for  order,  there  needs  to  be  order.  You   continue
interjecting, although the Chair is calling for order.

Now, I will have to name you, because you simply are not  listening  to  the
Chair. I am appealing to you for the last time. When  the  Chair  calls  for
order, please listen.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, there is always one big danger in  festivities
and celebrations, namely waking up  the  next  morning  with  a  hell  of  a
babalas, and all the problems  are  still  there  ...  [Laughter]  ...  only
bigger and heavier. To  awake  after  a  multi  million  rand  party,  still
overwhelmed  by  crime,  unemployment,  affirmative  action  and   with   no
expectations of overcoming them, will merely dump us in a  huge  after-party
depression.

Ek glo ons almal is na 10 jaar slimmer en wyser as in 1994. [I believe  that
after 10 years we all know more and are wiser than we were in 1994.]

The best way to celebrate is to reflect on the  ten  years  and  to  revisit
those areas  where  certain  communities  are  marginalised  by  the  social
contract of 1994.

Ons het basies twee wêrelde wat met mekaar versoen moes word.  Aan  die  een
kant, 'n wêreld waar die koestering  van  die  eie  eiendom  en  kultuur  en
godsdiensgoedere wat vir ons kosbaar is, prioriteit geniet -  maar  wat  tog
in die transformasie in Suid-Afrika in die spervuur verkeer. Aan  die  ander
kant   is   daar   'n   wêreld   waar   armoede,    siektes,    dakloosheid,
onderwysloosheid, werkloosheid, beperkte middele en  menswaardige  nood  die
grootste prioriteite is.

Is die uitdaging vir die tweede dekade van ons nuwe demokrasie nie juis  dat
die erkenning en daadwerklike aanspreek van hierdie  twee  stelle  behoeftes
nie net met mekaar versoen moet word nie, maar mekaar juis  moet  aanvul  en
stimuleer. Is die een nie dalk die sleutel tot die ander eerder as  wat  dit
twee botsende pole is wat voortdurend in konflik moet wees  nie?  Die  vraag
kan met reg gevra word of hierdie wederkerige afhanklikheid tussen dié  twee
stelle behoeftes by Kemptonpark raakgesien is en  verdiskonteer  is  in  die
sosiale kontrak wat Suid-Afrika se mense met mekaar gesluit het?  Persoonlik
glo ek dat juis dit die grootste uitdaging is vir die  volgende  tien  jaar,
dat Suid-Afrika se gemeenskap nie sal ophou om met mekaar te praat nie;  nie
sal ophou om te berus by 'n skikking wat eenmaal  bereik  is  nie.  Dat  ons
veel eerder, veel wyser vanuit die kosbare ondervinding en  ook  die  skades
en skandes van die eerste tien jaar daagliks sal bou en uiteindelik  formeel
sal beslag gee aan wat die Groep van 63, 'n opvolgskikking noem.

Die behoeftes van  die  verskillende  gemeenskappe  hoef  nie  vir  ewig  in
botsing met mekaar te verkeer nie. Met die regte gesindheid  van  wedersydse
respek en lojaliteit teenoor 'n gedeelde vaderland  en  kontinent,  kan  die
een eerder die sleutel tot die ander wees. Dalk is daar vir ons  'n  les  te
leer uit die ou film van Jamie Uys, "Hans en die Rooinek". Die twee  geswore
vyande was gedwonge saam te voet op pad van die Kaap na  Pretoria.  Die  een
met vuurhoutjies, die ander met 'n sigaret.  Albei  het  uit  hardkoppigheid
rookloos gebly, totdat die nood hulle gedwing het: Jou  vuurhoutjie  is  die
sleutel tot my sigaret, en omgekeer. So alleen sal Suid-Afrika die  pyp  kan
rook. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We basically had two worlds that had to be reconciled with each  other.  On
the one hand, a world in which the cherishing  of  one's  own  property  and
culture and religious beliefs which are precious to us take priority  -  but
which are nevertheless in the cross-fire during the transformation in  South
Africa. On the other hand there  is  a  world  in  which  poverty,  disease,
homelessness, lack of education, unemployment, limited means and human  need
are the greatest priorities.

Is the challenge for the second decade of our  new  democracy  not  in  fact
that the recognition and active addressing of these two sets of  needs  must
not only be reconciled with each other, but  must  actually  complement  and
stimulate each other. Is the one not the key to the other rather than  their
being two conflicting  poles  that  must  be  in  continuous  conflict?  The
question can rightly be asked whether this mutual dependence  between  these
two sets of needs was noticed and taken into account at Kempton Park in  the
social contract which South Africa's people concluded with  one  another?  I
personally believe that this is in fact the greatest challenge for the  next
ten years, that South Africa's community will  not  stop  speaking  to  each
other; will not stop abiding by an agreement which has  been  reached.  That
we shall rather, far  wiser  from  the  valuable  experience  and  also  the
experience of  the  first  ten  years,  build  and  eventually  give  formal
substance to what the Group of 63 calls a follow-up agreement.

The needs of the various communities do not have to remain in conflict  with
one another forever. With the right attitude of mutual respect  and  loyalty
to a divided fatherland and continent, the one can rather be the key to  the
other. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from the old film of Jamie Uys,  ``Hans
en die Rooinek''. The two sworn enemies had no option but to  walk  together
from the Cape to Pretoria. The one had matches, the other had  a  cigarette.
Because they were  both  stubborn,   neither  of  them  could  smoke,  until
desperation forced their hand: Your match is the key to  my  cigarette,  and
vice versa. Only in this way will South Africa be able to make the grade.]]

Mr M WATERS: Thank you, Chair. The hon Mabe is obviously  unaware  that  the
entire representivity  of  one  of  the  DA's  predecessors,  the  PFP,  was
entirely female for 13 years and led by Helen Suzman. That is what the  DA's
been doing for gender empowerment. [Interjections.]

South Africa has much to celebrate, next April. We will have had  ten  years
of democracy. We will be celebrating the day the  brutal  NP  regime  of  46
years was legitimately kicked out of office, an  office  they  should  never
have held in the first place.

However, to start debating this event some ten months prior  to  the  actual
event is, quite frankly, a waste of Parliament's time.  The  title  of  this
debate does not even make sense and the voters are probably and  justifiably
wondering whether we do not have anything better to debate,  such  as  dodgy
oil or rotten arms deals.

Let us debate this special report into the arms  deal,  which  was  released
today, and what role the Cabinet played in it.  Instead,  we  debate  issues
such as preparations to celebrate the first decade of freedom. Honestly,  if
we do not take ourselves seriously, how on earth can we expect anybody  else
to?

What we should be discussing are  issues  like  child  abuse  and  HIV/Aids,
which South Africans are forced to face every day. We only have  to  open  a
newspaper to know what horrific  crimes  have  been  committed  against  our
children. This week, the Mpumalanga police have expressed outrage  regarding
the dramatic increase  in  rural  child  rape  over  the  last  six  months.
Provincial  Commissioner,  Eric  Nkabinde,  said  Mpumalanga  was   breeding
monsters, with up  to  300  sex  crimes  against  children  currently  being
reported per month.

He further stated, and I quote:


  It is not strange anymore that up to ten child rape  cases  are  reported
  every day. The latest rapes included that of a two year old toddler girl,
  raped at the crèche by an 18-year old, a 14-year  old  girl  raped  at  a
  lodge by a visitor, the next day the man raped her in a room  and  a  ten
  year old boy was raped by a 20-year old family  friend  in  Tonga,  while
  herding cattle.

Mpumalanga has only four child protection  units  with  a  provincial  staff
shortfall of 71%. They also have the highest caseload in the  country,  with
the Nelspruit unit having a staggering 141 cases per investigating officer.

Another topic the ANC steers clear of like the plague, although  it  affects
every household in our country, is HIV/Aids. Amazing! We  debate  topics  as
irrelevant as preparations to celebrate the first decade of freedom, but  we
have yet to have a debate on HIV and Aids and how it is impacting  on  South
Africa. We have never debated that in this House. [Interjections.]

A disease that is killing more South Africans than  anything  before  it,  a
staggering 600 people a day, and we do not  debate  it  in  this  House.  In
fact, by the time we reach  27  April  2004,  approximately  200  000  South
Africans, watching this irrelevant debate on TV, would have died. Up to  200
000 of them would have died. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Why are you participating?

Mr M WATERS: Because we have to, to get our point across.

Up to 13% of children between the ages of two and 14 years have lost one  or
both parents due to Aids. There is no strategy on the  ANC's  part  to  keep
parents alive. We have already prepared over 900 000 graves for  people  who
have died of  Aids  and,  unless  the  ANC  Government's  narrow-minded  and
outdated stance  on  HIV/Aids  is  changed  and  a  national  antiretroviral
programme is implemented, the only thing we  will  be  preparing  for  as  a
nation ten years from now, will be a further 900 000 graves.

I put it  to  this  Government  that  there  is  a  time  and  a  place  for
everything, including celebrations. Let us not insult our people by  getting
that wrong. [Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, I believe that  this  debate  today  is
one that not only reflects on the past ten years, but also one in  which  we
should take stock, in order to determine beyond doubt, who stands  where  in
this country. [Interjections.]

In my maiden speech in Parliament on 11 June 1998,  I  said  the  following,
and I quote:


  There are two special groups of people. Those who pray for me  every  day
  and those special people whom I, as an Afrikaner, have come  to  know  so
  intimately during the past five years. These are the people who  made  me
  realise that, personally, I could only be free once I have  accepted  the
  freedom of equality of all the people in this country.


  They are my friends and my brothers and sisters in the townships  in  the
  northern areas of Port Elizabeth, who have introduced me to a world and a
  people that I knew were there, but a world and a people I did not  really
  know existed.


  This is the world of the people who are  still  desperately  in  need  of
  jobs. These are the people who still do not have a  permanent  roof  over
  their heads and who have no electricity or running  water.  This  is  the
  world of the people who grew up with slogans such as ``liberation  before
  education'' and ``one settler one bullet''.


  This is also the world of the  people  who  say  they  have  found  their
  freedom, but nothing has really changed. Sadly, however, this new freedom
  has  not  brought  along  with  it  peace  from  violence,  uninterrupted
  education, speedy delivery  of  housing  and,  in  the  Eastern  Cape  in
  particular, care for the aged and pensioners.


  This country is pregnant with potential but it has not yet come into  the
  fullness of its new birth, because of a  lack  of  understanding  of  the
  fears, the aspirations and the realities of this  newborn  child.  It  is
  with these realities in mind and  a  message  from  the  people  in  Port
  Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape, that I stand here today, saying that  the
  very essence of Government  is  not  to  forget  the  needs,  dreams  and
  aspirations of those we have left behind at home and whom we are here  to
  represent.


  I believe that the hurts and the injustices of the past are  etched  into
  the minds and the souls of the generations  who  have  experienced  these
  things, and they cannot be eradicated. However, I believe it is our  duty
  to create an environment that will be condusive to the growth of a nation
  that will not point fingers of accusation, but will extend  its  arms  of
  embrace in order to grow into its fullness, in  the  hands  of  the  next
  generation.

That was 1998. Today, five years later, I can undoubtedly say that  the  New
NP has grown into the new South Africa. Today, we in the New NP  can  say  a
lot has happened to improve the quality  of  life  of  every  South  African
citizen. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Today we have better education, today we  have  much  speedier  delivery  of
housing, today we are taking better care of the elderly,  our  children  and
the poorest of the poor. Today millions of people  have  running  water  and
electricity. Today I am proud to say that in the search to be  part  of  the
builders of this country, the New NP has opted to  walk  down  the  road  of
reconcilliation and nation-building.
As the New NP opted to move closer to the centre of the political  spectrum,
we have chosen to work together with  the  Government,  to  build  a  better
South Africa for  all  its  people,  and  we  are  commited  to  a  positive
contribution by working hand in hand with the Government.

Die realiteit is ook dat daar diegene in hierdie land is wat  steeds  hunker
na voor-1994. 'n Bewys hiervan is die agb Sakkie Blanché  se  stemverklaring
en ek haal aan: [The reality is also that there are those  in  this  country
who are still hankering after pre-1994. Proof of  this  is  the  hon  Sakkie
Blanché's declaration of vote, and I quote:]


  In the old South Africa, Public Works was one of the best run departments
  in the administration. Now, it seems that the ANC Ministers and nine MECs
  around the country  must  be  trained  and  retrained  to  improve  their
  performance. There are too many things going wrong  in  this  department,
  for which the Minister must take responsibility.

It is clear that the DA thinks  that  this  Government  does  not  have  the
ability, and that black people in this country do not have  the  ability  to
govern this country. [Interjections.] [Applause.] To the DA we want  to  say
that one can be a member of the opposition, one is entitled to be  a  member
of the opposition, but one must still stay a patriotic South African.

I am saying that the DA should stop pretending that since 1994,  this  is  a
country that belongs to black people, so that when  things  go  wrong,  they
can point fingers and say it is  not  us,  but  them.  The  DA  should  stop
talking about us and them, they should start  talking  about  us,  as  South
Africans. This country belongs to  all  of  us  and  the  New  NP  does  not
hesitate to take co-ownership with the ANC. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Deputy Speaker, I can understand the  ignorance  of  Mr
Waters, but the arrogance is too much to bear ... [Interjections.]  ...  and
so let me say to those who were still in  nappies  when  there  was  a  real
struggle to be fought, when people went to prison,  went  into  exile,  were
murdered, were hanged, that what we are  celebrating  today,  in  the  first
instance, is 48 years of the Freedom Charter. [Applause.]

Forty-eight years ago the Congress of the People adopted this  Charter.  But
what was important was that many months before the actual  event  volunteers
went out. They went to rural villages, into factory canteens at lunch  time,
into the dusty  streets  of  our  townships,  into  mine  compounds  and  to
traditional imbizos. The  volunteers  went  with  a  simple  question.  They
asked: "What would you do, if you were the government?" In 1955 this was  an
audacious question to ask in a squatter camp or at a road-side  construction
site. These were, remember, the  granite  years  of  apartheid.  It  was  an
unthinkable question, but it was a profound and liberating question.

Hundreds of thousands of ordinary South Africans, most  of  them  black  and
disenfranchised, spoke out about  land  and  housing,  about  education  and
about health care. They said that they wanted to  live  in  a  South  Africa
that  belonged  to  all,  black  and,  remarkably,  given   300   years   of
colonialism, white.

As we move towards the first decade of freedom, this vision of  the  charter
of the people becomes an important reference point to  assess  our  progress
and to grasp the long road that still lies ahead. My ANC comrades and  other
colleagues here, the hon Ngubane and others, have spoken very  movingly,  in
detail, about their personal experiences and about  the  important  advances
that we have made, not just as the ANC, but as a country, since 1994.

For us in the ANC the profound process of transformation  in  which  we  are
engaged is a national democratic revolution. This transformation process  is
national because it is about nation-building. It  is  about  constructing  a
common  sense  of  citizenship  and  constructing,  also   critically,   the
infrastructural scaffolding for a single nation - integrated towns,  cities,
villages and suburbs.

It is  a  national  struggle,  the  struggle  for  national  transformation,
because it is a struggle against national  oppression.  Not  as  an  act  of
charity, from whites giving blacks some  crumbs,  but  because  to  build  a
prosperous South  Africa  we  have  to  build  on  the  liberated  energies,
aspirations and traditions of struggle of millions of black compatriots  who
have tasted the bitter bread of daily oppression, who have survived and  who
have prevailed.

This transformation process is also national because it  is  about  building
national  self-determination.  It  is  our  collective  struggle  as   South
Africans to be  able  to  decide  on  the  policies,  the  quality  and  the
character of our own democracy, free from the bullying and  manipulation  of
powerful external forces.

The key nation-building task that we face today is surely the imperative  of
pushing back the frontiers of  poverty.  These  frontiers  are  not  natural
phenomena. We are not talking about rivers  or  mountains.  We  are  talking
about socially constructed barriers, some historical, but many of  them  are
also being built and rebuilt daily as we speak, and that is what we have  to
push back.

It is the  continued  accumulation  of  wealth  in  the  hands  of  a  small
minority. It is the R54 billion  capital  outflow  between  1994  and  2000,
basically that surplus, produced here in our country by  the  sweat  of  the
brow, turned into profits and  then  running  away  from  democracy  in  our
country.

These barriers that we have to push back include the resistance of  affluent
suburbs to attempts  to  establish  more  equitable  rates  regimes  in  our
cities. It is the use  of  capital-intensive  technologies  in  cases  where
labour absorption is  perfectly  possible  and  absolutely  necessary  in  a
country with  high  levels  of  unemployment.  It  is  the  retrenchment  of
farmworkers  in  Limpopo,  to  bypass  a  minimum,  a  very  minimum,   wage
determination. It is the casualisation of workers everywhere,  in  the  name
of the free market - freedom, one wonders, for whom? - in order to  undercut
progressive  labour  legislation  that  the  hon  Leon  is,   quite   openly
campaigning to roll back. It is resistance to black economic empowerment  or
the  perversion  of  black  economic  empowerment  into  little  more   than
shuffling around the boardroom table to pre-emptively make some space for  a
few dark faces. It is the redlining of  communities  and  whole  regions  by
banks. It is loan sharks, the mashonisas, exploiting the people's  desperate
financial straits. These and many more  realities  are  the  frontiers,  the
barriers, that we must resolutely push back.

The barriers that we have to push back  are  also  international  realities.
Every single cow,  notoriously,  in  the  European  Union,  receives,  every
single day, two dollars of public subsidies coming from wealthy  governments
in the North. That is more than the majority of  individuals  receive  daily
on our continent. That subsidised cow is more than just a very  spoilt  cow.
That subsidy is part of a structured and daily reproduced  global  inequity:
a barrier to the exportation of African commodities. Which is  why,  by  the
way, we do need a government and we do need a president that are  active  on
the international scene. This is very important. In order to  fight  poverty
here, we also have to deal with global inequities. [Applause.]

We are constantly told that we need foreign investment, and yes, of  course,
we do. And of course we cannot cut ourselves off from  global  markets.  But
the  DA's  economic  policies  are  built  on  advising  us  to  deepen  our
dependence  and  our  reliance  on  foreign  multinationals   and   external
investors. Their economic policies amount to advising us to strut our  stuff
on the global kerb-side, trying to attract passing traffic.

Which is why, wittingly  or  unwittingly,  they  so  grossly  misinterpreted
policies such as Gear. For them  Gear  is  entirely  about  making  eyes  at
foreign investors. But  actually  Government's  macroeconomic  policies  are
exactly the opposite. They are designed to lessen our dependency on and  our
vulnerability to external sharks in a volatile global  economy,  getting  us
away from soliciting on the global pavement.

This is also the reason the Growth and Development Summit did not  sit  down
and  ask  as  its  key  and  only  question:  "How  do  we  attract  foreign
investors?" The key question that was asked by the  Growth  and  Development
Summit was: "How as South Africans, as Government, as business,  as  labour,
as the commmunity sector, do we marshall our own resources  for  growth  and
development? And this is why  the  DA  was  so  off-balance,  so  absolutely
silent, in the run-up to the Growth and  Development  Summit,  because  they
were unable to offer any constructive policies around  marshalling  domestic
resources for growth and development. [Applause.]
Sidelined by their own inept policies, it comes  as  no  surprise  therefore
that the Leader of the Opposition is  now  calling,  after  the  Growth  and
Development Summit, from the sidelines, for the substitution of  Nedlac.  He
wants to come onto the field and take off Nedlac. He thinks  he  is  on  the
reserve bench, but actually he has been sent off, not by the race card,  but
by a red card. He is off. [Interjections.] Our revolution  is  national  and
it will therefore sideline those who cannot think patriotically.

Our national revolution is also a democratic revolution.  And  here  too  we
find sharp differences - polarised positions. As the ANC, and  not  only  as
the ANC but together  with  many  other  South  Africans,  we  are  actively
committed to deepening and enriching the democratic  breakthrough  of  1994.
That was the beginning, not the end.

Ours is a vision of a developmental state. The DA's vision of the new  South
African Government is of a neocolonial  state.  [Interjections.]  They  want
the state to be lean and mean. Lean, so that the wealthy who can  afford  to
pay for private health,  private  transport,  private  schools  and  private
security do not have to pay too much tax. For the poor, by  the  way,  there
is no health care if it is not public health care;  there  is  no  transport
unless it is public transport;  there  is  no  education  unless  there  are
public schools.

They want the Government to be lean, but they want it  to  be  mean  because
the restless native masses have to be disciplined and put  in  their  place.
[Interjections.] You think I am exaggerating? Consider  the  Nepad  founding
document. The founding document of Nepad is an  extensive  analysis  of  the
crisis of underdevelopment on our continent. It deals with  the  failure  of
the aid/debt nexus. It  envisages  massive  infrastructural  programmes.  It
envisages the changing of terms of trade, of  food  security  -  a  critical
issue on our continent. It talks about trying to  reverse  the  brain  drain
from our continent and much, much more.

In all of this, in this vast document, what is the single thought  that  the
DA plucks out with a small pair of tweezers? What does  it  pluck  out  from
this large Nepad document? One single  thing:  the  peer  review  mechanism.
That is all they can think of and that is all they can see in it.  For  them
that is the alpha and omega of Nepad. Why? Because they  want  to  turn  our
state into a prefect state. In the time-honoured traditions of  colonialism,
with its perversion of traditional leadership, of "boss boy"  and  "indunas"
in the reserves, in the compounds, in the colonies, in the  region,  outside
oubaas's front gate ... [Interjections.] We heard about that. For them  that
is Nepad. [Applause.]

Minister of Safety and Security, that is  exactly  also  their  position  on
their current theme song, their whole approach  to  crime  in  our  country.
This campaign of theirs amounts to saying: "The  ANC  Government  must  sort
out -`their' people - the  mini-bus  operators,  the  trade  unionists,  the
disorderly  masses  living  in  the  townships."  [Interjections.]  The  hon
Camerer, without any sense  of  selfconsciousness,  referred  to  the  "dark
underside" just now in this House. [Interjections.] "But",  they  say,  "the
Government must sort that out, that is the dark underside,  the  townships."
"But", they say, "give us the statistics. Let us do the  thinking.  We  will
do the white collar work but you get on  with  the  induna  work."  That  is
their vision of the South African state. [Applause.]
In the past several weeks four  very  interesting  things  happened  in  the
constituency in which I  work,  Blue  Downs,  which  is  mainly  a  coloured
working  and  lower-middle  class  township  just   across   the   N2   from
Khayelitsha. A few weeks  ago,  sadly,  all  the  musical  instruments  were
stolen from the Silversands Primary School. It is a poor school, but with  a
very enlightened principal and teaching staff and they are  very  passionate
about music and dance and take it seriously. And so it was quite  a  tragedy
when they lost all their musical instruments.

A few days later, unrelated, I assume, the DA chose Blue  Downs,  Kleinvlei,
as the site for launching their crime campaign. Because  the  hon  Leon  and
the hon Gibson cannot sing like Peter Marais, in order to attract  attention
to themselves they had to hire a Cape Minstrel band.
[Interjections.] With all this  hoopla  going  on,  while  Messrs  Leon  and
Gibson were pouring out all of their suburban cocktail hour lamentations  on
the good folk of Kleinvlei, Blue Downs, who had come to  listen,  presumably
to the band, barely a kilometre away the community policing  forum  and  the
neighbourhood  watch  from   Silversands   were   recovering   the   musical
instruments and returning them to the school. [Interjections.]

And then last  week,  the  fourth  noteworthy  event  that  happened  in  my
constituency was that the Ministers of  Justice,  Safety  and  Security  and
Public Works participated in the unveiling of a new court  complex  in  Blue
Downs, in an event co-hosted by the  local  community  policing  forum.  The
Blue Downs court complex  is  about  physically  bringing  justice  to  poor
communities.

And there, encapsulated within a few weeks in the life of a  poor  community
on the Cape Flats, one has the realities of the new South  Africa.  Schools,
principals,  teachers,  parents  and  students  making  music   in   adverse
conditions, but getting on with it.  There  one  has  a  community  policing
forum and six affiliated neighbourhood watches getting on with it.

A national Government, a developmental state,  transferring  resources  into
historically  neglected  communities  and   working   closely   with   local
structures - getting on with it. That is the picture, that is  the  snapshot
of this South Africa in transition. But, of course, the  tableau  would  not
be complete if we did not  also  have  one  hired  band  and  two  choirboys
chanting   their    litany    of    suburban    lamentations.    [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

Forty-eight years ago, as apartheid  tightened  its  grip  on  our  country,
volunteers went out to ask: "If you were  the  government,  what  would  you
do?"  I  do  not  think  people  answered:  "I  would  be  lean  and  mean."
Interestingly, they did not even answer: "Don't ask me. The government  must
govern."  What  they  said  was  something  much  richer   and   much   more
transformational. They said: "The people shall govern."

And now, today, in imbizos, in school governing bodies, in community  police
forums, in Nedlac - which they wanted to  do  away  with  -  in  Growth  and
Development  Summits,  in  ward  councils,  in  shopsteward   councils,   in
Parliament, unevenly, in the face of many barriers that have  to  be  pushed
back, collectively, millions of South Africans are answering  the  question:
"What would you do?" They are answering it in practice and they are  saying:
"This is what we are doing."  [Applause.]

         JUDICIAL OFFICERS (AMENDMENT OF CONDITIONS OF SERVICE) BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Deputy Speaker and colleagues, this Bill is the second piece of  legislation
that  is  derived  from  the  Judicial  Officers  Amendment  Bill  that  was
introduced towards the end of the 2001  session  of  Parliament.  The  first
Bill was, of course, the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions  of  Employment
Bill, now Act 47 of 2001.

The Bill amends five Acts in all. These amended  Acts  deal  primarily  with
the appointment of  magistrates  and  conditions  of  service  for  judicial
officers, that is judges and magistrates. It is important to note  that  the
provisions of the Bill can be divided into two main  categories  of  reform.
The first category sets  in  place  a  new  mechanism  for  determining  the
remuneration of judicial officers, while the second  category  gives  effect
to two separate judgments of the Constitutional Court, namely the  Satchwell
and Van Rooyen cases.

In seeking to provide an appropriate mechanism for determining the  salaries
of judicial officers, the Bill integrates the views  of  the  Constitutional
Court on this issue. As regards the Van Rooyen judgment, the court had  this
to say on the matter:


  Judicial officers ought not to be put in a  position  of  having  to  ...
  engage in  negotiations  with  the  executive  over  salaries.  They  are
  judicial officers, not employees, and cannot and  should  not  resort  to
  industrial action to advance  their  interests  in  their  conditions  of
  service. That makes them vulnerable to  having  less  attention  paid  to
  their legitimate concerns in relation to such matters,  than  others  who
  can advance their interest through normal bargaining  processes  open  to
  them.

However, the court took notice of the intention to involve  the  Independent
Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers in this matter,  as
proposed in the original Judicial Officers  Amendment  Bill,  and  expressed
itself as follows in paragraph 146 of the judgment:


  Unlike the magistrates, there is no filter between  the  judges  and  the
  executive to mediate the determination of their remuneration. Recognising
  this, the Minister has  submitted  a  Bill  to  Parliament  to  vest  the
  Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers with
  the power also to make recommendations on  the  salaries  of  judges  and
  magistrates.  This  is  part  of  the  evolving   process   of   judicial
  independence in South Africa.

I do not think that we could improve on  this  perspective,  other  than  to
confirm its intention and to express  the  wish  that  this  mechanism  will
address the  concerns  of  the  judiciary  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The
mechanism  provided  by  this  Bill  thus  remedies  current  anomalies  and
satisfies the requirements for a process that  complies  with  the  precepts
associated with judicial independence.

Apart from a peripheral discussion on the use of the independent  commission
as a vehicle for determining the salaries  of  judicial  officers,  the  Van
Rooyen decision also expressed itself on  other  matters.  Of  relevance  to
this amendment was the finding that section 9(4) of the Magistrates'  Courts
Act relating to the appointment of acting magistrates was  unconstitutional.
Clause 1 of the Bill before us thus substitutes the relevant  provisions  of
that Act with a view to putting the  appointment  of  acting  and  temporary
magistrates on a sound footing.

The second Constitutional Court  case  addressed  by  today's  Bill  is  the
Satchwell case. Here, the court held as unconstitutional the failure of  the
Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act to afford to  same-sex
life partners of judges the same rights  as  those  enjoyed  by  spouses  of
married judges. The Bill therefore amends the said Act  in  accordance  with
this ruling and carries this principle  forward  in  respect  of  the  lower
court  judiciary  through  the  insertion  of  a  relevant  clause  in   the
Magistrates Act.

The Bill that comes before us  today  is  part  of  an  ongoing  process  of
judicial reform. We will be introducing further legislation,  all  of  which
will incorporate aspects of the Judicial Officers Amendment  Bill  that  was
initially proposed in 2001. These  steps  will  be  taken  with  a  view  to
establishing a unified, transformed and independent judiciary in  line  with
government policy and as envisaged by our Constitution.

In closing, I would like to thank the chair and the portfolio committee  for
their careful preparation of the legislation that is  before  us  today.  In
addition, I would like to thank the officials in the department who  drafted
the legislation and supported the committee in its deliberations. I  support
the  amendments  contained  in  this   important   piece   of   legislation.
[Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Deputy Speaker, this is an awfully technical  Bill  and
an awfully technical debate to have at such a late hour, and I hope  not  to
keep the House too long. Essentially the Bill before us amends  four  pieces
of legislation.

I am seeing both sides of the House agreeing for the first time today.  This
is wonderful. The  Magistrates  Act,  the  Independent  Commission  for  the
Remuneration of Public Office Bearers Act,  the  Public  Finance  Management
Act and the Judges Remuneration and Conditions of  Employment  Act  are  all
Acts that we are currently amending.

Broadly speaking we regulate four main aspects pertaining to our  judiciary.
Firstly,  we  regulate  aspects  of  remuneration  for  judicial   officers.
Previously if a magistrate acted for a time in a post that had  attached  to
it a higher salary, that magistrate would not be  entitled  to  that  higher
salary for the time he or she would have served in that position.  The  Bill
now affords some measure  of  equity  and  equitable  remuneration  to  such
magistrates by establishing a new regime in this regard.

The second matter pertaining to remuneration of  the  judiciary  is  a  more
constitutionally significant one. Through this  piece  of  legislation,  the
salaries of judges and magistrates  will  be  referred  to  the  Independent
Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers. From now on,  like
MPs and Cabinet Ministers, judges will also have their  salaries  determined
after intensive enquiry by the independent commission.

A new development towards the transformation of our judiciary into a  single
judiciary is the role of  the  chief  justice  in  this  regard.  The  chief
justice will engage the commission on behalf of the entire  judiciary,  both
magistrates and judges. This of  course  implies  that  the  role  presently
played by the magistrates' commission will have to be brought in  line  with
the new salary mechanism.

The  second  issue  that  this  Bill  deals  with  relates  to  disciplinary
processes in the magistracy. The existing procedures are  vexed  and  result
many times  in  peculiar  and  even  embarrassing  situations  where  errant
magistrates  cannot  be  removed  through  irregular  application   of   the
disciplinary procedure.

We now, with this Bill, simplify the suspension procedures by providing  two
types of suspension:  Firstly,  a  provisional  suspension,  which  must  be
authorised by the Minister and confirmed  by  Parliament;  and  secondly,  a
sentence of suspension from office. Again we clarify when a  magistrate  may
be suspended from  office  and  provide  that  the  magistrates'  commission
recommends,  the  Minister   authorises   and   Parliament   confirms   such
suspensions. We believe that this procedure is more in line with the  checks
and balances in our Constitution and  will  instill  into  the  disciplinary
procedure of magistrates some certainty, fairness and restored dignity.

The other two issues which my colleague, the hon Masutha, will deal with  in
some detail are the matters around  acting  and  temporary  appointments  of
magistrates and meeting the constitutional obligations towards  spouses  and
partners of judicial officers. I  am  pleased  that  you  are  listening  Mr
Douglas. We believe that this  Bill  signifies  an  important  step  in  the
ongoing transformation of our judiciary and we commend it to  the  House  at
this very late hour. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The  DA  supports  the  Judicial
Officers (Amendment of Conditions of Service)  Bill  which  deals  with  two
main aspects of service on the Bench, namely  appointment  and  remuneration
in the case of magistrates and remuneration in the case of judges.

The purpose in relation to  magistrates  is,  as  has  been  said,  also  to
reinforce   their   constitutionally   guaranteed   independence,    thereby
addressing  the  issues  raised  by  the  Van   Rooyen   judgment   of   the
Constitutional  Court.  It  regulates  the  temporary  appointment,  by  the
Minister, of magistrates  for  short  periods  of  time  to  fill  temporary
vacancies and builds in certain safeguards  for  the  purpose  of  complying
with that judgment to remove any suspicion  of  undue  interference  by  the
executive by providing that  Parliament,  and  the  magistrates'  commission
must be informed if the vacancy remains unfilled for three months.

The DA will support any moves to reinforce the independence  of  the  Bench,
coming as it does on the heels of Minister  Penuel  Maduna's  assurances  to
Parliament during the discussion of his Vote that  Government  is  committed
to the  independence  of  our  judiciary.  This  is  a  move  in  the  right
direction. Such acting magistrates will get the same salary  as  permanently
appointed magistrates for that period.

An underlying purpose of this Bill is also to bring the appointment  process
and other conditions of service of magistrates more  closely  in  line  with
those of acting appointments in respect of judges. This is part  of  a  more
general longer term scheme, to have a unified Bench. The jury is  still  out
regarding to what extent and  how  soon  in  practical  terms  this  can  be
achieved. However, reinforcing magistrates' independent status  carries  our
full support.

The Bill also purports to streamline and constitutionalise  the  provisional
suspension of magistrates. Up  to  now  this  has  been  a  messy,  dubious,
prolonged and unsatisfactory process of which the  portfolio  committee  has
long been critical.  The  DA  therefore  welcomes  what  is  intended  as  a
substantial improvement, although how it will work in  practice  remains  to
be seen and we do hope that it does.

Ensuring that magistrates' and judges' salaries are also determined  by  the
Independent Commission for the Remuneration of  Public  Office  Bearers  and
providing  that  their  salaries  cannot  be  reduced  save  by  an  Act  of
Parliament is a welcome move to reinforce the  independence  of  magistrates
and bring their status into line with that of  judges  by  making  provision
for benefits to accrue  to  spouses  and  heterosexual  or  same  sex  life-
partners  of  these  magistrates  and  judges  in  line  with   the   recent
Constitutional Court's decision.

The Bill at last brings such matters into the  new  millennium  and  the  DA
fully supports this move. The previous exclusion of life-partners from  such
benefits was surely unconstitutional. The DA also  supports  the  amendments
to the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office  Bearers
Act increasing the number of members to eight  and  setting  out  guidelines
for  the  commission's  recommendations  on  renumeration.  We  take   great
pleasure in supporting this Bill.

Mr M T MASUTHA: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, colleagues and  comrades,
the Bill before us is intended to reinforce an important value  espoused  in
our Constitution,  namely  the  creation  and  fostering  of  a  single  and
independent judiciary which constitutes one of  the  three  pillars  of  our
constitutional democracy.

The introduction of this Bill by the ANC-led Government  must  therefore  be
seen as a clear indication of the ANC's commitment to upholding this  value.
Under the apartheid order magistrates and  the  courts  they  presided  over
were seen as mere extensions of the then  Department  of  Justice,  which  I
must remind the hon Camerer and her colleague Dr Delport they once  presided
over as the former Deputy Minister and Minister of Justice respectively  and
were therefore treated as such.

It is therefore not surprising that  the  kind  of  judgments  that  they  d
livered  and  the  manner  in  which  they  conducted   their   proceedings,
especially when black litigants were involved, often  reflected  the  racial
prejudice reminiscent of the apartheid government's policies  of  the  past.
Moreover the then  regime  saw  very  little  need  for  magistrates  to  be
appropriately  qualified  as  judicial  officers.  This  of  course  further
weakened their independence and ability to perform their  functions  without
fear or favour as contemplated under section 165(2) of our Constitution.

This Bill seeks to erode this legacy by, amongst other things,  substituting
the current section 9(i)(b) of the Magistrates Court  Act  of  1944  with  a
provision that states, and I quote:


  No person shall be appointed as  a  magistrate  of  a  regional  division
  unless he or she is appropriately qualified  and  is  a  fit  and  proper
  person and the magistrates' commission has informed the Minister that  he
  or she is  suitable  for  appointment  as  a  magistrate  of  a  regional
  division.

Secondly, because of the existing mechanism of creating temporary or  acting
appointments of magistrates which has resulted in the  prevailing  situation
in  which  magistrates  occupy  such  acting  or  temporary  positions   for
unreasonably long periods of time thereby undermining the current system  of
appointment of magistrates under the Constitution, the Bill seeks to  create
a clearer and simpler system of acting and temporary appointments.

In this regard the Bill provides in the first instance for three  situations
in which the Minister,  after  consultation  with  the  head  of  the  court
concerned, may make acting appointments  for  periods  not  exceeding  three
months at a time, namely in a  situation  where  a  magistrate  who  is  the
incumbent of that position is not available, a vacancy has  arisen  and  has
not yet been filled and an additional vacancy  has  arisen.  In  the  second
instance the Bill provides for the head of a regional division  or  a  chief
magistrate to make a temporary appointment for a period not  exceeding  five
days  to  take  care  of  emergency  situations  where  the   incumbent   is
unavailable to perform his or her duties owing to ill-health or  some  other
contingencies.

Allow me now  to  turn  to  the  matter  arising  from  the  well-publicised
Constitutional Court judgment in the Satchwell case, namely the  removal  of
unfair discrimination against same-sex partners of  judges  with  regard  to
survivors' benefits. As this  House  may  well  be  aware,  Judge  Satchwell
successfully challenged the constitutionality of  a  provision  in  the  law
governing survivors' benefits for judges as being discriminatory in that  it
only applies to spouses, a concept which is narrowly understood  in  law  to
refer only to persons that have entered into a valid marriage.

In Casu the court made an order in the following terms, and I quote:


  With effect from the date of this order sections 8 and 9  of  the  Judges
  Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act, Act 88 of 1989, are to  be
  read as though the following words appear therein after the  word  spouse
  "or partner in  a  permanent  same-sex  life  partnership  in  which  the
  partners have undertaken reciprocal duties of support."

This Bill seeks therefore to give effect to this court decision. Whilst  the
question of heterosexual partners who are engaged in a similar  relationship
was not before the court and was therefore not addressed by the  court,  our
committee deemed it prudent to extend this principle  to  benefit  surviving
partners in heterosexual relationships as well. Note that in both  instances
only one surviving partner stands to benefit.

In the case where a judge is married to more than one  spouse,  for  example
under customary law or religious law, however, the  surviving  spouses  will
not each receive the full survivors'  benefits  but  on  the  contrary  will
equally share the  single  benefit  applicable  to  one  spouse  between  or
amongst them. The same principle is sought  to  be  extended  to  survivors'
benefits in respect of magistrates as well. [Applause.]

Mr  T  E  VEZI:  Madam  Speaker,  the  amending  Bill  being  debated  today
represents yet another step in the  ongoing  process  of  bringing  existing
statutes into line with the Constitution and with judgments by  our  highest
courts. This is  a  very  necessary  process  as  it  leads  to  up-to-date,
relevant and appropriate legislation that is constitutionally and  therefore
legally sound and defendable.

I would like to highlight just four important aspects of the Bill.  Firstly,
the Bill brings the requirements for the  appointment  of  magistrates  into
line  with  the  Constitution  which  holds  that  magistrates   should   be
appropriately qualified and  be  fit  and  proper  persons.  The  Bill  also
enables and simplifies the process and consequences of  the  appointment  of
magistrates in acting and temporary capacities.

Secondly, the Bill inserts the so-called  Satchwell  court  order  into  the
Statute Book, in that  it  provides  that  benefits  currently  received  by
spouses of deceased judges would also be received by partners of  judges  in
permanent heterosexual or same-sex relationships. The morality of this  step
is not an issue here. What is important is that the provision  gives  effect
to a court order and the values of  a  liberal  Constitution  that  contains
known discrimination and the promotion of equality as central objectives.

Thirdly,  the  Bill  provides  that  an  Independent  Commission   for   the
Remuneration of Public Office  Bearers  will  make  recommendations  to  the
President  on  the  salaries  and  allowances  of  judges  and  magistrates.
Importantly, the Bill charges the chief justice with making a submission  on
behalf of the entire judiciary to the commission.  Also,  it  provides  that
Parliament should by resolution approve the President's determination  after
which any salary increase would come into effect and  be  backdated  to  the
time of the President's proclamation.

Fourthly,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  decided  to  retain   the
provision that enables Parliament to pass a resolution that would set  aside
the suspension of magistrates as it was the most important measure of  their
protection. The IFP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy Minister,  the  ACDP  believes  that
the amendments relating  to  same-sex  and  heterosexual  relationships  are
finessing into legislation, which otherwise might have  been  acceptable,  a
secular humanistic agenda which are in direct contradiction  to  the  Judeo-
Christian family values that we as Christian democrats hold dear.

The Constitutional Court, in a display of judicial  activism,  decided  that
from 17 March of this year, the relevant sections of the Act are to be  read
as though the following words appear therein, after the word  spouse:  -``or
partner in a permanent same-sex life partnership in which the partners  have
undertaken reciprocal duties of support". In a single  disdainful  sentence,
a basic moral position long shared by  Christians,  Jews  and  Muslims,  and
people of other faiths, has been reduced to nothing.

Clearly, the mere fact that the Constitutional Court has made such a  ruling
does not result in a ruling being morally  acceptable.  It  all  depends  on
one's particular point of view, ours being the biblical one that appeals  to
members of all faiths.

The portfolio committee additionally saw fit to extend  this  protection  to
include heterosexual unmarried persons. Such persons can  get  married,  but
choose not to. Why should their partners receive the same  pension  benefits
whilst they are not prepared to commit to one another  by  getting  married.
It is a case of having one's cake and eating it too.

Implementation will also present difficulties, as the department  will  only
be able to rely upon what the partners themselves say.  How  will  one  stop
partners fraudulently stating that they are in such permanent  relationships
in order to obtain pension benefits. The possibility for abuse is  enormous,
particularly if this principle is extended throughout the civil service.

The cost to the state will also be huge, with both homosexual and  unmarried
heterosexual partners being entitled to two-thirds of a judge's  salary  for
life. Has any  actuarial  costing  been  done?  And  will  the  Government's
pension fund be  able  to  carry  these  costs,  should  these  benefits  be
extended to all civil servants?

I am sure that these are some of the reasons why the  Minister  for  Justice
and Constitutional Development initially opposed the Satchwell  application.
The ACDP will not support this Bill. Our thanks to the NA  for  extra  time.
They also oppose this Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF supports the amendments made in  this
Bill to the following Acts: The Magistrates' Courts Act, 1944;  the  Supreme
Court Act, 1959; the Judges Remuneration and Conditions of  Employment  Act,
1989;  the  Magistrates  Act,  1993;  and  the  Independent  Commission  for
Remuneration of Public Office Bearers Act, 1997.

The main objective of the Bill appears  beneficial  and  in  line  with  the
constitutional values  of  our  country,  especially  in  terms  of  current
benefits received by the  spouses  of  deceased  judges.  The  mechanism  of
complaints against judges is a good step towards maintaining our  democracy.
The appointment requirements for  magistrates  are  well  in  line.  The  MF
supports the Judicial Officers (Amendment of Conditions  of  Service)  Bill.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Deputy Speaker, thank you. It would seem that everyone but  the  ACDP  fully
supports this Bill. Their objection pertains rather  to  the  constitutional
decision, which I believe is fundamental to the  spirit  and  ethic  of  our
Constitution, so I choose not to take issue with that at this point.

I would like to thank the members of the portfolio  committee  and  all  the
parties for their support for this legislation. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (African Christian Democratic Party dissenting.)

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC JOINT COMMITTEE ON REPARATIONS

Mr M T MASUTHA: I am sure everybody is now tired of my voice.  Nevertheless,
Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, once again allow me this time  on  behalf
of the Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Joint  Committee  on  Reparations,  Comrade
Andrew Mlangeni, who cannot be with us today due to a death in  his  family,
to present to this House the committee's report. I  am  sure  that  all  our
hearts are with him during this time of grieving.

The committee had been established  by  decision  of  the  Speaker  and  the
Chairperson   of   the   National   Council   of   Provinces   to   consider
recommendations made by  the  President  in  terms  of  section  27  of  the
Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, Act 34 of 1995.  In  its
written submission to the committee, the DA  stated  that  it  "rejects  any
attempt to substitute broader redistributive  programmes  for  reparations".
The committee decided that this assertion was  based  on  an  erroneous  and
unsubstantiated assumption by the DA about what was  being  put  forward  by
the President.

The committee  further  rejected  the  assertion  that  the  Act  was  aimed
exclusively at the granting of reparations to individuals only  and  not  to
granting redress to communities and the broader society  for  harm  suffered
as a result of gross human rights violations of the past.  Furthermore,  the
committee rejected the contention that symbolic  and  community  recognition
was intended to serve as  a  substitute  for  what  in  the  DA's  view  was
inadequate individual reparations.

The committee, having considered the  President's  speech,  identified  four
key areas on  which  the  recommendations  were  focused,  namely:  Firstly,
symbols and monuments; secondly,  rehabilitation  of  communities;  thirdly,
medical  benefits  and  other  forms  of  social  assistance  to  individual
victims; and lastly, final reparations.

The committee  further  categorised  these  recommendations  into  two  main
groups: those recommendations that seek to redress injustices  of  the  past
in a more holistic manner by focusing on the gross human  rights  violations
inflicted upon whole communities and broader society, on the one  hand;  and
those recommendations that seek to redress  gross  human  rights  violations
suffered by  individual  victims  identified  through  the  TRC  process  by
granting them some degree of relief, on the other.

The committee therefore supports  the  President's  recommendations  calling
for systematic programmes to project  the  symbolism  of  struggle  and  the
ideal of freedom through academic and informal records of history,  cultural
and art forms,  erecting  symbols  and  monuments  that  exalt  the  freedom
struggle, including new geographic and place names. It has,  however,  added
that it is necessary that in all this work the ideals of reconciliation  and
unity are also symbolised. The committee notes the  work  that  has  already
begun in this regard, including  the  establishment  of  Freedom  Park,  the
Garden of Peace and the renaming of streets and towns in  various  parts  of
the country.

The  committee  also   supports   the   Government's   commitment   to   the
rehabilitation of communities that  were  subjected  to  intensive  acts  of
violence and destruction. It notes the work that has already begun  in  this
area  and  it  endorses  the  focus  on  a  partnership   approach   between
communities and Government in pursuit of this objective.

The committee endorses the view that not only  individuals  but  also  whole
communities suffered and are still in distress. It therefore recognises  the
need for such communities to be  rehabilitated  through  various  programmes
mentioned by the President. Concerning  the  specific  needs  of  individual
victims identified by the TRC, the committee notes the  assurance  given  by
the President of programmes put in place to provide  for  medical  benefits,
education and other forms of social assistance.

In view of the claims  made  that  victims  have  not  always  obtained  the
assistance they require from government departments, the committee  proposes
that Parliament, in line with its oversight role, be provided  with  regular
reports by Government on progress  made  in  providing  such  assistance  to
victims.

The committee, having considered the President's  recommendations  regarding
final reparations, endorses the commitment of the Government  to  provide  a
once-off grant of R30 000 to those individuals or  survivors  designated  by
the TRC, over and above the other  material  commitments  already  mentioned
and the urgency with which the  President  commits  Government  to  allocate
these benefits.

We in the ANC concur with the President that no amount of money can make  up
for  lives  lost  nor  grant  sufficient  compensation  for  the  indignity,
humiliation and suffering that millions of our people were subjected to  and
agrees that for the majority of victims  and  heroes  of  the  struggle  the
sweet air of freedom they now can breathe, the sweet water of  human  rights
and dignity that they now can taste and the  warm  rays  of  democracy  that
they now can bathe themselves in to their hearts content are all the  things
they could ever ask for in return for their contribution to the struggle.

Therefore,  the  committee  recommends  that  Parliament  accepts  the  four
recommendations made  by  the  President  as  constituting  a  complete  and
appropriate response to  the  task  entrusted  to  him  in  this  regard.  I
therefore commend this report to this august House. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure  for  me  to  convey
the DA's position on the TRC reparations  report  on  behalf  of  our  chief
spokesperson on the TRC, the hon Dene Smuts, who  unfortunately  had  to  be
with her son who is undergoing an operation.

The position of the DA on the  President's  proposal  is  reflected  in  the
Report of the Ad  Hoc  Joint  Committee  on  Reparations  contained  in  the
Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports  of  25  June  2003  as  views
expressed, but not carried - that is in  reference  to  paragraph  2  -  and
contentions, not accepted - that is  in  reference  to  paragraph  3(4).  We
express our appreciation to the chairperson, the hon Mlangeni for  including
our position, even if it does not appear under our party's name.

It is incontestibly the case that the  reparations  promised  to  designated
victims are governed by sections 3, 4, 5, 25 and  26  of  the  Promotion  of
Unity and Reconciliation Act. These victims have waited  nearly  five  years
for individual reparations. Both the DA and the TRC have said  during  these
years that they were being  neglected  and  betrayed  despite  the  nation's
solemn obligation to them. That  they  are  finally  to  receive  an  amount
modest by comparison with even the TRC's unsatisfactory  1998  proposals  is
cause for some relief.

However, this step certainly does not satisfy the  demands  for  justice  in
the case of the 2 975 victims who emerged from the amnesty process.  It  was
only  the  promise  of   reparation   that   rendered   constitutional   the
extinguishing of their right to sue for damages. That is the basis on  which
we drafted the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act in 1995. And that  is
what the Constitutional Court confirmed after the AZAPO challenge.

These 2 975 victims, at minimum, should have been assessed for  actual  loss
and properly compensated. Do not forget that they are  victims  of  killing,
torture, abduction  and  severe  ill-treatment,  not  of  discrimination  or
apartheid. They include the victims of the liberation  movements  themselves
in their camps in exile.

Our assertion that monuments are cold comfort and that community  programmes
are no substitute for what was promised at the time is proved  by  the  fact
that an amendment has to be made to the Truth and Reconciliation  Commission
Act,  after  the  fact,  to  include  community  programmes  as  a  form  of
reparation.  This  amendment  still  has  to  serve  before  the   Portfolio
Committee  on  Justice.  As  a   supplementary   step,   very   often,   the
rehabilitation of communities ravaged by violence is welcome, but it  is  no
substitute for what was promised at the time.

The social, medical and other services offered are  no  more  or  less  than
what the Government owes any citizen in any case. In addition,  the  social,
medical and  other  services  offered  under  the  expanded  urgent  interim
reparations  programme,  when   Government   kept   postponing   its   final
reparations proposals, has sadly shown that they  are  meaningless.  We  are
pleased that the ad hoc committee has accepted our recommmendation  in  this
regard and that Parliament is now asked, through its  portfolio  committees,
to exercise annual oversight over these services.

We hope that the TRC-designated victims will now appeal to  their  MPs  from
all parties when departments fail to look after them instead  of  repeatedly
returning, as the  TRC  reported,  to  the  President's  Fund  empty-handed.
[Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ad  Hoc  Joint  Committee  on
Reparations in its report before  the  House  today,  groups  the  four  key
recommendations by the President on reparations into two  broad  categories.
Firstly, redress in  a  holistic  manner  to  communities  and  the  broader
society and, secondly, redress to individual victims of gross  human  rights
abuses under apartheid.

The IFP supports this approach as we support the principle that  whoever  is
entitled in law to reparations,  should  receive  such  reparations  as  are
deemed  appropriate.  We  also  support  the  main  recommendation  of   the
committee that Parliament accepts the President's four  recommendations  and
that the practical arrangements will be undertaken  through  regulations  in
terms of the Act.

We also recognise, having  been  represented  on  the  committee,  that  its
mandate was restricted to the President's recommendations flowing  from  the
TRC process. However, the IFP is duty-bound to point out that only  a  small
fraction of the victims of apartheid appeared before the TRC.  In  all  only
19 000 victims did so, which immediately highlights  the  indisputable  fact
that there were far more victims even in the broadest sense of the word.

The  President's  recommendations  on   reparation   and   the   committee's
consideration of and report on them, therefore, deals with  only  one  small
process. In  other  words,  reparation  to  victims  that  were  statutorily
provided for. The challenge this  House  faces,  as  indeed  the  Government
does, is how to deal with those  victims  of  apartheid  who  could  not  be
accommodated under the TRC process, or who chose not to  take  part  in  its
proceedings for a variety of reasons.

An argument has been advanced that reparations to these victims are  already
taking the form of Government's endeavours in  meeting  the  basic  economic
and social needs of the people who suffered under apartheid. On the  surface
that sounds reasonable enough, until one realises  that  providing  for  the
basic needs of a country's citizens is in fact  any  Government's  duty.  It
has no choice but to do so. If it did not, it would not  be  fulfilling  its
electoral, legal and constitutional mandate and could reasonably  expect  to
be voted out of office at the next and earliest opportunity.

Therefore, another method must be found  to  compensate  those  millions  of
victims of apartheid who will not  benefit  from  the  existing  reparations
policy. At this point, the IFP would not  like  to  propose  any  particular
method or process, except to say that its ultimate form  should  be  decided
by a national debate and  by  national  consultation  with  the  victims  of
apartheid who will not benefit at this point. Failure to do so would in  our
opinion leave too much unfinished business that could bedevil the future  of
our democracy.

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, die Nuwe NP steun  die  verslag
soos voortgebring deur die Ad Hoc komitee oor reparasies. Daar is  egter  'n
paar dinge wat uitgelig behoort te word.

In die eerste instansie steun ons die gedagte van die aanwys van simbole  en
monumente heelhartig. Ek wil egter ook 'n beroep doen op  almal  wat  geraak
is om aanbevelings te doen by die spesifieke komitee wat dit reeds hanteer.

Wat interessant is, is die feit dat daar ook 'n suggestie van die  President
is dat gemeenskappe in hul totaliteit opgehef behoort te word. En weer  eens
berus hier 'n groot verantwoordelikheid op elke lid van hierdie  raad,  elke
openbare verteenwoordiger van hierdie gemeenskappe wat sleg  geraak  is,  om
daardie sake onder die aandag van die Regering te bring.

Wat  ook  interessant  is,  is  die   voorstel   van   die   Waarheids-   en
Versoeningskommissie dat daar jaarliks vir die  volgende  ses  jaar  gereeld
verslag gedoen moet word aan die Parlement deur die onderskeie  departemente
om oorsig te gee en verslag te doen oor  wat  presies  hulle  alles  in  hul
departemente gedoen het met betrekking tot reparasies.

Die gedagte wat deur die agb Camerer uitgespreek word, en dus  ook  nou  die
DA se weiering of verset is teen  die  verslag,  is  vir  my  nogal  redelik
insiggewend, want ons kan verstaan dis nou weer  verkiesingstyd.  Hulle  sal
graag die 2 975 aan hulle kant wil hê. Hulle  redenasie  gedurende  die  ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the  New  NP  supports  the  report
published by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reparations. There are, however, a  few
things that should be highlighted.
In the first place we support the idea of the  designation  of  symbols  and
monuments wholeheartedly. However, I would also like to appeal  to  everyone
who has been affected to make  recommendations  to  the  specific  committee
that is already dealing with this.

It is interesting that there is also a  suggestion  by  the  President  that
communities as a whole should be uplifted. And here,  once  again,  a  great
responsibility rests  on  every  member  of  this  House,  on  every  public
representative of these communities which have been adversely  affected,  to
bring those matters to the attention of the Government.

What is also interesting is the proposal of  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission that for the next six years there  should  be  a  regular  annual
report to Parliament by the various departments  to  give  an  overview  and
report on exactly what they have done in their departments  with  regard  to
reparations.

The idea expressed by the hon Camerer, and which also  represents  the  DA's
refusal or objection with regard to the report, is  fairly  enlightening  to
me, because we can understand that it is  once  again  election  time.  They
would like to have the 2 975 on their side. Their argument during the ...]

... deliberations was that we should accept the proposals made  by  the  TRC
that R21 700 per victim should be paid out over a period of six years.  Now,
that is a noble idea, but on the other hand they do not tell  us  where  the
money must come from.

Want dit is nie die enigste aanbeveling wat die WVK gemaak  het  nie.  Hulle
het ook gepraat  van  welvaartbelasting.  Aan  die  ander  kant  is  die  DA
doodstil,  want  hulle  wil  hul  kiesers   wat   geraak   sal   word   deur
welvaartbelasting nie te na kom nie en aan die  ander  kant  wil  hulle  ook
weer ... Jy kan nie alles vir almal te aller tye wil wees nie.

En daarom stem die Nuwe NP heelhartig saam met die President wanneer  hy  sê
geen bedrag wat die  Regering  gaan  uitbetaal  sal  ooit  kan  vergoed  vir
lewensverlies en vir die trauma wat mense reeds deurgegaan het  nie.  Daarom
is dit ook belangrik dat die President daarna verwys het dat ons  mense  nie
bloedgeld moet aanbied nie. Die Nuwe NP ondersteun dus 'n finale,  eenmalige
uitbetaling van R30 000 en ons ondersteun die program ten volle.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Because that was not the  only  recommendation  the  TRC  made.  They  also
mentioned prosperity tax. The  DA,  on  the  other  hand,  keeps  completely
quiet, because they do not want to offend their voters who will be  affected
by prosperity tax, and on the other hand they also want to  ...  One  cannot
be all things to all people at all times.

And for this reason the New NP  agrees  wholeheartedly  with  the  President
when he says no amount that the Government is going to  pay  out  will  ever
compensate for  loss  of  life  and  for  the  trauma  people  have  already
suffered. For this reason it is also important that the  President  referred
to the fact that  we  should  not  offer  people  blood-money.  The  New  NP
therefore supports a final, once-off payment of R30 000, and we support  the
programme in its entirety. [Applause.]]

Mrs M A SEECO: As indicated in the principal debate on the matter, the  UCDP
concurs with the findings of the  TRC  up  to  and  including  the  once-off
blanket offer to all the victims of  atrocities  by  the  President  of  the
Republic.

Hinging on the spirit of reconciliation as captured by the  authors  of  the
interim constitution, all the reparations should answer to ubuntu.  However,
the recommendations by the TRC should not be construed as  asking  too  much
from somebody. That apology could heal all wounds and afford this country  a
fresh start in the new decade.

The construction and erection of symbols and monuments should be done  in  a
peaceful manner, showing understanding of the situation. They should be  put
up for reparation of relations and  not  retaliation.  To  us  there  is  no
problem in this instance, because, wherever they are  put,  in  time  people
will identify with the symbols and monuments of their choice. And  democracy
gives people the right to choose what they want and not  be  bulldozed  into
what is the preference of the majority.

As we said before, no amount of money can ever be sufficient to replace  any
life. We call on all our people  to  appreciate  and  accept  the  token  of
goodwill in the form of the R30 000 once-off grant. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The MF feels the  hardship
and pain that the victims who took their cases to the TRC endured.

The relating of experiences seldom left a dry eye.  The  experience  of  our
nation has been traumatic and though we stand free  as  a  democracy  today,
the sufferings of our people needed justice, which the  TRC  has  taken  the
initiative to achieve.

Reparation to these 22 000 or so victims is expensive and with the state  of
our nation  in  terms  of  poverty  and  other  negativities,  seems  barely
possible. However, the MF feels that as a nation it  is  our  responsibility
to ensure the wellbeing of all and in line with  this,  voices  its  support
for any strategies suggested by the committee in terms of reparation.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Adjunkspeaker, die  afhandeling  van  die  WVK-proses  kon
baie maklik ontaard het in 'n dermsuitrygproses van  voor-af  van  blaam  en
skuld werp en van verhoudinge vertroebel. Die NA  glo  egter  dat  president
Mbeki hierdie saak verstandig gehanteer het en die toon aangegee het vir  'n
versoenende hantering en oplossing van 'n delikate saak.

Volkome geregtigheid is in 'n gebroke samelewing nie moontlik nie.  Lewe  en
pyn kan  nooit  in  geld  uitgedruk  word  nie.  Die  beste  manier  om  die
samelewing te herstel is deur geregtigheid en dan ook deur dit  waarmee  ons
vandag en elke dag besig is. 'n Bedrag van  R30  000  as  'n  gebaar  is  'n
simbool vir die slagoffers van misdade in die verlede en moet  ook  sodoende
beskou word.

Ek sien in die verslag dat plekname ook verander moet word om aan  die  WVK-
verslag gestand te doen. Kan ek u daaraan herinner  dat  die  Afrikaners  ná
die Anglo- Boere-oorlog, ná die verdrukking deur  die  Engelse,  amper  geen
pleknaam verander het nie. Dít is nie die manier om dit te doen nie. Die  NA
ondersteun hierdie verslag en ons wens al die  lede  'n  aangename  resestyd
toe. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, the conclusion of the  TRC  process  could
very  easily  have  degenerated   into   an   over-analytical   process   of
apportioning  blame  and  levelling  accusations  all  over  again  and   of
bedevilling  relations.  However,  the  NA  believes  that  President  Mbeki
handled this matter wisely and gave the keynote for a conciliatory  handling
of and solution to a delicate matter.

Absolute justice is not possible in a fragmented society. Life and pain  can
never be expressed in terms of money. The best way of restoring  society  is
by means of justice and then also by means of that which  we  do  today  and
every day. An amount of R30 000 as a gesture is a symbol for the victims  of
crimes in the past and must also be regarded as such.

I see in the report that place  names  also  have  to  be  changed  to  give
substance to the recommendations of the TRC report. May I  remind  you  that
the Afrikaners, after the Anglo  Boer  War,  after  the  oppression  by  the
British, changed virtually no place names  at  all.  The  NA  supports  this
report and we wish all the members a pleasant recess. [Interjections.]]

Mr E M SIGWELA: Hon Deputy Speaker, the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Reparations
recommends that this Parliament accepts the  four  recommendations  made  by
our President in this regard. That is,  firstly,  systematic  programmes  to
project  the  symbols  of  the   struggle   for   freedom;   secondly,   the
rehabilitation of  communities  that  were  subjected  to  intense  acts  of
violence and destruction; thirdly,  medical  benefits  and  other  forms  of
social assistance and fourthly, with regard to specific cases of  individual
victims identified by the Promotion of  National  Unity  and  Reconciliation
Act, Act 34 of 1995, final reparations by providing a once-off grant of  R30
000 to those individuals or survivors designated by the TRC over  and  above
the other material commitments already mentioned.

The ANC accepts these recommendations, as they give a clear guide to  us  as
a nation on how we  can  move  the  fixation  on  the  trauma  of  apartheid
brutalisation into a programme of reconciliation as we stand together,  both
perpetrator and victim. We need to accept  the  proposed  reparations  as  a
symbolic act of cleansing our nation.  We  need  to  look  into  the  future
without any impediments  to  accepting  each  other,  black  and  white,  as
brothers and sisters, ready to hold each other's hands, ready to lift  heavy
loads together, to dig or fill up  trenches  together  and  to  do  together
whatever our beloved country requires of us to do. To create a  new  country
and a new nation united across colour lines.

Speaking as a  victim  at  individual  level,  leaving  out  the  collective
brutalisation as part of the community, I sincerely believe that  there  can
be no better reparations than the permanent guarantee of  freedom  from  the
gross indignities  suffered  by  the  black  people  under  apartheid  rule,
including a permanent guarantee of freedom from  the  brutal  repression  by
the apartheid state, including of course  the  brutality  of  its  surrogate
states, the so-called bantustans, the homelands, because they  were  equally
brutal. As I say this, I am reminded of the victims  who  were  tortured  to
death. Comrades, such as Comrade Luksmart Solwandle Ngudle of  Cape  Town  -
here where we are - Comrade Timol  also  from  here,  Comrade  John  Mahapi,
Steve Biko and others.

I am also reminded now at a very  personal  level  of  the  captain  in  the
security police in December 1964, who hit me so hard across  the  mouth  and
asked me one question: "Do you know that  you  are  now  in  Umtata  and  no
longer in Maseru?" And whenever I answered "yes" to the question, he hit  me
so hard that I became confused and did not know how to answer. By the  third
time, when he turned his hand and hit me with the edge of his  hand  like  a
karate chop he broke my lips - I still have the mark here. I reached  inside
my mouth and shook my teeth, and when they actually  broke  off,  two  teeth
here, I realised that I did not need to answer.

As he was doing this, and blood was flowing down on  my  shirt,  and  I  was
being handcuffed,  his  colleagues  sitting  around  shouted  "Hitler!  Heil
Hitler", I realised where I was. That was the point of determination in  me.
I began not even to feel the  pain,  but  to  have  the  determination  that
apartheid must be fought. I knew I was at a point where I  could  ultimately
be killed, but that was not important at that  moment.  It  was  the  system
that could produce that kind of people. And even as I tried to pull  out  my
handkerchief, Nicholson, the last man to interrogate  Comrade  John  Mahapi,
said: "Los daai ding. Sluk in daai bloed". [Leave that thing.  Swallow  that
blood.] And that is the past we come from.

I am also reminded, comrades and hon members of this  House,  of  the  small
group of us, the first people to be tried under the Terrorism  Act.  It  was
not the brutality of the Security Police only this  time,  because  look  at
it, the whole system of the state, it did not matter  whether  you  were  in
the hands of the police, or in prison under prison officials ... I  wish  Dr
Skosana was here ... or in court. The very  judges  who  were  so  concerned
about the rule of law were harassing you. You knew even before the  sentence
how the sentence was going to go.  Because  when  we  were  sitting  as  the
accused in the dock, we were expecting the judge at least  to  intervene  so
that we could get a fair trial and not to look at him and  already  see  how
the sentence was going to go. That was the state of affairs.

But that is not all. There was the systematic torture  that  we  endured  in
prison, the ten of us, at Maximum Central Prison  in  Pretoria,  sitting  in
those cells with condemned prisoners. We were not  condemned  to  death.  We
were denied food, denied everything to the point that we tried  anything  as
a means of survival. I tried floor polish and I found it inedible -  I  spat
it out. I tried toothpaste, because the officer in charge of stores gave  us
toiletries. I tried it and found it edible. I  put  some  toothpaste  in  my
mouth, went to the water-well and took a little water  and  worked  it  down
and swallowed it. That sweetness and that peppermint taste kept us alive.  I
learnt that my other nine comrades were also doing the same thing. And  that
is how we survived.

It is those things, those situations that one thinks of when we  talk  about
reparations. But, as I say, I have related this before - I  mean  I  do  not
have time now - when I was speaking in the United  States  and  Canada,  and
people asked me: "What is your desire? What should happen to  those  people?
If now you are free, what should happen?" I said that what I  want  is  that
Mr Potgieter, who was the head of the  prison  at  Maximum  Central  Prison,
should accept that he committed a crime. He was wrong, he  was  against  the
law and  he  should  walk  with  me  and  we  must  march  together  against
apartheid. That is all that I  want  from  him  and  I  think  that  is  the
greatest prize that we need. [Applause.]

And then there are people who try and make us feel  that  there  are  blacks
and whites in our country, to the point that I give the New  NP  credit  for
what they have done to join hands with the ANC and  want  to  march  into  a
brighter future together as sisters and brothers rather than former  enemies
looking into each other's  eyes,  you  know,  with  a  desire  to  kill  one
another. That is what we must be thinking of as  we  think  of  reparations.
There can be no greater reparation than the guarantee of freedom,  than  the
guarantee of permanent liberation and freedom from all these things  I  have
just related to you. [Applause.]
