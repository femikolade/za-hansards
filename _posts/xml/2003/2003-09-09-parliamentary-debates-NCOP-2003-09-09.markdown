               GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS' DEBTS TO MUNICIPALITIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the total amount owed to municipalities  for  services  rendered
           amounted to R23 787 million as at 30 June 2002;


       (b)   the  current  trends  indicate  that  the   amounts   owed   to
           municipalities for services rendered are increasing; and


       (c)  it is  estimated  by  the  Minister  for  Provincial  and  Local
           Government  that  approximately  6%  of  the  total  accumulated
           municipal services debt  is  owed  by  national  and  provincial
           government departments, which amounted to approximately  R1  400
           million as at December 2002; and


  (2) urges all national and provincial government departments who owe  any
       monies to municipalities in respect of municipal  services  debts  to
       set the example for other South  Africans  who  also  owe  monies  to
       municipalities for services rendered to pay the  outstanding  amounts
       immediately.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         VIOLENT CRIME IN TABLE VIEW

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J HORNE: Chairperson, I would like to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the suburbs of the Cape Peninsula, and  especially  Table  View,
           have in recent weeks been increasingly targeted by criminals  to
           carry out attacks of extreme violence on its residents; and


       (b)  besides a bank robbery in Table View two weeks ago  as  well  as
           other crime in the area, a  woman  was  brutally  assaulted  and
           robbed in broad daylight outside her church on Monday morning, 1
           September 2003 - not only was this woman badly  traumatised  but
           she also had to undergo an Aids test as she was stabbed  several
           times; and


  (2) calls upon the Minister for Safety  and  Security  and  the  MEC  for
       Police Services in the Western Cape urgently to investigate the crime
       situation in Table View and  to  ascertain  whether  the  Table  View
       Police Station is adequately staffed and has all the other  resources
       to address the problem of the ever-increasing crime in the area.

                   CONGRATULATIONS TO PROTEAS CRICKET TEAM

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I move without notice:

  (1) welcomes the return  tomorrow  of  our  national  cricket  team,  the
       Proteas, who have just completed their three-month tour of England;

           only  with  his  top-class  batting  in  achieving  two  double-

           displayed his captaincy prowess;


       (b)  "Fast Poison" Makhaya Ntini  for  his  ten-wicket  haul  at  the
           hallowed grounds of Lords, the home of world cricket; and


       (c)  he effervescent Shaun Pollock,  the  previous  SA  Captain,  who
           established himself as one of the world's  top  all-rounders  in
           international cricket  by  getting  300  test  wickets,  thereby
           joining his illustrious uncle Graeme Pollock  and  father  Peter
           Pollock, both former Springboks, on the honours list of  cricket
           fame; and


  (5) notes that the Proteas have redeemed themselves from  the  World  Cup
       debacle and have brought back tears of joy to the faces of beleagured
       SA sports lovers.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  FREEDOM PARK: AN EVOLUTION FROM CREATION, OCCUPATION AND COLONISATION TO
         LIBERATION, RECONCILIATION, TRANSFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr D M KGWARE: Deputy Chair, Deputy President and hon colleagues, as we  are
approaching the celebration of our Heritage day on 24  September,  we  would
like to put a little bit of focus on the debate around Freedom Park.

The debate before this august House with its remnants of colonial  trappings
is a stark reminder of the  extent  to  which  apartheid  colonial  cultural
domination still persists  in  our  country.  One  of  the  consequences  of
colonialism and apartheid was the erasure and  marginalisation  of  cultural
and intellectual contributions of non-colonial systems.

Over centuries of cultural deprivation and oppression we are,  after  almost
10 years of freedom, able to ensure that we move closer towards  the  stated
goal of the Freedom Charter that the doors of learning and culture shall  be
open for all. This situation has  to  be  corrected  by  providing  all  our
citizens with access to the arts, museums and symbols in  order  to  have  a
common cultural heritage and consciousness. In this context we will have  to
ensure that every South African takes full advantage of and  is  exposed  to
the projects Government has started.

One such symbol and project is Freedom Park, situated on  a  koppie  on  the
outskirts of Pretoria. It will trace our  history  and  ensure  that  it  is
recorded from its very beginnings and reflects the contribution of  heroism,
uprisings, setbacks, common human experiences and that at the heart of  each
conception is a noble human condition of spiritual fulfilment  derived  from
the willingness to cleanse and heal. Moreover, it appeals to the hearts  and
minds of South Africans to rededicate themselves to the celebration  of  our
diversity on African soil. In this regard we have had contributions  to  and
requests for participation in the activities  of  Freedom  Park  by  various
commissions from friend and foe alike dating back to the apartheid era.

Yes, in order to achieve its objectives, wide  and  exhaustive  consultation
took place between the Freedom Park  Trust  and  faith-based  organisations,
special interest groups and cultural bodies  to  ensure  that  the  physical
manifestation of Freedom Park represents  the  wide  cultural  diversity  of
South Africa. Workshops have been held with traditional healers,  the  youth
and women's organisations. The cleansing, healing  and  symbolic  reparation
ceremonies have introduced a shift from a philosophical discussion  to  both
consultation processes and practical ways of creating the  context  for  the
emergence of Freedom Park.

In this regard the role of provinces would be  critical  since  it  will  be
conducting   cleansing   and   healing   ceremonies,   symbolic   reparation
ceremonies, participation in the activities in the  Garden  of  Remembrance,
providing inputs for the memorial at Freedom Park and  to  initiate  similar
activities in the provinces. This input will include the sending of  plants,
soil and boulders to the Freedom Park as a manifestation of people who  have
fallen during the seven eras of conflict during our country's history.

Moreover, there has  been  a  shift  from  philosophical  discussions  about
indigenous  knowledge  systems  to  it's  actual  implementation.  Moreover,
African myth, culture and cosmology will be interpreted  into  form  in  the
demarcation of the site and in the construction of the precinct.

As the ANC, we believe that the new South African  order,  antenatal  labour
pains and all, needs to redefine. We should recreate the conditions that  we
embrace, namely, reconciliation, transformation  and  development.  In  this
respect, Freedom Park has claimed its place on the national  agenda  and  in
the hearts and minds of the people. As we are gathered here  the  Department
of Arts and Culture continues to work hard at deepening  awareness  of  this
project.

In conclusion, Chairperson, Freedom Park is  an  essential  element  in  our
continuous struggle for the assertion of our dignity and  the  reinforcement
of the confidence to free ourselves from the psyche of  colonialisation.  It
will also mean that we take our rightful place on the continent and  amongst
other people. As a nation  we  must  continue  to  strive  to  arrive  at  a
situation where no South African is  marginalised  or  irrelevant.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]
Mnr A E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Voorsitter,  baie  dankie.  Mense  is  meer  as  net
politieke wesens. Daarom gaan die beoogde Vryheidspark in  Salvokop  in  die
suidweste van Pretoria 'n baie breër konsep van vryheid as  bloot  politieke
vryheid vier. En dit is wat president Mbeki gesê het by die opening van  die
terrein van die beoogde monument.

Byna 10 jaar nadat Suid-Afrika sy vryheid gekry het,  is  daar  nog  nie  'n
monument wat dit gedenk nie. Selfs die  Parlement  het  nog  nie  'n  finale
besluit geneem oor die standbeeld van die wêreldikoon, Nelson Mandela,  hier
by die Parlement nie. Dat dit gedoen moet word, is baie belangrik omdat  dit
sê: Ons bestaan.

Vryheidspark gaan oor alle Suid-Afrikaners se sigbaarheid. Ander  lande  het
egter  net  die  verhaal  van  hulle  politieke  vryheid  vertel.   In   die
Vryheidspark moet ook  ander  vryhede  gevier  word.  Dit  is  duidelik  dat
swartmense in Suid-Afrika wegbeweeg van 'n klem op "liberation" na  'n  klem
op "celebration" en dit is net so duidelik dat die wit gemeenskap  besig  is
om weg te beweeg van 'n gevoel van magteloosheid na 'n gevoel van behoort.

Die groeiende begrip vir Afrikaners se vryheidstryd is  duidelik  en  daarom
sal daar in die Vryheidspark ook ruimte wees  vir  die  herdenking  daarvan.
Boerehelde soos generaal Louis Botha en  apartheidstryders  soos  mnr  Chris
Hani gaan hulle binnekort langs mekaar op 'n  gedenkteken  bevind.  Wie  sou
dit in die verlede ooit kon dink?

Die beplande Vryheidspark in Pretoria sluit  alle  vryheidsvegters  in.  Ons
beskou die oorlog as 'n Afrika-oorlog teen kolonialisme. "Die Boere  wat  in
die Anglo-Boereoorlog geveg het, was almal vryheidsvegters",  het  dr  Wally
Serote gesê en hy gaan verder: ``Ons kan nie anders  as  om  die  Boerehelde
saam met al die ander vryheidsvegters te vereer nie.'' Ons  is  almal  Suid-
Afrikaners  met  dieselfde  toekoms  en  ons  moet  mekaar  gedurig  hieraan
herinner.

Die hoofdoel van Vryheidspark is om 'n nuwe, gedeelde patriotisme te  kweek.
'n Versameling gedenkrotse van Suid-Afrika se nege provinsies  gaan  in  die
beplande Vryheidspark in Pretoria  hulde  bring  aan  talle  Suid-Afrikaanse
vryheidsvegters.  Dié  gedenkrotse  wat  dapperheid,  opoffering,   menslike
lyding en  verlies  sal  uitbeeld,  sal  bo-op  Salvokop  in  die  Tuin  van
Herinnering wees. Die tuin is deel van die eerste fase  van  die  park.  Dit
moet gereed wees vir die tiende herdenking van die demokrasie van  die  land
volgende jaar. Die rotsversameling sal die laaste  simboliese  rusplek  wees
vir almal wat hulle lewens opgeoffer het vir  die  bevrydende  grondwet  wat
die land nou het. Die park sal verder 'n  monument,  museum,  gedenktuin  en
inheemse   plante,   'n   amphiteater,   kommersiële   geriewe    soos    'n
konferensiesentrum,    'n    teater    vir    die    uitvoerende     kunste,
spesialisboekwinkel en aandenkingswinkels  bevat.  Dit  sal  Suid-Afrika  se
verhaal vertel.

Die vraag waarom simbole, monumente en herdenkingsvoorwerpe nodig is,  lewer
een antwoord op: Om mense te laat onthou, te laat  onthou  van  die  onregte
van die verlede en die veranderings wat op maatskaplike en politieke  gebied
plaasgevind het en om hulde te bring aan helde. Dié  soort  simbole  is  ook
nóú verbind met die identiteit van 'n groep mense en hoe  hulle  hul  in  'n
nuwe situasie herdefinieer.

Dit is egter interessant dat in lande waar daar  politieke  en  maatskaplike
veranderinge plaasvind daar groter klem is op die  oprigting  van  monumente
as in lande wat politiek meer stabiel is. 'n Nuwe politieke regime volg  die
praktyk om beelde van voormalige leiers te  verwyder.  In  Rusland  is  byna
alle beelde van Stalin vernietig. Maar dit is nie gewens nie omdat  'n  deel
van die kultuur en erfenisskat van die land  sodoende  vernietig  word.  Die
ANC-regering behoort dit duidelik te maak - en het  by  geleentheid  dit  al
gedoen - dat monumente,  met  die  uitsondering  van  werklike  aanstootlike
voorbeelde,  nie  voor  die  voet  vernietig  sal  word  nie,  maar  dat  'n
bewaringsbeleid eerder gevolg sal word en dat daar bygevoeg word  eerder  as
dat daar verwyder word. Dít  lei  tot  nasiebou  en  die  vestiging  van  'n
gemeenskaplike  struktuur.  Nuwe  erfenisstrukture   word   dikwels   na-aan
bestaandes opgerig en so sal Vryheidspark op Salvokop in Pretoria  naby  die
Voortrekkermonument ingerig word.

Wêreldwyd  is  nuwe,   komplekse   nasionale   simbole   in   multikulturele
samelewings saamgestel. Die ANC-vlagkleure, ook Afrika-bevrydingskleure,  is
byna soos 'n  pyl  in  die  ou  driekleur  ingevoeg  -  hoewel  vlagontwerpe
eenvoudig behoort te wees. Die tradisies van twee volksliedere en vier  tale
is in die volkslied verenig. In albei gevalle was  die  ontwerpe  dus  lomp,
maar hulle is dadelik wyd aanvaar omdat die bevolking  hulle  met  die  nuwe
kenmerke kon identifiseer. En dít is ook wat beoog word  met  hierdie  park.
'n Reeks tradisies is in die stad, Pretoria saamgevoeg waarvan die  trekker,
Pretorius en die Boer, Kruger slegs  'n  gedeelte  verteenwoordig.  Verskeie
ANC-leiers het al  hulle  waardering  vir  die  stryd  om  vryheid  en  teen
imperialisme uitgespreek. Die Vryheidspark gaan  dus  heel  gepas  naas  die
Voortrekkermonument  gehuisves  word  wat  ook   negatiewe,   gepolariseerde
simbole na die positiewe kan omswaai.

Dekades lank is Pretoria internasionaal gebruik om na die  apartheid  regime
te verwys. Dit was ook die gruwelike toneel van die Kerkstraatbom. Nóú  word
wêreldleiers met swier in die hoofstad ontvang. Terwyl vername politici  die
Springboksimbool in 1995 oorlogsugtig  aangepak  het,  het  Madiba  konkrete
gestalte aan die simbole van 'n reënboognasie gegee en in  'n  Springboktrui
die wêreldbeker help ontvang.

Simbole is setels van emosie, waardes en kosbare  tradisies.  As  gevestigde
simbole uitgegooi word om mag bloot ter wille van mag te  vertoon,  het  dit
uiters gevaarlike implikasies vir enige  nasionale  versoeningsproses,  maar
wanneer dit geakkommodeer word,  het  dit  magiese  krag.  Dít  is  wat  die
Vryheidspark ten doel het.

Maar waar is die vroue? In die oprigting van erfenisstrukture, word daar  in
die algemeen bittermin aandag gegee aan vroue. Behalwe die Vrouemonument  in
Bloemfontein en die eenvoudige maalklip wat die protesoptog  van  vroue  oor
die dompasstelsel in die jare vygtig na  die  Uniegebou  verteenwoordig,  is
daar nie veel bewyse dat vroue se rol in Suid-Afrika gedenk word nie  en  dr
Serote en die skeppers van die Vryheidspark sal hieraan baie ernstig  aandag
moet gee.

Die Vryheidspark, ten slotte, is 'n mylpaal vir  almal  wat  in  Suid-Afrika
leef en ook vir Suid-Afrika gesterf het; 'n mylpaal  wat  ons  sal  herinner
aan die verkeerd van die verlede, maar ook sal inspireer om te  bou  op  die
suksesse van ons almal se voorvaders. Motho ke motho ka batho. ['n  Mens  is
'n mens deur ander  mense.]  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you very much. People are more  than
just political beings. Therefore the intended Freedom Park  at  Salvokop  to
the south-west of Pretoria will celebrate a much broader concept of  freedom
than mere political freedom. And that is what President Mbeki  said  at  the
opening of the area of the envisaged monument.

Almost 10 years after South Africa was liberated there is still no  monument
to commemorate this event.  Even  Parliament  has  not  yet  taken  a  final
decision about the statue  of  the  world  icon,  Nelson  Mandela,  here  at
Parliament. That it has to be done, is very important because it states:  We
exist.

Freedom  Park  is  about  the  visibility  of  all  South  Africans.   Other
countries, however, have merely told the story of their  political  freedom.
In this Freedom Park other liberties must also be celebrated. It is  evident
that black  people  in  South  Africa  are  moving  away  from  a  focus  on
liberation to a focus on celebration and it is  just  as  evident  that  the
white community is moving away from a feeling of powerlessness to a  feeling
of belonging.

The growing understanding for the struggle for liberation of  Afrikaners  is
clear and therefore its commemoration will also be accommodated  in  Freedom
Park. Boer heroes like General Louis Botha and  fighters  against  apartheid
like Mr Chris Hani will soon find  themselves  next  to  one  another  on  a
memorial. Who would ever have thought that in the past?

The planned Freedom Park in  Pretoria  includes  all  freedom  fighters.  We
regard the war as an African war against colonialism. Dr Wally  Serote  said
that the Boers who  fought  in  the  Anglo  Boer  war  were  all  liberation
fighters and he continues: ``We cannot but  honour  the  Boer  heroes  along
with all the other liberation fighters.'' We are  all  South  Africans  with
the same future and we must constantly remind each other of this.

The  primary  purpose  of  Freedom  Park  is  to  cultivate  a  new,  shared
patriotism. A collection of commemorative rocks  from  South  Africa's  nine
provinces will pay homage to the numerous South African liberation  fighters
in  the  planned  Freedom  Park  in  Pretoria.  These  commemorative  rocks,
depicting valour, sacrifice, human suffering and loss, will  appear  on  top
of Salvokop in the Garden of Remembrance. The garden is part  of  the  first
phase of the park. It has to be ready  for  the  tenth  anniversary  of  the
democracy of the country next year. The collection  of  rocks  will  be  the
symbolic last resting place of all those whom  had  sacrificed  their  lives
for the liberating Constitution that this country now enjoys. The park  will
also have a monument, museum, commemorative garden  and  indigenous  plants,
an amphitheatre, commercial facilities like a conference centre,  a  theatre
for the performing arts, speciality bookshop  and  souvenir  shop.  It  will
tell the story of South Africa.

The question why symbols, monuments and commemorative objects are  necessary
has one answer. It is to remind people, to remind them of the injustices  of
the past and the changes that came about in the social and  political  areas
and to pay homage to heroes. These types of symbols  are  closely  connected
to the identity of a group of people and how they redefine themselves  in  a
new situation.

It is interesting, however, that in countries  where  political  and  social
changes occur, there is greater emphasis on the erection of  monuments  than
in more politically stable countries. A new  political  regime  follows  the
practice of removing images of former leaders.  In  Russia  nearly  all  the
statues of  Stalin  have  been  destroyed.  This  is  undesirable,  however,
because in that way a part of the culture  and  heritage  of  a  country  is
destroyed. The ANC Government should make this clear, and  has  on  occasion
already done so, that monuments, with  the  exception  of  really  repulsive
examples, will not be destroyed  indiscriminately;  but  that  a  policy  of
preservation will instead be followed and  that  additions  should  be  made
rather than removing anything. This is what  will  lead  to  nation-building
and the establishment of a communal structure. New heritage  structures  are
often erected close to existing ones and so too Freedom Park on Salvokop  in
Pretoria will be established close to the Voortrekker Monument.

Throughout the world, new national symbols in multicultural  societies  have
a complex composition. The colours of the  ANC  flag,  also  the  liberation
colours of Africa, have been introduced like an arrow in the  old  tricolour
- although flag designs should be simple.  The  tradition  of  two  national
anthems and four languages have been combined in  the  national  anthem.  In
both  instances  the  designs  were  unwieldy,  but  they  were  immediately
accepted because the nation could identify with the new features.  And  this
is also what is envisaged with this park. A range of  traditions  appear  in
the city, Pretoria of which the trekker, Pretorius, and  the  Boer,  Kruger,
represent  only  a  segment.  Various  ANC  leaders  have  expressed   their
appreciation for the struggle for liberation and  against  imperialism.  The
Freedom Park will thus quite fitting be situated close  to  the  Voortrekker
Monument and that will positively transform negative, polarised symbols.

For decades  Pretoria  was  used  internationally  as  a  reference  to  the
apartheid regime. It was also  the  gruesome  scene  of  the  Church  Street
bombing. Now world leaders are elegantly welcomed  in  the  capital.   While
prominent politicians vigorously attacked  the  Springbok  symbol  in  1995,
Madiba gave concrete essence to the symbols of the rainbow  nation  and  was
on hand to receive the world cup wearing a Springbok jersey.

Symbols  are  seats  of  emotion,  values  and  precious  traditions.   When
established symbols are thrown out merely  to  exhibit  power  for  its  own
sake,  it  has   extremely   dangerous   implications   for   any   national
reconciliation process; but when  they  are  accommodated,  it  has  magical
powers. This is what is intended with Freedom Park.

But where are the women?  In  the  erection  of  heritage  structures,  very
little attention is given to women in general. Except for the  Vrouemonument
in Bloemfontein and the simple millstone that represents the  march  to  the
Union buildings by women against  the  dompas  system  during  the  fifties,
there is not much evidence that  the  role  of  women  in  South  Africa  is
commemorated and Dr Serote and the creators of Freedom  Park  will  have  to
pay a serious attention to this.

Freedom Park, in conclusion, is a  milestone  for  all  who  live  in  South
Africa and those who died for South Africa; a milestone that will remind  us
of the wrongs of the past,  but  will  also  inspire  us  to  build  on  the
successes of all our ancestors. Motho ke  motho  ka  botho.  [One  is  human
because of other humans.] [Applause.]]

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chairperson, I  don't  want  to  repeat  the  arguments
raised by my hon colleagues. I think I agree with much  of  what  they  have
said. Our feeling in the ACDP is that Freedom Park is a  monument  or  theme
park that should, however, be raised by private subscription and not  public
funds, though the state may contribute.

They say that history is written by the victors. The author, of  course,  is
very often taken on revision later, if it's not accurately written. But  the
author of Freedom Park, it seems  to  me,  will  be  the  ANC  and  that  is
substantiated by the speech by my hon friend, Mr Kgware.

However, a nation like  ours  need  not  be  so  shortsighted.  We  need  to
approach history with understanding and  humility.  We  must  guard  against
triumphalism,  particularly  when  our  democracy  is  still  so  young  and
untested. We must also be careful not to elevate aberrations of  history  to
the national norm or incidents to the status  of  national  characteristics.
We have a penchant for this in South Africa. We've seen it recently  with  a
young rugby player.

We must be careful  not  to  elevate  our  aberrations  of  history  to  the
national norm. Thus, any monument or exhibition will be boring,  short-lived
and not credible if it is not accurate and true.

We need, however, to accentuate what is positive,  noble  and  good  in  our
history, and give credit where credit is due. And we  have  so  much  to  be
proud of. We need to vocalise our strengths, not our weaknesses; our  hopes,
not our fears. We are a united nation; let us sound like one;  let  us  look
like one. This will help us rediscover each other with a  new  pride  and  a
new sense of nationhood.

We need to respect each other's fears and aspirations as well as our  common
history. Former President De Klerk and former President Mandela gave us  the
lead. Let us focus on common goals, not on each other.

You see, the more reconciled we are and the more reconciled  we  sound,  the
more investors and  visitors  will  have  confidence  in  our  country.  The
financial and business communities are sensitive to these  signals.  I  know
of  no  successful  country,  no  successful  company  and   no   successful
organisation that constantly harps upon its weaknesses.

Investors and visitors will find  it  attractive  when  we  focus  upon  our
strengths and assets. When we do those things and focus  upon  those  things
which unite  us,  then  South  Africa  looks  like  a  completely  different
proposition for inward and direct investment - a confident South Africa  not
constantly put off balance. When we go on exhibition, let us  recognise  the
values that unite us and respect the  religious  mores  and  values  of  all
South Africans in the way we approach things.

Finally, Madam Chair, may I also say, and I say this from my heart,  let  us
in South Africa live victoriously and not as victims.  We  are  inclined  to
see ourselves as victims  of  history.  We  are  not.  We  are  products  of
history. We are all that. We are products of our family, of our  parenthood,
but we can live victoriously.

We have so much to be grateful for. We have so  many  wonderful  assets.  We
have done so many great things and we can do so many more  great  things  in
the future. But you cannot do that if  you  constantly  see  yourself  as  a
victim. You have to live  victoriously.  So  let  this  new  monument  be  a
monument to reconciliation and a monument  to  the  further  development  of
this wonderful country of ours. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair and hon colleagues, at the best of times it is  never
easy to interpret the intentions or expectations  of  a  particular  people,
culture or civilisation. But when South Africans across the colour,  ethnic,
cultural and political spectrum paused at the top  of  the  mountain,  after
having walked the long walk to freedom, they heaved  a  collective  sigh  of
relief and unbridled joy that the journey was complete.

At long last the light at the  end  of  the  tunnel  has  materialised.  The
twinkling stars sparkle with a new intensity.  They  are  almost  touchable.
The South African nation trembles with delight.

The idea or concept of Freedom Park  crystallises  as  a  heritage  site  to
bring together all the  strands  of  the  nation's  diversity  so  that  the
nation, South Africa, triumphant in it's new nationhood, would  commemorate,
remember, salute and honour all those who journeyed before us to  arrive  at
this new destination, so pregnant with  the  future,  so  promising  and  so
different from a fractured, fragmented and forgettable past.

But we dare not lapse into a false  sense  of  euphoria  without  casting  a
longing, lingering look back into the mists of  time,  genuflecting  at  the
feet of  our  forefathers  and  mothers  whose  myriads  of  sacrifices  and
foresight have surely been responsible for bringing us all together to  this
epochal moment in our history. We continue  on  our  journey  and  pray  for
spiritual guidance and inspiration so that  we  taste  the  nectar  of  true
freedom with a deep and abiding gratitude to our ancestors.

In a speech delivered on Youth Day, 16 June 2002, Mr Mongane  Wally  Serote,
executive chairman of the Freedom Park Trust, uttered these profound  words,
and I quote:


  Freedom Park will be a South African monument,  going  back  three,  four
  billion years when the first forms of life emerged on this earth, in  the
  soil of this land. It  will  be  a  monument  which  examines  the  first
  emergence of human life ever in our country. It will speak to  the  finds
  which indicate that the first forms of modern  agriculture  and  industry
  were thought out and created here in this land.

Freedom Park is envisaged to portray, through narration in its  museum,  the
story of human  development.  It  will  portray  the  indomitable  struggle,
conducted in the face of overwhelming  odds,  of  how  triumphal  peace  was
forged from a volatile and  seemingly  catastrophic  history,  of  how  good
triumphed over evil in the inevitable culmination of  the  first  democratic
elections in April 1994.

No one group of people must dare claim monopoly  of  Freedom  Park.  Freedom
Park must not be contaminated by claims from exclusive groups interested  in
advancing narrow and parochial interests.  Freedom  Park  must  reflect  the
sheer human will and  innate  conviction  of  all  people  of  South  Africa
towards creating what is sometimes mistakenly considered  in  some  quarters
as a miracle, the day  that  South  Africans  of  all  shades  of  political
opinion stood in long queues in the face of  sometimes  unfriendly  elements
to cast their votes on that historic day, 27 April 1994.

The mission of Freedom Park  is  to  provide  a  pioneering  and  empowering
heritage destination that challenges visitors  to  reflect  upon  our  past,
improve our present and build on our future as a united nation.  A  one-stop
heritage precinct, Freedom Park shall strive to  accommodate  and  chronicle
all of  humanity's  experiences.  It  will  be  an  international  icon  for
humanity and freedom and serve to inspire  people  all  over  the  world  to
rediscover their humanity.

Freedom Park will be central to the unfolding of humanity's experiences  and
symbols into a single coherent epic of the struggle  of  humanity  in  South
Africa, the struggle for survival, for land  and  resources,  and  how  they
shaped the economic, political,  cultural  and  historic  landscape  of  our
country.

It is envisaged, too, that Freedom  Park  will  be  a  veritable  garden  of
indigenous South African flora and fauna.  In  the  midst  of  this  verdant
environment  will  be  erected  a  monument  for  spiritual  meditation  and
spiritual gratitude in silent  salute  to  the  pathfinders  and  the  storm
troopers who sacrificed their lives in the cause for everlasting  peace  and
interracial harmony in South Africa for all its people.

We would be failing posterity if we did not seize the opportunity to  ensure
that Freedom Park presents a true history of all its  people.  Freedom  Park
must indeed enjoy a new pride of place both nationally  and  internationally
in encapsulating the new  integrity  that  is  being  forged  by  all  South
Africans.

I commenced my speech by stating that the South African nation  had  reached
the mountain top after its long  walk  to  freedom.  But,  my  friends,  the
journey does not end on the mountain top: The journey continues. The  plains
lie ahead. With the liberation we now don the mantle of reconciliation.  The
vestiges of racism and suspicion and  innate  prejudices  must  be  cleansed
from our bosom. We must all evince a readiness  to  do  just  that.  Freedom
Park must stand as a sentinel against such negative and  destructive  traits
in our psychological and attitudinal make-up.

The  journey  continues.  Transformation  in  our  society  is  an  absolute
imperative.  Without  transformation,  development  is  stillborn.  Let   us
clearly understand our specific roles  in  the  journey  ahead,  across  the
plains. Let us embrace our fellow men and women  and  walk  together  today,
tomorrow, forever. [Applause.]

Ms N P KHUNOU: Chairperson and hon  members,  South  Africans  lived  in  an
oppressive and difficult state. Africans, in particular, who are  bona  fide
people of this country  suffered  more.  We  have  been  brought  up  in  an
environment in which we had to strive  hard  for  survival  under  difficult
conditions. Our land and resources  have  a  great  impact  on  the  social,
economic, political, cultural and historical landscape of our country.

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[South Africa has a very rich history. We need to  talk  about  it  all  the
time. All countries want to come here to learn from us  how  we  managed  to
take what belonged to us without a  fight.  God,  who  wants  peace  at  all
times, is happy about this. Africans have shown  that  they  not  only  have
perseverance, we are also full of humanity and forgiveness.  We  are  caring
people. Let us be proud of that.]

The Truth and  Reconciliation  Commission's  main  objective  was  to  bring
issues forward, learn to forgive and forget  the  past  imbalances,  and  to
deal with the falling and dying of our  heroes  and  heroines.  This  is  as
difficult as it looks and sounds  -  the  process  has  been  difficult  and
stressful. We need to try to heal the wounds of the past.  It  will  take  a
long time, but eventually we will win. We need a place where we can  all  go
to heal our bodies, minds and souls - all South  Africans  -  not  only  ANC
members like colleagues have said.

In the beginning, God created man in the mental and moral likeness  of  Him,
with the ability to reason and exercise free will and to choose  right  from
wrong. God's purpose in creating man was to  have  a  perfect  race  of  men
living harmoniously with the rest of His creation  in  an  Edenic  paradise.
Contrary to the evolution theory of man reaching an ever higher estate  from
an original low estate, the Bible promises a time of restoration of man.

A park in Greek is termed paradeisos, and in English it  is  paradise.  This
is the place where God planned that all mankind should go. It is  a  perfect
place for relaxation; a place  where  you  could  go  to  be  grounded  with
yourself; to rebuild Africa; to heal the body, mind and  soul;  a  place  in
harmony with the environment which will be transferred to yourself  for  the
process of healing; a place to get in touch with nature and  the  ancestors;
a place of rebirth for us as Africans; the nature of an Edenic paradise.  To
conquer oneself is a greater victory than to conquer thousands in a battle.

Freedom  Park  is  a  one-stop  heritage  precinct  established  within  the
parameters set by the principles of Government's national  legacy  projects.
It began in April 2001. It was founded  to  address  gaps,  distortions  and
biases, and to provide new perspectives on South Africa's heritage. It is  a
broad  presentation  of  the  entire  South  African  history,   challenging
traditional narratives through the  reinterpretation  of  previous  heritage
sites in the country.

The park is also aimed at acknowledging the country's role  in  the  genesis
of early life forms and later at harmonising some of that  which  eventually
evolved into  the  modern  Homo  sapiens,  tracing  evidence  of  humanity's
evolution found in South Africa.

Let us celebrate Heritage Day with one objective, namely, to heal  ourselves
from the past and be committed to pushing back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.
Amandla! [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LABOUR AND PUBLIC
                     ENTERPRISES - STUDY TOUR TO GERMANY

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  I  now  call  the  hon  Nkuna,  the
chairperson of the select committee.

Mrs C NKUNA: Thank you. Hon Chairperson, hon members,  as  correctly  stated
by President Mbeki in January 2003's statement, our movement  must  continue
to meet its obligations to the rest  of  the  world,  in  keeping  with  its
international conventions and traditions.

Our visit to Germany was in line with the  aforesaid  statement  and  was  a
situation of  good  standing  between  the  two  countries.  The  system  of
government in Germany is somewhat similar to ours.  They  have  a  bicameral
system, namely the  Bundestag  and  the  Bundesrat.  The  Bundestag  is  the
principal legislative chamber and is made up  of  members  who  are  federal
officials directly elected by the public. Most of the  legislative  work  in
the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, as is the case  in  our
National Assembly.

The Bundesrat, the second legislative chamber, is the federal body in  which
a certain number of  Länder  governments,  similar  to  our  provinces,  are
directly represented - just like our system  of  Government.  The  Bundesrat
typically  schedules  plenary  sessions  for  the  purpose  of   voting   on
legislation prepared in the committees. The  legislative  authority  of  the
Bundesrat is subordinate to that of the Bundestag, while  the  upper  House,
be that as it may, plays a vital legislative role.

It was gratifying to learn and note that the  programmes  we  are  currently
initiating in our  communications  industry  are  already  far  advanced  in
Germany, with  positive  spin-offs  in  job  creation,  gender  sensitivity,
skills empowerment and overall privatisation in order to effectively  assist
poverty alleviation in our terms.

Deutsche Telekom AG offers integrated solutions  of  mobile  communications,
Internet,  fixed-line   networks   and   other   systems,   with   personnel
representation in 65 countries on  all  six  continents.  This  company  has
traineeship programmes increasing annually and  also  participates  in  many
national and international initiatives to bring lasting change. It also  has
its own public-private partnership programmes  to  alleviate  and  speed  up
transformation in Germany.

We also learned with admiration about the advanced privatisation process  of
posts and telecommunications, which culminated in the passing of an  Act  in
1996  which  regulated  the  following:  licensing,  where  the   regulatory
authority undertakes control duties; universal service, where  the  dominant
provider has to serve at affordable prices; price control, where rates  must
be approved  by  the  regulatory  authority;  and  interconnection  and  all
interception,  where  telecommunications  companies  must   allow   switched
connections to competitors' networks and give security agencies  information
free of charge.

On the sensitive issue of privatisation in our country, we are delighted  to
learn, just as we are putting more emphasis in our country on united  action
to push back the frontiers of poverty,  that  in  Germany  they  have  seven
objectives that guide them  towards  economic  prosperity,  namely,  a  high
level of employment; sustained opportunities for the German economy to  grow
and compete with other economies; social  security;  the  promotion  of  new
technologies and innovations  to  maintain  the  economy's  competitiveness,
linking economic and ecological goals; intensifying the  worldwide  division
of labour; a  free  system  of  world  trade;  and  economic  assistance  to
Germany's new state.

The above should  allay  the  fears  of  those  who  are  sceptical  of  the
privatisation process  currently  being  initiated  and  undertaken  in  our
country. It is beyond doubt that such  moves  will  assist  in  driving  our
economy towards sustainable growth and development.

Cognisance  should  be  taken  of  the  fact  that  in  Germany  too,  their
privatisation activities were largely driven by factors  such  as  budgetary
constraints, a need to attract investment, a general trend towards  reducing
the role of the state in the economy, and  a  combination  of  technological
change, liberalisation and globalisation of products and financial  markets.
It was also heartwarming to note and learn in the privatisation and  labour-
market process in Germany, in spite of the general norm  that  privatisation
causes a reduction in the number of  employees,  that  in  many  state-owned
enterprises there was a tendency  by  the  privatised  companies,  including
their affiliated companies, to employ more people.

It was also pleasing to learn of the control measures put in place to  level
the playing field in as far as the former monopoly operators of  the  postal
and telecommunications markets are concerned, that is Deutsche Post  AG  and
Deutsche  Telekom  AG.  Such  measures  led  to  the  establishment  of  the
registration TP, which was tasked with  promoting  the  development  of  the
postal   and   telecommunications   markets   through   liberalisation   and
deregulation. This body was equipped  with  procedures  and  instruments  to
enforce the regulatory aims,  inclusive  of  information  and  investigative
rights and a set of sanctions.

paragraph follows.)

[It is true that one learns until one is old. Our journey to Germany was  an
eye-opener. I believe that we learned things from our brothers  and  sisters
that will  help  Africa  and  our  South  Africa  through  the  creation  of
employment and fighting poverty. We were delighted to  see  the  proceedings
of their  national  assembly.  If  we  from  the  NCOP  could  follow  their
proceedings, a part of our job will be easier. Our  relations  with  Germany
and the agreement about provision for bursaries  that  will  help  keep  our
children at school must be sustained. The Department of Trade  and  Industry
needs to protect and encourage this relationship. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, this is a rather unique situation  as  far  as  I
remember. Committees have sometimes filed reports  to  the  House  on  their
trips overseas, but I don't remember in  the  past  any  committee  actually
debating their trips. In a sense this has a very positive aspect to it.  The
first is that it enhances accountability. We certainly didn't go to  Germany
to come back here to tell everyone in the House what a nice holiday we  had.
We worked very hard, and we saw and learned a lot of things.

There are a number of parallels between  Germany  as  a  society  and  South
Africa as a society. We both have recently gone through major upheavals  and
we both are, in a sense, societies in transition.  In  that  sense  we  have
many parallels. In Germany  we  saw  how  the  Eastern  philosophy  met  the
Western philosophy. We saw the building of  a  new  united  nation,  and  in
South Africa we have a parallel situation.

Privatisation is certainly one of the key issues that we saw,  and  the  hon
committee chairperson has certainly given  us  a  comprehensive  outline  of
what we learned about that. It is quite clear that we have similar  concerns
in the process of privatisation.

We are all concerned by the threat of job losses. There  are  going  to  be,
and we all accept, job losses in privatisation, but we saw  how  the  German
parastatals catered for it - how they negotiated with  the  unions  in  good
faith and how the unions negotiated with them in good  faith.  We  also  saw
how they resolved to reach situations in which  they  could  compromise  and
ameliorate the effect of the job losses by creating opportunities  elsewhere
and finding work for those  people  elsewhere,  while,  at  the  same  time,
reaping the benefits of privatisation. Undoubtedly, from the  experience  in
Germany we saw that there were benefits to be reaped from privatisation.

Aside from these lessons, there were sometimes even direct lessons  that  we
learned. In Germany we spoke to the railway regulator and the  company  that
actually runs the railways in this process of privatisation.  One  has  seen
in the news recently in our country that the railway signals  are  dangerous
and this, in fact, has the potential to cause loss of life. There  are  many
causes for this. Firstly, we have  the  scourge  of  cable  theft;  and,  it
seemed to us when we visited their railways,  that  we  also  have  somewhat
ageing systems.

Now, when I asked the Germans directly how they protect their  cables,  they
looked at me somewhat surprised and said: ``Cables? We don't use cables.  We
use digital  radio  links.''  They  considered  this  far  safer,  far  more
reliable and far more cost-effective.  The  reason  we,  in  the  committee,
wanted to debate this is because we want to make sure  that  the  department
actually investigates these things to the benefit of our people.

Our people are losing  their  lives,  in  some  instances,  on  the  railway
system. We have within our power the ability to do something about  that.  I
am not saying that we can transport the  German  experience  willy-nilly  to
what we have here, but we certainly owe it  to  our  people  to  investigate
this properly and to ensure - if it can be used it will save lives, it  will
save our country expenses and make us more competitive overseas -  that  the
department  investigates  this  and  does  so   diligently   and   properly.
Chairperson, thank you for this opportunity. [Applause.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson and  members,  as  we  are  on  the  verge  of
finishing 10 years of freedom in South Africa. Having successfully laid  the
foundation to  deal  with  the  poverty  we  inherited  from  the  apartheid
government, our trip to Germany was ideal in terms of  empowerment  for  the
road ahead, and that was the main  objective  that  was  achieved  with  the
study tour to Germany.

With the aim of the tour clearly outlined in the report, it was pleasing  to
learn that the system of government in Germany is a  bicameral  system  with
two Houses, the Bundestag and  the  Bundesrat.  The  federal  government  of
Germany introduces most legislation. When it does so, the Bundesrat  reviews
the legislation  and  then  passes  it  on  to  the  Bundestag.  If  a  Bill
originates with the Bundesrat, it is submitted to the Bundestag through  the
executive branch. If the Bundestag introduces a Bill, it is  sent  first  to
the Bundesrat and, if approved there, it is forwarded to the executive.
There is also a joint conference committee which  resolves  any  differences
in legislation between the two legislative Chambers.  Once  the  compromised
Bill that emerges from the conference  committee  has  been  approved  by  a
majority in both Chambers and by Cabinet, it  is  signed  into  law  by  the
federal president and countersigned by the relevant Cabinet Minister.

The Bundesrat is similar to the NCOP in that  it  is  the  federal  body  in
which the 16 Länder governments, similar  to  our  provinces,  are  directly
represented. Their respective Länder  governments  appoint  members  of  the
Bundesrat. Because the Bundesrat is smaller than the Bundestag it  typically
schedules sessions once a month for the purpose of  voting  on  legislation,
while  the  Bundestag  conducts  about  50  plenary  sessions  a  year.  The
Bundesrat rarely attends committee  sessions,  but  instead  delegates  such
responsibilities to civil servants from its Ministries, as allowed in  terms
of the basic law.

It should also  be  noted  that  in  their  system  the  federal  government
presents all legislative initiatives first to the Bundesrat,  and  that  the
Bundestag approves all the legislation affecting policy areas for which  the
basic law grants provinces concurrent powers and for which the  Länder  must
administer federal regulations.

It was also interesting to learn that Bundesrat membership  is  confined  to
voting members of a state government and that at the heart of  parliamentary
activity is work done by committees who have dates for plenary sessions  set
in advance for each calendar year. Submissions  from  the  Bundestag  arrive
three weeks before the session, while committee work must  be  finished  two
weeks before the plenary session.

For the purposes of increased efficiency and service delivery,  I'm  of  the
opinion that the NCOP should look at adopting the system  of  the  Bundesrat
in Germany, in terms of which dates for plenary  sessions  are  set  far  in
advance annually.

We were delighted to note the way railway reforms were carried out,  wherein
the  following  measures  were  undertaken  to  transform  the   state-owned
Bundesbahn  and  Reichsbahn  into  a  market-conforming  company:  a  strict
separation  of  state  and  business   tasks   to   ensure   entrepreneurial
independence and the strengthening of the company's competitive  capability;
the merger of former special assets of the federal government  to  form  the
Federal Railway Property Fund; the transformation of the  business  part  of
the federal railway property into a public company acting on  its  own;  the
reorganisation and restructuring of Deutsche Bahn AG into four  divisions  -
the track infrastructure, local passenger traffic,  long-distance  passenger
traffic and freight traffic with their own profit  and  loss  accounts;  the
opening of the rail network to outside companies;  and  the  regionalisation
of local transport.

Please note  that  in  terms  of  the  whole  process  of  transforming  the
railways, we were informed that co-operation with other transport  operators
was put to much greater use in order to design services  that  conformed  as
closely as possible to the market.  The  railway  reforms  resulted  in  the
reduction of the burden on the taxpayer and the  federal  budget,  increased
productivity, and better financial performance of the traffic  divisions  as
restructured.

We also learnt, with interest, from the German railway  operator  that  they
use a system of signals based on digital radio  -  cutting  the  problem  of
cable theft - which they recommend as being safer. We  were  happy  to  note
that most labour-market issues in Germany are covered in our  South  African
restructuring framework.

The casualisation of employment was a major policy issue, that  is  one-year
contract jobs, which need exhaustive discussion and  consideration.  We  are
not ready for that yet, taking into consideration the economy and  the  high
rate of unemployment in our country. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!  I  shall  now  put  the  question.  The
question is that the  Report  of  Select  Committee  on  Labour  and  Public
Enterprises - Study Tour to Germany - be agreed to. The  decision  is  dealt
with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution. I note that all  delegation
heads are present in the House. We will then proceed to allow  provinces  an
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they wish  to  do  so.  Is
there any province wishing to make a declaration of vote? There is none.  We
proceed then to voting. This will be done in the usual  way  -  alphabetical
order per province. Eastern Cape?

           CONSIDERATION OF FIRST REPORT OF JOINT BUDGET COMMITTEE

Mr T B TAABE: Thank you very much indeed, Madam Chair, for  the  opportunity
to be able to rise this afternoon to present to this House the first  report
of the Joint Budget Committee. I do so  on  behalf  of  our  co-chairperson,
Comrade Ralane, who could not be here this afternoon.

As hon members would know, this first report of our Joint  Budget  Committee
was published in the ATC on 18 June this year. This  report  deals,  in  the
main, with the national department's  expenditure  trends  from  January  to
March of 2003 and, most importantly, with the expenditure  patterns  of  the
nine provinces for the financial year ending 2003.

In respect of national  departments,  we  discovered  as  the  Joint  Budget
Committee that expenditure trends  of  the  departments,  for  instance,  of
Social Development, of Government Communication and Information  System  and
of Public Enterprises fluctuated quite substantially.

Communications was left with about 54,25% of its  budget  unspent  after  11
months of the financial year in question. In the 12th  month,  surprisingly,
the last month of the financial year ending March 2003, the same  department
spent almost all its unspent funds.

Public Enterprises had also not spent 10,1% of its  budget  by  the  end  of
March 2003. However, we must be conscious of the  fact  that  by  and  large
these figures are unaudited  and  the  possibility  exists  that  the  final
outcome, in terms of the audited figures, may inevitably  tell  a  different
yet positive story once the audits have been duly completed.

The challenge remains for us, particularly in the NCOP, to  ensure  that  we
do all that is necessary for systematic and dramatic improvements to  happen
in the area of spending in the provinces. Limpopo -  Kgoshi  Mokoena  -  the
Free State, the Western Cape, Mpumalanga  and  the  Eastern  Cape  have  all
recorded substantial underspending.

Gauteng, the report informs us, underspent  its  budget  marginally;  whilst
KZN, albeit having received the largest chunk of the budget, is not  counted
amongst the provinces that recorded the highest underspending.

We have not completed our work as the Joint Budget Committee. Oversight,  by
its very nature as hon members would know, is not an event,  but  rather  an
ongoing process, which is sometimes very protracted indeed.  We  have  taken
the view, as the Joint Budget Committee, that those  departments  which  are
required to account  for  their  discrepancies  in  spending  should  appear
before our committee during the month of  October.  We  will  be  consulting
with the relevant organs of state in this regard,  and  will,  as  a  matter
principle, take on board the relevant portfolio  and  select  committees  of
Parliament.

The release of the report of the SA African Human Rights  Commission  should
be noted by members,  particularly  in  respect  of  chapter  13  on  public
finance. We anticipate some thoroughgoing engagement  with  stakeholders  on
this chapter pretty soon.  We  want  to  advise,  when  this  happens,  that
members of this House  should  be  able  to  take  full  advantage  of  this
opportunity as this would sharpen their oversight  duty  and  responsibility
as elected representatives.

Having made these observations,  we  have  taken  the  well-considered  view
that, one, we must continually build capacity into our financial  management
procedures in order to  ensure  full  compliance  with  the  Public  Finance
Management Act; two, that the strategic plans of  the  departments  must  be
thoroughly  scrutinised  to  ensure  redress  on  both   underspending   and
overspending before plans for new  projects  in  the  said  departments  are
proceeded with; three, that formal and structured co-operation  between  our
committee and other sector committees of Parliament has become  an  absolute
necessity in order to permit the flow of information in respect  of  unusual
spending  by  departments;  and,  lastly,  in  respect  of  provinces,  that
structured co-ordination is required between  treasuries  and  Minmecs.  The
point we should make here is that whatever decisions are taken at the  level
of the Minmecs, they should be budgeted for adequately in the provinces.

We believe as the Joint Budget Committee that the work has only just  begun.
As we are a fairly new committee  we  hope  that  hon  members  will  indeed
interact  with  our  work  as  it  is  at  the  heart   of   the   oversight
responsibility we continue to shoulder as elected representatives.  At  this
point I think I should thank you, Madam Chair. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I think that before I put the  question,
we should congratulate the members and committees that have dealt with  both
Orders for having tabled reports which we could debate in  the  House.  This
should increasingly become a practice for this House  and,  certainly,  this
Parliament.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free  State,  Gauteng,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

 ALLEGATIONS ABOUT PURCHASE OF GUESTHOUSE BY CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
    (Consideration of Report of Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence)

Order disposed of without debate.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! As there is no speakers' list,  I  shall
now put the question. The question is that the  report  be  agreed  to.  The
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution. Is  there
any province wishing to make a declaration of vote  in  terms  of  Rule  71?
There is no province wishing to make a declaration.

We proceed to voting. We begin with the Eastern Cape.

Ms P C P MAJODINA: IMpuma Koloni iyasekela. [The Eastern Cape supports.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Re kgotsofetse, re a e amohela kaofela.  [We  are  satisfied,

time to speak for you. [Laughter.]] Western Cape?

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: INtshona Koloni iyahambisana. (Western Cape agrees.)

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  All  provinces  have  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the report adopted. [Applause.]

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:00.
