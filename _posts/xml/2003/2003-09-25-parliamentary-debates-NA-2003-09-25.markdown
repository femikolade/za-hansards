                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
                                    ____

The House met at 14:02.

The Chairperson of Committees  took  the  Chair  and  requested  members  to
observe a moment of silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  The  Ministers  for  the  first  two
questions are not in the House yet. I believe they are on their  way.  Could
we proceed with  the  questions  to  the  Economics  Cluster.  That  is  the
Minister of Transport.

QUESTIONS AND REPLIES - see that book.

                              NOTICE OF MOTION
Mr I J PRETORIUS: Deputy Chair, I hereby give notice that I  shall  move  on
behalf of the DA:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses  its  severe  disapproval  of  the  illegal  and  unethical
       practice by some in the ANC of  purposely  arranging  for  voters  to
       register at addresses at which they are not permanently resident  for
       purposes of inflating support during by-elections.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Thank  you.  Are  there  any  further
notices of motion?

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Sorry, Chairperson. I just want a point of  clarity.  Are
we doing motions and statements now or after the debate?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The statements  will  be  taken  after
the debate. Are there any motions without notice?

Mr S K LOUW: Sorry, Deputy Chairperson.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Are you rising on  a  point  of
order?

Mr S K LOUW: Yes. In fact, we want to raise our objection to that motion  of
the DA.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The question of  the  notice  will  be
... It is a matter of notice, but the actual substance of it will  be  given
consideration through the team, the technical team.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, this is a query to the ANC. On what  grounds  are
they objecting? To stand up and say, ``We object  to  it,''  without  giving
any reason for it doesn't make any sense at all.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: In the normal  course  of  events  the
notices that are given here  are  given  further  consideration.  If,  on  a
technical issue, any matter that is there does not pass muster  then  it  is
attended to. So that would be the normal course of events.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, I am not sure if the hon member from  the  ANC  -
the Whip from the ANC - thinks that we gave  a  motion  without  notice,  or
whether he is aware of the fact that it was  just  a  motion  that  we  were
proposing today.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, I think it is  accepted  that  it
was just a notice of motion. Thank you.

Are there any motions without notice? None.

           PREPARING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The SPEAKER: Deputy Chair, hon members, the  Pan-African  Parliament  is  no
longer a matter for the distant future. It is no longer simply a concept  or
an idea about which Africa dreams and to which our people aspire. It  is  an
immediate reality.

The Pan-African Parliament may very well  be  in  session  in  four  months'
time, namely in the first month of 2004 - in January. Now that is  what  the
summit decided, and, as  I  will  be  reporting,  there  is  a  very  strong
possibility that that intention will actually be  realised.  Therefore  this
House can no longer afford to talk about it in the abstract  -  the  debates
can no longer be abstract.  We  will  have  to  be  taking  decisions  about
important issues in the very immediate future, certainly in November  if  we
are to meet in January.

As we are all aware, South Africa has offered to host the seat of  the  Pan-
African Parliament. The African Union has not yet taken a decision on  this,
and I will come back to this  later.  The  summit  in  Maputo  accepted  the
recommendations of the meeting of African Parliaments that was held here  in
Cape Town on 30 June and  1  July.  The  summit  underscored,  firstly,  the
urgency of  the  entry  into  force  of  the  protocol  on  the  Pan-African
Parliament and the importance of setting up this organ,  which  will  ensure
the effective and full participation of African peoples in  the  development
and integration of the continent.

Secondly, it urged countries that had not done so  to  ratify  the  protocol
before the end of this year in order to allow the parliament to meet  before
31 January 2004. Last, but not least, it mandated  the  chairperson  of  the
union, in consultation with the commission, to determine  the  beginning  of
the first term of the Pan-African Parliament.  This  mandate  was  given  so
that there would be no need to wait for the next summit in  order  to  bring
the parliament into being.

The pace of ratification has now speeded up considerably, and  the  required
number is likely to be reached well before the end of October. The  steering
committee will be meeting on 9 October and 10 October,  in  other  words  in
two weeks' time, to assess the situation and to begin to  discuss  with  the
commission the feasibility of, and plans for, the inaugural session.

As hon members are aware, the members of the commission were agreed upon  by
the heads of state in Maputo and were sworn in at that time. Five of the  10
commissioners who were elected were women, as had been agreed.  And  I  must
say, on a personal level, that I was  glad  to  see  such  targets  actually
achieved.

The  former  president  of  Mali,  President  Konare,  was  elected  as  the
chairperson, and the honourable Julia Joiner was appointed  as  the  African
Union Commissioner for Political Affairs and will  be  directly  responsible
for the Pan-African Parliament. They took office last week and already  each
of them has separately indicated support for the early establishment of  the
Pan-African Parliament. I hope this House will congratulate  them  on  their
appointment.

Now, as I indicated, there has been no decision on the final  seat,  but  in
my view it would be very appropriate if the inaugural session  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament were held in Addis Ababa. It is  where  the  organisation
of the African Union was founded. It has been the  headquarters  of  African
unity in its broadest sense for nearly half a century and, of course, it  is
the headquarters of the African Union. But that is not something  that  will
be determined  by  me  or  the  steering  committee.  It  will  have  to  be
determined under the mandate that has been given to President Chissano.

We have a tendency in this Parliament to defer  decisions  and  await  party
caucus decisions, etc. The reality is that  the  Pan-African  Parliament  is
not going to wait for us. It will be meeting whether we are ready or not.  I
want  to  stress  this,  because  we  are  not  going  into   a   ready-made
organisation, such as the IPU or any other  association,  which  is  already
established, has its rules and where  we  go  in  and,  while  we  influence
changes, we have to accept what exists. We are  going  into  an  institution
that is being shaped now, and we would be going in  as  foundation  members.
Therefore we have the opportunity to, and the  challenge  of,  shaping  that
new institution.

Now it is not enough for people to say - and I've heard  this  said  by  our
members - that we have the most marvellous Constitution. We  are  not  going
to be  able  to  impose  it  on  anybody.  If  we  want  any  part  of  that
Constitution to be reflected in the Pan-African Parliament and  the  way  it
functions, we are going to have to  argue,  to  discuss,  to  promote  those
ideas and win support.

The question is: Are we ready; are we able to do that? I  am  really  posing
this as a serious question,  because  we  have  to  make  those  very,  very
important decisions. For example, regarding the inaugural session  -  if  it
happens in  January  -  we  will  have  to  elect  five  members  from  this
Parliament. This means that in November, if  not  in  October,  we  have  to
elect five members,

Have we decided on the criteria? Have we considered how those  members  will
be chosen; and how we see them managing the process of spending  two  months
of the year in the Pan-African Parliament while simultaneously carrying  out
their duties in this House? Has this been considered and worked out? On  day
one, members will have to take an oath. Have we  agreed  on  an  oath?  What
sorts of things do we believe should those members swear loyalty to?  Again,
this is a question on which we have to decide.

On that first day, there will be an election for  five  presiding  officers,
one from each of the regions.  This  means  SADC  will  have  to  elect  one
person, which means that we have to caucus with SADC to see who  our  choice
will be; and, more importantly also, but simultaneously,  to  consider  with
all the other regions who the five Africans are  that  we  want  to  put  in
place as the president and the four vice presidents of  the  African  Union.
That is a decision that will be taken on day one.

The inaugural session will have to decide  how  it  continues.  What  issues
will it debate? Is it going to set up committees? All of these matters  have
to be decided. Are we going to have  our  members  accountable,  or  are  we
going to get five members there to make the decisions?

Chairperson, may I appeal to you please that there are too many meetings.  I
know I am not up there, but as somebody standing here I appeal to  you  that
if members wish not to pay attention, they should leave.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order,  please  hon  members!  If  you
wish to participate in this, please be  here,  or,  alternatively,  you  may
want to take your business outside the Chamber.

The SPEAKER: As I indicated,  these  are  extremely  important  issues.  Are
these five members whom we elect, however  we  elect  them,  going  to  make
those decisions on their own? What mechanism are we setting up to give  them
mandates?  How  will  we  determine  what  those  mandates  will  be?   What
structures  are  we  setting  up  to  hold  them  accountable?  Because   my
understanding, when we agreed to the protocol, was that  the  South  African
Parliament, certainly, wanted its members to be accountable  to  it  because
Parliament would be electing the members.

The terms of office of these members will be until the election so that  the
new  Parliament  will  have  to  elect  five  members  anew.  But  this  has
implications for the type of parliament that is being set up. It will  be  a
perpetual parliament; a self-generating parliament, because  once  it  comes
into being there will be no end of the term. New members will come  in  from
different countries when members whose terms  have  expired  have  left.  So
those first months will be very, very crucial in terms of making  decisions,
because that will continue - that shape, that framework that  is  being  set
up there. Later on it will be much  more  difficult  to  change.  Therefore,
again, we need to be clear that we have a say in that.

Now the parliament will not immediately be a law-making body, but then  what
is it going to do? It needs, in my view, to foster regional integration,  it
needs to consolidate democracy,  it  needs  to  and  must  play  a  role  in
bringing peace and resolving conflicts  on  this  continent.  So  these  are
amongst the things that one would have to do. Again, how is it going  to  do
that? We have Nepad, which has been agreed. Is that new parliament going  to
have any role in it? A number of organs that will  be  established  will  be
accountable and report to the Pan-African Parliament.

Therefore we need to be sure when we constitute the  Pan-African  Parliament
that there will be a way, a mechanism in place, for these  different  organs
to report and be held accountable, otherwise their reports  will  simply  be
rhetoric, or just tabled not for consideration.

I want to end by making reference to our  offer  to  host  the  seat.  As  I
indicated, that has not been determined yet, and it would  await  a  meeting
of the summit. But I want to express the view  which  we  discussed  in  the
working group that, firstly, we do not believe the  Pan-African  Parliament,
wherever it is, should function in the shadow of a national parliament,  and
that includes us. If the Pan-African Parliament is in South Africa,  it  has
got to be an institution that is accountable to Africa.  It  is  not  to  be
monitored or stewarded by this institution.
I personally want to suggest, again in terms of the proposal that  has  been
put forward, that it should meet once in each of the  five  regions  of  the
continent in the first few years. This is so  that  there  is  an  ownership
across the board, regardless of where  the  seat  is.  The  protocol  allows
that.

Then, it needs also, in  my  view,  to  be  an  African  building.  All  the
parliaments  of  this  continent  that  I  have  seen  have  imitated  other
parliaments, mostly West European. I would suggest that we consider  things,
such as a competition of African architects in  order  to  have  a  building
that has this vision of the Renaissance and unity that we  all  talk  about.
If we walk in this building, different parts of  it  have  been  constructed
increasingly of South African materials. Originally they were  all  British.
This last building has one foreign component - maybe members  will  identify
it. All the others are South African.

The Pan-African Parliament must  be  constructed  of  African  material.  It
must, in its  gardens  and  its  ambience,  reflect  the  diversity  of  the
continent. But that's not enough - that  will  be  a  physical  environment.
What fills that building will be shaped, in part, by what  we  do.  I  think
that is the kind of challenge that we face in the next few  months.  I  know
we are all focused on the challenges of the elections we are facing,  but  I
would put it to you -  and  this  may  sound  like  heresy  -  that  another
election will come in five  years,  but  another  opportunity  to  create  a
totally new parliament for our continent will not come in five years. It  is
taking place, certainly, in under five months. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms F HAJAIG: Deputy Chair, comrades and colleagues, yesterday we  celebrated
Heritage Day in South Africa. With our vision of an African  Renaissance  we
hope to see, in the not-too-distant future, the celebration of the  heritage
of Africa in all its diversity, right across every country in Africa.

The reason for this debate today is to familiarise ourselves, as members  of
Parliament and as representatives of the people of South Africa,  with  what
the issues are and report back to our constituencies so that the  people  at
grass roots can be part and parcel of the process in  the  establishment  of
various organs of the African Union.

Despite the good work of the Organisation  for  African  Unity  one  of  the
glaring  mistakes  was  the  top-down  approach,  namely  the   absence   of
participation of parliaments and civil society in all deliberations  of  the
OAU. We need to know what the African Union is, what it seeks to do and  why
we need the Pan-African Parliament. What is  the  role  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament? How will  the  Pan-African  Parliament  contribute  towards  the
realisation of the aspirations of the African  peoples  for  greater  unity,
solidarity and cohesion that transcends the gender,  cultural,  ideological,
ethnic, religious and national diversities of Africa?

As you know, the Pan-African Parliament is one of the organs  that  need  to
be established according to the Constitutive Act of the African  Union.  The
protocol relating to the establishment of the  Pan-African  Parliament  will
soon have sufficient ratifications from  member  states  so  that  the  Pan-
African  Parliament  can,  indeed,  be  established.  As  the  Speaker   has
mentioned, the probable date for the inaugural plenary  is  expected  to  be
sometime in January 2004.

We need the Pan-African Parliament so that the voice of the  African  people
can be heard. We come from different traditions so  we  need  to  hear  each
other, take decisions according to what is best practice and take them  back
to our national parliaments for debate.

The preamble  of  the  protocol  says  in  one  of  its  articles  that  the
establishment of the Pan-African  Parliament  needs  to  be  informed  by  a
vision to provide a common platform for African peoples,  and  their  grass-
roots organisations need to be involved in discussions  and  decision-making
on the problems and challenges facing our continent.

Article 3 of the protocol outlines nine objectives.  These  objectives  are:
to facilitate the effective implementation of the  policies  and  objectives
of the African  Union;  to  promote  the  principles  of  human  rights  and
democracy  in  Africa;  to  encourage  good  governance,  transparency   and
accountability in member states; to familiarise the peoples of  Africa  with
objectives and policies aimed at integrating the  African  continent  within
the framework of the establishment of the African Union; to  promote  peace,
security and stability; to contribute to a more prosperous  future  for  the
peoples  of  Africa  by  promoting  collective  self-reliance  and  economic
recovery;  to  facilitate  co-operation  and  development  in   Africa;   to
strengthen continental solidarity and build a sense of common destiny  among
the peoples of  Africa;  and  lastly,  but  not  least,  to  facilitate  co-
operation among regional economic communities and the parliamentary fora.

To fulfil the above objectives is no mean task but  a  long-term  vision  is
necessary. Prof Cyril Ndebele, in this regard, says the following:


  The Pan-African Parliament should provide a  common  platform  for  these
  ideals and for agreeing on strategies for  development.  It  should  also
  play a significant role in  the  harmonisation  of  laws  and  codes  for
  Africa. This will prove a major challenge because  parliamentarians  will
  first have to build trust among themselves, a process  that  cannot  take
  place overnight. It is important that the process through which consensus
  is reached builds on what unites Africans, rather than on the differences
  among us.

The Pan-African Parliament can play  a  meaningful  role  in  promoting  and
consolidating  democracy.  The  Universal  Declaration  on  Democracy  urges
parliaments to be guided by  certain  principles.  I  would  like  to  quote
principles 3 and 4 in this regard. Principle 3 says:


  As an ideal, democracy aims  essentially  to  preserve  and  promote  the
  dignity and fundamental rights  of  the  individual;  to  achieve  social
  justice; foster the economic and social  development  of  the  community;
  strengthen the cohesion of society and enhance social tranquility ...

Principle 4 continues to say:


  The achievement of democracy presupposes a  genuine  partnership  between
  men and women in the conduct of affairs of society in which they work  in
  equality  and  complementarity,  drawing  mutual  enrichment  from  their
  differences.

This brings us back to the protocol where one of  the  articles  there  says
that at least one out of five parliamentarians should  be  a  woman.  But  I
think that after the establishment of the Pan-African  Parliament,  we  need
to revisit this article. South Africa has taken  a  particularly  courageous
stand in ensuring that three out of five of the delegation  will  be  women.
But I do think that we need to do a lot of work in the  rest  of  Africa  to
promote this. The PAP can play a meaningful  role  in  elections  in  member
states and can assist countries to resolve differences. In this regard,  the
Peer Review Mechanism and the Pan-African Parliament should have a linkage.

Article 3(5) requires the Pan-African Parliament to promote peace,  security
and stability. But, neither the protocol nor the Constitutive  Act  provides
the enabling means for the Pan-African Parliament to,  indeed,  do  this.  I
think that article 11 as a whole should  be  revisited.  However,  the  Pan-
African Parliament, as a representative of  all  African  peoples,  will  be
better positioned to make a positive impact in terms of influencing  various
national parliamentary programmes of member  states  and  promoting  respect
for  human  rights;  spare  no  efforts  to  prevent  armed   conflicts   by
identifying and analysing the causes  with  a  view  to  finding  solutions;
secure contributions for humanitarian relief  in  cases  of  emergency;  and
will use parliamentary diplomacy to promote peace on an ongoing basis.

According to Prof Bathily, the vision of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  must
define the future and vision for Africa. Various countries and regions  have
set their own development visions. The vision for Africa includes  increased
political, economic and cultural  integration.  The  fruits  of  development
should be shared more equally among all African peoples.

The Pan-African Parliament will have to evaluate the various  value  systems
and rework some of these systems, and thus reconcile this  diversity  which,
ideally, is  needed  for  a  unified  continent.  Once  agreement  has  been
reached, these agreements must be translated into legislation  -  which  can
only happen after five years - which will ensure that the changes  that  the
Pan-African Parliament seeks to effect can be enforced.

Members of the Pan-African Parliament  should  take  these  values  back  to
their national parliaments and ensure that, through their own  parliamentary
work, the needs and opinions of their own people are heard at the  level  of
the Pan-African Parliament. This interaction will  be  important  to  ensure
the  broad  participation  of  the  ordinary  African  in  the   Pan-African
Parliament.
I would  like,  very  briefly,  to  examine  the  role  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament in defining positions taken at  multilateral  fora  such  as  the
World Trade Organisation, the International  Monetary  Fund  and  the  World
Bank. The Pan-African Parliament must discuss how globalisation affects  the
livelihoods of the people and the quality of their lives. How will the  Pan-
African Parliament promote Nepad? How can the programmes of PAP improve  the
quality of life and push back the frontiers of poverty?

President Thabo Mbeki, at a meeting of the African  Central  Bank  Governors
in 2001, summed it up very nicely when he said:


  When we speak of an African Renaissance, we speak of ending  poverty  and
  underdevelopment on our continent and redefining the building of a better
  life for the ordinary people of South Africa, especially the poor.

I think that the question of funding the Pan-African Parliament  is  a  very
important  one.  It  needs  adequate  funding  to  carry  out  its   mandate
successfully. To be truly independent, the Pan-African Parliament has to  be
self-sufficient. There are a number of options that need to be  examined  in
the light of the diverse economies of Africa.

Lastly, this is an appeal:  We  have  a  wealth  of  expertise  from  Africa
sitting in other countries all over the world. These experts  need  to  join
hands with governments, parliaments  and  nongovernmental  organisations  to
assist us to reach our  millennium  goals  and  in,  indeed,  make  this  an
African century. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Mr Deputy Chairperson, I think it was well  that  the  Speaker
introduced this debate, because she gave  us  an  insight,  not  only  as  a
Speaker but as the Chairperson of the  steering  committee  set  up  by  the
commission to see that when we meet, whenever  we  do  meet,  that  body  is
going to be able to function properly. So,  if  she  seemed  unduly  nervous
today about the progress that is being made, it was not as the  Speaker  but
as chairperson of the steering committee.

Of course, what we have been talking about for so long is actually going  to
happen. I think it's important  that  we  should  look  at  the  Pan-African
Parliament because, in the first instance, it's not going  to  meet  in  its
final form. It's going to commence in a substantial form, but  with  certain
interim arrangements, and it's important that we should understand this  and
the vision for the longer-term future.

There are two distinct features  of  this  particular  phase.  It  says,  in
Article 2 of  the  protocol  that  the  Pan-African  Parliament  shall  have
consultative and advisory  powers  only.  So,  at  this  stage,  that  is  a
feature. Secondly, it says that during  the  interim  period  member  states
shall be represented by an equal number of five parliamentarians,  at  least
one of whom must be a woman appointed by parliament.

In the final phase, article 2 says that the ultimate aim of the  Pan-African
Parliament shall be to evolve into  an  institution  with  full  legislative
powers, and whose members are elected by universal adult  suffrage.  So,  we
are entering under interim conditions, but I think we must  have  before  us
the vision of the future as defined in the protocol in Article 2.  There  is
another interesting provision in the protocol which will have a  bearing  on
the nature of the debates that take place and, indeed, on the  character  of
the Pan-African Parliament.

Article 6 says that the parliamentarians shall  have  their  vote  in  their
personal and independent capacity. That raises an issue which Madam  Speaker
raised also, of the question of mandates, performance and  recall.  However,
as we are about to enter this critical formative period of that  Parliament,
I think  we  should  understand  the  primary  role  that  that  Pan-African
Parliament is required to play.

To see this final role, we have  got  to  go  back  to  article  17  of  the
Constitutive Act of the  African  Union.  ``In  order  to  ensure  the  full
participation of African peoples'', and I underline ``of African  peoples'',
``in the economic integration of the  continent,  a  Pan-African  Parliament
shall be established''.

Article 2 says that the Pan-African  Parliamentarians  shall  represent  not
only states, but all the peoples of Africa. It's further emphasised  in  the
preamble to the protocol, which says:


  Further noting that the establishment of the  Pan-African  Parliament  is
  informed by the vision to provide  a  common  platform  for  the  African
  people and their grassroots organisations to  be  more  involved  in  the
  discussions and the decision-making on the problems and the challenges of
  the continent.

Thus I believe that the primary responsibility of this  new  Parliament  has
to do with people, not with regions, not with states, not  with  governments
and not with political parties, but with the people of Africa.

Amongst the hierarchy of organisations that exists  in  the  AU,  I  believe
that this Pan-African Parliament is the organ that is specifically  mandated
to provide, at the moment, the missing link between the  African  Union  and
people, on the one hand, and conversely,  the  people  of  Africa  with  the
African Union.

We will soon be participating  in  the  Pan-African  Parliament  during  the
interim period of its  existence.  How  we  conduct  ourselves  during  this
formative phase will impact on whether the Pan-African Parliament turns  out
to be an instrument serving the people of Africa or whether it evolves  into
a congenial talk-shop pandering to the whims of  the  continent's  political
elite.

It will be pointed out that the  Pan-African  Parliament  has  no  executive
power and that, at this stage, it has no legislative power,  but  this  does
not preclude the members of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  from  using  that
Parliament provided  by  the  protocol  to  speak  out  against  corruption,
against injustice, against the abuse of power and against the  disregard  of
human rights. Neither does  it  require  members  of  that  Parliament  from
calling for action against governments that violate the very  principles  to
which all member states of the African Union are bound. Nor does it  prevent
the Pan-African Parliament from putting forward constructive  proposals  for
dealing with the problems and promoting the welfare of  the  people  of  the
continent.

When the power of the Pan-African Parliament is  defined  in  a  formalistic
way, it's true that this power is limited. However, when one  considers  the
reality of power in a holistic  way,  and  by  this  I  mean  the  power  to
influence, the power to persuade, the power to mobilise  and  the  power  to
lead, then one realises that the potential power in the hands  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament and its members is very great indeed.

I believe that if regionalism, nationalism, party loyalty  or  personalities
are put  first,  the  Pan-African  Parliament  will  fail  in  its  historic
mission, but if the interests of the  people  are  put  first,  courageously
and, may I say, caringly, the Pan-African Parliament will play a  meaningful
role in the future of our continent.

Regrettably, at the moment, the African Union and  even  Nepad  seem  to  be
somewhat remote from the  people.  Both  of  these  organisations  and  this
programme have acquired a top-down character. To ordinary citizens,  the  AU
consists of some bureaucrats  in  Addis  Ababa  and  a  periodic  summit  of
presidents  at  some  venue  in  Africa.  I  believe  that  the  Pan-African
Parliament can do much to change this, but that can  only  happen  when  the
people see that the members of the Pan-African  Parliament  are  championing
their cause, dealing with their  needs  and  articulating  their  hopes  and
their aspirations. It can only happen when the AU and its  organs  are  seen
by the people of  Africa  to  be  relevant  to  their  lives  and  to  their
wellbeing.

In a few months' time, Madam Speaker said probably in January, five  members
of our Parliament will become  members  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament.  I
believe it's going to be an onerous task. How you are going to be  a  member
of Parliament and fulfil your functions in this House and your mandate  from
your people here, and also be a member of the Pan-African Parliament and  do
justice to that particular demand is something that I don't quite  know  how
it is going to happen and how it's going to work.

However, for all that,  I  believe  that  whatever  happens  elsewhere,  the
members  of  Parliament  who  go  and  become  members  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament that we nominate will lead by example. By furiously  putting  the
interests of the people first, they will help  to  fashion  the  Pan-African
Parliament into an organisation which can make a difference to the lives  of
the people on our continent.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Thank you, Chairperson. Firstly,  I  want  to  examine  the
African Union and Pan-African Parliament, the New Partnership  for  Africa's
Development, or Nepad, and the  African  Peer  Review  Mechanism.  What  and
where are they interconnecting?

I'll start off with the AU and the PAP. The  Constitutive  Act  of  11  July
2000 proclaimed the establishment of the African Union and proceeded to  set
out the constitution. It then identified the objectives of the Union, 14  in
all, and 16 principles. It identified the nine organs of the Union.  One  of
them, and third on the list, is  the  Pan-African  Parliament,  which  ranks
behind the Assembly of the Union and the Executive Council. The  Pan-African
Parliament is a necessary and crucial organ of the Union.

Before I further on the Pan-African Parliament, I just want  to  remind  hon
members that members of the European Parliament  were  initially  chosen  by
the national parliaments, but in 1979 the first direct elections  were  held
allowing the citizens of the member states to vote for candidates  of  their
choice. Since then elections have been held every five years. They have  one
single currency. The European Parliament has  626  members.  The  number  of
members per state is laid down in the treaty.

With regard to the establishment  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament,  as  the
Speaker has rightly said, the summit in Maputo has urged  all  countries  to
ratify the protocol and  deposit  the  instruments  of  ratification  by  31
December 2003. What does this mean to us? The Speaker has also asked  if  we
were ready. I'm saying we need to prepare ourselves thoroughly  in  advance.
Here I just want to thank the Speaker and her office and the Deputy  Speaker
for spearheading the working group and also for starting to  popularise  the
Pan-African Parliament. That is why we are having this debate today.

Caucuses must then keep the Pan-African  Parliament  on  their  agendas.  We
need to look into the composition of the delegation and  also  the  election
of  delegates.  Parties  should  now  consider  the  process  regarding  the
nomination of candidates and whether the process should be a secret  ballot.
About the mandate, who will give the mandates to these people  who  will  be
representing us in the Pan-African Parliament? With regard to the  oath,  as
the Speaker has rightly asked, are we supposed to amend  the  oath  or  not,
because if we decide to take a second oath it means we  will  be  minimising
the oath that we normally take when becoming members of this Parliament.

Coming to the process regarding the recall of  delegates,  article  5(4)  of
the protocol provides that the seat of a member  of  the  PAP  shall  become
vacant if he or she is recalled by his or her national parliament  or  other
deliberative organ. It means  that  if  we  get  started  with  the  PAP  in
January, those members who are elected to it will only serve for two  months
before being recalled  because  of  the  general  election,  but  the  other
members of the Pan-African Parliament will continue.

How will the PAP assist the communities  and  Africa  as  a  continent?  Any
vision of the PAP has to be relevant to Africa's problems and  the  role  of
the African Union and Nepad in addressing those problems.  It  must  play  a
meaningful role in addressing Africa's problems.

Regarding the regional caucuses, the draft PAP rules formally establish  the
regional caucuses as a mechanism.  If  multinational,  cross-border  parties
develop  in  the  Pan-African  Parliament  as  they  have  in  the  European
Parliament, could they compete  with  the  formalised  regional  caucus  for
power and influence? If this happened, it would be necessary  to  reconsider
this aspect and possibly amend the relevant rules.

The Pan-African Parliament will play an important role in providing a  forum
for African people to make their views  known  through  their  parliamentary
representatives. The PAP should  also  include  an  oversight  function.  It
should also make more effective use of various radio station and  television
broadcasts  to  popularise  its  work  and  to  disseminate   the   relevant
information.

The PAP would therefore have  to  translate  its  oversight  role  into  the
monitoring of African governments individually  or  collectively  addressing
poverty.  A  vision  of  the  PAP  has  to  be   relevant,   practical   and
implementable through  a  set  of  mission  objectives  that  would  include
providing a forum for the voice of the people to be heard and for  the  real
monitoring of poverty relief projects and programmes.

Let me briefly touch on the Nepad and the  African  Peer  Review  Mechanism.
The Nepad initiative has been  successfully  marketed  outside  the  African
continent, especially with the G8 countries. Today  it  is  recognised  that
the vision contained in the Nepad initiative stands no chance of  succeeding
unless the popular masses in their  diversity  truly  appreciate  it,  going
beyond governments, bureaucrats, institutions and foreign partners.

We need a mechanism to popularise Nepad. We cannot deny the fact that  Nepad
is not known. It is a big term, but it has not yet gone down to  the  people
so that they could interpret in their own way what it really is.  What  does
this mean to the ordinary person on the ground?

The African Peer Review Mechanism is an entirely voluntary process.  The  AU
member states are free to decide  whether  or  not  to  accede  to  it.  The
African Peer Review Mechanism will assist  all  participating  countries  to
measure their success in  implementing  the  priorities  and  programmes  of
Nepad by being focused on mutually agreed objectives and through  compliance
with best practice in each of the following areas: democracy  and  political
governance, economic governance and  management,  corporate  governance  and
socioeconomic development.

The APRM can no doubt make  a  significant  contribution  to  defending  the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence  of  the  African  Union
member  states,  and  contribute  towards  achieving   greater   unity   and
solidarity between the African countries and African people. Those  are  the
objectives stated in article 3(a) and (b) of the Constitutive Act.

The IFP wishes to see the popularisation of the following:  the  Nepad,  the
African Union, the  Pan-African  Parliament  and  the  African  Peer  Review
Mechanism. Civil society needs this information and there is no need for  us
to withhold it from the masses. [Time expired.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I agree fully  with  the  previous  speaker;
thanks to the able leadership of our Speaker and Deputy Speaker we  are,  in
my view, as ready as can be to participate in  the  Pan-African  Parliament,
despite the issues raised by our  Speaker  when  she  addressed  the  House.
Without  their  tireless  efforts  the  Pan-African  Parliament  would  have
remained nothing more than a concept in a protocol gathering dust  somewhere
in obscurity, and both of them deserve a statue in the entrance hall of  the
Pan-African Parliament-to-be.

Five members  of  this  Parliament,  three  of  whom  will  be  women,  will
represent South Africa in  the  Pan-African  Parliament,  but  in  order  to
enhance multiparty democracy on the continent it would be  a  good  idea  if
two members could come from opposition parties.

There is only one obstacle regarding our participation  in  the  Pan-African
Parliament. Now, I have been a bit out of touch with  the  business  of  the
working group owing to other obligations, but to the best  of  my  knowledge
the protocol establishing the  Pan-African  Parliament  still  needs  to  be
ratified by five more parliaments before it can enter into force.  As  at  2
September 2003, only 22 out of 53  countries  have  ratified  the  protocol.
Ratification by a simple majority, though, is required before  the  protocol
can enter into force, and hopefully this will  happen  before  the  term  of
this Parliament expires next year.

I pin my hopes on the Pan-African Parliament to promote and  strengthen  the
practice of democracy on this continent. Democracy entails  much  more  than
merely having elections every four or five years. I think  the  counting  is
just as important as the voting.  What  I'm  saying  is  that  many  African
countries present themselves as multiparty democracies,  but  unfortunately,
only a few are worthy of the title.

Within the context of Nepad - and many other speakers have pointed it out  -
the African Union  decided  to  monitor  the  state  of  governance  amongst
themselves with a view to promoting good governance on  the  continent,  and
that is exactly  what  the  Pan-African  Parliament  should  do.  It  should
monitor  the  state  of  democracy  amongst  themselves  with  a   view   to
strengthening  democratic  principles  on  the  continent.  This   in   turn
necessitates the development of a measure by which the extent  of  democracy
in a state can be evaluated, and I'm proud to say that the New NP  has  done
precisely that.

Sourced from the United Nations Human Development Report,  the  New  NP  has
identified indicators against which the extent of  democracy  in  a  country
could be measured. You can read all about it in a booklet called Freedom  in
Africa - At a Glance. If you buy one you will also strengthen the  funds  of
the New NP  and  it  contains  valuable  information.  [Interjections.]  The
aforesaid indicators are: regular elections that are free and  fair;  levels
of literacy; women's  equality;  freedom  of  association;  freedom  of  the
press; the extent  of  military  involvement  in  politics;  the  extent  of
minority rights; the decentralisation of government;  the  freedoms  enjoyed
by political parties; and the separation of the powers of government.

Getoets aan hierdie maatstawwe vir demokrasie blyk dit dat  slegs  vier  van
Afrika se 53 state as ten  volle  vry  en  demokraties  verklaar  kan  word,
naamlik Namibië, Suid-Afrika,  Zambië  en  Botswana.  Elf  state  geniet  'n
redelike mate van vryheid. In 18 state  word  vryheid  beperk.  Daar  is  11
state waarin vryheid aansienlik beperk word, en nege  state  waarin  vryheid
heeltemal onderdruk word.

Kan ek net vinnig twee lande met mekaar vergelyk. Zimbabwe kry  nul  uit  10
vir persvryheid, 38 uit 100 vir die algemene stand  van  die  demokrasie  en
beklee die 42ste plek op die demokratiese  ranglys  in  Afrika.  Suid-Afrika
kry 10 uit 10 vir persvryheid, 98 uit 100 vir die  algemene  stand  van  die
demokrasie en beklee die eerste plek op  die  demokratiese  ranglys  in  die
kontinent. Demokrasie het nog 'n lang pad om te loop  op  die  kontinent  en
hopelik  sal  die   Pan-Afrika-parlement   die   proses   versnel.   Dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Measured by these standards for democracy it is clear  that  only  four  of
the 53 states of Africa can be declared as being fully free and  democratic;
namely Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Botswana.  Eleven  states  enjoy  a
reasonable degree of freedom. Freedom is restricted in 18 states. There  are
11 states in which freedom is considerably restricted  and  nine  states  in
which freedom is completely repressed.

May I just quickly compare two states. Zimbabwe gets 0 out of 10  for  press
freedom, 38 out of 100 for the general state of  democracy  and  holds  42nd
place on the democratic rating list of Africa. South Africa gets 10  out  of
10 for press freedom, 98 out of 100 for the general state of  the  democracy
and holds first place on  the  democratic  rating  list  of  the  continent.
Democracy still has a long way to go on the continent and hopefully the Pan-
African Parliament will accelerate the process. Thank you.]
Mr O BAPELA: Chairperson, let me begin by quoting from some of the  writings
of some of our greatest  leaders.  In  1892,  111  years  ago,  one  of  the
founders of the ANC, the Rev  John  Langalibalele  Dube,  in  his  published
pamphlet entitled ``A Talk Upon My Native Land'' said:


  Oh! How I long for that day when darkness and  gloom  shall  have  passed
  away, because the ``Sun of Righteousness has risen with  healing  in  His
  hand''. This shall be the dawning of a brighter day  for  the  people  of
  Africa ... Then shall Africa take her place as a  nation  among  nations,
  then shall her sons and daughters sing aloud: ``Let us arise  and  shine,
  for our light has come. The glory of the Lord has arisen upon us.''

In 1906, six years before the ANC was formed, yet  another  founder  of  the
ANC, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, said:


  I am an African, and I set my pride in my race  over  against  a  hostile
  public opinion. The brighter day is rising upon Africa. Already I seem to
  see her chains  dissolved,  her  desert  plains  red  with  harvest,  her
  Abyssinia and Zululand the seats of science and religion, reflecting  the
  glory  of  the  rising  sun  from  the  spires  of  their  churches   and
  universities. Her Congo  and  her  Gambia  whitened  with  commerce,  her
  crowned cities sending forth the hum of business, and all her sons ...

And daughters -


  ... employed in advancing  the  victories  of  peace,  greater  and  more
  abiding than the spoils of war. Yes, the regeneration of  Africa  belongs
  to this new and powerful period!


  The regeneration of Africa means that a new and  unique  civilisation  is
  soon to be added to the world ... The most essential  departure  of  this
  new civilisation is that it will be thoroughly spiritual and humanistic -
  indeed a regeneration moral and eternal.

These prophetic words of wisdom from the two heroes of our revolution  speak
volumes as we witness the rebirth of the African continent and as  it  takes
its rightful position among the nations of the world.

We witnessed the birth of the African Union in July 2002  in  Durban  which,
coincidentally,  is  in  the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal  where  Rev   John
Langalibalele Dube and Dr Pixley ka Isaka Seme came from.

Other organs of the AU are being established and  today  we  are,  as  South
Africa, preparing ourselves and our  country  to  participate  in  the  Pan-
African  Parliament,  the  PAP,  and  not  ``pap''  as  others  are  already
referring  to  it,  although  not  with  bad  insinuations.  ``Pap''  is  an
Afrikaans word for porridge, it is the staple food of Africa,  and  the  PAP
will be a stable foundation of Africa. [Laughter.]

Today's debate is aimed at educating members and the public, you the  people
of South Africa, about  this  new  important  institution,  the  Pan-African
Parliament. The protocol of the PAP envisages the establishment of the  Pan-
African Parliament as one of the organs of the African  Economic  Community;
but ultimately, it is an organ of the African Union.

As the vision was outlined by  the  hon  Fatima  Hajaig  and  Madam  Speaker
earlier, I would like to emphasise that the PAP provides a  common  platform
for African people and their grass-roots organisations to be  more  involved
in the discussions  and  decision-making  on  the  problems  and  challenges
facing Africa.

The process of the protocol of the Pan-African  Parliament,  which  we  have
ratified as this Parliament, is part of a  process  to  further  consolidate
the aspirations of the African people  for  greater  unity,  solidarity  and
cohesion in a larger community; transcending cultural, ideological,  ethnic,
religious and national differences. This is in line with article 14  of  the
treaty establishing the African Economic Community, which  states  that  the
objective of the Pan-African Parliament will be to ensure  that  the  people
of Africa are fully involved in the economic development and integration  of
the continent.

From the outset, the PAP will not have legislative powers or functions,  but
this will not reduce its influence, importance, strategic function and  role
in the affairs and challenges of the continent. In  its  first  five  years,
after entry into force of the protocol on the Pan-African Parliament, it  is
envisaged that a conference of all states' parties will be  held  to  review
its operation and effectiveness; and the system  of  representation  in  the
Pan-African Parliament, including, its legislative  powers  thereafter.  For
example, the PAP can  request  the  attendance  and  ask  questions  of  the
African Union officials, but it will not have the power to subpoena them.

Whilst the protocol on  the  Pan-African  Parliament  does  confer  specific
oversight,  it  could  possibly  exercise  powers  through  the  instruments
relating to these institutions. For example, it is significant to note  that
the protocol relating  to  the  establishment  of  the  Peace  and  Security
Council of the African Union requires the council to maintain close  working
relations with the Pan-African Parliament.

Further,  the  Peace  and  Security  Council  must,  when  the   Pan-African
Parliament so requests, submit reports to the PAP  in  order  to  facilitate
the  discharge  by  the  Pan-African  Parliament  of  its   responsibilities
relating to the maintenance of peace, security and stability in Africa.

Without boring you with  all  the  technicalities,  I  will  point  out  the
importance of the institution and the progress made thus  far.  As  the  hon
Geldenhuys indicated, already the parliaments of  22  countries  -  you  are
definitely correct, hon Geldenhuys  -  have  ratified  and  deposited  their
protocols with the AU. Many informed us  during  the  recent  workshop  held
here in Cape Town in the July recess that they would ratify by  the  end  of
September, while others have informed us that they will ratify  by  December
2003. We only need 25 to 27 ratifications in order  to  achieve  our  simple
majority  of  countries  that  will  have  ratified  in   their   respective
parliaments.

I must say that progress was achieved, and we will  certainly  be  ready  to
launch the Pan-African Parliament in the first half  of  2004.  We  can  say
with certainty here that by the time the third session of the  AU  meets  in
July 2004, the PAP will be up and running.

Regarding current challenges, as indicated and will be  indicated  by  other
speakers and also as elaborated in the  eighth  and  ninth  reports  of  the
African Union Working Group which are in circulation, there are a number  of
challenges with which we still need to deal. Members  have  alluded  to  the
appointment of members to serve in the Pan-African Parliament.  How  are  we
going to be doing that? The procedures  need  to  be  developed.  Also,  the
African  Working  Group  has  already  drafted  rules  for  the  Pan-African
Parliament which, we hope, will be in circulation soon so that  members  can
familiarise themselves with those particular  rules.  These  are  the  rules
that we will be sharing with the other parliaments.

Article 3 also says that at least one of the  representatives  of  a  member
state's delegation to the Pan-African Parliament must be  a  woman.  Note  -
and I repeat - one of the  delegates  appointed  by  a  respective  national
parliament must be a woman. They  only  speak  of  one.  However,  as  South
Africa we have made a proposal, which was accepted by  all  the  parliaments
in Africa, that instead  of  one  woman,  we  should  have  two  within  the
delegations. However, we informed other national parliaments in Africa  that
as South Africa we had taken a decision that out of the  five  delegates  we
would be selecting, three would be women. So, we have gone a step further.

The rules, as in draft form, must exist in  terms  of  article  12  and  the
rules of procedure on the basis of the two-thirds majority of  all  members.
We need, therefore, to familiarise ourselves with those particular rules.

With the existence of the Pan-African Parliament, the  new  challenges  that
come with it  will  be  the  regional  caucuses  and  the  establishment  of
regional parliaments. Already there is  reference  to  that  effect  -  East
Africa has an assembly which is a regional  parliament.  Research  is  being
undertaken to look at their model and also to start discussion in  the  SADC
region to convert, if this is agreed to, the  SADC  Parliamentary  Forum  or
Parliament into a new regional parliament. Soon after the  PAP  is  launched
and established, these  regional  parliaments  will  be  important  building
blocks to strengthen the PAP.

As I conclude my input, I would like to urge  members  to  be  knowledgeable
about these  continental  developments,  such  as  the  African  Union,  its
decisions and all its organs; the role of organs such as  the  PAP  that  we
are debating today;  the  African  Peer  Review  Mechanism;  the  Peace  and
Security Council; Nepad;  and  soon-to-be-established  organs  such  as  the
African Development Bank; the African Justice Court;  the  Economic,  Social
and Cultural Council of the AU, etc.
Africa has its own  challenges  and,  as  all  of  you  know,  a  number  of
conflicts still exist in some parts of Africa in this  21st  century,  which
has been declared the African Century. I  was  one  of  those  who  recently
visited  southern  Sudan  courtesy  of  the  Institute   for   Justice   and
Reconciliation and I interacted with the people  who  are  affected  by  the
longest war. Currently, there is a ceasefire fortunately and  resumption  of
negotiations, in the hope that those negotiations will yield results.

The Chairman of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, Dr  John  Garang,
whom we met for an hour, said  that  southern  Sudan,  since  creation,  has
never had an asphalt or tar road. It is exactly like that, and that is  what
we saw - no tar roads, underdevelopment, no electricity,  a  94%  illiteracy
rate, harsh poverty conditions, and children walking  around  naked  without
clothes.

Other conflict areas would include  the  Great  Lakes  Region  and  what  is
referred to as ``the conflict belt'', that is  the  DRC,  Burundi,  Somalia,
the Ivory Coast, Liberia, etc. This year,  2003,  we  have  witnessed  three
coup d'états in the Central African  Republic,  Sao  Tomé  e  Principe,  and
about two weeks ago, in Guinea-Bissau.

Other challenges remain - that is  underdevelopment,  lack  of  development,
poor  infrastructure,   weak   economies,   debt,   poverty,   disease   and
malnutrition, most of which are not of their own making. Our task is to  see
and realise, through the PAP, the noble goals of Nepad and the unity of  our
people on the continent for a better life.

For the  Pan-African  Parliament  to  be  relevant  to  the  people  of  the
continent, it must become the voice of the people. It should  not  shy  away
from raising, boldly, issues affecting our people, obviously backed up  with
facts and on behalf of the people, and it should deal with them.  A  failure
to rise to this challenge will  mean  the  PAP  being  seen  as  irrelevant,
unimportant and failing in its obligations.

Africa must, through the PAP, build democracy,  have  good  governance,  and
ensure respect for human rights  and  that  all  governments  respect  their
people's enshrined rights. We are looking forward to the birth of  the  Pan-
African Parliament and, as public representatives, we  should  pronounce  on
this institution and popularise it amongst our  people.  However,  in  order
for this to happen, we must equip ourselves  as  members  with  the  African
Renaissance philosophy and vision, embrace African unity and take  pride  in
ourselves as Africans. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chairman, every  effort  must  be  made  to  have  the
protocol ratified by all member states as soon as possible.

The ACDP suggests that delegates elected for representation within the  Pan-
African  Parliament   should   not   be   determined   by   majority   party
representation within respective national parliaments. This will  allow  for
greater accountability and openness within the AU structures.

We also suggest that only delegates who have  been  duly  elected  by  their
people should hold office within  the  PAP.  Further,  we  suggest  that  no
member of a political party should enjoy representation within the PAP  when
representation in a respective  country  was  acquired  through  a  military
coup, despotic governance or a one-party state.

The provision that members will have a limited period to serve  in  the  PAP
should be welcomed. This further endorses our position that members  in  the
PAP will be  drawn  from  elected  members  whose  membership  was  attained
through the process of elections  within  member  states.  In  other  words,
where countries do not hold free and fair elections, membership in  the  PAP
should not be allowed.

The  authority  of  delegates  within  the  PAP  should  be  exercised  with
reasonable  freedom,  without  undue   influence   from   their   individual
countries. However, where the decisions of  the  PAP  are  in  contradiction
with  the  interests  of  member  states,  delegates  should  be  given  the
opportunity to express this through the various mechanisms  provided  within
the PAP. In other words, country delegates serving  on  the  PAP  should  be
able to petition on  behalf  of  their  respective  countries  in  cases  of
disputes with either  the  PAP  or  a  neighbouring  country.  However,  the
deliberations and powers of the PAP should remain independent of any  member
state.

It is not necessary that members of Parliament should be  required  to  take
an oath in their national parliaments showing  support  for  the  AU.   Only
those delegates who serve on the PAP will be required to do so.  The  reason
for this is that South Africa should, at all times, be both  supportive  and
vigilant of the deliberations that go on  within  the  PAP.  Therefore,  the
Houses of the member states of the AU  will  be  able  to  operate  with  an
agreed amount of independence.

The ACDP will support further deliberations  on  these  issues.  Thank  you.
[Time expired.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chairperson, as other  members  including  the  Speaker,
have already said, there is a whole  range  of  matters  around  which  this
House, this Parliament and the country have to take positions  on  in  order
that our inputs should be very clear in terms of the creation  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament, possibly in January 2004.

I'd like to just take the opportunity in the time I have to tease  out  some
of them or add to any that would already have been raised. This  is  because
we need to use the opportunity  we  have,  through  the  Speaker  being  the
chairperson of the steering committee which is assisting the AU  commission,
to lead the preparations. We also need to inform, or to make our  inputs  to
our Department of Foreign  Affairs  so  that,  as  it  participates  in  the
processes at all levels, it is informed, also, by our  own  views  on  these
matters.

The first issue I'd like to raise is the one that has  already  been  raised
about party representation in our own delegation of five.  If  you  look  at
the eighth report, which is before us, there are certain options which  have
been put before us on how to approach this matter. I just  want  to  propose
that as parties are expected to be considering  these  matters  between  now
and when we come back - and as this Parliament puts these matters  before  a
committee and finally brings them to a plenary  to  take  firm  positions  -
they must be very clear what it is that they are  proposing.  So  there  are
options which are in the eighth report, and I hope that members have  looked
at those.

The next issue is one on the representation of the two Houses.  With  regard
to that, I want to point out that there are two  difficult  issues  that  we
need to reconcile. The first one is an approach we got from a legal  opinion
which  said  that  given  the  fact  that  foreign  affairs  is  a  national
competency, the National Council of Provinces, being a House  of  provinces,
would therefore not have a role to play in  this  regard.  So  that  is  one
issue.

The second issue - and we got  the  latest  legal  opinion  last  Tuesday  -
points out that according to the protocol, it is, in  fact,  parliaments  of
the member states which are expected to decide  on  their  members  who  are
going to sit as Pan-African parliamentarians. In the case of  South  Africa,
Parliament consists of the two Houses. We need to sort  out  this  issue  of
how we approach this particular matter so  that  by  the  time  we  have  to
decide on our delegation - and I want to venture to say that this  can't  be
later than  November  because  that  would  be  the  last  session  of  this
Parliament this year - we are clear on how we deal with that.

The next issue is the question of the election of South African  members  of
the Pan-African Parliament. The issue has already been  raised  by  speakers
before me, but I just want to raise, specifically,  the  actual  process  in
each of the Houses. Let's say,  for  instance,  that  we  decide  that  both
Houses are going to  be  represented.  [Interjections.]  Don't  disturb  me,
Colin.

Now, chapter four of our Constitution, in relation to joint  sittings,  says
that the President may summon a joint sitting for  any  business.  There  is
such a provision in the Constitution. So, for instance,  we  could  ask  the
President to summon such a joint sitting so that we, as  a  Parliament,  can
deal with the issue of who we are  sending  to  represent  us  at  the  Pan-
African Parliament.

However, the challenge that we face is contained in our own Rules,  as  well
as in the Constitution, actually. This is because the Rules,  in  fact,  say
that we cannot have a decision or  a  vote  at  a  joint  sitting.  A  joint
sitting is not allowed to take a vote or a decision. So, how can we  have  a
joint sitting where we collectively decide on the delegation?

Now, there are thoughts about how we could do  that.  One  of  the  thoughts
that has been put forward is that perhaps we  could  have  a  joint  sitting
where each of  the  Houses  separately,  one  after  the  other,  takes  the
decision to send the delegation consisting of the same names. Those are  the
things that we have to look at before we actually deal with this matter.

The other issue that  has  already  been  raised  is  one  relating  to  the
election of the office bearers of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  -  one  who
would be president and the four who would be  the  vice  presidents,  coming
from each of the five regions of Africa.

Now the questions are: How do we start the processes at  a  national  level?
Who determines whether, in fact, as a  country  we  are  putting  forward  a
nominee - what determines that? We have actually asked  Foreign  Affairs  to
please guide us on these matters, as they have more experience on how  these
processes normally get initiated and how they unfold.

The other issue is: Within the region, what  is  the  process  and  who  co-
ordinates that process? Is there a role for the two members of the  steering
committee  that  come  from  the  regions?  This  is  because  the  steering
committee consists of 10 people - two from  each  of  the  five  regions  of
Africa. At the SADC level we have South  Africa  and  Botswana  as  the  two
members of the steering committee from SADC. Is there a  role  for  them  in
terms of co-ordinating this process that must unfold? This  is  because,  if
you look at the time we have, we are only  left  with  three  months  before
these processes have to be sorted out.

At the same time, there is a concern that the process should be as  tidy  as
possible politically. We are all politicians and we know how  sensitive  the
issue of elections is. I'm quite sure  that  for  this  side  of  the  House
especially, with the list processes that are unfolding, it is a  very,  very
sensitive time.

This is just as sensitive even at regional and continental levels. In  fact,
if people tell you about the election of  the  commissioners  who  have  now
been appointed by the Maputo Summit,  you  will  know  how  sensitive  these
issues are. This is because there is competition -  everybody  wants  to  be
the successful candidate, every country wants to  make  sure  that  its  own
nominee is the one that is successful. So the question is: How  do  you  co-
ordinate and manage that process in a manner that  is  the  least  bruising?
Competitions in politics are the most bruising and nightmarish  processes  I
know in my own limited experience.
The other question is whether, in that process, there  is  a  role  for  the
regional  parliaments.  Of  course,  in  our  case,   we   only   have   the
parliamentary forum. We don't have a regional parliament. Is  there  a  role
for them in co-ordinating this issue?

Finally, when our people get to the venue of the inaugural  session  -  that
is the last phase of this election  process  -  what  happens  there?  There
definitely is a role for  regional  caucuses,  because  within  each  region
there must be an agreement on the one name that is going  to  be  forwarded,
either as the president or one of the deputy presidents.

The other question that arises is: Where do we  determine  which  region  is
going to give us the president, or which regions are going to  give  us  the
first, second,  third  and  fourth  vice  presidents?  These  are  all  very
sensitive issues which look technical, but are highly  political  and  very,
very sensitive. [Interjections.] I agree - Frene for president!

Lastly, I want to deal with the  issue  of  committees  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament - as part of what we have been  dealing  with  as  a  task  team,
tasked by the AU working group to look  at  the  priority  issues  that  the
inaugural session would have to look at and, in  particular,  issues  around
which, possibly, rules have to be determined. It is very  important  for  us
to look at the question of committees, because, as the Speaker said  in  her
opening speech, we are dealing with an  institution  that  does  not  exist.
There is simply nothing in place, and we have the opportunity  to  determine
and to shape what should happen. Which committees do  we  propose  the  Pan-
African  Parliament  should  have,  and  on  what  basis  should   that   be
determined?

The task team has put forward an approach to the AU working  group  in  that
there have to be committees that deal with the business aspects of what  the
Pan-African Parliament will be dealing with. As soon as the  office  bearers
have been elected, we would suggest that a rules committee, or  a  committee
that will deal with looking at rules - certainly as soon as  is  possible  -
would have to be created.

Secondly, we propose that a committee that would look at the budget  of  the
Pan-African Parliament would have to be created quite  early,  even  at  the
inaugural session. Thirdly, we believe that  there  should  be  a  committee
that would deal with the programme of the Pan-African Parliament,  in  other
words, projecting forward in terms of what the programme of the  Pan-African
Parliament should be and how to shape it, and what  structures  need  to  be
put in place to determine this on an ongoing basis. So we suggest that  some
of those key structures would have to be put in place  very  early  at  that
inaugural session.

Of course, we have to note that in the protocol  itself  there's  already  a
structure that has been created, the bureau - the  five  presiding  officers
we have already mentioned that would be elected at the inaugural session.

The second set of structures that we believe we need  to  look  at  are  the
ones that will be dealing with the content of the work  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament. Now, this is a very tricky issue because the AU, generally,  has
many structures. And if, for instance, you were to do what we did  in  South
Africa where for each Ministry you have a  portfolio  committee,  you  would
end up  with  quite  a  lot  of  structures.  That  would  probably  not  be
manageable, because you have only five people from each of the  parliaments.
How would you split them up to be able to  participate  in  that  number  of
structures?

So we have to look at that very carefully. I want to propose that article  3
of the protocol, which  the  hon  Hajaig  looked  at,  may  be  one  of  the
approaches we may want to take in when looking at this issue.  I  just  want
to throw  the  following  into  the  bag  of  approaches  that  need  to  be
considered. For instance,  human  rights  and  democracy;  good  governance,
transparency and accountability; peace, security and  stability;  collective
self-reliance  and  economic  recovery;  and  co-operation  among   regional
economic communities and their parliamentary fora may be seen as a  possible
way of approaching the structures that would be created by  the  Pan-African
Parliament in  order  for  each  to  be  able  to  exercise  some  oversight
function. This, even though at the moment there  is  none  that  is  crisply
spelt out, either in the Constitutive Act or in the protocol, but,  perhaps,
we could say that this is the minimum number of  structures  that  could  be
formed, or around a cluster of issues, as spelt out  in  the  objectives  in
the protocol.

I then just want to mention that, of course, the report before you  mentions
that there will be a seminar. We have proposed 20 October for that  seminar,
which will be before a plenary that possibly would take  decisions  on  some
of the issues that we have put before you. Of course, we have put  the  date
as 20 October, but further detailed consideration must be taken on  a  whole
range of matters and then, perhaps, we might change  the  date,  though  I'm
not sure. The programme committee has met and has said certain things  about
dates, but further  consideration  will  take  place.  However,  this  would
definitely be in that week  of  plenaries  in  which  we  propose  having  a
seminar before the plenaries so that  members  are  also  better  armed  for
taking the decisions that would have to be taken by the  House.  Thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, hon  members,  the  ultimate  aim  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament  shall  be  to  evolve  into  an  institution  with  full
legislative powers, whose members are elected by universal  adult  suffrage.
The PAP shall have consultative  and  advisory  powers  only.  The  protocol
relating to the composition, powers, functions and organisation of  the  PAP
has been signed by member states and is in the process of ratification.

The objectives of the PAP shall be to familiarise the people of Africa  with
the objectives and policies  aimed  at  integrating  the  African  continent
within  the  framework  of  the  establishment  of  the  African  Union;  to
strengthen continental solidarity; and to build a sense  of  common  destiny
among the people of  Africa.  The  PAP  is  an  organ  to  ensure  the  full
participation of African people in the governance, development and  economic
integration of the continent.

The UCDP takes cognisance of the fact that there is the  European  Union  of
which most countries in Europe are members. The union has its own  currency,
the Euro, which has improved value. We note that African countries are  poor
and backward, but my party believes in  excellence  through  hard  work  and
discipline. Through hard work and avoiding  the  temptation  of  corruption,
Africa will overcome.

My party has confidence in the people of a darker hue as long as  they  know
and accept that all success is wrought in prayer. We  hope,  as  we  prepare
for the PAP, that we shall see all countries represented equitably. We  call
on parliamentarians to prepare for the great challenges ahead. I thank you.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, because of the fact that my time  is  short,  I
simply want to state that we must prepare to participate in the  Pan-African
Parliament by gearing ourselves to  achieve  the  realisation  of  the  Pan-
African vision as envisaged by the founding fathers of Pan Africanism.  Some
of them are W E  B  Du  Bois,  Sylvester  Williams,  Marcus  Garvey,  George
Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Patrice Lumumba,  Ntsu  Mokhehle,
Namdi Azikiwe, Modibo Keita, Julius Nyerere,  Ahmed  Sekou  Toure,  Mziwakhe
Lembede, and Zephania Mothopheng.

That is a vision of an Africa restored to her lost power and glory. That  is
an Africa which was a First World country, and not an Africa which is now  a
Third World  country,  subjected  to  the  ravages  of  a  new  colonialism,
ruthless  economic  exploitation  and  underdevelopment.   The   Pan-African
Parliament must bring about a rejuvenated Africa; an  Africa  which  created
the first human civilisation, educated Moses in its highest institutions  of
learning, an Africa which  gave  the  redeemer  of  mankind,  Jesus  Christ,
asylum, demonstrating its  matchless  respect  for  human  rights  and  good
governance.

Speaking about the African vision, a leading Pan Africanist, said:
  We are to establish a society in which men and women will have no anxiety
  about work, food and shelter; where  poverty  and  illiteracy  no  longer
  exist; and where disease is brought under control; where our  educational
  facilities provide opportunities for learning; where  every  person  uses
  his or her talents to their fullest  capacity  and  contribute  to  their
  wellbeing.

I thank you. [Time expired.]

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Chairperson, I think it is important for me to report  to
the House that the life of Amina Lawal has been saved. [Applause.] Her  case
was overturned by an Islamic court that sat in  Nigeria  today.  This  is  a
victory for African women and all freedom-loving democrats the  world  over.
[Applause.]

The topic of our debate today is a great challenge to all of us  as  members
of Parliament in South Africa, but also for parliamentarians throughout  the
continent. The birth of this important  continental  body,  the  Pan-African
Parliament, which is one of the organs of  the  AU,  is  long  overdue.  The
objectives of the Pan-African Parliament can be summarised as follows:


  Facilitation of effective implementation of the policies  and  objectives
  of the AU; the promotion of the principles of human rights and  democracy
  in Africa; promoting good governance, transparency and accountability  in
  member states; popularising the AU  and  its  objects;  promoting  peace,
  security and stability; promoting and facilitating  economic  development
  in Africa through Nepad and other relevant programmes; and  strengthening
  solidarity and unity among the peoples of Africa.

As we prepare ourselves to participate  in  this  august  continental  body,
with its noble objectives, it is important that we prepare and  ensure  that
African women play an  important  and  strategic  role  in  the  Pan-African
Parliament, the AU and all its programmes.  Taking  into  consideration  the
status of women in Africa, it is very critical that  women  play  a  leading
role in this body, which will be the custodian  of  people's  human  rights,
including women's rights, democracy, accountability, peace and stability  in
the continent.

The launch of the AU in Durban,  South  Africa,  in  July  2002,  under  the
leadership of our President Thabo Mbeki as  Chair,  marked  a  milestone  in
Africa's history. Major strides and gains were realised,  not  only  by  the
people of this continent, but in particular, by African  women.  At  the  AU
summit in Durban, a historic resolution was adopted by the African heads  of
state, that 50% of the commissioners of the  AU  must  be  women.  As  Madam
Speaker has already reported, this was implemented to  the  letter  in  this
year's second  summit  of  the  AU's  head  of  states  meeting  in  Maputo.
Furthermore, the special protocol on the  African  Charter  for  people  and
human rights, and the rights of women, was adopted by the  heads  of  states
in Maputo. A directorate on gender has been established  in  the  office  of
the chair of the commission, to ensure that all programmes and  policies  of
the AU are mainstreamed.

These are some of the progressive policies that  must  be  strengthened  and
promoted by the Pan-African Parliament. After the first five years, the Pan-
African Parliament will have  legislative  powers.  It  will  also  play  an
important role in the harmonisation of laws and policies, within our  states
throughout the continent.  This  will  ensure  that  the  culture  of  human
rights, good governance, peace and  security,  is  adopted  in  all  African
countries. It will also monitor the implementation of the  African  Charter,
Cedaw,  the  Beijing  platform  for  action,  and  all  other  international
instruments that African countries have signed and ratified.

This demonstrates the urgency and importance of the Pan-African  Parliament.
However,  for  all  these  commitments  to  be  a  reality,  women  must  be
represented, and must play a leading role in the Pan-African Parliament  and
in all other organs of the African Union. The heads  of  state  who  met  in
Durban and in Maputo led by example when they adopted 50% representation  of
women in the AU. South Africa has also led by example in ensuring  that  60%
of its delegates to the Pan-African Parliament will be women. I  would  like
to congratulate our Parliament for this important resolution.

Therefore we challenge all other countries to ensure that at  least  50%  of
their delegates to the Pan-African Parliament are women. We  also  urge  the
African Union, which will officiate at the inauguration of  the  Pan-African
Parliament, to ensure that its 50% policy is implemented when the  presiding
officers, the president and the four vice-presidents are  elected.  It  must
ensure that 50% of these, and other key officials that  will  be  appointed,
such as the clerk, and the assistant clerks of  the  Pan-African  Parliament
are women.

These policies which affirm women must be harmonised in all  African  states
and they must be linked to the African Peer Review Mechanism.  This  is  the
only way in which we can  ensure  that  all  the  unjust  laws  and  harmful
practices are abolished throughout the continent. This is the  only  way  in
which we can ensure that there will never be another Amina Lawal in  Africa.
This will also ensure that practices  which  are  harmful  and  are  against
women's human rights, such as ukuthwala, which denies our  young  girls  the
right to education and freedom to choose their own partners,  are  abolished
in all our countries.

We also need to re-examine the practice  of  virginity  testing,  which  has
been distorted and exposes our girls to hooligans and  rapists  who  believe
that sleeping with a virgin cures HIV/Aids. We need  laws  and  policies  in
our continent that protect  the  girl  child  and  promote  her  full  human
development in a healthy and secure environment. One of the  most  important
organs of the African Union for African women  is  the  peace  and  security
council, which will be the organ responsible for promoting  peace,  security
and  stability  in  Africa.  Its  main  function  will  be  the  prevention,
management and resolution of conflicts.

We urge all African states to sign and ratify this protocol. We  would  also
like the AU to consider the plight of  women  who  are  living  in  conflict
situations where sexual mutilation and rape have  become  major  weapons  of
war against women. We have received reports of how women in Liberia and  the
Ivory Coast were mutilated, their breasts  chopped  off  and  that  pregnant
women's stomachs were cut open while they were still alive and their  babies
were taken out. These abusive practices against women,  particularly  during
war, should be abolished in Africa. The special African court that  will  be
set up under the African Union  must  also  consider  special  hearings  and
tribunals  against  these  crimes.  We  also  believe  that  women  must  be
represented in the peace and security council and in the African  court,  to
ensure that these concerns are addressed.

The plight of children  in  war  zones  must  also  be  addressed.  Children
orphaned through wars and HIV often seek refuge and are  captured  and  used
as child soldiers, while little girls are used as  sex  slaves.  This  means
that we must strengthen community-based programmes to  support  and  protect
orphans, and ensure that sufficient resources are  allocated  towards  these
programmes, especially since most of them are run by  rural  women  who  are
unemployed.

Education, shelter and security for these children must be  a  priority  for
our governments. All these programmes must be monitored and overseen by  the
Pan-African Parliament. We must also ensure that these  programmes,  through
the Pan-African Parliament, are part and  parcel  of  the  Nepad  programme.
Priority must  be  given  to  programmes  dealing  with  education,  health,
HIV/Aids, malaria, TB, human resource development, poverty  alleviation  and
rural development. Through these programmes, Nepad will be of great  benefit
to women and will ensure the total emancipation and development  of  African
women, the youth and the children of Africa. Thank you. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, may I first thank the Speaker and  the  Deputy
Speaker for outlining today for the  House  and  the  public  how  the  Pan-
African Parliament will be formed and what it will take.

Having looked at the transcript of the presentation by  Prof  Bathily  on  a
vision for the Pan-African Parliament,  the  MF  strongly  agrees  that  the
establishment  of  a  Pan-African  Parliament  can  play  a  vital  role  in
consolidating  democracy.  It  will  be  a  vital  instrument  in   conflict
prevention,  management  and  resolution  as   well   as   overall   African
integration.

We are all one people with  rights  and  entitlements.  A  consolidation  of
democracy will pave the  way  to  respecting  and  upholding  this.  Further
conflict prevention, management and  resolution  is  a  great  need  on  the
continent - noting activities in certain  African  areas.  Most  importantly
through our diversity, the Pan-African Parliament may be an  instrument  for
overall African integration that shall unite us as Africa and  as  a  global
competitor in its individuality.

The  MF  further  found  the  valued  article  by  Dr  Cyril  Ndebele  quite
benefiting and in line with our vision  of  Africa.  It  is  felt  that  our
diversity in culture and other geographic make-up may be a great  challenge.
However, the challenge can be utilised positively so that our diversity  may
unite us as Africa, as we have done in South Africa.

Economic integration will play a vital role in overcoming  poverty  and  its
constraints throughout Africa. Hopefully, the  Pan-African  Parliament  will
be a representation of co-operation and  development  between  countries  on
the African  continent.  The  Pan-African  Parliament's  vision  for  Africa
ventures internally and externally. With such vast discussion,  preparation,
planning  and  dedication  is  crucial.  Our  vision  of   the   Pan-African
Parliament is big but within our reach. The MF  feels  that  united  we  can
make a success of this vision and establish a strong  united  Africa.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, I would like to say thanks  to  Madam  Speaker
for rousing us and showing us the urgency of this subject and not  to  treat
it lightly. I also want to thank the  Deputy  Speaker  for  giving  us  that
wonderful promise that there will be a workshop on the  subject.  Again,  it
is to reinforce the urgency and seriousness of the  matter.  It  is  already
late in the day but I will just take  a  chance  of  going  back  a  little,
because I'm going to just take extracts from my paper.

It is often said that you can tell a person's age by the  songs  they  sing,
and earlier young people used to sing the song whose lyrics  went  something
like this: ``I can see clearly now the rain is gone''. In  Africa,  I  think
Africa should also use those lyrics and say: "I can  see  clearly  now  that
the demise of colonialism and apartheid have gone."

Now is Africa's time for  self-delivery  and  the  African  personality  now
called the African Renaissance. Africa is  challenged  to  form  an  African
community to meet the  challenges  of  the  modern-day  globalised  society.
Building a Pan-African community, Tom Boya would say:


  ... could never be said to be hasty or too fast a pace, because  the  old
  African adage asserts that he or she who is behind must run  faster  than
  the one who is in front.
This is Africa's century and Africa must seize it.

Much has been said about the contents of the protocol but  I  just  want  to
reiterate two or three things that I hold passionately dear and that is  the
idea  of  promoting  good  governance,  transparency   and   accountability;
promotion of human rights; promotion of democratic principles  and  that  of
popular participation in the economy and governance at all levels,  and  the
rest. It seems as though today, in this House, like minds thought alike.  It
is also disappointing to be some kind of a sweeper when there  is  consensus
and there is no contentious issue to debate. But it  is  also  a  good  sign
that there is, indeed, growth in this country and on the continent.

I would also like to identify, on behalf  of  the  DA,  our  immense  relief
regarding Ms Lawal's acquittal by  the  State  Shari'ah  Court  of  Appeals.
Stoning people to death for adultery is really out of date and is  the  most
unfair thing that can ever be practised.

Our optimism and enthusiasm for the Pan-African Parliament must not make  us
oblivious, however, of the many challenges and impediments that are  current
or lie ahead. This is not pessimism but realism and  the  realities  of  our
present day. The Pan-African Parliament  and  all  related  instruments  and
strategies can only be successful  if  all  national  parliaments  throw  in
their lot together.

The strength and success of the PAP will depend on the nature and inputs  of
each individual national parliament. In  other  words,  it  is  almost  like
saying the strength of a chain will depend on each  link.  The  present  day
Africa's  common  enemy,  somebody  said,  is  poverty,  diseases  such   as
HIV/Aids, malaria, etc. But I think those are  conglomerate  common  enemies
that can unite this continent to begin to  tackle  the  problems  that  face
them, without observing artificial barriers that  people  or  countries  are
inclined to set for themselves.

Last but not  least,  what's  to  be  done  by  us,  this  Parliament?  Many
brilliant ideas have been expressed. I think, down to earth,  what  we  need
to do is to set our inputs at a high footing so that they  also  run  as  an
example to other neighbouring countries.  It  is  also  imperative  that  we
equip not only ourselves but also our  constituencies  with  these  emerging
developing modes and processes that are geared to realising the  Pan-African
ideal  by  popularising  the  very  concepts  such  as  Nepad  and   related
instruments  in  our  societies  and  at  all  levels  of  our  country  and
continent. I thank you. [Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, it is a pleasure to be able to speak  last  in  a
debate which has been  so  positive  and  businesslike.  Many  members  have
referred to the procedures and proposals that are required to make the  Pan-
African Parliament a reality and, really, one  feels  that  one  is  on  the
brink of a new historical event in Africa.

I wish to return to some of the policy considerations that we need  to  take
account  of,  as  well  as  looking  at  the  businesslike  procedures   and
processes. I think it's very important that this House should  remember  the
need to maintain a political momentum, because the political  momentum  will
actually decide whether the Pan-African Parliament is seen as a  real  House
that represents Africa; and  it  is  the  political  momentum  which  is  so
important for us.

One of the issues under that heading is the need to  counter  Afro-pessimism
because Afro-pessimism, in my view, is perhaps one of the biggest  obstacles
to the creation of a real Pan-African Parliament that will be respected  and
seen by the people of the continent, as  a  whole,  as  being  an  important
occasion and issue.

I want to say that I think the hon Geldenhuys was a little bit one-sided  in
bringing this book from the  New  NP  which  talks  about  the  freedoms  in
Africa, important as those issues are, but which tends to  give  a  slightly
one-sided view of Africa and leads a little  bit  into  this  Afro-pessimism
that I am so concerned about.

I want to refer to a unique event which happened last  week  in  Cape  Town,
when  30  postgraduate  mathematics  students  from  16  African   countries
gathered. They are here for a period of nine  months  to  study  mathematics
and to advance the cause of the mathematical sciences right  across  Africa.
These students are gathered today in Cape  Town.  They  have  been  together
with mathematics professors from Morocco, Ghana, Nigeria,  Sudan  and  South
Africa; and they have been with various overseas professors  of  mathematics
as well in order to create a new network across the whole of Africa, and  to
discuss and learn the mathematical sciences.

I refer to this because I think  that  this  is  an  example  of  how  Afro-
pessimism can be overcome in a practical way, and it demonstrates  the  need
of Pan-Africanism not just in political resolutions  but  in  practical  co-
operation across the continent. I believe  that  the  Internet  gives  us  a
wonderful new instrument to develop Pan-Africanism  in  concrete  terms  and
raise the whole intellectual professional capacity in  Africa  and  this  is
the way that we should go. I would hope that as we  begin  to  move  towards
the Pan-African Parliament - and we are now moving rather  fast  -  we  also
use the instruments of technology and of the Internet websites and so on  to
spread the idea of Pan-Africanism, so that it is not  confined  to  a  small
number of politicians who meet together and keep each other  warm  but  that
we actually do take the issues and policies to the people as a whole.

I believe that Afro-pessimism is a useless kind of negative activity at  the
moment and we should do everything we can to counter it. And I want  to  say
that the ANC in this House and outside of it  has  fought  very  hard  since
1994 to overcome Afro-pessimism and to  indicate  that  African  governments
are able to run countries and to have a positive  mood.  I  think  that  the
initiatives that this House  has  taken  with  respect  to  the  Pan-African
Parliament, Nepad and the APRM have been a major effort by the ANC  to  show
that Afro-pessimism is something that comes a great deal  from  abroad,  but
also from certain forces within South Africa. We need to  counter  that  and
take a positive spin on everything that is moving in Africa,  and  the  Pan-
African Parliament is one of those.

I want to say that I think this House from  now  on,  and  the  MPs  in  it,
should, as you say, adopt the  multiparty  approach  to  ensure  that  Afro-
pessimism is downgraded, that it is removed, and that  the  positive  things
and experiences in Africa are given priority.

I must say that in  the  last  six  months  or  so  I  have  been  extremely
privileged to  participate  in  a  number  of  meetings  in  Accra,  Lusaka,
Nairobi, Livingstone and Cape Town, and in this very Chamber, where  members
of parliament from across the continent have met and discussed their  common
problems. And it is absolutely clear to me that we need a  parallel  process
to the executive in the African Union. We need a parallel process  based  on
parliaments and members of parliament so that the whole question of  African
unity is not confined to  the  organs  at  the  top  but  actually  embraces
members of parliament and their constituencies. I agree  entirely  with  the
hon Colin Eglin when he says that the Pan-African Parliament should  not  be
confined to  an  elite  category  of  representatives  meeting  and  talking
amongst themselves; but we do need a momentum across the continent  so  that
everybody participates.

I have learned that in many African countries the executives do not pass  on
the information that they gain in the African  Union  to  their  parliaments
and to their people. They  keep  this  information  and  these  insights  to
themselves. That is why that is a very good reason for arguing  for  a  Pan-
African Parliament which has as a parallel momentum  to  the  executive.  We
have a responsibility as parliamentarians to do our thing, in our  way,  and
to have our discussions in our forum, which runs parallel but is  of  course
connected to the African Union and not in  isolation  from  it.  This  needs
major political engagements.

I want to remind the House that parliamentary procedures are vital  for  the
success of the African Union, and are vital for the  success  of  Nepad  and
the African Peer Review Mechanism. The question has been  raised  again  and
again that the finances which Africa can raise to make a  success  of  Nepad
and  the  African  Union  are  finances  that  have  to  be  passed  by  the
parliaments of Africa. And,  even  where  those  parliaments  are  not  that
active and not that democratic they do have to pass  the  budgets  of  their
countries. Therefore the money  that  is  required  to  run  Nepad  and  the
African Peer Review Mechanism will have to come  through  the  parliamentary
system and that is why it is so important that the parliamentary process  is
run properly, with momentum and efficiency.

We have been told at various meetings that I  have  attended,  and  even  in
this House, that there is an illusion of a capital shortage  in  Africa.  We
of course welcome foreign aid and foreign investment and contributions  from
the G8, the EU or anybody else to the development of  Africa;  but  some  of
our economists are saying to us that there  is  an  illusion  of  a  capital
shortage in Africa. And, indeed, there are those who  read  the  news  about
the former president of Liberia, who is sitting in Nigeria  at  the  moment,
regarding the fact that he absconded with a million dollars - or  was  it  a
billion?  He absconded with a billion dollars from Liberia, a country  which
is so poor. There is no shortage of capital  in  Africa  provided  that  our
parliaments, all of them, exercise supervision over the  budgets,  over  the
way funding is used, and ensure that these budgets are applied to Nepad  and
so on.

I want to give a brief account of a  meeting  in  Nairobi  that  I  attended
recently where 15 parliaments were represented  to  discuss  Nepad  and  its
work, because the question of Nepad is certainly the business of this  House
and all the other parliaments. A decision was taken  that  Nepad  should  be
promoted, that every parliament in Africa should have  a  working  group  of
the kind that we have here. Again, I must pay tribute  to  our  Speaker  and
Deputy Speaker for the excellent work done by our working group. We want  to
see working groups of this kind in every parliament right across Africa.

We want to encourage parliaments  in  Africa  to  discuss  major  issues  of
society and policy. It is vital that the  policy  dimensions  of  the  whole
continent should be brought to bear and  not  just  technical  matters,  and
that parliaments should not be seen as a rubber  stamp.  They  must  promote
the separation of the legislatures and the executive, and  that  is  a  very
important principle in Africa  which  is  not  always  observed.  The  whole
question of regional integration should be looked at in a political  way  so
that the politics of  regional  integration  as  well  as  matters  such  as
customs, trade relations and normal business relations  are  discussed;  but
the political questions of cultural unity and unity  across  regions  should
be discussed in the parliaments.

I also want to say that it is vital that the Pan-African Parliament and  the
African Union should be seen not only in political  terms  but  in  economic
terms. There are many  issues  of  economic  integration  and  economic  co-
operation in Africa at the moment.  They  have  a  political  dimension  and
these matters are the things that should be  discussed  in  the  Pan-African
Parliament.

Also important is that with regard to these  institutions  which  are  being
created - the various  organs  of  the  African  Union  -  there  should  be
harmonisation across those institutions. This has  been  discussed  recently
and it is  terribly  important  that  the  Pan-African  Parliament  and  the
institutions which fall under it should also be harmonised so that  we  have
a single tendency right across the continent and we all work together.

Finally, I want to make a point that nobody else seems to have raised  today
and this is the fact that Africa exists in a by-and-large hostile world,  as
we saw at the Cancun conference. A new momentum has been developing  between
various Third World countries to have unity in the face of  the  North.  The
Pan-African Parliament will have a major agenda item which is the  unity  of
Africa in the face of a by-and-large  hostile,  unfriendly  and  globalising
world; and where the questions of African unity will be discussed  not  only
in the sentimental  terms  that  some  people  have  raised  here  today  by
referring to the past, to Tom Boya and Nkrumah and so on, but in  the  light
of the harsh realities of the world today.

We know and understand,  and  Cancun  has  reinforced  that  we  live  in  a
polarised world where African unity is not only a matter of  sentimentality,
of harking back to the past but is a harsh reality where we have to get  our
house in order. We have to co-operate, we have to co-ordinate,  we  have  to
make all of us work together right across the continent. We have  to  ensure
that no outside power is able to have break-away groups as they did  in  the
past; and divide French-speaking from English-speaking,  Arab-speaking  from
French-speaking as it happened in the past.

Colonialism  and  neocolonialism,  and  postindependent  processes  saw  the
fragmentation of Africa so that the African countries did not work  together
in the way that they should have. President Nyerere once said when  Tanzania
was asked to become a member of the Security Council,  ``For  us,  to  be  a
member of the Security Council makes us vulnerable to the pressures  of  the
United States and the great powers because when we vote against them we  are
going to be in trouble.'' That period must be over. We must now ensure  that
Africa unites politically and that we speak with one  voice.  I  think  that
the Pan-African Parliament will create just  that  kind  of  opportunity  to
unite the continent in a way that we were not united before.

So I have great pleasure in supporting this particular motion and I am  very
pleased to say that the House  is  united  in  support  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament. Thank you. [Applause.]

                            CAPE TOWN WINS AWARDS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G SOLOMON (ANC): Chairperson, as ambassador duly  appointed  by  Minister
Valli Moosa to promote the cities in  South  Africa,  I  wish  to  make  the
following important statement regarding Cape Town. Last  week,  the  Western
Cape branch of the Institute for Housing of  South  Africa  recognised  Cape
Town with an award for the Best Local Authority of the Year for the  Western
Cape. Cape Town also won an award for the  hostels  to  homes  project.  The
Dibanisa Iintsapho Hostels to Homes Programme is part of the  urban  renewal
programme which aims to convert all hostels in Langa, Nyanga  and  Gugulethu
into low-rental family units.

The ANC congratulates Cape Town, its leaders and people  and  calls  on  all
South Africans, prisoners, NGOs, Government and communities to  continue  to
work together to strengthen the people's contract for a better  tomorrow  in
Cape Town.

          SOUTH AFRICANS ABROAD VOTING IN THE 2004 GENERAL ELECTION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr I J PRETORIUS (DA): Chairperson, there is no  logical  reason  why  South
Africans who are temporarily outside our borders should  be  prevented  from
voting in next  year's  general  election.  The  DA  will  propose  its  own
amendment to the Electoral Act in Parliament, tomorrow, that will  give  all
South Africans who are abroad for study, business  purposes  and  employment
opportunities the right to vote.

You cannot separate someone's duty  from  their  right.  You  cannot  expect
someone to contribute to his country  but  then  deny  them  a  say  in  the
running of the country. You cannot call on  expatriates  to  come  home  but
then prevent them from voting. It just does not work.

In 1994 it was the ANC which pushed the then government of F W De  Klerk  to
allow South Africans abroad the opportunity to vote. But  in  1999  the  ANC
changed its tune. I think it's time that we allowed all  our  people  abroad
to vote. The vote does not belong to the Government.  In  a  democracy,  the
voter owns the vote. Don't take that precious possession away from  them.  I
thank you.

                     STEPS TO FIGHT INTERNET PAEDOPHILES

                            (Member's Statement)
Mr B W DLAMINI  (IFP):  Chairperson,  the  software  giant,  Microsoft,  has
declared war on Internet paedophiles by announcing the closure of  its  chat
rooms. Microsoft will also restrict  access  to  chat  room  users  by  only
allowing identifiable users. This decision is a  significant  step  and  one
hopes that South Africa will follow by legislating to  criminalise  Internet
grooming and impose tough sanctions on these child abusers.

Furthermore, we need to counter the morally damaging effect of this  on  our
children and protect the most vulnerable members  of  our  community.  Thank
you.

                NEED FOR TRANSFORMATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr Z P JORDAN (ANC): Chairperson, on  23  September  2003,  President  Thabo
Mbeki addressed the 58th session of the United  Nations'  General  Assembly.
Among the issues that the President raised in his speech  was  the  need  to
transform the United Nations organisation.

The ANC shares with the President the view that the United Nations needs  to
be  strengthened  and  transformed  into  a  democratic   institution   that
represents  and  responds  to  the  interests  of  all  countries,  be  they
developed or developing, large or small.

Developments in Iraq  have  raised  sharply  the  question  of  whether  the
current UN arrangement is a strong and effective  multilateral  organisation
capable of addressing issues of  concern  to  all  the  inhabitants  of  the
globe. The ANC believes that now is the time for the UN to act in  a  manner
consistent with its founding principles; now is the time to  act  to  ensure
global peace, and the eradication of poverty and underdevelopment.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

                   POOR PERFORMANCE OF ACCOUNTING OFFICERS

                            (Member's Statement)
Mrs M E OLCKERS (New NP): Chairman, the New NP wants to put  on  record  its
disappointment  about  the  financial  management  of   certain   Government
departments as highlighted by the Scopa resolution that was adopted  by  the
National Assembly on Monday, 22 September 2003.

It is clear from the Scopa resolution that certain  accounting  officers  in
the Public Service, and some in the public entity fields, are not  executing
their duties in line with the PFMA and responsibilities  that  are  expected
of directors-general. It is evident that several  departments  do  not  have
adequate  internal  control  policies  and  procedures.  In  almost  50%  of
national departments the auditors could not rely on internal controls.

According to the  Auditor-General's  assessment,  a  significant  number  of
auditors failed to comply with internal audit requirements of the PFMA.  The
Auditor-General also indicated that of the 15 public entities dealt with  in
the general report,  only  six  of  them  tabled  their  annual  reports  to
Parliament within the prescribed time.
The time has arrived for accounting officers who do  not  perform  according
to the  prescribed  standards  to  be  censured  by  relevant  parliamentary
committees. It is also the duty of the executive to ensure  that  accounting
officers who do not perform according to  the  PFMA  and  their  performance
contracts are replaced. Accounting officers  who  do  not  ensure  that  the
taxpayer's money is well controlled and  properly  spent  should  leave  the
public sector.

It would be  of  value  to  have  accounting  officers  in  the  House  when
resolutions regarding their departments are discussed so  that  transparency
and accountability can be direct ... [Time expired.]

          LAUNCH OF THE AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S L DITHEBE (ANC): Chairperson, the African  Institute  for  Mathematical
Sciences was  launched  by  the  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology, Dr Ben Ngubane; and the Minister  of  Education,  -  Prof  Kader
Asmal, on 18 September in Muizenberg, Cape Town.

This African initiative will  see  an  injection  of  R1  million  from  the
Department of Science and Technology to support Aims's programmes which  are
linked to centres and networks of excellence in science and technology.  The
centres and networks are aimed at focusing  on  human  resource  development
and popularising science in South Africa and across the  African  continent.
This will, among other  things,  see  five  African  mathematics  professors
interlinking  by  Internet  to  strengthen  scientific   and   technological
capacity across the African  continent  as  well  as  building  co-operation
among the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK, the University  of
the Western Cape, Cape Town, Stellenbosch and the  University  of  Paris-Sud
in France.

This bold African endeavour fulfils the resolve of  the  ANC  Government  to
strive for the end of poverty and underdevelopment on our continent, and  to
therefore build a better life for the ordinary people of Africa,  especially
the poor. This is demonstrated in the R1 million pledged by  the  Department
of Science and Technology in this venture as a measure of  its  enthusiastic
support for the  advancement  of  science  in  general  and  mathematics  in
particular. I thank you.

                    AWARDING OF BURSARIES TO 35 PRISONERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D V BLOEM (ANC): Chairperson, I would like to bring to the  attention  of
this House a positive event that took  place  in  Leeuwkop  Prison  recently
where the Mayor of Ekurhuleni Municipality  gave  out  35  bursaries  to  35
inmates to further their studies. It is very clear that  the  Department  of
Correctional Services have moved away from the old, brutal style of  dealing
with offenders. The focus of the department is on rehabilitation.

It's very encouraging to see the Mayor of Ekurhuleni Municipality,  Mr  Duma
Nkosi, actively involved in projects  at  various  prisons  in  the  Gauteng
province. I want to take this opportunity  to  congratulate  the  mayor,  Mr
Nkosi, for the positive and progressive work that he is  doing.  I  want  to
call on all businesses, community members and society  at  large  to  follow
the example of Mr Nkosi.

The fact that prisoners were represented by a  fellow  inmate  in  arranging
these bursaries serves to emphasise the  merits  of  Vukuzenzele  and  Batho
Pele. I thank you.

                  DECLINE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH COUNCIL

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A J BOTHA (DA): Hon Chairman, the  House  has  already  learnt  that  the
Agricultural Research Council is down to 50%  of  its  original  and  barely
replaceable research capacity. The remaining researchers have to  attend  to
so much service delivery that their research and  skills  transfer  capacity
is severely diminished. The resulting potential for the increase  of  animal
diseases and crop pests can compromise both food security and trade.

South Africa possesses 50% of all the agricultural scientific  knowledge  on
the continent of  Africa.  The  Nepad  programme  is  heavily  dependent  on
agriculture and that, therefore, makes  the  prevailing  conditions  in  the
Agricultural Research Council to be of extreme importance.

The DA's request that the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture be  briefed  on
the crisis was met by the management's whitewash. They pretended that  there
was really no  crisis  at  all.  Letters  to  the  Minister  remain  as  yet
unanswered. All  of  this,  together  with  today's  inadequate  ministerial
response, persuade the DA that a debate on this  matter  is  called  for  in
order to clear the air and establish some necessary facts. I thank you.

        FINANCIAL DONATION TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF MALARIA IN AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M M MDLALOSE (IFP): Chairperson, malaria is still a huge problem in  many
parts of Africa. About 1 million people die of malaria  per  year,  most  of
them in Africa. The announcement made earlier this  week  by  the  Bill  and
Melinda Gates Foundation that they will donate US$168  million  for  malaria
research is, therefore, very good news.

The funds will come in the form of three research grants  and  the  existing
malaria drugs will be used to prevent infant infection. New  drugs  will  be
developed to combat drug-resistant malaria and to find  a  malaria  vaccine.
This is the largest single donation to the fight against malaria. The  funds
for this research are  particularly  needed  as  in  many  parts  of  Africa
malaria has become resistant  to  chloroquine  which  is  the  cheapest  and
standard drug against the disease.

We hope that governments and the private sector throughout Africa will  work
together and use the resources  at  their  disposal  to  accelerate  malaria
research so that we can finally beat this deadly disease.

                          ACQUITTAL OF AMINA LAWAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M M SOTYU (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC Women's  League,  at  its  congress
held from 28 to 31 August 2003, committed itself to fighting to  save  Amina
Lawal's life and has since led marches and demonstrations to  highlight  the
continued abuse, oppression and exploitation of women.

Today's decision by the Katsina State Shariah Court  of  Appeals  to  acquit
Amina Lawal represents a tremendous victory for human  rights  and  justice.
The ANC congratulates Amina Lawal  on  her  acquittal.  We  salute  the  ANC
Women's League for remaining at the head of  the  struggle  by  millions  of
human rights activists in our country  and  abroad  to  save  Amina  Lawal's
life.

We thank all those who, during Amina  Lawal's  ordeal,  chose  to  fight  in
defence of the noble principles enshrined in the  Universal  Declaration  of
Human  Rights,  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of   all   Forms   of
Discrimination Against Women. We salute all who  fight  in  defence  of  our
very humanity. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP (NA): Voorsitter, op 'n  punt  van  orde:  Die  sweep  van  die
kleiner partye het my versoek om in die plek van die ACDP 'n  verklaring  te
maak, maar u het toe nie my naam gelees nie. Kan ons 'n kans kry?

Die VOORSITTER VAN KOMITEES: Ons  kom  by  jou.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP (NA): Chairperson, on  a  point  of  order:  The  Whip  of  the
smaller parties has requested me to make a statement in  the  place  of  the
ACDP, but you have not read my name. Can we get a chance?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We are coming to you.]

                              LAND RESTITUTION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE (Nuwe NP): Voorsitter, grondhervorming  help  niks  as
die Departement van  Landbou  en  Grondsake  nie  aan  die  opkomende  boere
ondersteuning bied om die grond volhoubaar  te  benut  nie.  Daar  is  reeds
talle voorbeelde van plase wat aan opkomende  boere  gegee  is  wat  verkoop
moes  word  omdat  dit  nie  winsgewend  was   nie.   In   Junie   het   die
Hoofgrondeisekommissaris gesê:


  Grondhervorming word nie gedoen vir die doel van volhoubare  ontwikkeling
  nie, maar om die ongeregtigheid van die verlede reg te stel.

Die Nuwe NP sê egter: Natuurlik moet  die  ongeregtigheid  van  die  verlede
reggestel word, maar dit help nie 'n mens  gee  iemand  'n  plaas,  maar  jy
voorsien hom nie van die nodige kennis en kundigheid  oor  hoe  om  te  boer
nie. Dis ook belangrik om opkomende boere by  te  staan  in  die  finansiële
bestuur van hulle plase. Grondhervorming gaan absoluut  geen  ongeregtigheid
regstel as plase uitgedeel word, maar ná drie jaar weer opgeveil word  omdat
die eienaars dit nie na behore kon bestuur nie.

Die Nuwe NP doen dus 'n ernstige beroep op die Minister  om  hierdie  uiters
belangrike been van  grondhervorming  op  die  voorgrond  te  plaas.  Sonder
kennis en kundigheid sal die landboubedryf in Suid-Afrika tot niet  gaan  en
grondhervorming  beslis  ook  misluk.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member's
statement follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE (New NP): Chairperson, land reform is  of  no  use  if
the Department of Agriculture and  Land  Affairs  does  not  offer  emerging
farmers support in utilising the land in a  sustainable  manner.  There  are
already many examples of farms given to emerging  farmers  that  had  to  be
sold because they were not profitable. The Chief  Land  Claims  Commissioner
said in June:
  Grondhervorming word nie gedoen vir die doel van volhoubare  ontwikkeling
  nie, maar om die ongeregtigheid van die verlede reg te stel.

However, the New NP says: Of course  the  injustice  of  the  past  must  be
rectified, but it does not help if one gives someone a  farm  but  does  not
provide him with the necessary knowledge and expertise on how  to  farm.  It
is also important to assist emerging farmers with regard  to  the  financial
management of their farms. Land reform will rectify absolutely no  injustice
if farms are handed out but have to  be  auctioned  off  again  after  three
years because the owners cannot manage them properly.

The New NP therefore makes an earnest appeal to the Minister  to  prioritise
this extremely important  aspect  of  land  reform.  Without  knowledge  and
expertise the agricultural industry in South Africa  will  go  to  rack  and
ruin and land reform will certainly also fail.]

                           REPORT ON FARM ATTACKS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C AUCAMP (NA): Voorsitter, die NA beskou  die  verslag  oor  plaasmoorde
wat  vandag  bekend  gestel  is  as  'n  futiele   oefening   in   politieke
korrektheid.  Die  bevinding  dat  slegs  2%  van   plaasaanvalle   polities
geïnspireerd  is,  en  dat  rasseonverdraagsaamheid  nie   'n   motief   vir
plaasmoorde is nie, strook nie met die ervaring en die werklikheid nie.  Die
verslag  is  myle  verwyder  van  die  realiteit  van  die  oormaat  geweld,
wreedheid en brutaliteit wat met plaasmoorde gepaard gaan.

Die verslag hou vol om bloot 'n roofmotief as rede aan te voer vir  90%  van
plaasaanvalle, maar bly  in  gebreke  om  te  verklaar  waarom  koelbloedige
moorde dikwels gepleeg word  sonder  dat  iets  geroof  word.  Ook  rym  die
verslag  se  bevindings  nie  met  die  talle  gevalle  waar  'n  uitgerekte
marteling die finale doodmaak van slagoffers voorafgaan nie.

Die eensydige onderrok van die verslag hang uit wanneer, op bladsy  476,  na
kommer wat uitgespreek is oor geopolitiese motiewe  vir  plaasmoorde  verwys
word as ``post-1994 retoriek van sekere politici'', terwyl net die  volgende
paragraaf baie meer simpatiek handel met bewerings dat arbeidsgriewe  gesien
word as motief vir plaasaanvalle.

Die verslag plaas 'n onbehoorlike verantwoordelikheid op  boere  om  hulself
nog  meer  te  beveilig,  maar  maak  geen  aanbeveling  ten   opsigte   van
staatssteun in dié verband nie. Die  verslag  bly  in  gebreke  om  werklike
aanbevelings te maak oor hoe die  Regering  sy  basiese  plig,  naamlik  die
beveiliging van sy mense, kan uitvoer. Die verslag slaag volkome  daarin  om
presies te sê wat die Minister wil hê dit moet sê. Ek dank  u.  (Translation
of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP (NA): Chairperson, the NA regards the report  on  farm  murders
which was published today as a futile  exercise  in  political  correctness.
The finding that only 2% of farm attacks are politically inspired, and  that
racial intolerance is not a motive for farm murders, is simply at odds  with
experience and reality. The report is far removed from the  reality  of  the
excessive violence, cruelty and brutality that accompany farm murders.

The report persists in giving merely the motive of  robbery  as  the  reason
for 90% of farm  attacks,  but  fails  to  explain  why  murders  are  often
committed in cold blood without anything being stolen. Nor can the  report's
findings be reconciled with the fact that there are numerous cases in  which
a prolonged torture precedes the eventual killing of victims.

The one-sided petticoat of the report is hanging  out  when,  on  page  476,
concern expressed about geopolitical motives for farm  murders  is  referred
to  as  "post-1994  rhetoric  of  certain  politicians",  whereas  the  next
paragraph deals  far  more  sympathetically  with  allegations  that  labour
grievances are regarded as a motive for farm murders.

The report places an unfair responsibility on  farmers  to  make  even  more
provision for themselves, but makes no recommendation in  respect  of  state
support in this regard. The report  fails  to  make  actual  recommendations
about how the Government can perform its basic duty, namely  to  ensure  the
security of its people. The report succeeds totally in saying  exactly  what
the Minister wants it to say. I thank you.]

                        INSOLVENCY OF SA POST OFFICE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr V C GORE(DA): Chairperson, the SA Post Office confirmed on  Tuesday  this
week that it is technically insolvent. As such, its  future  is  of  growing
concern and it is highly questionable; and drastic measures are required  to
ensure the  continued  operation  of  the  Post  Office.  The  DA  genuinely
believes that the CEO, Mr Manyathi, is trying to salvage a sinking ship.

We welcome his undertaking that the Post Office  will  not  ask  the  postal
regulator for a postal tariff increase in line with the CPIX this  year.  He
has suggested a 5% increase only. It is apparent that the  problems  of  the
Post Office have been there for some time but the  people  of  South  Africa
have only recently been able to get a glimpse of these  problems.  The  Post
Office has avoided bringing its annual reports to Parliament for  years.  It
is simply not acceptable to have hidden the true picture of the Post  Office
from the people who own it, namely, all South Africans.

The report also confirms what the DA previously revealed to the  media;  the
losses of the Post Office were cross-subsidised by money  from  the  poorest
of the poor. The Post Office has used just under a  billion  rand  of  money
from depositors to prop up its loss-making operations.  It  is  morally  and
ethically indefensible to use money earned by the ordinary workers  of  this
country for these purposes.

Hard-working individuals trusted the Post Office with their funds and  hoped
that these funds would be safeguarded and invested in a prudent  manner.  It
was only when this was discovered by the DA and on the insistence  from  the
DA that the Post Office has now made an undertaking  that  this  will  never
occur again in the future.[Applause.]

                           UN INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss J E SOSIBO (ANC): Chairperson, violence continues to occupy the  centre
stage of political developments in Iraq. It is estimated that about  169  US
soldiers have lost their lives since May 29 when  President  Bush  announced
the end of the war. Many more have been injured  than  were  injured  during
the period of conventional warfare. Realising that America  is  heading  for
another Vietnam fiasco, President Bush is now turning back  to  the  UN.  He
now seeks the UN and international community to play a more meaningful  role
in Iraq.

The recent moves by the US  administration  should  be  encouraged  and  the
lesson should be  learnt  that  a  strong  UN  working  in  defence  of  and
representing all the people  of  the  world  is  in  the  best  interest  of
humanity. I thank you. [Applause.]
                                FARM MURDERS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY:  Chairperson,  I  really  hope  that  I
understood what the hon Aucamp said.  Unfortunately,  the  listening  device
that I was using was not very clear. But, if I understood him correctly,  he
was doing something that  he  ought  not  to  do  in  this  House.  He  cast
aspersions on people, who are outside the House and who are unable  to  come
here and defend themselves, because he insinuated that  we  manipulated  the
committee to arrive at a decision that we would be comfortable with.

Let me point out something here: There are people who, all  the  time,  want
to drag us into situations of conflict. We are  resisting  that  because  it
ought not to happen. In the past, there  were  people  who  came  from  both
sides of the political conflict. Both of  those  sides  understood  what  it
meant to bleed. We don't want our country to go back there. What  he  wanted
this committee to  say  was  that  the  attacks  on  farms  are  politically
motivated. He wanted that. And, because they have said that  they  were  not
politically motivated, he is now expressing frustration. In other words,  he
would have been happy if our country was depicted as a country  where  there
is political conflict among ourselves and the people that we serve. That  is
what he wanted.

Please, let us move away from that path. We know what it means to bleed  and
we do not want to go back to that past. We want to unify  our  people.  That
committee said, indeed, that the attacks were not politically motivated  and
the facts speak for themselves.

Hon member, if you want to go out there and do your own  inquiry,  do  that.
Don't bring into this House speculation about things that are not  happening
on the ground. And don't suggest that we need to go back as South Africa  to
the conflict of the past because from our side, through  understanding  what
that conflict has done to our country, we will not go back. [Applause.]
          LAUNCH OF THE AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES

                            (Minister's Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Chairperson,
I am responding on behalf of the Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology. I have noted the statement that was made by the hon Dithebe  and
I want to say  that  the  project  that  he  referred  to  is  part  of  the
implementation of our research  and  development  strategy,  the  thrust  of
which is to ensure broader participation  of  the  previously  disadvantaged
communities. We hope that in this particular  project,  those  will  be  our
beneficiaries. Thank you. [Applause.]
