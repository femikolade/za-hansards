<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the definitions clause and there are, as you will see, a number of amendments on the Order Paper, and arising from them it may be necessary to change the definitions clause, and I would therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is the clause which provides that the Attorney-General is the person who conducts prosecutions on behalf of the State; and in sub-clause (5) it provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An attorney-general shall exercise his authority and perform his functions under the Act or under any other law subject to the control and directions of the Minister, who may reverse any decision arrived at by an attorney-general and may himself in general or in any specific matter exercise any part of such authority and perform any of such functions.</block>

<p>Sir, I know that it has not been the practice of the hon. the Minister, who is the present incumbent, in any way to interfere with the decision of an attorney-general; he has said so in this House. But the power is given here to the Minister to reverse a decision of an attorney-general. That is a most serious thing to be done, and one cannot imagine circumstances in which this would be done. I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of subsection (5):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that when the Minister has reversed a decision arrived at by an attorney-general, the Minister shall report such reversal to both Houses of Parliament within fourteen days if Parliament is then in ordinary session or, if Parliament is not then in ordinary session, within fourteen days after the commencement of its next ensuing ordinary session.</block>

<p>I think this amendment is a reasonable one, because it would be a most serious state of affairs if the Minister decided to reverse a decision of an attorney-general. I think it would have the added advantage that there would not be rumours floating around that the Minister interfered, or that something happened and that the attorney-general declined to do this or that, resulting in rumours floating around that the Minister interfered. These rumours, as the hon. the Minister knows, have done the rounds for a number of years and I think that this provision would eliminate that. I hope that the hon. the Minister will find himself in a position to accept this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to accept this amendment by the hon. member for Durban North. In fact, I cannot see the object of this amendment, except for the extremely superficial reason advanced by the hon. member, namely that rumours may arise that the hon. the Minister of Justice has abused his powers. Sir, I wish to express doubts as to whether this may be considered to be sufficient justification for the authority of the Minister in this connection, which is in fact the highest authority, having to be qualified and limited in this way. I wish to point out that this clause provides that all prosecutions shall be instituted by the State. The State is the highest authority and the body which is charged with the task of conducting all prosecutions and which has do so. After all, I think that it goes without saying that in this connection the Minister of Justice is the highest authority and the representative of the State. In fact, it is also the authority which will appoint the attorney-general. Therefore I think that this is simply a logical and consequential position. The State is the highest authority, and this is immediately followed by the authority of the Minister of Justice acting as the representative of the State, and therefore I think that this authorisation is essential and also believe that owing the implications which may arise, this power in favour of the Minister should, for obvious reasons, also be welcomed by the department itself and by the attorneys-general. Therefore I say that we on this side of the House are not in a position to accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Ermelo has correctly stated that in terms of this Bill before us, the authority to institute prosecutions or not to institute prosecutions is vested in the State. Sir, that is no argument. Because the actual administrative responsibility of carrying out the functions of the State is vested in a particular official with a particular status in the Public Service. In the case of prosecutions, the discretionary power to decide whether a prosecution should proceed or <span class="col_4763-4764" refersTo="page_0935"/>not has from time immemorial been in the hands of the Attorney-General. It is a discretion which is exercised by the Attorney-General on behalf of the State. One cannot conceive that every decision of the Attorney-General comes to the Minister for his opinion as to whether or not he should approve or disapprove. When the Minister does intervene in so far as a prosecution is concerned, whether to authorize it or to withhold, it, the circumstances must be most unusual. It cannot possibly a normal case. When I say &#x201C;normal&#x201D; I mean conventional crimes and conventional prosecutions. Where the Minister has then in fact exercized his discretion to intervene it will be in abnormal circumstances and these occasions, I presume, are minimum in number. The fact is that whether that prosecution is proceeded with or not, it remains as far as the public is concerned, the decision of the Attorney-General whereas in fact it was not a decision of the Attorney-General, as was customary and normal, but a decision of the Minister. Take as a corollary matters of promotions and appointment of officials in the Public Service. The Cabinet is responsible for the appointment of officials but the Public Service Commission makes the recommendations. In every instance where the Cabinet does not follow the recommendations of the Public Service Commission that is made public that the normal procedure has not been adopted. All this amendment of the hon. member for Durban North envisages is that where abnormal procedure has taken place, where the Minister has had to intervene, then Parliament should be informed. I think it is a very reasonable proposal and one which makes the matter clear as far as the public is concerned as to the isolated cases where the Minister has exercised his discretion and not the Attorney-General.</p>

<speech by="#prinsloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. P. PRINSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I think I should just point out to the Committee that this clause 3, to which the hon. member is objecting, fully corresponds with section 5(3) of the existing Act, a section which was also discussed in depth on previous occasions and which appears in similar form on the Statute Book. It has just been defined a little better here, but there is no difference between the clause as we now seek to enact it and as it is embodied in the existing Act. Nor do I find in the reasons advanced by hon. members opposite who have already spoken, any grounds for this side of the House to agree that this addition is necessary. In fact, I think that there is at all times sufficient opportunity for Parliament to bring a Minister to book if necessary. Up to now this section has worked well, and I feel that we should content ourselves with it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal is quite correct in saying that it corresponds with the section in the present Act, but at the Second Reading we made it clear that we could not necessarily allow everything contained in the existing Act to go through, because if we do not agree with it, we want to change it. I think an important principle is involved here. The Attorney-General is an important figure in our administration of justice and much weight must be given to a decision made by him. The hon. member for Ermelo is quite correct in saying the State is the highest authority and the State is a body which institutes the prosecution, but he is wrong in saying that the hon. the Minister is the highest authority. Parliament is the highest authority, because the Minister is responsible to Parliament. When the Minister makes such a serious decision, as he can make here, then we believe that it is right that he should inform Parliament so that Parliament may exercise its constitutional right of control over the Minister and may discuss whether the Minister acted correctly or incorrectly. We do not question the right of the Minister to take under certain circumstances a different decision to that of the Attorney-General. We do not therefore oppose the clause on those grounds, but when the Minister makes such a decision, we want him to report it to this House so that we may say not only that justice is being done, but also that it is in fact seen to be done. I think this is quite a reasonable proposal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>The Opposition wants the Minister to inform this House when he decides not to follow a recommendation by the Attorney-General. Let us look at an instance where the Attorney-General decides to prosecute a person and the Minister decides not to prosecute him. In such a case the Minister must advise this House of that decision, and if he wishes to inform the House fully, he must give details as to why he took this decision. Then the case of a person who is not being prosecuted must be set out clearly here in this House and before the public. In that case the amendment of the Opposition <span class="col_4765-4766" refersTo="page_0936"/>amounts to an invasion of the privacy of the individual, and for that reason we must reject it. But let us look at the other case, where the Minister decides to prosecute a person and where the Attorney-General has decided not to prosecute him. What is the position then&#x003F; Then the Minister must 14 days after he has taken the decision, and, we must assume, long before the case has come up in court, come to this House and provide it with details. What does that mean&#x003F; That means that at this stage, before the case has come up in court, the State must show its hand and play its cards, and this is prejudicial to the State. For that reason, too, this must therefore be rejected. No, this amendment cannot be accepted. If the amendment only meant that the Minister would only have to mention the name and say that he had reversed the decision of the Attorney-General in this case, and he only furnished the name and no details of why he had done so, then it would be meaningless. It would mean nothing, for then this House would not be able to express an opinion on whether the Minister acted correctly or incorrectly. Under the circumstances it is my submission that this amendment has no substance and that it should be rejected.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo started this hare running, if I may call it that, by introducing the opposition to this amendment from that side of the House. He did so, I suggest, on an entirely wrong premise. His argument was to the effect that we on this side of the House were proposing to remove this power of the Minister to use his discretion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>To qualify it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>That is precisely the point. That was his argument &#x2014;either to remove it or to qualify it. But that is not the case. We are not attempting to qualify the Minster&#x2019;s discretion. All that we are asking is that once the Minister has exercised his discretion, he should report it to Parliament. There is a very sound reason for this request. The hon. the Minister has time and again told us that he wishes to preserve; the discretion of the Attorneys-General and does not wish to interfere in their functions. This is a very sound approach. Therefore, if he does choose to exercise this power which subsection (5) gives him, it will obviously be in very special circumstances; and I believe that it is in the interest of everyone that where he does interfere in the discretion of an Attorney-General he should report it to Parliament. The hon. member for Pretoria Central said that this could be undesirable because it would mean that it could be possible to raise that particular matter in Parliament. It may be in the public interest that that matter should be raised in Parliament if the Minister has exercised his discretion against an Attorney-General. Parliament should have the right to debate matters of this sort. Obviously, if it is not in the public interest, if it is a matter which would be harmful to the particular individual without being in the public interest, then clearly it is a matter which would not be raised across the floor of the House. However, as a matter of principle we believe that in such cases it is important that Parliament should be informed. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will agree to this amendment. I emphasize that it does not curtail the Minister&#x2019;s powers in any way. It does not mean that he cannot exercise the discretion which this clause is giving him. It does not curtail that in any way. I therefore do urge the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban North knows the history of this particular provision as it has existed over the years. The position is that before 1917 everything was done in the name of the Minister. He therefore had full control and simply gave Attorneys-General instructions. That was the case until 1917. In 1917 the pendulum then swung right over to the other side. At that time Parliament placed the responsibility and the power to prosecute exclusively in the hands of the Attorneys-General. In 1926 Mr. Tielman Roos had the provision changed to read more or less as it reads now. His contention was that if power were left wholly in the hands of the Attorney-General, he would be responsible to no-one and no-one could call him to account. To balance the scales as nearly as possible, it was then decided and accepted that the Attorney-General would subsequently be subject to the control of the Minister. That was the position until 1925. Gen. Smuts was Minister of Justice at that time and he caused an amendment to be effected which, however, did not change the effect. One may therefore say that this provision <span class="col_4767-4768" refersTo="page_0937"/>has remained unchanged from 1926 up to the present time.</p>

<p>My contention is that I do not interfere with the activities of the Attorney-General. I have never done so, and I think I can also say this for my predecessor, because I do not know of one single case where the hon. the Prime Minister interfered when he was Minister of Justice. That is the general rule. However, I think it is wise for the Minister of Justice to have the ultimate control. Cases could arise where it would be necessary for the Minister to exercise control.</p>

<p>The question is asked why such cases are not tabled here or reported to Parliament so that the Minister may be called to account; he is, after all, accountable to Parliament. But that is just what is being done today. If there were ever a case where the Minister of Justice interfered, this would in fact be known. There is not the slightest doubt of that. One hon. member after another could then put questions to ascertain what was behind it, etc. The Minister is fully responsible. Such a case would also be raised during the discussion of the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. I therefore have a great deal of respect for the argument of the hon. member for Pretoria Central, i.e. that one could embarrass a person were his affairs to be discussed here before the case had come up in court, or, on the other hand, because it would not be brought before the court.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but I think that we must leave this provision as it has been all these years. It has worked well, and I do not think that there has been reason for complaint at any time. I think that the hon. the Opposition and the hon. member for Durban North, who broached the matter, should accept it this way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think this matter has been very fully canvassed, and all the views that could have been put have been put, but I am afraid that we still differ on this matter. I do not think one can say that it will be known. There is the possibility of rumours. I remember that a long time ago there were very strong rumours about a case, for example, that the Attorney-General in a treason trial issued a <i>nolle prosequi,</i> but nevertheless the Minister decided that the prosecution should proceed. One does not know whether that was so or not.</p>

<p>I do not know; I was not here. At any rate, the amendment cannot cause any difficulty to an accused person, because we have in this House the <i>sub judice</i> rule that one may not discuss anything which is the subject of a judicial decision. Therefore this amendment gives protection to the person concerned. I accept what the hon. the Minister has said, as did his predecessor, that they do not interfere with the attorneys-general and their decisions. But if they do, I am sure the hon. the Minister would concede, it would only be in the most serious circumstances, and such circumstances would be so serious that Parliament ought to know about them. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views differ from our views on this matter and so we will have our opposition recorded.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move, as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (b); and to omit all the words after &#x201C;pleaded&#x201D; in line 39 up to and including &#x201C;119(2)&#x201D; in line 42.</block>

<p>I would like to make it clear that in moving my amendment, I have followed the memorandum of the Bar Council very faithfully. It does not mean to say that I have in every case accepted what they proposed; but on the major clauses I have followed their arguments. Where I agree with them, I have notified amendments which I hope the hon. the Minister will find possible to accept. According to the arguments of the Bar Council, clause 6(b) of the Bill empowers the Attorney-General, after the accused has pleaded to a charge, to withdraw the charge without the accused being <span class="col_4769-4770" refersTo="page_0938"/>entitled to a verdict of acquittal. They go on to say that this provision is unwarranted and is in conflict with the accepted principle that once an accused person pleads he joins issue with the State and the case must proceed or he must be acquitted. I cannot see any reason why the hon. the Minister is amending this provision. It seems to me a just provision that once issue has been joined, the accused should be entitled to an acquittal. Otherwise it does appear if the case is simply withdrawn that he could be charged again with a similar offence or even perhaps with the same offence. I would like to move this amendment which puts the law back to what it was before the present Bill was brought to the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is in point of fact a tremendously important one. It contains a complete change with regard to the law as it stands and as we believe it ought to be. The clause should not be seen separately in a vacuum. It must be seen in the light of the provisions contained in clause 119 and in other clauses, in terms of which certain information may be obtained from the accused by way of interrogation by the court. The one is bound up with the other. One of the most fundamental objections we have to this has already been raised in our arguments, and that is that this is an inquisitorial system. Here the court will in point of fact be assisting the State in formulating a charge against the accused. In terms of this the court may, after the charge has been put to the accused, undertake this interrogation in order to extract certain admissions, etc., from the accused. This, of course, detracts enormously from the objectivity of the magistrate. Consequently I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 31, to omit &#x201C;other than&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;including&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The amendment I now seek to have effected will mean that although the charge may still be withdrawn after the accused has pleaded, it will not be possible to withdraw it after the interrogation has taken place. Otherwise it means that after the charge has been put to the accused and after certain admissions have been made to a particular charge, that charge may be withdrawn and those admissions may be used for drawing up another charge sheet against him and for charging him again without the State having any evidence. In actual fact the evidence for that has been provided by the accused. This is contrary to all legal principles in South Africa. It is for the State to prove that a person is guilty. It is the State&#x2019;s duty and the State&#x2019;s function to bring about a conviction. For that reason this is important. This is the most inquisitorial of all the elements. After all, the accused is interrogated for the purpose of seeing whether the State cannot find some evidence. As we say in English, this is &#x201C;a fishing expedition&#x201D; on which the State may go to see whether they can find anything in terms of which a person may be charged. That is what the provision in the Bill may be used for. Therefore I propose that if he has pleaded and those admissions have been extracted from him and the charge is subsequently withdrawn by the State, the accused must be acquitted on that charge.</p>

<p>I also want to say a few words with regard to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton. It is a fact that the Act at present does provide that an accused, after he has pleaded and the charge has been withdrawn, is entitled to a verdict of acquittal. That is so, but I do not believe that a very important principle is at stake here in that regard. From a practical point of view, it often happens that a person pleads to a charge and that certain circumstances only come to light afterwards. It may concern the technical nature of the charge and the technical evidence which may not have been available at that stage. It may also be a petty charge. One also finds the case of a transgression charge where the person is not immediately available or will possibly not be available for a few months. Now the case may be postponed and the person will perhaps have to be detained. Perhaps he is not in a position to obtain bail. This is the sort of charge which I refer to, where the person has already pleaded. If certain admissions have not been obtained from him, I do not believe that there will be anything wrong in withdrawing the charge, rather than causing the accused further inconvenience by awaiting trial, which will cause him to be in prison in the meantime. The charge can rather be withdrawn and the State may retain the right to charge him again. I cannot see that the accused will be prejudiced in any way if he has merely pleaded and the charge is subsequently withdrawn. It is an improvement. For that reason I say the amendment moved by this side of the House is a far better one. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that it is a reasonable <span class="col_4771-4772" refersTo="page_0939"/>amendment in the light of legal practice and our legal principles which have been established in the course of centuries.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think this side of the House will be prepared to accept either the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton or that moved by the hon. member for Florida. The hon. member for Florida is on the wrong track with regard to his reference to a &#x201C;fishing expedition&#x201D; and his assertion that the accused would allegedly have to assist the State in drawing up a charge sheet.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, let it be so. After all, the position is that the whole situation must be seen and read, as the hon. member remarked quite rightly, the context of the rest of the Bill, and particularly in the context of the procedure laid down in clauses 105, 119 and others. It is necessary for the State to be granted the opportunity of formulating its charge sheet properly. Consequently it is necessary for a procedure of this nature to be laid down. The present procedure provides that the charge may be withdrawn before the accused has pleaded. Then the case is abandoned. The present procedure also provides that the prosecutor may withdraw the charge after the accused has pleaded, that is prior to conviction. The only thing that is happening now in terms of the new procedure, is that the critical moment is being moved to the point before any evidence has been led. Now there are three stages&#x2014;i.e. the stage before the accused has pleaded; the stage before evidence has been led and then the final stage before conviction has taken place&#x2014;when proceedings may be halted and the accused may be acquitted. I think this procedure is necessary in the light of the provisions of clause 105. After all, the State should have the right, should it choose to do so, to withdraw its charge and, if need be, to change it. Otherwise the position will arise of the accused being entitled to total acquittal at that stage already. I do not believe that that is the idea. The position may also arise where a prosecutor may be hesitant to bring about any changes when he is faced by this situation. There is no real prejudicing whatsoever of the rights of the accused in this regard. In fact, it can only lead to a rapid settlement of the case. I want to contend that this is necessary, that it is a good procedure and that this clause should not be amended.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find the attitude of the hon. member for Ermelo disappointing to say the least of it. I go further and say that if this is going to be the attitude of the hon. the Minister then it will confirm our worst fears in regard to not only the effect of this legislation, but the intention of the Government in introducing the new procedure in terms of this Bill. I say this because the attitude of the hon. member for Ermelo&#x2014; which may also be the attitude of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;will do damage to the very principle of our law which Judge Botha was very careful to preserve, namely the two principles to which I referred especially in the Second Reading debate yesterday. Those principles are the right of the accused to silence at all times, and his right not to be in any way implicated either in assisting the State in proving its case or in showing his innocence. I would point out to the hon. the Minister that those are two fundamental elements of the basic principle of our law, that the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt rests upon the State, and Judge Botha has not at any stage in his report suggested that this should be altered in any way. On the contrary, as I pointed out during the debate yesterday, he went out of his way, I suggest, to emphasize the importance of preserving this principle without doing any damage to it. He said that an accused&#x2019;s right to silence at his trial would lose all meaning if he could be placed under pressure at a pre-trial interrogation to incriminate himself in respect of the offence charged. The same reasoning applies even where there is not the sort of pressure which there would have been under Judge Hiemstra&#x2019;s proposal. The same applies, in other words, if questions may be put to him. I concede, as the hon. member for Ermelo pointed out, that he is not obliged to reply to those questions. He may remain silent, but we pointed out in the Second Reading debate that the circumstances under which he will be brought before a magistrate and under which these questions will be put to him, may lead him, especially if he is illiterate and unrepresented&#x2014;and such persons will form the majority of those who will be brought before the magistrate&#x2014;to feel that he must give a reply to those questions. The effect of this clause is that after the accused has <span class="col_4773-4774" refersTo="page_0940"/>answered questions it will be possible for the State to withdraw the charge without giving any decision on the charge, as is required at the present time. At the present time, also, I would point out to the hon. member for Ermelo, an accused has the right to silence. He is not obliged to give any reply other than to say that he is guilty or not guilty. And yet, with the law as it stands at present, once the charge has been put to him, he is entitled to a verdict if the State chooses to withdraw the charge against him. In other words, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.</p>

<p>What is being sought under this clause is that, after the questioning has taken place, the State will be allowed to withdraw without giving the accused a verdict of acquittal. This can be seriously prejudicial to an accused person, because he may well give replies to these questions which will indicate that he is not guilty of the charge which has been put to him, but which may at the same time indicate that he is guilty of some other offence. This, as I have said, can be seriously prejudicial to an accused person. Surely the amendment which we suggest is perfectly fair under these circumstances. If in fact the State wishes to withdraw, then it must choose to withdraw before any questions are put to the accused. We do not agree with the hon. member for Ermelo that the critical stage of the new procedure is the stage before evidence is called. The critical stage is the stage before any questions whatsoever are put to an accused by a magistrate. Our amendment has the effect of giving the State the opportunity of withdrawing immediately after a plea, but before questioning. This the State does not have the right to do under the law as it stands at present. It does, however, provide that once questioning has taken place by the magistrate, the State shall then not be allowed to withdraw without giving the accused the benefit of a verdict of acquittal. I would urge the hon. the Minister to consider very carefully this amendment in the light of Judge Botha&#x2019;s findings throughout his report. I would emphasize that throughout his report his view was that no new procedure should be introduced which would in any way damage the fundamental principles upon which our law is based. With the greatest respect, if paragraph (b) is passed in its present form, it will undoubtedly do damage to these fundamental principles. I say this, even if one assumes that this is not an inquisitorial procedure. I am not arguing on that basis now, Sir. Even if one argues on the basis of the new procedure as was propounded by the hon. the Minister and that side of the House, it nevertheless involves some questioning by the magistrate in order to decide whether the accused understands the elements of the charge and intends his plea to be an admission of these elements. The magistrate may have to put elucidatory questions to an accused person. The hon. the Minister shakes his head, but this is so. The Minister must not think that all the magistrate can do is to put these questions to an accused person, to which that person then replies &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D;, and that that will then be the end of the matter. The accused may well not follow a question. He may say, &#x201C;I do not understand this. What happened was this.&#x201D; The magistrate may then have to put further questions to establish whether in fact the elements of the charge are clearly understood by the accused. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I first want to say that basically the amendment moved by the official Opposition and the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton amount to exactly the same thing. I think the only thing is that she is more consistent in that she proposes the deletion of the paragraph, whereas the Opposition&#x2019;s amendment will in fact have the same effect. Sir, the whole idea of the new system of pleading is to accelerate trials. When a person has been arrested, he has to be brought before a magistrate as soon as possible in order to make his plea, and if it cannot be done immediately, then as soon as possible afterwards. The effect of that will be that the accused may go free already on that first occasion when he pleads, if he can give a proper explanation to the court at that stage. He may go free after he has pleaded, but he first has to plead. Sir, if one retains the old system in terms of which the accused, after he has pleaded, is entitled to a verdict of guilty or not guilty, then one will find the position of the prosecutor being hesitant to allow the accused to plead as the prosecutor does not have all the information concerning the case at that stage. Under the old system the accused pleaded after the court had fully acquainted itself about the case; the Police had the dossier available and the prosecutor had prepared a comprehensive charge; the accused was entitled to obtain further details concerning the charge, and he then pleaded guilty or not guilty to the charge, <span class="col_4775-4776" refersTo="page_0941"/>and then the court was indeed bound to find him guilty or not guilty.</p>

<p>Sir, what is the effect of this provision&#x003F; The effect of this provision is no different from the present position, except that the accused is not entitled to a verdict of guilty or not guilty. If the State does not proceed with the case, the accused goes free in any event. But subsequently if the State finds, after a thorough investigation has been conducted, that a <i>prima facie</i> case may in fact be made out against the accused or that there is in fact sufficient evidence, the accused is summoned to appear before the court and the case proceeds. After all, Sir, we know what happens with some cases. I know, and the hon. member for Durban North knows&#x2014;although I am not so sure whether the hon. member for Florida knows this&#x2014;that there is another way one may go about this. One goes into the prosecutor&#x2019;s office and tells him; &#x201C;The accused is outside; are your witnesses here&#x003F;&#x201D; The prosecutor replies that his rool is very full and one then tells him that the accused will make a plea of guilty to a charge of assault if the case is tried immediately. The prosecutor then replies that his witnesses are not available and one then tells him that the accused will plead not guilty. If the accused has pleaded and has been found not guilty subsequently, he may then come along and raise a plea of <i>autrefois acquit</i>; in other words, he then goes completely free in a case where it will in fact have been possible to make out a case against him. One knows that such things have happened in the past and that it is possible that such things may happen. Sir, therefore this amendment is not acceptable, in view of the new set-up being created by this Act, because if the amendments proposed by the official Opposition and the hon. member for Houghton are to be accepted, we may as well leave the whole Criminal Procedure Act just as it stands today.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do hope that we will hear what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view is on this too. The argument of the hon. member for Waterkloof is that this has to deal with the situation when the accused comes along and pleads not guilty and then due to certain circumstances the prosecutor suddenly finds that his witnesses are not there. Well, that situation is met by the amendment moved by the hon. member for Florida, because that amendment says you may withdraw after a plea and you may then recharge him but you may not do so if either evidence has been led or the man has been interrogated by the magistrate and has given what in effect is evidence. That is the whole point. The hon. the Minister concedes in this Bill that you should not withdraw after evidence. Now, what is this quizzing process&#x003F; What happens&#x003F; He is asked questions and the answers to those questions form part of the record. They are evidence. In fact, it is incontrovertible evidence. It cannot be controverted unless he can show that it was incorrectly recorded. So the effect of the amendment of the hon. member for Florida means in effect before any evidence has been given. After evidence has been given you may not withdraw. That is the one point. I was attempting to indicate that the answers to the questions become evidence, incontrovertible evidence. But now there is the matter of asking the accused questions. It is the function of the Police to interrogate an accused. They are entitled to interrogate an accused and they always do it, and the accused has certain rights. But the difficulty here is this. The principle existing now is that once you have pleaded you are entitled to a verdict of guilty or not guilty, whether or not evidence is led, because you have been put in jeopardy by having to plead to the charge where the issue is joined. But we agreed that in fact there are circumstances, such as the hon. member for Florida described, where it is difficult in practice to say that once he has pleaded he is entitled later, if there is no evidence available, to a verdict of <i>autrefois acquit.</i> Bui that is as far as we go. Then we say that if there is any evidence then he is in fact in jeopardy. He is in jeopardy without any evidence but he is in jeopardy if there was evidence. The whole object of this interrogation is to make the accused say something as quickly as possible, something which is in the nature of evidence and which, it is hoped, is detrimental to his case, or shall we say, that it will complement the State&#x2019;s case in as much as they will not have to call evidence to prove the admissions that they got from the accused. Listening now to the argument of the hon. member for Ermelo and of the hon. member for Waterkloof, I am beginning to wonder for what purpose this is going to be used. It is now becoming apparent that this is required not for the purposes stated by the hon. member for Waterkloof, but for the purpose of using this in effect as a weapon of Police interrogation of an accused. Because what do they do&#x003F; This is going to be the policeman&#x2019;s <span class="col_4777-4778" refersTo="page_0942"/>dream, the investigating officer&#x2019;s dream. He is going to say: &#x201C;Well, I have to investigate this case but I am not going to traipse 20 miles out to do this, that and the other. This fellow knows it. I have interrogated him and I know very well he knows it and I have to get that evidence.&#x201D; Then he is going to say: &#x201C;I do not have the evidence in my docket and I am not going to be bothered anymore, so let us have a go; let us call this fellow and put him in court and charge him&#x201D; and then he will have to go through the quizzing process, the interrogation by the magistrate in terms of section 119.</p>

<p>I say the effect of these two amendments are exactly the same. Moreover, it is a fact that if we were to accept these amendments, clause 119 would be completely emasculated. Clause 119 would be completely emasculated, and all the arguments advanced in favour of clause 119 during the Second Reading debate, would have been advanced to no avail, in which case we might as well revert to the old system. But I see it from this point of view: In future a plea of &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D; will not stand on its own. These additional questions will be asked to clarify the plea. Only after that has been done, will there in fact be a plea. If a person is prepared to admit a certain thing in a particular plea, why will he not be prepared to do it in another case as well&#x003F; Is there any good reason why, if a person is prepared to make an admission on one occasion, he will not be prepared to make an admission on another occasion&#x003F; To me it is only logical that if one has replied &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to one question, one will give the same reply to a similar question in another case.</p>

<p>The hon. member was concerned about the ignorant, illiterate people who may appear in our courts. But I can tell him now that I, as the Minister of Justice, am quite satisfied that such people who appear in our magistrates&#x2019; courts, are safe in the hands of the court itself. The court takes pains to put the procedure as clearly as possible to such a person and to explain it to him. Of course, the court will not put all sorts of ideas into his head to let him go free, but the accused is perfectly safe in the hands of the court. I am not concerned about that. My objection to these amendments is that if we accept the one or the other, we may just as well delete clause 119 as well and abandon the procedure on which we have already decided in principle.</p>

He defended his attitude in preferring the clause to remain as it is and in not accepting the amendment; but he gave no valid reason for changing a provision which he as a legal man should know is virtually an institution in law, not only in this country, but in most civilized countries of the world. It is virtually an institution that once a man has pleaded, the charge must be presented to him, or he is entitled to acquittal.</p>

<p>No, no. We have endeavoured here to meet to some extent the position put by the Minister, taking into consideration the danger that arises because of the application of clause 119(2), and because, in fact, it goes much further. Assuming we were to accept the Minister&#x2019;s viewpoint, that when the accused has pleaded the charge may be withdrawn, this provision goes even further. It virtually places the accused in jeopardy, and certainly completely vitiates the arguments put up by the hon. member for Pretoria Central and others; because not only has the accused pleaded and not only does the clause provide that no evidence be led, but it even goes further and by implication virtually places the accused in the position where, the case having been withdrawn, there is nevertheless on record certain facts that he has mentioned around which it will be possible thereafter to build up a case, since that is the purpose of the withdrawal. The situation is this: The reason for withdrawing a case could only be the fact that the State has not prepared a case on the strength of which the prosecutor or the Attorney-General is prepared to proceed against the accused. Having discovered that, and despite the factors disclosed by the interrogation under clause 119(2), he then withdraws his case. But in the meantime he has had every opportunity to place the accused in jeopardy.</p>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Florida meets the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude because of a principle which the Bill now incorporates, although we do not agree with it, to the extent that if the accused does plead and the prosecutor wants to withdraw the charge, there should be no evidence of any nature whatsoever. &#x201C;Evidence&#x201D; is not only the evidence given by a witness, but also the evidence which is given as a result of the interrogation provided for by clause 119(2). You cannot have it both ways. The hon. the Minister wants it both ways. In the one case he cannot present evidence because he has not got enough evidence to convict the accused. He then withdraws the case. But he has certain other statements made by the accused, wittingly or unwittingly, possibly even without the opportunity of having been able to obtain legal advice. In thousands of cases, as the hon. the Minister will know, may persons be too poor to even contemplate getting legal advice on certain technical issues. The case is then withdrawn, further investigations take place, further witnesses are sought, to eventually bring the accused to court again. This the hon. the Minister says will save time, staff and expenses. I think the exact opposite is true. I think we have been generous in meeting the hon. the Minister by the simple amendment which we have moved. I would prefer to see the thing restored to what it was.</p>

<p>I now speak for myself as a man who has been in practice for I think almost as long as the Minister. Forty-five years is a fair period of practice and perhaps a little longer than the age of the hon. member for Pretoria Central. If we go to the extent of meeting the hon. the Minister halfway, I do not think he should dig his toes in. We are not here to win points. After all the hon. the Minister is a trained lawyer. We are trying to meet him by accepting to some extent what he wants, provided that not only no evidence is led but that nothing is recorded in respect of the alleged accused who at that stage is completely innocent. No case has yet been proved against him. In those circumstances I think the hon. the Minister should meet us on this particular amendment. I think it is a fair request and it indicates the desire to ensure that the accused is not placed in jeopardy or that he should have any apprehension in his own mind. While I agree that we should avoid guilty people escaping the law, we should also respect the rights of the citizens and ensure that until a case is proved against a person or a proper charge is brought against him he should not in any way be prejudiced. This amendment helps the hon. the Minister to bring that about.</p>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Jeppes actually supports the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton. He stated this clearly. Although he referred to an old institution of our law which was supposedly being tampered with, the hon. member for Jeppes&#x2019;s own United Party is now accepting that the situation must be changed. Mr. Chairman, with a view to clarity may I just cross swords with the hon. member for Durban North about one important aspect, i.e. that about the presumption that a person is innocent. It is an old established principle of our law that when a person is brought before the courts they shall, for the purposes of the onus of proof which rests with the State, accept that that person is innocent until he is proved to be guilty <span class="col_4783-4784" refersTo="page_0945"/>by the State. In other words, there is a presumption, for the purposes of the onus of proof, that a person is innocent. It is a presumption that rests with the court. But we are also dealing with a factual situation. Apart from the operation of a legal presumption, the factual situation is such that an offence has been committed, i.e. goods have been stolen, a person has been murdered, someone has been violated, an offence has been committed and someone has committed that offence. If we now accept as a fact that a person is not guilty, the State will not be able to bring a person before the courts. It will consequently never be able to have any confidence in its case. But when the State brings a person before the courts, it must believe that that person is guilty, otherwise it would not bring him before the courts. So much for the facts, and that has nothing to do with the legal presumptions resting with the courts.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the hon. member for Durban North to ask himself whether any person is adversely affected if this clause remains as it is, and the accused has given certain facts to the court. Even if those facts could afterwards count against the accused, it does not mean that the accused is being adversely affected by them. He cannot be adversely affected in the sense that he is found guilty although he is not guilty. He could perhaps now be found guilty, whereas he would previously have been found not guilty even though he was, in fact, guilty. Then we have a prejudicing of rights. Then we have a prejudicing of the rights of the community. Then we have a prejudicing of the rights of the person who was robbed, murdered or violated. But if the hon. member is arguing that a person who is not guilty can be found guilty, then he has an argument. The hon. member says that such a possibility exits, but he mentions no examples. He is not using any real arguments at all. I do not believe the hon. member is being serious with that argument. We must, in fact, try, in the case of a person who is guilty, to phrase the law of criminal procedure in such a way that that person will be found guilty.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North said that we were dealing here with a policeman&#x2019;s dream. If he cannot prove a particular fact, he can bring the person before the magistrate. That person could admit to a particular fact and then it would not be necessary for him to obtain that evidence. Who is being prejudiced&#x003F; Suppose what he says is true. Who is being prejudiced&#x003F; Let us also state another principle very clearly. There is nothing in our law to the effect that an accused may not assist in establishing his own guilt. A person is arrested. He is questioned and furnishes certain explanations to the police which enable them to investigate those explanations. That is the position today. Points of difference often crop up in respect of what he said to the police. Now we have more legal security. The case is heard in open court. Everything he says there is very clear. Now we have more legal security than if he were only to speak to a policeman and differences crop up later about what he really was supposed to have said. Why are hon. members so afraid that an accused could supply particulars that could lead to his being found guilty&#x003F;</p>

<p>The question refers to the question of prejudice. However, the hon. member does not want to see it from the point of view of possible prejudice to the community. There are definite benefits involved in this. It will not be necessary for Brig. Von Keyserlingk or some or other policeman to travel far into the bundu to go and look for evidence. The hon. member for Umlazi told us how difficult it sometimes is to get hold of the evidence. A great deal of time is being saved in this manner and the proceedings are shortened. It could happen that this clause could result in cases now coming before the courts very much more quickly. Instead of it taking a month for the State to prepare its case and find the evidence, it can now take a day or two. In summation it can be said that no prejudice whatsoever can result from this as far as the accused is concerned. Seen from the point of view of what is the truth, and seen from the point of view of law and justice triumphing, there will be no prejudice whatsoever. That is the course we ought to adopt.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that hon. member has now let the cat out of the bag. If the hon. the Minister does not repudiate what he has just said, then the country will be entitled to assume that it will be used for the purposes which we suspected it might be used for. The hon. gentleman has just said that at the moment <span class="col_4785-4786" refersTo="page_0946"/>the police have the right to interrogate persons who are suspect. Then he says that this will give the whole thing more &#x201C;regsekerheid&#x201D;. This is now being done in front of a magistrate or the magistrate himself does it. What he in effect is saying is that that is the purpose for which this will be used, namely to interrogate a suspect. He will be interrogated in court where the evidence that he gives will be used against him. Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has to answer this question: What is he in fact after with this provision&#x003F; Take the practical application of it. When do you bring a man before the court and ask him to plead&#x003F; You only bring him before the court, you only call his case and ask him to plead when you are about to proceed against him.

<p>I want to say something else. I want to say that it is speeches such as we have heard this morning in this Committee from hon. gentlemen over there which will invite everybody who comes before the court to ensure that the new system does not work.

Let us all, when we go to court, just shut up.&#x201D; That will be the general practice. The whole system proposed in this Bill will break down if that is done.

<p>Mr. Chairman, if that is the interpretation being given to this clause, i.e. that the questioning which the Police normally do will be done by the courts, then that interpretation is wrong. If the hon. member for Pretoria Central said that, then it is wrong. However, I doubt that. If questioning takes place, it is only in respect of the elements of the charge, and nothing more. Questioning only takes place in respect of the elements of the charge: &#x201C;Did you do it&#x003F; Did you want to do it&#x003F; What excuse do you have&#x003F;&#x201D; Nothing more is asked. No evidence at all is taken from the person. An attempt is only made to obtain clarification of the plea, whether it be guilty or not guilty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that in his previous reply the hon. the Minister already gave an indication that gives rise to our greatest fears being realized, because he said that if we now brought about this change we would weaken clause 119, and that we could then just as well relinquish the new procedure. In other words, we can forget completely about the arguments advanced to the effect that the new procedure was introduced merely to clarify differences between the State and the accused, so that the duration of the case can be curtailed. That is not why the procedure was introduced. It was introduced for this purpose, so that they could first question a person and then charge him. That is why it was introduced, and this was confirmed by the hon. the Minister and that is exactly what we do not want.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria Central says there can be no prejudice, but of course there can, for the simple reason that when the questioning takes place the accused will not understand all the implications of the questions put to him if he does not have a legal representative. Take, for example the case where it is alleged that a person has shot someone. The magistrate then asks him: Did you shoot the person&#x003F; It is a simple question. The person may be under the impression that he shot that person, and he then says: &#x201C;Yes, I shot him&#x201D;. You will remember, Sir, that there was a famous case that took place in the thirties. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the case. A group of people went hunting and while they were shooting there, the one person took a shot and one of the bearers fell down dead. As I said, there were a lot of hunters, but that person was under the impression that he had shot the bearer. By means of careful research it was established, however, that it was not his bullet that had struck the bearer, but someone else&#x2019;s. Who it was they could not determine.</p>

The State does not have to prove whether it was his bullet that struck the person or not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Suppose he had confessed to having shot him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>The only test is: What does the objective evidence indicate&#x003F; Even if he had made a confession, it must still be proved by <i>aliunde</i> evidence. Under this procedure, however, there is no chance of that. The police would not even gather the necessary evidence together to try to prove that case. And if a person says he did, in fact, shoot someone, while there is, for example, the defence of <i>aber-ratio ictus</i> which he can use and which he does not know of&#x003F; How is he to know about that&#x003F; And even if he did know it, there is still the question of <i>dolus eventualis,</i> which he could let himself in for because he does not realize the implications of that when he replies. Who is going to explain that to <span class="col_4789-4790" refersTo="page_0948"/>him&#x003F; Of course there is prejudice as far as such an accused is concerned. The point I want to make is that even when a person is innocent in the objective sense of the word, there could be circumstantial evidence surrounding him, the implications of which he does not know of, and which he does not understand for the purposes of his defence. In an inquiry such as this he can therefore be compelled to make statements which he should never have made, and which then frees the State of the burden of proving those statements objectively. If the State were to have to prove them objectively, it would possibly not be able to do so because that person is, in actual fact, innocent. That is the point, and therefore I find it so extremely lamentable that we now have this position. The hon. the Minister says the whole object of the new procedure is merely to question the accused in advance and then withdraw the case. The argument which the hon. member for Ermelo used is therefore completely incorrect. He said the procedure was being introduced to ensure that the charge sheet would be correct and that nothing was wrong with it. That was the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. But the hon. member should know that in terms of clause 86 the prosecutor may, at any stage of the trial, apply to amend the charge sheet, and the court may grant this if it wishes to do so. In addition, in terms of clause 88 of this Bill any defect in the charge can be corrected by the evidence that is led. It is thereby cured. This clause is consequently unnecessary to ensure that there is no technical fault as far as the charge sheet is concerned, thereby to save time. No, Sir, it is there to catch the accused out. It can, as I have indicated, result in an innocent person in actual fact being found guilty by the circumstantial evidence, the implications of which he does not realize, because it relieves the state of the burden of still having to prove those facts objectively. Sir, under those circumstances I must say that our objection to this particular provision has become that much more vehement because the cat has not been let out of the bag, as the hon. member for Durban North said; we now know exactly what this whole thing is all about. It has nothing to do with the arguments which hon. members on that side raised here in the Second Reading Debate.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in the first place I have been authorized by the hon. member for Pretoria Central to categorically deny that he tried to imply that he sees the procedure under clause 119(2) as a substitute for police investigation or police questioning. Sir, in addition I want to state very frankly to the Opposition that we are engaged in a futile debate because they have not mastered this Bill. If the hon. member for Florida would give me his attention and not be so smug, I should like to ask him whether he is aware of the provisions of clauses 117 and 118, which are not under discussion at present, because if that hon. member were aware of the provisions of those clauses, he would not have used the absurd example of the person who was shot in the bushveld. In the second place, Sir, if that hon. member were aware of the elements of a murder charge, which he apparently has in mind, he would be aware that the magistrate must also ask the accused, in terms of clause 119(2): &#x201C;Was it your intention to shoot that person&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>The accused&#x2019;s answer to the effect that it was not his intention, will have to be recorded. In other words, the absurd consequences which the hon. member for Florida was trying to deduce from this, disappear. Sir, the hon. member for Musgrave interpreted this amendment hopelessly incorrectly. He and the hon. member for Jeppes do not agree with the hon. member for Ermelo who said that the <i>moment critique</i> is not being shifted. But, Sir, they do not touch on paragraph (c). The hon. member for Houghton is consistent; she also wants to delete paragraph (c). In other words, she wants to shift the <i>moment critique</i> when the accused appears before the judge, the person who passes sentence. She wants to remove this altogether and she is consistent. But hon. members of the official Opposition accept that the <i>moment critique</i> is now being shifted to a certain point. Sir, I say again that those hon. members have not read the Bill. To what point is the <i>moment critique</i> being shifted&#x003F; It is being shifted to the point laid down in clause 150(1), i.e. to the point at which evidence is furnished. Sir, that is the effect. Let us look at the additional effect of the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s amendment. The only effect it has is that the proceedings, which are being provided in terms of clause 6(b), are then <i>pro non scripto</i> or <i>non est.</i> That is the <span class="col_4791-4792" refersTo="page_0949"/>only effect their amendment has. In other words, the point on which we must enter upon a debate with the Opposition is whether those notes which the magistrate will take down in terms of clause 119(3), will form a part of the ensuing proceedings. I now ask the Opposition: If the proceedings under 6(b) are <i>non est,</i> if they do not exist, what does this mean&#x003F; It means consequently that that person who has been charged can again stand trial on the same charge on another occasion, and what is then wrong with those things he said to the magistrate continuing to stand as part of the records&#x003F; What is wrong with that if he is appearing on the same charge, as the hon. member for Jeppes argued&#x003F; Secondly, suppose the accused is arraigned on another charge, what is the effect of the amendment then&#x003F; The effect of the amendment is then that the minutes under 119(3) cannot be used. Sir, what is then actually the effect of the amendment of the official Opposition&#x003F; They want to detract from the total essence of the principles of <i>autrefois acquit;</i> i.e. where a person was possibly &#x201C;in jeopardy&#x201D; in terms of offence A as hon. members on that side put it, they also want to create the possibility of his then being able to offer that plea in terms of offence B, on which he was not charged. I argue with the Opposition on that basis, i.e. that you have not taken those principles into account. In other words, the conclusion is that the Opposition cannot argue with us further about these clauses. By leaving clause 6(c) as it is, they have actually accepted the basic principle of the shifting of the critical moment, which is a completely new approach, as I have said, and which we are introducing with the intention, according to clause 119, of allowing this totally new procedure to succeed.</p>

Is not that the point&#x003F; Of course that is the point. It will not be necessary to lead evidence before the magistrate is entitled to convict.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say to the hon. the Minister and to this House that we are now dealing with legislation which is going to affect every single citizen. It is a Bill in respect of which it is particularly important that it has the respect of the public and the public will not have the respect which it ought to have if the Government is going to deal with amendments which we propose in the way in which the amendments have been dealt with up to now in this Committee Stage. I believe that what we should be trying to do&#x2014;both the Government and this side of the House&#x2014; is to try to get a Bill which will be as good as possible; not a Bill which is going to assist the State to the prejudice of the accused, or assist the accused to the prejudice of the State, but a Bill which will try to achieve the best possible balance between the interests of both sections. It is no good trying to argue that by moving our amendments we are simply trying to assist the defence, because that is not the case. What we are trying to do is to achieve a reasonable balance between the two conflicting interests. We say that in regard to clause 6(b), it is grossly unfair, once the trial has started and the questions have <span class="col_4795-4796" refersTo="page_0951"/>been put to the accused, that the State should be entitled to withdraw the charge in respect of which the questions were put to and answered by the accused, and then charge him with another offence.

<p>If they acknowledge that by this proposed amendment they accept that principle, all their arguments fall away, and we must just continue arguing about one point, i.e. what the effect will be of clause 6(b) if the amendment, which we do not accept, were to be accepted. We say that if their amendment is accepted it would result in the proceedings in terms of clause 119(2) being <i>non est.</i> If the clause remains as it is, the proceedings in terms of clause 119(2), read in conjunction with clause 119(3)&#x2014;&#x2014;let us now be specific&#x2014;will not be <i>non est.</i> That is the point.</p>

<p>So when the charges are put to him, or the indictment in the Supreme Court, the trial begins. The accused either says &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D; or &#x201C;guilty&#x201D;, and the magistrate then asks him all those questions. The hon. the Minister says that he agrees with Mr. Justice Botha who said that an accused&#x2019;s right to silence at his trial would lose all meaning if he could be placed under pressure at a pre-trial interrogation to incriminate himself in respect of the offence charged. This is part of the trial. At the trial he is invited to incriminate himself. He is not told at the trial that he has the right to silence. Under the proceedings at the trial that is envisaged here, Mr. Justice Botha&#x2019;s recommendations, his thoughts on the subject, are not being honoured; in fact they are being denied.</p>

What then is the provision in clause 119&#x003F; When the accused pleads &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D;&#x2014;he has a right to silence&#x2014;the way in which the Bill ensures that he maintains his right of silence is that the magistrate &#x201C;shall&#x201D;, in other words, he is obliged to ask the accused &#x201C;whether he wishes to tender any explanation <span class="col_4797-4798" refersTo="page_0952"/>of his attitude in relation to the charge&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In other words, he has a right of silence but the magistrate is obliged to ask him whether he wants to tender any explanation of his attitude in relation to the charge.</p>

<p>That is not all. Just to ensure that he has a right of silence, he is asked, if he does not wish to tender an explanation, to make &#x201C;any statement indicating the basis of his defence&#x201D;. Then, just to make quite sure that his right of silence is protected, by this Bill, he is then asked&#x2014;this is incredible!&#x2014;&#x201C;whether he wishes to say anything else in relation to the charge for the information of the magistrate or the trial court&#x201D;. This is in addition to what has gone before. He is then also asked whether he made any statement under duress. That is his right of silence! What is more, the measure goes further and every question the prosecutor wants put to him, at that stage before the prosecutor has led any evidence, the magistrate is obliged to put to the accused. If the prosecutor goes through his docket and points out the issues on which there is going to be a trial, those issues are all put to him.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>What absolute nonsense this is! It comes right back to this: We concede that it may be illusory to say that, when you are called upon to plead; you are in jeopardy although no evidence is led. We can go so far as to say that, when you plead to a charge, that charge may be withdrawn before evidence is led. That may be done for practical reasons, because you are not really in jeopardy at that stage. However, the Bill concedes that you are in jeopardy once evidence is led. The hon. the Minister will concede that the object of this operation is to hasten proceedings so that it will become unnecessary, where the accused makes submissions, to call evidence in respect of the facts to which the accused admits. Is that not also correct&#x003F; Now the hon. the Minister is silent. What I have said is therefore also correct. Therefore, unless our amendment is accepted, you have the situation that this procedure will be used as a police interrogation at what looks like being his trial. Why else is the law changed in this regard&#x003F; The hon. the Minister has not yet answered that question. Why is the existing law now changed&#x003F; It is not being changed for the practical reasons given by the hon. member for Florida, namely that there are practical considerations where one takes a plea and is obliged to withdraw because you cannot go on with the case&#x2014;it is not that. Therefore, what is the reason&#x003F; The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s duty to this Committee is to tell us. We have had about four explanations from the hon. gentlemen who sit on that side, but it is that hon. Minister&#x2019;s duty to this Committee to tell us what was the motivation behind. &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member did not reply to one single argument of this side of the House. If that is the way we are going to conduct this debate, it is going to be futile, because we on this side of the House are doing our best to match up the arguments of that side of the House with arguments. We therefore want to make a friendly request to them to answer arguments that are raised on this side of the House, as we have answered arguments item for item that have so far come from that side of the House. So far those hon. members have not tried to do so.</p>

<p>I just want to try to give the House an impression of the way in which this hon. member has presented things to us in this House that can be misleading. For example, in terms of clause 119(2) the magistrate may, if he judges that the trial will take place in a magistrate&#x2019;s court, ask additional questions. Until we cornered the hon. members, they objected to what might come to light after the magistrate passed on to the proceedings prescribed by clause 119(2). But when we unmasked that hon. member by showing him that the magistrate would be compelled to ask about all the elements of an offence, they ran away. Now they have come back to a completely innocent clause like 119(1). I just want to ask the hon. member whether he is aware of the decision in <i>Rex V. Komo,</i> 1947 (2), p. 511. In that case it was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For instance, the Attorney-General may accept a plea of guilty for any other offence of which the accused might be convicted and the court has no power to prevent it, but once the accused has pleaded not guilty the position changes.</block>

<p>At that stage the two parties, the prosecution and the defence, have placed the case in the hands of the judge. He must then give his decision.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>They joined issue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>They joined issue. What is now happening, in fact, is that we are shifting forward the moment when the case is placed in the hands of the judge. We say that the moment evidence is led the accused is exposed to the danger of a decision from the judge. Why do we say this&#x003F; The prosecutor, the Attorney-General, will begin to lead evidence in terms of clause 50. He will lead only one witness. Then the judge can give a decision or, in the case of a magistrate, if no evidence is led that is necessary for the ruling, i.e. <i>aliunde</i> evidence, i.e. merely on the admission of the accused, the accused would be in danger if the case were then to be placed in the hands of the trial magistrate or the judge. That is the new model. Prior to that, however, he is not exposed to the danger of a decision. That is what hon. members cannot understand. What we are actually doing in clause 6(c) is to amend decisions such as those in <i>Rex v. Komo</i> and to shift the moment when the case is placed in the hands of the judge, the trial magistrate or the trial judge for adjudication, and that is what the hon. members do not understand. The moment they understand that, we can argue meaningfully.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that they have been arguing here for days about the maintenance of the accusatorial system. If they understand the principle of the accusatorial system, i.e. the two parties who are joined and may then submit their case to the trial judge for his decision, they would have no problem with this clause either. I want to suggest that they go back and first analyse these principles.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, will you allow me just to reply to that hon. member, because he suggested, that we did not understand the import of this new procedure. I should like to explain to that hon. member and to the House that this is entirely incorrect, because the trial has started when the evidence has been delivered. The accused is prejudiced from the moment that he replies to the questions put to him by the magistrate, because the answers that he gives to those questions may be used in order to convict him. It may be quite unnecessary, because of his answers, to lead any further evidence. This is the way in which the system is to be shortened. After all, if the hon. member does not agree with this I should like to point out to him that in the very clause we are dealing with, namely clause 6(b), those admissions made are described as evidence, because it is stated here that the Attorney-General may at any time after an accused has pleaded to a charge and before any evidence, other than admissions by the accused recorded in terms of paragraph (b) of section 119(2), has been led in respect of that charge &#x2026; So precisely in the clause we are dealing with those admissions are described as evidence. And therefore Mr. Chairman, how can that side of the House argue that the accused is not prejudiced while he is answering these questions&#x003F; This proves to us beyond any doubt that whatever Judge Botha intends by the procedure he recommends, that side of the House intends it to be an inquisitorial procedure which will enable the State in certain cases to elicit evidence on one charge and to convict an accused on an entirely different charge. In addition they may lay another charge against the accused and convict him of that. In view of this the Government cannot blame anyone else but itself if we or, for that matter, anyone in this country describe this procedure as inquisitorial and as going completely against the fundamental principle of our law, namely that the onus rests throughout upon the State to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt. There can be no doubt in the light of the statements made by the hon. the Minister and hon. members on that side of the House, that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention that this principle should be diverted from in certain cases. In other words, in order to make myself perfectly clear, it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to use this procedure to convict an accused. We will certainly not be a party to this procedure. The Government must rest assured that if this Bill is placed on the Statute Book it will be dubbed as the Government&#x2019;s inquisitorial criminal procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if you will permit me I just want to state very clearly that the charge which the hon. member for Durban North brought against me, i.e. that the object of this clause is to replace police questioning, is far-fetched. I definitely did not say anything like that. Such a thing can definitely not be read into the Bill either. I just want to state very clearly that the hon. member is very definitely wide of the mark here.</p>

<p>With reference to the argument of the hon. member for Durban North, I want to say that he was completely wrong in referring to clause 119 and the questions the magistrate will ask in terms of the said clause. That is indeed not what is being referred to in clause 6. Clause 6 refers only to admissions recorded with the specific permission of the accused himself. That is all that is being referred to. It cannot possibly replace police questioning. The hon. member is completely on the wrong track.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 22, page 12, to omit &#x201C;weeks&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This clause deals with private prosecutions on certificates of <i>nolle prosequi,</i> by Attorneys-General and it provides in subsection (2)(c) that such a certificate shall lapse unless proceedings in respect of the offence in question are instituted by the issue of the process referred to in subsection (1)(a) within six weeks of the date of the certificate.</p>

<p>We feel that a period of six weeks is too short. There may be difficulties in issuing the process within so short a period of time, bearing in mind that it may be necessary for the person instituting the private prosecution to obtain documents which were previously in the hands of the State. He may have to study these documents. It may also be a complicated case where it could take some considerable time to prepare the document which will be the institution of the process. If it was a simple summons six weeks would not be too short a time, but in matters of this sort one can imagine the complicated state of affairs arising from a complicated company fraud, perhaps, in which the State may feel that there is not a sufficient case against the person concerned. In such a case it could take the private prosecutor some time to prepare the summons which will be the institution of the process. Therefore I would ask the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment which provides that the period shall be a period of six months.</p>

<p>I submit that that is not an unreasonably long period within which to keep the possible accused in suspense. Obviously one wishes to have proceedings dealt with within the shortest time possible, but at the same time one should not prejudice a person wishing to institute a private prosecution. That process of law should be retained in our system as it is being retained in terms of this clause, but at the same time it should not be made unduly difficult by making the period for the institution of the process unduly short.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I suggest that the clause as it stands at present is not unreasonable. One must take into account the fact that in most cases&#x2014;I say in most cases, because I know that there will be exceptions&#x2014;where such a private prosecution is in question, the person who wants to institute it will be the original complainant. He will therefore have been in possession of most if not all of the facts of the case for a long time and after the State had refused to prosecute, he could then get his documents in order within that minimum period of six weeks.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was unable to complete my argument before the House adjourned for lunch. I would like to complete it now. The fact that the Opposition also agrees now that the period of 20 years must be reduced to six months, according to their amendment, proves that in principle they are in favour of a substantial reduction of the period. I mention a period of 20 years, because this is the period after which a crime becomes prescribed under the present situation. In effect, one had 20 years, from the time the crime was committed, to make application for a certificate to prosecute. He had that period of 20 years, and the Opposition are now themselves saying that the period should be reduced to six months.</p>

<p>Before the adjournment I also pointed out that in most cases it would be the complainant himself who would continue with an application for a private prosecution if the Attorney-General refused to prosecute. <span class="col_4807-4808" refersTo="page_0957"/>But, Sir, there is the exception where a curator or an executor suddenly comes into the picture and has to make the application. It may happen that he would not then have the time to study the whole matter, but it is precisely in regard to these cases that I do not understand the Opposition&#x2019;s problem, because immediate application for that certificate need not be made. The matter may be studied completely before application is made for the certificate, and then a period of six weeks still remains. Even then I think that, in terms of clause 168, application could be made for an adjournment, just as the State may ordinarily apply for an adjournment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is something I would like to point out to the hon. member for Kroonstad and to the House. Whilst the hon. member is correct that in most cases the man who will be seeking to bring the private prosecution will be the complainant, and that he will be in possession of the facts as such, he will generally be a layman. He will wish, in most cases, to seek legal advice and legal representation to draw up the process by which the proceedings will be instituted. It will take time for any legal representative to assimilate the facts, to assess the nature of the charge and to frame it. In view of this we consider that the period of six weeks is too short.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member has already made that point. I do not want repetition.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am replying to the argument which the hon. member for Kroonstad used in justification of the period of six weeks being retained. I pointed out earlier that it could be a complicated case. I do not wish to elaborate on that because I have already dealt with that point. It could be a complicated case which could require a good deal of investigation before the institution of the process. The hon. member for Kroonstad pointed out that the person wishing to bring the private prosecution need not apply immediately, but could prepare himself and then apply. He said that he would then have six weeks from that time. This might sound quite reasonable in theory but in practice no man is going to involve himself in the expense of approaching a legal representative to assist him in instituting a process unless he knows that he is able to get the <i>nolle prosequi</i> certificate from the Attorney-General; so that in practice no person who wishes to bring a private prosecution is going to be able to commence with his process until such time as he has a certificate. Therefore the period is a short one. The hon. the Minister laughs; he seems to think &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what I wish to emphasize is that the procedure of a private prosecution is a procedure which in the interests of citizens should be retained in a form which will make it reasonably possible for them to exercise this procedure. If the period from the date upon which the certificate is issued by the Attorney-General is made unreasonably short, then it nullifies the benefit and the effect of having such a procedure. It will mean in practice that persons who wish to avail themselves of this procedure will not have sufficient time in which to do so. Therefore they will not be able to avail <span class="col_4809-4810" refersTo="page_0958"/>themselves of this procedure. I cannot see what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty is. The hon. member for Kroonstad pointed out that under the present law a period of 20 years exists for this purpose. I hope he is right: I have not checked that. He says that a private prosecution could be brought within 20 years of the issue of a certificate by the Attorney-General. Well, we concede that this is an unreasonably long period. We concede that it is in the interests of justice that a maximum period should be laid down. The only question is whether the period as suggested in this Bill is reasonable. We submit that a period of six weeks is totally unreasonable; it is far too short a period, because the majority of persons who would wish to avail themselves of this procedure would necessarily have to seek legal advice. If the case happens to be specially complicated, it could take a legal representative a period of time in excess of six weeks within which to prepare the process. We submit that a period of six months is perfectly reasonable, and therefore we ask the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Musgrave was getting so hot under the collar that one could not even smile, or do anything without him coming down on one. There is a very simple explanation for this matter. The person who institutes a private prosecution, may ascertain from the Attorney-General whether he is going to prosecute or not. If the Attorney-General says that he is not going to prosecute, a certificate need not be issued immediately. Then he can go ahead and get everything in order from A to Z, and consult his legal representative. Only when he is ready does he have to request the certificate. After that he still has six weeks before the certificate lapses. I want to tell the hon. member that there is no question of my wanting to push everything through as it stands here. I think that six weeks is ample time I think that the hon. member for Kroonstad is quite correct. However, even under these circumstances I am prepared to accommodate him. If he were to withdraw his amendment and move that &#x201C;three months&#x201D; be substituted for &#x201C;six weeks&#x201D;, I would be prepared to accept that, simply to show him what a good disposition there is on this side. I do not believe that this is necessary, but I shall accept it simply to demonstrate our goodwill.</p>

<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to submit to the hon. the Minister for his consideration a problem I have in connection with clause 8. With the general purport of clause 8 we have no real problem. We believe that it is a good thing that under certain circumstances, in these specific cases, the Attorney-General should be able to reserve his rights when he issues the certificate. As I understand the clause, it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s object to make the provisions of clause 8 specifically applicable to certain bodies or persons having powers of private prosecution under other legislation and not on the ordinary private prosecutor described in clause 7 of this Bill. Clause 8(1) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4811-4812" refersTo="page_0959"/>Any body upon which or person upon whom the right to prosecute in respect of any offence is expressly conferred by law &#x2026;</block>

<p>Such a body or person is then subject to the rest of the clause. This can be interpreted in such a way that a body or person to on which or whom the right is expressly conferred by the Act to prosecute in respect of an offence also includes a person as mentioned in clause 7(1), because this is also a person to whom the right of private prosecution is being conferred by the Act. I do not believe it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s object that this should have a bearing on that, because if it is so interpreted, this would mean that where a private person prosecutes, and it is an important right of a private person to be able to prosecute privately, the Attorney-General could issue his <i>nolle prosequi</i> subject to the fact that he will still retain all rights over the prosecution which he would normally have, i.e. including the right to stop the prosecution. I do not think this can be lined up with the whole set-up of allowing a private prosecutor to prosecute. I did not move an amendment in this connection and I do not know whether the hon. the Minister agrees with me that clause 8 could possibly be interpreted in that way, but if there is a possibility that it can be interpreted in that way, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider making the necessary changes in the wording so that it cannot be interpreted in that way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I realize that the hon. the Minister just wants to make it applicable to those bodies he spoke about. But I say that as it now reads it can be otherwise interpreted. It can be otherwise interpreted because clause 8(1) provides that it is applicable to a &#x201C;body upon which or person upon whom the right to prosecute in respect of any offence is expressly conferred by law&#x201D;. An ordinary private prosecutor prosecutes in respect of rights conferred upon him by this legislation, i.e. clause 7(1). In other words, clause 8 can also relate to him, and all I want from the hon. the Minister is that he should consider introducing possible changes in the wording so that it is very clear what is meant by clause 8, so that it will not have the effect that I fear it will have.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 13:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Committee has just agreed to clause 12 and the Opposition has moved no amendment in that connection. Clause 13, the clause now under discussion, refers to that private prosecution which can be taken over by the Attorney-General at virtually any stage. The implication of that is that it is a prosecution, now being taken over by the Attorney-General, which was made pending by a private person in terms of clause 12. and that relative clause again refers to clause 7 which indicates the bodies that could have instituted the prosecution. The further implication is therefore that in terms of clause 13 proceedings may be conducted in terms of clause 119 which is the contentious clause which the Opposition <span class="col_4813-4814" refersTo="page_0960"/>spoke out against during the Second Reading. That clause now also becomes relevant in terms of clause 13 if the Attorney-General were to take this over. I therefore want to discuss the implications of clause 13 in terms of what we have thus far accepted. What it amounts to is that the proceedings and actions in terms of clause 119 can now be carried out, therefore, by the magistrate on behalf of a private prosecutor, but if clause 13 becomes applicable &#x2026;</p>

Clause 12 again provides certain actions of another clause. I feel myself called upon to put it to the Committee that by acceptance of clause 12, read in conjunction with clause 13 which we are now dealing with, the Opposition will no longer be able to make objections in that connection in terms of clause 119 &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with respect, what I want to indicate is that clause 13 implies that an action now being taken over by the Attorney-General was previously an action on the part of a private prosecutor and that the Opposition seriously objected to those actions which also came up in clause 6, which we have already dealt with. That is what the whole debate is about. I regard it as my duty to point out that by acceptance of clause 12 that they must now also, by implication, accept clause 13, i.e. that since the Attorney-General is now taking the place of a private prosecutor, they will no longer be able to object to the fact that a magistrate is conducting the proceedings in terms of clause 119.</p>

<p>Clause 22:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following subsection at the end of the clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) A search under subsection (1)(b) shall, as far as possible, be made by day in the presence of two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the search is made.</li>

</ol>

<p>Clause 22 deals with a search which can take place without a warrant by reason of the fact that delay in obtaining the warrant would defeat the object of the search and where a police official is satisfied upon reasonable grounds that a warrant would be issued in any event under the provisions of clause 21(1). My amendment is intended to add a further subsection which provides that where the search is made under these circumstances, that search should be made by day and in the presence of two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the search is made. If hon. members will have a look at clause 21, they will find that if there is to be a search at night it has to be provided for in the actual search warrant which is issued. Clause 21(3)(a) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A search warrant shall be executed by day, unless the person issuing the warrant in writing authorizes the execution thereof by night.</block>

<p>It is rather interesting to note that in the draft Bill which was published by the Minister in the <i>Government Gazette</i> on the 10th December, 1971, this particular provision was present. We find, however, that in the Bill presented to the House that particular provision has been removed. In terms of clause 22, the search can in any event take place with the consent of the person concerned or with the consent of the person present who permits that search to take place. The clause provides that the person concerned may consent <span class="col_4815-4816" refersTo="page_0961"/>to the search and the seizure of the article in question or a person may consent to the search. In other words, there has to be consent by one or other of these two persons. I think that a search, particularly under circumstances where a police official has to exercise his discretion in a reasonable way it is provided for here and one has to rely upon the reasonableness of that particular discretion should be undertaken by day, in view of the fact that a search only takes place by night if it is specifically permitted in terms of a search warrant. In other words, there is a significance attaching to the fact that the search will be executed by night. I think that this may be a discretion which perhaps goes a bit too far and intrudes on the private rights of the individual. Hon. members will furthermore notice that this particular type of search does not take place in respect of any matters which affect the security of the State. I think that clause 20 is relevant in this connection. There are other provisions in regard to a search where the security of the State is concerned. This type of search which is mentioned in this clause only refers to a normal search where a police official suspects that there is some or other preparation to commit a crime, where there is any intent to commit a crime, or where certain actions which take place lead the Police to believe that an offence may be committed. I feel that this clause which pertains in the present Act and which the draft Bill also contains should, unless the hon. the Minister has some very good reason indeed to satisfy the House as to why it was extracted from the draft Bill, remain in the present Bill. This matter has been dealt with in cases from time to time, and a search by night under these circumstances has always been regarded as illegal, as the hon. the Minister knows. In the case of <i>Rex v</i>. <i>Uys</i> in 1940, some issue arose about the relevance of a particular document which was sought to be handed into court. It was submitted that the document had been obtained illegally because the search had taken place by night without the proper authority, and the question arose whether that document was admissible or not. Certain viewpoints were expressed with regard to the admissibility of the document, and the court held that although the document had been acquired in the course of an illegal search, it was nevertheless prepared to admit the document. My plea to the hon. the Minister therefore is to agree to this amendment, in other words, to retain the position as it now stands, as was contemplated in the draft Bill so that the privacy of the citizen can be protected. Is it fair to expect people to be satisfied to be awakened at all hours of the night, particularly where, as in this case, the matter is one in which the security of the State is not involved&#x003F; I will be glad to hear the hon. the Ministers views in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct about the provision having been in the original draft, but there was very strong representations from the Police to the effect that it complicated their work and made it virtually impossible. The representations of the Police carried a great deal of weight, but in addition to that a legal body, to whom the matter was presented for comment, also supported the Police. They said, for example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our view, this section is impracticable and the course of justice might well be delayed to the prejudice of the State if two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality have to be present at the search.

<p>Mr. Chairman, this morning I noticed on the Order Paper an amendment in the name of the hon. member for Houghton to substitute for &#x201C;a police official&#x201D;, &#x201C;any person&#x201D;. One obviously has not had time to do the necessary research as we started at ten o&#x2019;clock this morning, but what I would like to know is whether it is possible for any person except a Police official to be in possession of a search warrant. The other thought that has occurred to us is this: What is the position if a person purporting to be a police officer gets a search warrant and purports to act in terms of it&#x003F; I wonder if the hon. the Minister could help us in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment is, of course, quite out of place for the simple reason that all the powers granted in clause 28 only have a bearing on a Police officer, and to give it to anyone else now would make nonsense of this. Consequently I cannot accept this. With respect to the position of a private person who obtains search authorization to which he is not entitled, it is, of course, an offence, and discussing it here falls outside the purview of this clause.</p>

Then there is the consequential amendment to that which I shall deal with in a moment. I should first like to motivate this amendment. As the clause reads at the moment the court is obliged, by reason of the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; in the second line, at the conclusion of the proceedings to make one or other of the orders which follow, i.e. paragraphs (a), (b) or (c).</p>

<p>The court can only make one of those three orders.

Now, I submit to the Committee that in that situation it is unreasonable that the court should immediately at the conclusion of the proceedings be required to make the order. We therefore submit that it would be more reasonable and fairer if it was mad discretionary for the court to make the order at the conclusion of the proceedings. It would then give the opportunity for anyone who wishes to claim possession of this article to bring a substantive application to the court at some later stage which, in terms of the law as it exists at present, they would be entitled to do. Now, if the hon. the Minister is disposed to accept my argument so far &#x2026;</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister is with me that it is unfair that at the conclusion of the proceedings, if the person to whom the article belongs is unknown, at that stage it should be immediately forfeited to the State, then I submit that it is fair to leave it to the discretion of the magistrate to make one or other of <span class="col_4819-4820" refersTo="page_0963"/>the orders and then it would follow that some provision would have to be made as to what happens to the article pending an order being made. Therefore I propose that a proviso at the end of subsection (1) be added to the effect that pending such order the article shall remain in the custody of the State. That deals with one of the amendments which I have moved.</p>

<p>The other amendment which I have moved in respect of line 38 really deals with another point in the same clause and I now wish to come to that. In subsection (4) as it reads, it is provided that any order made under subsection (1) or (3) may be suspended pending an appeal or review. Whether or not the hon. the Minister accepts my first amendment&#x2014;I hope he does &#x2014;I believe that this second amendment should be accepted, that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; should be altered to &#x201C;shall&#x201D;; in other words, to provide that pending an appeal the order shall be suspended. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that if that is not the case, then the person who may subsequently be found to be legally entitled to this article may not be able to recover it, because once the order is made and if that order is not suspended, the person in whose favour the order is made is perfectly legally entitled to dispose of that article. He can sell it, he can give it away, he can damage it, he can do what he likes with it because the court has ordered that he may possess it. Unless that order is suspended and it is obligatory to suspend it pending an appeal, the person who is subsequently found to be entitled to it could lose his rights. I therefore urge the hon. the Minister to accept these three amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think the amendments moved by the hon. member for Musgrave are acceptable. Apart from the idea that those amendments are in my view quite illogical, I do not believe them to be of any value as far as making amendments of this nature essential. The principle we accepted is the idea of concluding the hearing of cases as quickly as possible in the interests of all parties. It is consequently also logical that when one gets to the end of a case and encounters such articles, the court should, in terms of this clause, return such articles as soon as possible to the rightful owner. We can imagine the difficult position that could arise if such action were not taken and final effect immediately given to the position. To have to store these exhibits, articles, etc., could create an impossible situation.</p>

<p>The provision is here being ordered quite well and gives the court the right to hear evidence in that connection. When the court has come to an effective decision as a result of that evidence, it gives a ruling which can, in any case, still be subject to appeal. I therefore do not think that the amendments moved by the hon. member are worth the trouble. In fact, I want to allege that if the amendments were to do anything to this clause, the effect would merely be that the clause would be very much more complexly ordered. Therefore we are not prepared to accept the proposed amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. the Minister will not accept the reasoning of the hon. member for Ermelo, because, with respect to the hon. gentleman, his reasoning is not sound. I hope that this House in its anxiety to establish a quicker procedure, is not going to go to the extent of aiming at speed despite the fact that it may cause an injustice in the process. I do suggest that the hon. member for Ermelo missed the point that I was making. The hon. member for Ermelo said that it is desirable at the end of proceedings to dispose of the question of possession, which is relevant to this clause, there and then as quickly as possible. There is no doubt that it is desirable, and I therefore accept his proposition. Where it can be done at that stage, it is desirable to do so. In the cases mentioned in paragraphs (a) or (b), according to which the person entitled to the article will be known and can establish his possession and lead evidence there and then, there can be no problem. No doubt if the magistrate is asked at that stage to issue an order, he will do so. But I want to come to the point missed by the hon. member for Ermelo. I drew particular attention to the last part of paragraph (c), which provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the person who is entitled thereto cannot be traced or is unknown, that it (the article) be forfeited to the State.</block>

<p>My point is precisely this, that it is unfair that the magistrate should be compelled to make an order at a stage where the owner of the goods is unknown. It should be possible for him in that situation to leave the matter in abeyance so that if at some time <span class="col_4821-4822" refersTo="page_0964"/>in the future someone should come forward to claim the article and to establish that he is entitled to it, he can then make application to the court. The hon. member for Ermelo said that in any event, it the order is made immediately there and then, nobody is prejudiced, and there can be an appeal As I pointed out in my original address, as this clause relating to appeal is worded, the lawful possessor could be prejudiced, unless that provision is also amended to suspend the order pending appeal; because the article can be disposed of, etc., as I indicated in my first address. I would therefore ask the hon. the Minister to accept these amendments.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we must regard this clause in the light of practical experience in the courts. In practice the experience has been that there are rooms and rooms full of <i>corpus delicti</i> or exhibits and that one must continually make space available. For that reason the intention is to get rid of them as quickly as possible. This does not mean that if, at the end of the case, the magistrate impounds the article it will be sold the next day. But the hon. member must remember that there was a long case in which the <i>corpus delicti</i> served as an exhibit, and the owner had not yet come forward. He could not be traced, either. I do not have experience of that, but I am told that the department does not know of one single case in which an exhibit used in the magistrate&#x2019;s court was also needed in the superior court.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. member has already encountered this in practice in the supreme court. Therefore it was felt that a final order should be made at the termination of a case. If the owner is known, the article will be returned; if he is unknown it will, of course, take quite a while before the article is got rid of by way of sale. In other words, from the commencement of the case in which it served as an exhibit until the advertising date is known and the article is eventually sold, it must be stored. That is the reason why we cannot keep these articles indefinitely. It is simply impossible for the Department of Justice to keep exhibits indefinitely in case the owner should come forward. If the actual owner comes forward, there is nothing that prohibits an <i>ex gratia</i> payment being made to the person as compensation for the sold article. The person must just have reasonable proof that the article was his. Consequently with all the safeguards there are and the difficulties experienced in the magistrates courts, exhibit rooms and storage locales, it was felt that this provision is necessary. I would not like to have the hon. member insist that those articles be kept indefinitely, or until an owner eventually comes forward.</p>

<p>Subsection (4) has to do with when a case goes on appeal.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand the Minister&#x2019;s point that there have not been cases where these orders have been taken on appeal. That may be so, but if this were to happen, the person concerned would be prejudiced if the clause remains worded as it is. I want to urge the hon. the Minister to agree to change the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; to &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. It seems to me that this is the only logical thing to do, because it makes the appeal worthless if the goods can be disposed of. Reverting to the first amendment, I can understand the problem of the State where these articles have to remain in State possession, sometimes for a very long time. In order to meet this situation, would the hon. the Minister not agree to amend the clause to provide that where the magistrate finds that the person entitled thereto cannot be traced or is unknown and therefore forfeits it to the State, that the article shall be kept in the possession of the State, say, for a period of a year or something of that sort, and if not claimed within that time, can then be disposed of in the normal way&#x003F; This would give a reasonable time in which to make application if the owner in the interim does come to inquire about the article. Would the hon. the Minister be prepared to accept an amendment along these lines&#x003F; If he could indicate that he would, I could draft one immediately and submit it.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the whole idea is that we should like to have finality at the conclusion of a trial. I think that with these precautions being <span class="col_4823-4824" refersTo="page_0965"/>taken, i.e. that a person will always be entitled to an <i>ex gratia</i> payment if his possessions are sold, there will be no problems. We shall pay back to a person what such an article fetched on an auction sale because one does not want to appropriate for oneself someone else&#x2019;s property if it does not belong to one. With these two provisions I really cannot see why such articles should be stored for at least a year. The exhibit room may be full and then such articles must still be hoarded as well. They may be fairly large items. I recently read of a case where a similar kind of thing took place as that which the hon. member spoke about. I think the case took place in America. The exhibit was one of those terrible drugs, heroin or something of that kind. Afterwards it was discovered that it was being stolen from the exhibit room. Then the case comes up again and the drugs are simply placed in the exhibit room again. The storage of exhibits in exhibit rooms causes many difficulties. The hon. member must therefore please not insist on that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that the hon. the Minister has certainly made out a case for having the necessary power in respect of these exhibits. I think he is quite right; experience in this regard does show that these rooms become full with all sorts of strange objects. I think that the hon. member for Musgrave has indicated, also, that he is half satisfied with the explanations given by the hon. the Minister in respect of the first two parts of his amendment. However, surely the hon. the Minister will accept the last part of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, namely in line 38, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. At present it reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Any order made under subsection (1) or (3) may be suspended pending any appeal or review.</block>

<p>Obviously, if anyone feels strongly enough to appeal&#x2014;and I must say that I have no knowledge of such an appeal&#x2014;provision is made for an appeal. If he wants to appeal against any order that is made, surely one should say that the order &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be suspended pending the appeal or review. As it is now, it indicates that it might not be suspended pending a legitimate, properly lodged appeal. I hope that the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment.</p>

Every magistrate will interpret the &#x201C;may&#x201D; as &#x201C;shall&#x201D; for the simple reason that it is locked up in the <i>corpus delicti</i> room. That is really the effect of it.</p>

If he says it will be interpreted as &#x201C;shall&#x201D;, let us leave no doubt about it at all. The hon. the Minister must know how many strange things happen as a result of misinterpretations. An order may, in fact, not be suspended. Someone may forget to make an order. This is what happens. Someone makes an appeal and then someone else forgets to make an order or does not apply for an order because he does not know the law. Let us make it automatic.

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the clause which provides for the forfeiture of weapons, instruments or other articles by means of which offences have been committed, including, in respect of an offence referred to in Part I of Schedule II, vehicles used in connection with the commission of an offence. I want to say at this stage that it is a great pity that the Criminal Procedure Bill should not be the Bible of criminal procedure. There are a number of <span class="col_4825-4826" refersTo="page_0966"/>other offences in respect of which it is possible for the court to order the forfeiture of the vehicle or whatever article was used for the commission of an offence. There are provincial ordinances, dealing with game, etc. There are a number of other provisions of the law in terms of which the court may order the forfeiture of certain articles. It is a great pity that all these measures are not consolidated in this clause once and for all so that this Bill, in so far as forfeiture of articles is concerned, can be the Bible of criminal procedure. Then one could take the one document with you and carry it around knowing that it provides for all the different circumstances under which articles can be forfeited. Especially policemen and law enforcement officers should know what their rights are and what they are not. That is the first point I wanted to make. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this is possible.</p>

<p>Then I want the hon. the Minister to give us some sort of assurance relating to the utterances of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport. He said that where a man was convicted of a driving offence of a serious nature, the vehicle should be forfeited. He actually spoke in terms of an automatic forfeiture of the vehicle to the State. This is not in this clause but it is possible for the schedule to which this relates to be amended by proclamation so as to include the offence of wreckless driving or negligent driving. This can be done merely by proclamation. If the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport is as vociferous as he has been in the past, and is listening to it it may be that in fact this forfeiture provision would apply to such driving offences. Even if it did, we would oppose it here and now because it does not put it right. Would the hon. the Minister indicate in the first place whether he can perhaps make this a consolidating measure in the Other Place, and in the second place, whether he would give us an assurance that as long as he is the Minister, he will not accede to the request of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport and change the Schedule to which this provision relates, by proclamation&#x003F;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 48, after &#x201C;who&#x201D;, to insert &#x201C;wilfully&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I may say that obstruction can of course be intentional, it can be unavoidable, and it can be wilful. I want to illustrate, if I may, the type of obstruction which can take place. We have had occasions in this House when the hon. the Speaker has requested the hon. member for Umlazi to sit back so that he could view the hon. member for Florida. It would be wrong to suggest that the obstruction caused by the hon. member for Umlazi was something of which serious notice should be taken, because that type of obstruction is quite unintentional. Then, Sir, I can imagine the sort of situation that would arise if the hon. member for Pretoria Central, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth North and the hon. member for Johannesburg West were to become involved in some pastime in which there are also laws on obstruction. One can imagine how unfortunate it would be if the hon. member for Johannesburg West, because of his agility, were to be free of any penalty, while the hon. members for Pretoria Central and Port Elizabeth North might well be penalized, through no fault of their own, but because of a lack of agility, for obstruction. Sir, these positions can arise. I have illustrated them in perhaps a rather frivolous way, but they do arise. The hon. the Minister will be aware of an actual prosecution where the judgment went from the magistrate&#x2019;s court to the Supreme Court on appeal, where a police photographer was obstructed when he sought to take a photograph for exhibit purposes of a particular scene, and the person concerned was charged with obstruction. Some of us, Sir, because of our physical form, might well obstruct the view of a police photographer. We may be doing it quite unintentionally, but nevertheless we would be obstructing him.</p>

I do believe that we must look at this matter in the light of circumstances.

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (k) of subsection (1).</block>

<p>Sir, I found it quite strange to find a clause such as this one, which deals with extradition to overseas countries, among the powers under which a peace officer may arrest without a warrant, because it seems to me that it would really not be possible to do something of this nature in a hurry; that this is pre-eminently a case which will first be discussed through diplomatic channels before we shall have this person arrested, and that there should always be a warrant in any case, because there are important provisions in the clause which have to be complied with before such a person can be arrested. There must be a suspicion that he has been concerned in an act committed outside the Republic, an act which, if it had been committed in the Republic, would also have been punishable. I do not believe that this is something which a police officer or a peace officer can decide on the spur of the moment. I believe that this is pre-eminently a matter <span class="col_4829-4830" refersTo="page_0968"/>where the arrest should take place under a warrant, and for that reason I have a consequential amendment in this regard on a later clause. I hope that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that the matter should first go through the proper channels and that a warrant should be issued by a court before the arrest takes place in those circumstances.</p>

<p>As I mentioned then, Sir, obviously we have no objection to the arrest without warrant of people who enter the Republic illegally. Indeed, our position was made clear on this point a long time ago. You will remember, Sir, that in at least one very unfortunate case&#x2014;I refer to the case of a certain Tsafendas&#x2014;we took the very strong view that the action should have been taken far sooner than it was. In fact, no action was taken at all, and then it was too late. Sir, what we are seeking to do here is to eliminate what we believe is essentially a humiliating, discriminatory provision that applies to citizens of the Republic who transgress provincial boundaries. It is quite obvious that these powers are intended to be used against Indians, against people of Asiatic descent, who are found to be illegally in what one might call the wrong province. We know that they are confined to certain provinces and that they can only move out of them with special permission, but, Sir, I believe that the hon. the Minister, who is in a benign mood this afternoon, will agree with us that there have been tangible signs of a change in approach on the part of the Government in relation to the movement of Asiatics especially. We believe that these are fellow-citizens of ours whose origins are obviously different, but nevertheless they are citizens of the Republic of South Africa. We believe they should not be subjected to the humiliation of summary arrest for being illegally in a province in which they should not be. We are aware of the fact that the Government is taking a slightly more relaxed attitude towards them, and we feel that unless we remove the words which this amendment seeks to remove, it will perpetuate an offence on the dignity of these people.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I do not think that we on this side of the House are inclined to accept that amendment. This clause lays down the circumstances under which a peace officer may act without a warrant. If we examine the various sub-clauses, we undeniably gain the impression that it is aimed at those alleged offences where it is essential to take action. In regard to this particular subsection my submission will be that if there are circumstances under which arrest without a warrant is essential, they will indeed be those circumstances mentioned in this sub-clause, namely where a person is reasonably suspected of being a prohibited immigrant in the Republic or in any province in contravention of any law regulating entry into or residence in the Republic or any province. After all, Sir, we can imagine the circumstances in which action of this kind will take place, where a peace officer or a policeman is instructed to, or considers that he must, take action. It will be almost impossible for him, if justice is to be done, if, in such cases, he first has to adopt the tedious procedure of going to the nearest magistrate or police officer in order to obtain <span class="col_4831-4832" refersTo="page_0969"/>a warrant. This applies to offences where prohibited persons are acting in an illegal manner and where immediate action has to be taken against them. If we were to accept that amendment, it would make this subsection completely worthless and the Police would not be able to arrest a single one of these offenders. These are people who act in a cunning way, people who act during the night and who are bent on committing this type of offence. That is why I say that we cannot support the amendment.</p>

<p>I am afraid the hon. member for Ermelo is overstating the position grossly. He says that if we accept this amendment it will negate the whole purpose of this clause but surely the most important part of this clause is the provision for the arrest by a peace officer without warrant of people who come into the Republic illegally. Now, what we object to is for the same provisions to be applied to our own South African citizens, our fellow citizens, who may be of Asiatic descent and who happen to be found in the wrong province. I suggest that in this day and age this is really a technical offence. I do not think it calls for the summary arrest of these people. Surely, if the authorities felt so strongly about it, it could be met by a summons or warning but not by arrest. It is not a grave offence and has not been considered as such for a long time.</p>

I suggest that in this day and age the most equitable thing to do would be to agree to remove it from the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I shall first refer to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Florida that paragraph (k) be deleted. Now, paragraph (k) deals with a case where a person has committed an offence outside the borders of the Republic. The Police find him within the Republic and they then have the power to arrest him directly. The possibility exists that such a man has already committed an offence and it may be a serious offence. It is being investigated. In fact, an application for extradition may already be on its way to the Government, or the information may have been received that the man has committed the offence there and that they will request his extradition. So while he is in the Republic he is really a fugitive from that particular country, say, Portugal or Rhodesia or Botswana. For that reason I do not know whether it is wrong to have this power. One should not waste time by first having to apply for a warrant. It must be borne in mind that this person is a fugitive. I think the provision is quite reasonable, that you may arrest that person directly if those particular circumstances arise. I really do not believe that the hon. member realizes all the implications and I do not believe he is taking account of all that may happen. Since such a person is a fugitive, he will try to get away as quickly as possible after being observed by the Police, if he is not arrested on the spot. Much as I would have liked to accept the hon. members&#x2019; amendment, I do not think it would be wise to do so.</p>

<p>I now come to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington. Everything the hon. member said is perfectly true. It is true that the Government <span class="col_4833-4834" refersTo="page_0970"/>is adopting, as he said, a more relaxed attitude in this regard. In fact, I think the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs said so the other day. I am aware of our attitude, but the fact remains that the provision which prohibits this is still on the Statute Book. As long as it is on the Statute Book and in view of the fact that it has been included in previous legislation, I cannot see that it would make things any easier if you had to get a warrant from a magistrate before arresting the person in such a case. As long as this is the position in terms of existing legislation I think we should leave this clause as it is. This was the position under the old dispensation and it will remain the same under the new. I do not know what the instructions to the Police in this regard will be, but I do believe that if there is to be a more relaxed attitude in general, this will also be the case in regard to the Police.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have the feeling that the hon. the Minister is still turning over whether he can accept the amendment which the hon. member for Kensington has moved. I hope he will go on turning it over a little longer and perhaps conclude that he can. In regard to the position of the Bantu people the whole attempt is to get away from the summary arrest of somebody found in a place where he should not be without a particular endorsement on his documents. I would suggest that this is something akin to that and that it would do us all the more credit if this was certainly not an offence for which summary arrest could take place. We admit that it is an offence, but we are not dealing with that. However, we feel that it would be perfectly possible merely to warn the man that he must appear in court; that is, if it is still felt that it will constitute an offence if he is found within certain areas where at this stage he should not legally be. I hope that the hon. the Minister will find it possible to remove this portion from the clause. It has been on the Statute Book for some time, but I think we have now reached the stage where it can be removed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should also like to urge the hon. the Minister to accept the amendment which the hon. member for Kensington has moved. It is not merely that the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs said that the Government was going to adopt a more relaxed attitude, but as I understand&#x2014;I may be wrong&#x2014;what the hon. the Minister said was that this was going to be abolished altogether and certainly in relation to the rest of the country if not in the Orange Free State. It seems to me that if that, in fact, is so, one ought not to have this provision in the Bill. I want to say as well that I think that this offence is committed more often than any other offence, without any prosecution being instituted deliberately. In fact, I am quite sure that Indian businessmen travel all over the country today without getting their permits, because they just do not have the time to do so. We feel that all these offences should be regarded as such and that there should be the power to arrest without a warrant because of the nature of the offence. But we do not agree that this particular offence should be regarded as an offence and that the person concerned should be subject to arrest without a warrant. The hon. the Minister says that this provision is not in the Act already. As far as I am aware, the equivalent section is section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act. This is a very hurtful position. The offence is a very hurtful one. It goes back so many years. We do not like it, and I hope the hon. the Minister will consider the matter in the same light.</p>

<p>So far as the amendment by the hon. member for Florida is concerned, it really ought to be a matter in respect of which a warrant should be issued. How would any policeman know that &#x201C;a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists&#x201D; that the person to be arrested has been concerned in any act committed outside the Republic&#x003F; The only way in which that policeman would know whether the act has been committed outside the Republic would be as a result of information contained in a document. The only way he would know whether or not he could apprehend the person would be to know where in fact he was and what he had done. In those circumstances he would be on the look-out for him and a warrant could easily be provided. I think that, if the hon. the Minister looks at that amendment, together with the amendment on the Order Paper relating to clause 43&#x2014; they go together&#x2014;he might also be inclined to accept that one. But most certainly, so far as the amendment by the hon. member for Kensington is concerned, this is really a matter of principle in respect of which the hon. the Minister of Indian <span class="col_4835-4836" refersTo="page_0971"/>Affairs agrees with us. I do hope that the hon. the Minister therefore will relent in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this amendment was only brought to our notice this morning or yesterday, and consequently it has not been possible to make any inquiries. But I am prepared to undertake that the department will make inquiries in this regard, that it will consult the Police and will also discuss the matter with the Minister of Indian Affairs, if it is possible to get hold of him. If I find then that there are no serious objections to this, I shall look at the amendments and introduce the necessary changes in the Other Place, in the light of the offence and of the spirit that exists in respect of this matter. I am prepared to do that.</p>

<p>In spite of what was said by the hon. members for Florida and Durban North, I really cannot agree to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Florida. I am just thinking of a case such as that of Rocha, whom no-one could succeed to keep in custody in any prison in the Republic or in Mozambique. Imagine such a person. Rocha is a man who goes about with at least two pistols all the time. In his case, when he has committed an offence in Mozambique, you really cannot sit here waiting in South Africa and first request a warrant when you happen to come across him, and then arrest him. This is only one case I have in mind. The other case is where you know very well that an application for extradition is on its way or where such an application has already been received. When such a person is encountered you cannot wait and you have to act at once. He is a fugitive as a result of an offence committed in another country and consequently such a person has to be arrested at once. I am sorry, but I really cannot accept this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to carry this matter to unnecessary extremes, but I do feel that the hon. the Minister and I are perhaps speaking at cross purposes a little. The problem with a person like Rocha to whom the hon. the Minister referred, is that he was a fugitive, and any other fugitive would be a prohibited immigrant and it would, in any case be possible to arrest such a person summarily without a warrant on the basis of the fact that he is in South Africa unlawfully. But this clause applies to a person who is in South Africa lawfully, and who is not a prohibited immigrant. I am thinking, for example, of a person who has committed an offence in another country, which is not an offence in South Africa. However, the peace officer who has to arrest him is not aware that it is an offence here as well, or whether the same punishment&#x2014; and this is also something which applies in regard to extradition&#x2014;is applicable. The person I have in mind is a person who is entitled to be in South Africa and one who is not necessarily a fugitive from another country. There ought to be a warrant for his arrest. I am thinking now of the provisions of the clause as it stands at the moment, namely that credible evidence shall have been received on reasonable grounds and so on. The chances of an unlawful arrest are considerable, and implicit in this is the possibility of actions being instituted against the State as a result of people who exceeded their powers. It would be much safer, under those circumstances if a warrant were properly issued before the arrest, particularly if it is a complicated case. However, we have no problems with fugitives for they are in South Africa unlawfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on clause 40&#x2014;which is standing over &#x2014;I moved an amendment which provides for the deletion of paragraph (k). I used the wording of paragraph (k) and it appears on the Order Paper in my name under clause 43 now. The wording of the amendment I propose, is exactly the same as the wording of clause 40(1)(k). In other words, this means that, instead of the provision falling under clause 40, i.e. the provision dealing with arrest without warrant, I now want it to fall under clause 43, which deals with arrests for which a warrant must be issued. Consequently, whatever happens to clause 40, will decide what happens to my proposal in clause 43. For that reason I ask that this clause also stand over just as clause 40 is standing over.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the clause which provides for force to be used in circumstances where someone resists arrest, or for the purpose of arresting such a person. It provides that in certain circumstances, in respect of certain offences, if the person is killed that death shall be regarded as justifiable homicide. The offences in respect of which this applies&#x2014;and we are dealing here with the Police, not really with anyone else&#x2014;are those contained in Schedule I. Subsection (2) of clause 49 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where the person concerned is to be arrested for an offence referred to in Schedule I or is to be arrested on the ground that he is reasonably suspected of having committed such an offence, and the person authorized under this Act to arrest or to assist in arresting him cannot arrest him or prevent him from fleeing by other means than by killing him, the killing shall be deemed to be justifiable homicide.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, what are those offences&#x003F; Those offences, listed in Schedule I, are the following: Treason; sedition; murder; culpable homicide; rape; indecent assault; sodomy; bestiality; robbery; assault, when a dangerous wound is inflicted; arson; breaking or entering any premises, whether under the common law or a statutory provision, with intent to commit an offence; theft, whether under the common law or a statutory provision; receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen; fraud; forgery or uttering a forged document knowing it to have been forged; offences relating to the coinage (this is almost unbelievable); any offence, except the offence of escaping from lawful custody in circumstances other than the circumstances referred to hereunder, the punishment where for may be a period of imprisonment not exceeding six months without the option of a fine; escaping from lawful custody, where the person concerned is in such custody in respect of any offence referred to in this schedule or is in such custody in respect of the offence of escaping from lawful custody; and any conspiracy, incitement or attempt to commit any offence referred to in this Schedule.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is more or less the position as it is today. Under the position as it is today, we have seen an alarming number of persons, especially in recent times, who have been shot and killed by policemen when the policemen concerned have tried to arrest them or when they have resisted arrest. There have been some tragic circumstances which have arisen. In one case a young man was trying to escape by climbing over a wall. He was shot dead in circumstances which I shall not speak of since the matter is <i>sub judice.</i> We had another example the other day where someone had used someone else&#x2019;s credit card. He was suspected, therefore, of having committed fraud. This same person, at short range, was shot dead. These are just two examples of the very many that there are. As the hon. member for Umlazi pointed out in the Second Reading debate, you have a situation where a policeman, either wishing to secure an arrest or wishing to apprehend someone who is escaping, has the power to kill a person who is accused of an offence in respect of which the court is not empowered to impose the death sentence. Sir, as I said, there have been an alarming number of these cases. Unfortunately many of them are <i>sub judice</i> and unfortunately one cannot talk about the <span class="col_4843-4844" refersTo="page_0975"/>circumstances of a lot of them. But, Sir, I think we were all impressed by the voice of authority of the hon. member for Umlazi when he said, from his experience, that there were a number of these persons who were trigger-happy; that it was the younger persons rather than the older persons who resorted to shooting. I think it must be made quite clear that the standing orders of the Police prohibit the sort of behaviour that we have been seeing lately in these shootings. There is no doubt that the Police standing orders do prohibit this sort of behaviour. Sir, in the light of this, is it not time to limit the provision, in terms of which the Police may shoot to secure an arrest or to stop a person escaping in circumstances where, if that person is killed, the shooting will be regarded as justifiable homicide, to those offences in respect of which the death sentence is competent&#x003F; There are a number of those offences: Housebreaking with aggravating circumstances, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, rape, treason, and so on &#x2014;all the offences listed in clause 284. Sir, it seems to me that if there is a risk that you may be killed on arrest and that this may be regarded as justifiable homicide, then in the light of what has been happening, it might be wise to restrict the offences in relation to which shooting can take place and be regarded as justifiable homicide, to offences in respect of which the person could in any event be sentenced to death. In other words, he should not have to suffer beforehand, negligently, the fate which only ultimately and after due consideration the court would impose upon him. In those circumstances, Sir, and for those reasons I move the amendment which stands in my name on the Order Paper and which is designed to give effect to the situation that I have described&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 19, to omit &#x201C;referred to in Schedule 1&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;in respect of which the sentence of death is a competent sentence in terms of this Act,&#x201D;.</block>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the effect of the amendment of the hon. member would be as follows: Persons arrested by the Police who then tried to escape would in relation to the following offences not need to have any fear that the Police might shoot at them; I shall mention to you the crimes which, if the amendment of the hon. member were accepted, would be eliminated, and then we must look objectively in this Committee at the possible results. These are: Indecent assault; sodomy; bestiality; assault, when a dangerous wound is inflicted; arson; robbery; fraud; forgery; offences relating to the coinage; and then conspiracy to commit some of these crimes. Sir, let us now consider these from the beginning. Indecent assault could be of such a nature that at the stage at which an arrest is imminent or when the person is being arrested, it might be a case of rape, which is in fact a capital crime. In addition there is the case of assault, when a dangerous wound is inflicted. Suppose an attempt is made to secure an arrest shortly after the assault has taken place. The person is not yet a corpse. Now, the person assaulted is lying there seriously wounded. The policeman or the person authorized to carry out an arrest allows that person to escape because the assaulted person still has a little life left in him. I want to mention the case of arson. Suppose, Sir, a person is caught in the act of setting fire to a petrol dump. Suppose strategic supplies of the Republic were being set alight, or suppose a person breaks into a bank, steals R1 million and tries to escape. Then, as a result of the amendment of that hon. member, it would not be possible to use a fire-arm, for the action of the person then attempting to carry out the arrest, or who may be arrested and allows an escape to take place, would not be deemed justifiable homicide if he allows such a suspected or arrested person to escape. Sir, I do not know what the attitude of the hon. the Minister in this connection is going to be, but I want to make it clear to the Committee that this amendment of the hon. member should be considered with extreme care, for the consequences thereof cannot be foreseen. We do not want in this way to condone indiscreet action. We would say that such matters should be settled administratively. But in the interests of society, the public and the State I, and I believe the rest of us here as well, will not be able to support this amendment without very serious consideration.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (2).</block>

<p>This goes a good deal further than the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North in that of course I do not believe that people should be allowed to shoot <span class="col_4845-4846" refersTo="page_0976"/>persons attempting to escape custody. When I say people I mean people because this does not only authorize Police officers to shoot people escaping from custody. If hon. members would look at an earlier clause, clause 42, they will see that any private person may without warrant arrest any person. Such person is also covered under the protection of this clause. Sir, there is a slight improvement in this Bill on the existing law as it stands. The offences for which the use of a fire-arm is permitted has been narrowed to some extent. The actual offence of escaping from custody is not now included in the schedule, so there is that improvement. But there is still of course a very wide range of crimes for which persons attempting to arrest someone who tries to escape custody, may draw a fire-arm and kill such a person. This is justified in terms of the law. I am against that. Certainly in England no such thing can happen as the shooting of a person who attempts to escape from custody, because the Police there are not even armed. I know our society is rather different from that of England. But what has happened in our society as the result of permitting policemen or any other person&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;to draw a gun and shoot somebody who appears to be escaping custody&#x2014;and what private person even knows of the existence of Schedule I and whether or not he is entitled to kill&#x2014;is that an inordinate number of people have in fact been shot. I do not have the figure of the number of persons shot by private persons, but I do have the number of persons shot by police officers who were attempting to stop somebody from escaping, custody. According to answers given to me in the House, the Police shot 49 adults and five juveniles in 1970; in 1971 they shot 52 adults and two juveniles; and in 1972 they shot 91 adults and three juveniles. I do not know how many of those fall under the sort of spine-chilling types of cases that the hon. member who has just sat down enumerated: the arson, the blowing up of security installations, and so on. I have no idea, but I do know, from reading the newspapers, that among these cases are people who were shot while escaping from custody for relatively minor offences. I think that having a provision like this on our Statute Book encourages policemen, instead of arresting persons physically, to shoot them.</p>

<p>I do think that the Police are entitled to shoot in self-defence and when they are really dealing with a violent person who appears to be about to inflict injury on them. I think any other person is, in self-defence, also entitled to defend himself. Surely, that will be allowed in our common law&#x003F; In our common law that will be permitted. Therefore I see no necessity whatever for our Criminal Law to contain a provision like this. One should also bear in mind the damage that this provision has caused. Apart from the Elliot case to which the hon. member for Durban North referred, we have only recently read about the case where a 14-year old school-boy was in a serious condition with a bullet lodged next to his spine and a collapsed lung after being shot by a policeman in attempting to escape custody for a supermarket theft.</p>

<p>In the heat of the moment any person, or any policeman&#x2014;although policemen ought to be more disciplined in this regard&#x2014;knowing that in the past it has been accepted that persons who are escaping custody may be shot, quickly draws a gun if he happens to have a gun on him&#x2014; an awful lot of people in South Africa are armed, I might add&#x2014;and shoots a person. He is thus turning a relatively minor offence into a capital offence.</p>

<p>I am against this; I am against this altogether. I think, as I have said, the only justification for killing a fugitive from justice or someone who is attempting to escape custody, is when such a person is a violent criminal who is attacking the person attempting to effect the arrest&#x2014;whether that person is a policeman or a private individual. I believe that this is a golden opportunity to improve our Criminal Law at this stage, and I therefore have moved this amendment which will create this possibility.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think the hon. the Minister will be prepared to accept either the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban North or the one moved by the hon. member for Houghton. These two amendments differ only in degree. Clause 49 draws a very clear distinction, and discriminates very clearly between the two types of arrest referred to in the various subsections. In subsection (1) mention is made of resistance to arrest, attempts to escape, etc. In the past the circumstances under which a police officer could use violence was emphasized very clearly by our courts, and there was no doubt about those circumstances. The courts also made clear what <span class="col_4847-4848" refersTo="page_0977"/>degree of violence could be applied in relation to the degree of seriousness of the crime, etc. But when we refer to subsection (2) the position is different. This does deal with an arrest, but with this kind of arrest, as is made very clear in this clause, in respect of which no other procedure exists and where the accused, or the person who has to be arrested, cannot be arrested by any other means. I think that, when we are dealing with this kind of arrest, it is basically wrong, under law and in principle, to allege that it should be applied only in the case of a crime for which the death sentence may be imposed. It will in all conceivable circumstances be impossible for a policeman, in such a situation, to calculate, only after having given thought to the matter, to what extent he is entitled to make the arrest. He has to act on the impulse of the moment. For that reason I maintain that it is an incorrect principle to apply. What we are dealing with here is an alleged crime, and an attempt by a peace officer or policeman to make an arrest. Now I maintain that if in that process something happens for which provision is being made here, he must have the right to arrest, regardless of whether it was a crime. I want to say here in passing that I am referring specifically now to the serious crimes listed in Schedule 1. In those cases it would be wrong to expect a person to sum up the situation first. I would be wrong to make a provision to this effect. I want to refer to a decided case, namely the case of the <i>State v</i>. <i>Arlow,</i> in the fifties, in which the court stated very clearly what action could be taken in these cases. In fact, this is all that is being embodied in this clause. This provision is merely a re-enactment of section 37 of the present Criminal Procedure Act. It has been very clearly laid down by our courts that there has to be proof of a crime; there has to be an attempt to arrest; there has to be resistance; and there has to be no other way in which the fugitive could be apprehended. If one applies that principle and adopts it as a premise, I maintain that a policeman is entitled to act in terms of this provision. It is the law at present and I believe that it is being reenacted here because it is regarded by the legislature as being essential and important. Those sentimental ideas raised by the hon. member for Houghton, may apply in certain respects. It would be a great pity if people were perhaps to lose their lives in this way, and I and all of us have sympathy in that regard. But when one is dealing with a serious crime, we cannot allow those considerations to apply; then we have to act in terms of this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot understand the reasoning of the hon. member for Ermelo. First of all, he maintains that Schedule 1 offences are all serious offences. That, of course, is not the case. Take for example the offence of theft. There it can be a case of minor theft.</p>

<p>I think hon. members can get up and state their case if they want to. I would like the opportunity, if they will listen, to reply to their arguments. I am replying to the hon. member for Ermelo. You could get a petty shop theft. Fraud, for example, was another case to which the hon. member for Ermelo, and also the hon. member for Bloemfontein West, referred. There are different degrees of fraud. There may be a very serious fraud and there may be a very minor type of fraud, but all these are lumped together under Schedule 1. In any event, what justification is there, even if a man has committed a serious theft or a serious fraud, for killing him simply because he is trying to flee&#x003F; He can be arrested again if he does flee. What that side of the House has not yet answered is the point made by the hon. member for Durban North. In many of these offences listed under Schedule 1, assuming a court would find an accused guilty of the offence as charged, that court would not be able to sentence the accused to death even though the theft may be a serious one and even though the fraud may be a serious one. It is also the case with some of the other offences. And yet the policeman is being authorized to kill him, not to kill him for the offence he has committed, but because he is trying to escape.</p>

<p>Of course it is. The hon. member for Pretoria Central will have the opportunity when I sit down to enter this debate and to justify the statement which he has made. I reiterate that in many of these offences, even though they may be of a serious nature, the magistrate convicting the person concerned would not have the power to sentence him to death, and yet in terms of clause 49(2) this Parliament is giving authority to a police officer, and in some cases, as has been pointed out, to other persons as well, to kill this person, and I repeat, not for the offence he has committed, but for attempting to escape arrest. What justification is there for that&#x003F; One must concede that if the person concerned is a dangerous criminal in the sense that if he is at liberty he would be a danger to other persons, there would be justification for giving the policeman power to use a fire-arm to attempt to stop him from fleeing, and if by accident he happens to kill this person this should be regarded as justifiable homicide. But then the offences should be strictly limited, and not be this long list we have here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo made the point that a person under such circumstances acts on the spur of the moment and that he does not have time to think whether the offence would be one which would carry the death sentence, and therefore he justifies the inclusion of this long list. Precisely the same argument applies in regard to these offences. These offences are limited and do not include every conceivable offence. The policeman must, in terms of this proposed clause, make sure or be satisfied that he falls within Schedule 1 in order to enjoy the protection of the clause. If he does not fall within Schedule 1, he will not enjoy the protection of the clause. One therefore sees no difference in principle if Schedule 1 were even further restricted, as we suggest, to include only those offences where the death penalty can be imposed, because those will be the cases where the accused may perhaps present some danger to the public if he is not prevented from fleeing. I would therefore ask the hon. the Minister to give further careful consideration to the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Durban North. Perhaps he could indicate to us what his views are in regard to this so that we can debate the matter further with him and, if he is not entirely in agreement with us, we may be able to suggest some other amendment which would restrict this Schedule which at the moment, in our submission, includes far too many offences in respect of which the use of a firearm to prevent the offender from escaping is too extreme as the person concerned may be killed.</p>

<speech by="#prinsloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. P. PRINSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. members are very concerned about the provisions contained in this subsection. I do not think that they should try to argue away the significance and the importance of the provisions of this clause so easily. Clause 49 of course to a certain extent codifies powers which already exist. Subsection (2) in particular is contained in section 37 of the existing Act. In that Act provision is made for the same matter. If we look at Schedule 1, we find the series of serious crimes for which the offender may be prosecuted. If the offender flees, he can be shot if that is the only way of arresting him. That is a provision which has existed for many years. It is a provision in regard to which warnings have on various occasions been issued by the Supreme Court calling for careful action. It is also a provision in regard to which the Police themselves saw to it that their people were properly trained, and that shooting was not easily resorted to. It is done only in essential cases. If we look once again at the crimes listed in Schedule 1, we will find that the crimes mentioned are escalating&#x2014; they have to escalate in these days in which we are living&#x2014;and that they are all extremely serious crimes. If a person should flee and should be shot, we have to accept or conclude that he simply got what he deserved. It is of course difficult for the person who has to make an arrest, in a period of time far shorter than the period we have in this House, to give due deliberation to a clause such as this and decide how he is going to act. He must act quickly, and if he is armed he has the necessary information enabling him to know in which cases he may use a fire-arm and in which not. I am aware that objections have been raised. In this way there are the objections from the opposite side of the House to which the hon. the Minister of course gives thorough consideration. Owing to the importance of the case and the length of time it has already been on the Statute Book, and because it deals with persons who may be identified as being persons who want to escape or flee, I do not think, however, that there ought to be any problem. In my opinion this clause ought to be accepted as <span class="col_4851-4852" refersTo="page_0979"/>it stands. I therefore associate myself with what my hon. colleague from Ermelo said in regard to this matter. I want to support it further by adding that events in the past have taught us that it is only by way of exception that serious inquiries stem from such cases which led to the death of a person. In any case every person is subject to an inquiry; the case is only settled after the magistrate who conducted the inquiry has had a proper opportunity of going into the matter. He can then find whether or not it was culpable homicide or not. A person cannot simply shoot someone and then try to allege that it was justifiable homicide. He will have to prove quite conclusively, and in clear terms, that this was in fact the case. That in itself urges a person to exercise great care.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it rather tragic that hon. members on that side of the House who have spoken on this subject should be so intractable. They all seem to hold the view that Schedule 1 only deals with serious offences. For instance, the hon. member for Innesdal has just told us that all of the crimes mentioned in Schedule 1 are serious crimes. The hon. member for Bloemfontein West as well mentioned some of them. Did hon. members then not listen to the arguments from this side of the House&#x003F; Let us take some of them again. I do not want to burden the record unnecessarily, but it seems as if they have not taken the point here. Let us take theft, whether under the common law or under a statutory provision. Theft is not only theft as such, but is also any conspiracy, incitement or attempt to commit theft. It could be a very petty theft indeed. How can the hon. member for Innesdal regard a theft of 50 cents worth of oranges as something for which a man should die, when he tries to escape arrest&#x003F; Is he serious about that&#x003F;</p>

<p>That hon. member seems to make noises but when I am asking him whether he disagrees with me he is not prepared to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. I believe that the hon. member for Houghton is seeking to go too far with her amendment as well. While one can sympathize with her point of view, I think it would be quite wrong for us to adopt the attitude suggested by her, which is that nobody should be allowed to shoot people escaping from custody.</p>

<p>Yes. I do not think the hon. member for Houghton can really ask us that a person who is wanted for a crime, such as murder, should be able to escape without fear of being shot. Surely, if the person escaping is likely to be a danger to the community, it is quite reasonable that provision be made for him to be shot at, if circumstances dictate it. This, I believe, is precisely what the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North is trying to achieve.</p>

<p>The other argument put forward by the hon. member for Innesdal is that this is a long standing provision of our law. Well, this is perfectly true, but that surely is no argument. If it is wrong, it is wrong, and it should be altered. Our submission is that it is wrong and that it should be altered. Our submission, in brief, is that there are many offences provided for in Schedule 1 which should certainly not fall under clause 49(2), and I therefore support most strongly the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the clause we are now dealing with is a very difficult provision. That I readily concede, but the police must have certain powers. While we were dealing with this matter we asked the Council of the Bar, to which such frequent reference was made yesterday, at least twice&#x2014;I was under the impression that it was three times&#x2014;to draw up a clause for us. They have still not succeeded in doing so to this day. The hon. member for Houghton proposed that we delete the entire subsection, and in this connection she expressed certain ideas. I do not think there are people in this House who would agree with them. They are entirely out of the question. What I do in fact believe is that we could perhaps at some stage or other make some concession <span class="col_4853-4854" refersTo="page_0980"/>or other in regard to Schedule 1. But up to now we have not been able to find any common ground as far as this provision is concerned. As I have said, we even left it in the hands of the Council of the Bar, and asked them to draw up something acceptable to us. They could not succeed in doing so. We therefore find ourselves in that position. It is true that the clause has been restricted. Previously the position was that where a policeman wanted to arrest a person who had escaped, and he could not apprehend him in any other way, he could shoot him.</p>

<p>No, I readily concede that. One could almost say that some of the young people were a little trigger-happy. But these days they cannot do that in terms of this clause. When a person escapes from custody, if he was in prison, and the policeman cannot apprehend him by any other means, the clause gives him the fullest right to shoot; not in order to kill him, but to thwart his attempted escape. In the case of an ordinary escape, where a policeman had a person by the scruff of the neck and was taking him to the police station, the position is different. If that person had been arrested for a minor crime and he were to escape, the policeman would not dare shoot. Only after the policeman has caught him a second time, and he escapes a second time, does the Act allow him to shoot, if that is the only means of preventing such escape.</p>

<p>That would have to be proved. I admit that we are dealing here with a very difficult clause. The police must have certain powers. One would not like to go too far with those powers and one would like to prevent people simply drawing their revolvers and shooting. We tried to modify this clause as well as we could. We had talks with the police, and in regard to the proposal made by the hon. member for Houghton they said that it was out of the question; that it would make their work quite impossible. In regard to this other amendment, we decided on the formula as it now stands. The Council of the Bar was unable to make a suggestion to us which would be acceptable to them, and which would at the same time be acceptable to us as well.</p>

<p>It has been said that the death sentence is, after all, not imposed for robbery; that this is merely a minor offence; but what about this case where the thieves drove off with a Trust Bank van containing R50 000 or R250 000&#x003F; Where such an enormous amount is stolen it is surely a serious crime. How is one going to distinguish between theft which is serious and theft which is not so serious&#x003F; What about a person who walks around with a pistol in his pocket and who resists when the police want to arrest him on a charge of robbery, and who then pulls out his pistol and makes his escape&#x003F; Is one to shoot him, or should one simply say that it was a minor offence; that it was only robbery and one should let him go&#x003F; I concede that it is difficult to decide what powers should be given to the police. But that is as far as we can go; we have to a large extent restricted their powers, and in my opinion shooting will not be resorted to as readily as in the past.

<p>Sir, I welcome the remarks of the hon. the <span class="col_4855-4856" refersTo="page_0981"/>Minister and of the hon. member for Innesdal. I rise to support the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North for this reason: Sir, in practice every policeman knows when he can shoot; make no mistake about that. You have the First Schedule offences where a policeman may shoot, in cases of rape, sodomy, bestiality, and so on, but the policeman knows in practice when he should shoot. Clause 278 tells us where the death sentence is competent, in cases of murder, treason, kidnapping, child-stealing, rape, robbery, attempted robbery and any offence, whether at common law or under any statute, of housebreaking or attempted housebreaking with intent to commit an offence. This clause gives the Police wide powers, but the average policeman knows when he should use these powers. As I said in the Second Reading debate, the experienced policeman never resorts to a fire-arm as a first resort; he only uses it in self-defence, where he is entitled to do so, or where there is a mass attack, which will never happen again, such as we had at Sharpeville. Our plea from this side concerns the young men in the Force. Most of us, except for the hon. member for Florida, and perhaps the hon. member for Pretoria Central and one or two others, grew up knowing how to use fire-arms. We had them at home and we knew how to use them, and we got a jolly good hiding if we did not handle fire-arms properly. When we joined the Police, and I know it from practical experience, we knew how to handle fire-arms, because the Police go through a course of musketry. But the Force is now taking matriculants at the age of 16 who have been drilling with an old carbine in the cadets and that is the only fire-arm he has ever had in his hands in his life, except that he might have fired a few shots with a ,22. But other than that he has never had a fire-arm in his hands. He is now entrusted with a fire-arm. &#x2026;</p>

With all the legislation and all the instructions these things can still happen. Here we are trying to place a sanctity on life. Every experienced policeman knows how to use a fire-arm and when.

<p>As I have said, clause 278 gives a long list of crimes where the death sentence is competent and I am saying that the experienced policeman who is worth his salt knows when to use a fire-arm, and you will find that those men never use their fire-arms irresponsibly. I am ashamed to say that at one stage things reached such a pitch that we issued instructions that when they came off duty their fire-arms had to be locked up in the station armoury because these men invariably before that, when they unloaded their fire-arms and went to their rooms they started playing the fool and that is where the shooting accidents took place. Here we want to put a bit of a curb on this indiscriminate shooting by young men. I am not against the seasoned man using his fire-arm. The hon. member for Innesdal well knows that any time a policeman shoots a person and kills him an inquest is always held and if the policeman is to blame he is charged accordingly. That is why I support the amendment of the hon. member and say that this should be confined to cases where the death sentence can be imposed.</p>

<p>It is a very simple amendment, which simply restores the position of the law as laid down in the original Criminal Procedure Act. I have tried to re-insert the words &#x201C;as soon as possible&#x201D;, which for some unknown reason have been omitted from this Bill. Originally, the Police had to take a person whom they had arrested to a Police station as soon as possible. Now they seem to be under the mistaken impression that they can in fact hold a person for at least 48 hours <i>incommunicado,</i> as it is. But now, with the omission of these words, I have no doubt that even more we will have the spectacle of the Police van, after an arrest early in the evening, driving around Soweto for half the night before the man is taken to the Police station. I am simply trying to restore the position as it was. I hope therefore the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment.</p>

<block name="quote">A person arrested with or without warrant shall be brought to a Police station or, in the case of an arrest by warrant, to any other place which is expressly mentioned in the warrant &#x2026;</block>

<p>As the provision now reads, it is an order. If it were to read &#x201C;as soon as possible&#x201D; one would actually be watering down the meaning of this clause. Apart from that there is another problem. The Police may want to apprehend a large number of people. They find the one person, and then want to go on to the next place where they want to arrest another person, etc. In this way they can drive around for most of the night with arrested persons. That is true. What is more, they sometimes need a person to identify someone for them. I really cannot see the sense of the amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;therein&#x201D; in line 51 up to and including &#x201C;there&#x201D; in line 54.</block>

<p>This clause provides for summons as a method of securing attendance of accused in a magistrate&#x2019;s court and subsection (2) (a) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Except where otherwise expressly provided by any law, the summons shall be served by a person referred to in subsection (1)(b) by delivering it to the person named therein &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then follow the words which I seek to have deleted, namely the words &#x201C;or, if he cannot be found, by delivering it at his residence or place of employment or business to a person apparently over the age of 16 years and apparently residing or employed there. One knows that this provision is part of the law as it exists today, but, with respect, it does not serve any useful purpose. If a court finds that a summons has not been served personally the court is not in a position to issue a warrant of arrest. My amendment seeks to provide that summonses shall always be served on the person concerned so that there will be no possibility of its not being brought to his attention. Looking again at the second part of subsection (2)(a), one finds that it is possible to deliver it to the residence or place of business or employment of the person concerned upon a person apparently over the age of 16 years residing there. There is no assurance that the person upon whom the summons would be served, would regard himself or herself as being in any way obligated or even related to the accused, so that, if there is no legal obligation, there is at least some moral obligation to see that that summons reaches the person who has been summonsed. If, in fact, this provision is intended to assist the messenger of the court, for example in getting the person to court, it is possible that in some cases where a summons has been delivered to a person such as is referred to in the second part of subsection <span class="col_4861-4862" refersTo="page_0984"/>(2)(a), an accused may receive the summons and may attend court, but in practice, I suggest, it happens more often than not that an accused person does not know of the summons and does not receive it. Then when the case comes before the court again it is necessary for the magistrate to postpone the case and to order that the summons be served personally upon the accused before any warrant of arrest is issued. My submission is that the second part of subsection (2)(a) should be deleted and I therefore ask the hon. the Minister to accept my amendment.</p>

<block name="quote">In line 4, page 46, to omit &#x201C;ten&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;fourteen&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I move this amendment in order to permit a longer time to elapse so that a person will have a longer time to prepare his defence. According to the Bar Council the minimum period of ten days which is proposed in the Bill as the period before the trial and after the service of the summons is too short. Any period shorter than 14 days, according to the Bar Council, is felt to be inadequate to enable an accused to prepare his defence, especially when it is borne in mind that it almost always takes a longer time to prepare the prosecution. It seems to me that this is a very good case for extending the time period. It does not make an enormous difference; a matter of four days. Therefore I cannot see any reason why the hon. the Minister should not agree to this minor amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the basic question with which we are concerned here in analysing the amendments is whether something other than a personal service of a summons should be adequate grounds for the non-appearance of the accused and whether it should be adequate grounds for having such a person arrested and for conducting an investigation to determine whether he has committed an offence by not appearing in court. Actually this is a matter which is dealt with in the next clause, but in this regard I want to state clearly that the principle of delivering a summons to a person other than the accused himself is a principle which operates very well in practise in civil law and which hardly gives rise to unjust action, if at all. Delivery of a summons to a person over the age of 16 years at an address frequented by the person constitutes effective service, in terms of and the next clause we shall deal with he is afforded the opportunity of explaining, should he not appear and should a warrant for his arrest be issued. If he can satisfy the court that he was not absent on purpose, the case is thereby concluded. Therefore I want to express my strong opposition to the idea of deleting the words and requiring personal service as such.</p>

<p>As has been indicated already, this Bill was brought before the House in order that unnecessary costs may be eliminated and time may be saved. It was brought before this House to enable our criminal procedure to operate smoothly. Every accused and every potential accused in this country must know that the authority of a summons to appear in court is a high authority which he must obey and which cannot be wilfully ignored.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of time raised by the hon. member for Houghton, she will see in the clause which is before the House that Sundays and public holidays are excluded. Therefore a period of ten days, as laid down in the Bill, in practise generally comes to 12 days since Sunday, too, is included. As someone who has had considerable experience of this, I want to assure her that in practice such a summons very seldom mentions a date that is within ten days of the date of issue of that summons. In practice the date will be further in the future and the person will have longer than 10 days. However, I can imagine circumstances in which it may be important for a case to be dealt with quickly and in which a relatively short period of ten days will be necessary. In such an important case this period of time is long enough for any attorney or lawyer worth his salt to prepare himself properly.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, unfortunately I cannot agree with the argument advanced by the hon. member for Vereeniging. The hon. member for Vereeniging said this operated well in the civil procedure in which one also had other service than personal service.

He may have his sentence set aside on application.</p>

<p>Not normally in the case of an ordinary civil summons, but he may in fact find himself in prison under certain circumstances. In this case the possibility exists that the person may in fact be deprived of his freedom by being arrested immediately after the summons. That is serious. Such a step should not be taken lightly, to arrest a person if there is a strong possibility that he did not receive that summons. I believe that in these circumstances the possibility is very strong that a person did not receive the summons. We know that it happens so often. A person may have been away, away on holiday or away on business or in a completely different city, when the summons was served on him. When he returns, the Police awaits him with a warrant. I think this should only be done when the court is convinced and where it was served on him personally. It is extremely important that this be done only under those circumstances. It is true what the hon. member for Vereeniging said, that it is a high authority. However, the court must be satisfied that the person did in fact take note of what happened. For that reason I support the amendment by the hon. member for Musgrave.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when one looks at clause 54(2)(a), one finds that one is dealing here with different aspects. In the first place there is the serving of a summons on the person himself; a summons must be served to the person himself. There are altogether four different aspects. The first, serving a summons on the person himself, I have just mentioned. In the other three cases a summons may be served at a person&#x2019;s residence, place of employment or business. In other words, if it is not served on the person himself, there are three other places he must nevertheless be at some time or other. After all, he has to be either at his residence, his place of employment or his business, if the summons is not served on him personally at some other place. Neither is the summons served to any person at his residence, his place of employment or business. It is only served to a person over the age of 16 years.</p>

<p>Sir, he may be absent from his place of business, but at his place of business there would most certainly be somebody who would come into contact with him. But I want to continue. This provision has been in operation for a long time, and all the spectres seen by the hon. member have never yet come to life. The provision has always existed, but suddenly, because it has been taken over from the old Act, the hon. member now objects to it.</p>

<p>Like the hon. member for Vereeniging, I also want to dwell on the period of 10 days to which reference is made in subsection (3), and to which the amendment by the hon. member for Houghton relates. Subsection (3) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A summons under this section shall be served on an accused so that he is in possession thereof at least 10 days (Sundays and public holidays excluded) before the date appointed for the trial.</block>

<p>What it actually amounts to is that the period is longer than 10 days. Some period or other has to be laid down. It may be 7, 10, 14 or 21 days, but somewhere a limit must at least be fixed. Provision is now being made for a period of 10 days, and surely that is sufficient. What does the hon. member want in place of that&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will first deal with the amendment by the hon. member for Houghton. I am of the same opinion as the hon. member for Krugersdorp. I really cannot see what a tremendous difference there is between 10 and 14 days.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because it has always been 10 days. The 10-day period, as provided for here, is actually very close to 14 days when you take Sundays and public holidays into consideration.</p>

<p>Sir, the amendment by the hon. member is only intended to bring about change. That is all she envisages as far as that is concerned and I therefore do not accept it.</p>

<p>With regard to the proposal by the hon. member for Musgrave, I completely agree with him that the courts are hesitant to issue a warrant for arrest if they are not quite sure that the summons has been served properly. But &#x201C;properly served&#x201D; does not mean &#x201C;served in persons&#x201D;. When one looks at the existing article 309(3), one sees that it has to be served &#x201C;properly&#x201D;. For many years the practice was that one could leave the summons, at a person&#x2019;s residential address, his place of employment or wherever, with somebody who is apparently over the age of 16 years, if one could not get hold of the person himself. I do not believe that difficulties have ever arisen in this regard. Why do we have to make a change now&#x003F; Under the present Act the position is the same. Why can we not insert the present provision here&#x003F; Sir, it is a useful provision. Sometimes it is very difficult to serve a summons on someone personally. Somebody who lives in a place like Stilfontein will know how difficult it is to serve a summons personally on a mine-worker who works shifts. He will know how many times he has to travel back and forth to get hold of such a person. Such a person is absent, but his wife or grown-up children, persons over the age of 16 years, are there. They then accept the summons. In how many cases do the people not react to it&#x003F; There are a few instances when they do not react to it, but then there is the alternative mentioned by the hon. member for Musgrave. One must then go to the courts and an application must be made for a warrant for the person&#x2019;s arrest. I said that the courts are hesitant to do this, but if it appears from the report that the summons was served on the person&#x2019;s wife or on another adult person who also lives there, the court would be quite inclined to issue such a warrant. I cannot see why we must deviate from a system which has worked so well for many years, also with view to the fact that no arguments have been advanced to indicate that it has an adverse affect on our administration of justice.</p>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F; The hon. the Minister talks about serving a summons on the wife of the person concerned, or perhaps on adult children, but surely there may be other people, other adults, at the place where the summons is served. There may be a servant who then forgets about it, or something like that. Is the hon. the Minister satisfied with these all-embracing provisions&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 15 and 16, to omit &#x201C;in terms of paragraph (a) of that section&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In a certain sense this amendment is consequential upon the amendment moved by the hon. member for Musgrave on the previous clause, but I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that the fact that he has not accepted the previous amendment does not change the position with regard to this amendment, because we now have the position where the House has agreed that a summons will be properly served if it is served in terms of clause 54. The effect of my proposed amendment is merely that the court may not issue a warrant <span class="col_4867-4868" refersTo="page_0987"/>of arrest on such a summons unless the court is satisfied that the summons was served on the accused. In other words, it removes the effect of the provisions of paragraph (a) of clause 54(2). It will still mean that the objections of the hon. the Minister will be met, namely that the mine-worker, for example, cannot be found, that he is often away and that you cannot serve the summons on him at his home. You can then leave the summons there and it will be regarded as having been served, but under those circumstances the magistrate may not issue a warrant of arrest unless he is certain that the accused has received the summons, because it must then have been served on the accused. In those circumstances, Sir, I submit that the hon. the Minister can accept my amendment, even though he did not accept the previous amendment. I want to relate to the hon. the Minister the type of problem that can be created by this section, and this is my own personal experience. I may say, Sir, that somebody, with my car, committed a parking offence in Johannesburg and a summons was then issued. The summons was served on my mother, who is living in our house. This was during the last parliamentary session. It was perfectly good service on my mother at my normal place of residence; of course, I was down here in Cape Town in Parliament. I did not receive the summons because my mother forgot about it, and when I got back home I discovered the summons in a drawer and I immediately went to the magistrate&#x2019;s court and found that a warrant of arrest had been issued. Fortunately it had not been served yet because they hold it over for 14 days normally.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I did not press the amendment which I moved in the previous clause because of the possibility of securing the position in this clause in terms of an amendment such as that moved by the hon. member for Florida. I rise now, Sir, to urge the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment. This amendment will ensure that a warrant of arrest will not be issued unless the court is satisfied that the summons was actually served on the accused. I would submit that the hon. the Minister should have no objection to accepting this amendment. On the contrary, it is an amendment which I would imagine the hon. the Minister would wish to accept because it ensures that no warrant of arrest can be issued except where the summons has actually come to the notice of the accused and the court is satisfied in that regard. The hon. the Minister must be aware that there have been cases where a warrant of arrest has been issued in cases where a summons has been served in terms of this previous procedure, namely by simply leaving it with a person who was apparently above the age of 16 years at the person&#x2019;s place of residence, employment or business, and where it has turned out that the accused has not had notice of the summons, either because the person has forgotten to bring it to the notice of the accused, as in the case mentioned by the hon. member for Florida, or for some other reason. In such instances it could be harmful to the accused person. One can envisage that the accused may perhaps be a person of some prominence and that the newspapers, as has happened, publish the fact that a warrant of arrest has been issued against the person concerned. He then has to come to court and explain that he has not received the summons and the warrant is withdrawn, but in the meantime this person has been arrested.</p>

<p>In my submission no person should be placed in that position. It is not sufficient that he has the opportunity, once arrested, to explain that he has not received the summons. The embarrassment of being arrested, of being brought to court under arrest, is not overcome by the fact that he can make an explanation subsequently. I would therefore be pleased to hear the attitude of the hon. the Minister because it seems to me this amendment is a very reasonable one and it is not necessary for me to motivate this any further.</p>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members of the Opposition are apparently <span class="col_4869-4870" refersTo="page_0988"/>losing sight of three basic aspects. In the first place, the magistrate is not compelled to find such a person guilty of an offence when he appears before him then. He has a discretion. The accused only has to furnish an explanation and the magistrate has the power to accept his explanation. In the second place, the Opposition is losing sight of the fact that this Bill also lays down that admission of guilt for lesser crimes&#x2014;when we get to those clauses, this will be evident&#x2014;may now also be paid after arrest, and even after the day on which the case&#x2014;according to the summons &#x2014;would originally have served before the court. This is a relevant aspect. In the third place, the hon. members of the Opposition are, to my mind, unnecessarily worried, because in terms of this Bill we are placing such logical and easy and simple bail-procedure on the Statute Book. If a person suddenly finds that he forgot to go to court or that his mother or his grandfather or his aunt or his sister or his daughter did not give him that summons, then it is the easiest thing in the world&#x2014; if he does not want to go to court or run the risk of being sent to prison because he did not appear&#x2014;for him to accompany the police officer to the police station and to arrange for bail, R10 or R15 or whatever it may be, depending on the seriousness of the crime, and to pay the amount of the bail and to go home. He will then have to appear on the fixed date. I do not think this is so dangerous and I think that we can trust our courts in this respect. I think that the amendment which has been proposed, is really unnecessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging has just given the Committee all the reasons for exactly why this amendment should be accepted. He says he can go and do this and that and all sorts of things, but why should he, if he has not in fact had personal notice of the summons&#x003F; Then the hon. member says the court has a discretion, and that when he comes before the magistrate, the magistrate can hear his explanation and if it is a good one he will accept it. But before that happens, he is brought before the magistrate on a warrant of arrest which is issued as the result of a return of service.</p>

<p>I want to say that the provision which is applicable at the moment reads that if any person fails to appear at the hour and on the day appointed for his appearance to answer any charge and the court is satisfied on the return of the person required to serve the summons that he was duly summonsed &#x2026; &#x201C;duly summonsed&#x201D; means in terms of the existing Act &#x201C;service in accordance with the provisions of the Act&#x201D;, which is not always personal service. But in relation to those words &#x201C;duly summonsed&#x201D; the Supreme Court has ruled, in cases where magistrates have issued warrants for the arrest of a person, and in fact on convictions for contempt of court, that this is not a proper procedure unless there has been personal service of the summons proved to the magistrate. I think that is a proper attitude, the attitude of the Supreme Court today. That is what this proposes. It proposes that we should put in this Bill what the Supreme Court has said is right and proper and reasonable. I am sure the hon. the Minister will accept that amendment.</p>

<p>No. It could be useful because such a person could collaborate with his wife, his good lady. He could always be absent when the summons is delivered and she would then receive it. It is in many instances the case with miners who are working all sorts of shifts.</p>

<p>*That is where the difficulty arises. Under the present provisions such a person is <span class="col_4871-4872" refersTo="page_0989"/>never properly summonsed and this is the only way in which this can be done. Of course, by &#x201C;proper summonsing&#x201D; I mean the different forms of summonsing. Because this system may be abused and may be abused to a large extent, it may be, rendered completely powerless and the magistrate will never be able to issue a warrant. Therefore I cannot see my way clear to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I am rather interested in the authority quoted by the hon. member for Durban North. I should like him to tell me in which case the Supreme Court gave that ruling.

<p>There are only 35 minutes left. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I intend to deal with this matter seriously now. There are a great many clauses still to be dealt with in this Bill and we still have not come to the more serious clauses in this Bill which obviously are going to have quite lengthy opposition from us. There are only 35 minutes left for debate this evening and I would submit that I am not exaggerating the position when I say that we shall not finish the Committee Stage of this Bill this evening [Interjections.] I do not think that it is unreasonable, if the hon. the Minister intends to consider this case seriously to which the hon. member for Durban North has referred, to ask that this clause should stand over. If, on the other hand, his attitude is that he is not going to consider it, then of course we shall have to continue arguing the clause. Frankly, as it does appear to be the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude, that he does not wish to give consideration to this case, I must point out to the hon. the Minister that he must make a distinction between the method by which that summons must be served which is dealt with in clause 54 and the issuing of a warrant of arrest. We have already passed the clause which provides that the summons may be served not only personally, but it may also be served by leaving the document with a person above the age of 16 at the place of business, employment and so on. Clause 55 now deals with the next stage, the stage as to when and under what circumstances a warrant of arrest may be issued.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. the Minister is not going to agree that it should be possible to issue a warrant of arrest where the court is not satisfied that the summons has come to the notice of the accused. This is what his argument suggested: That it is perfectly convenient to issue a warrant of arrest despite the fact that the summons has not come to the notice of the accused person. If that is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s contention, then, frankly, his view of what is reasonable and mine differ very greatly. In my view it is most unreasonable that a person should be put to the embarrassment and the indignity of having a warrant issued against him when he has not even received the summons.</p>

This does not help him; he is still put to the indignity of having been arrested. The alternative suggestion of the hon. member for Vereeniging does not help either. He said that once such a person is arrested, he can go with the policeman to the police station where he can pay bail and then be released from the arrest.

Should he be expecting anything of this nature, he would just say, &#x201C;I do not take receipt of a summons; I shall be down in the mine or under the bed, but I am not taking receipt of it. You must receive it&#x201D;. In terms of clause 54 of the Bill this is a proper form of serving. If the amendment were to be accepted, it would not be possible to arrest him if he failed to put in an appearance, even if the summons had been served properly and had been received by his wife. To me the matter is quite elementary. This is not an imaginary possibility; it is something that does happen.</p>

<p>In other words, this is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s major problem. But I want to tell him now that I have no problem in that regard. There is a simple reason for this. If the magistrate issues a warrant for the arrest of such a person, surely the policeman must serve the warrant on him personally. In order to arrest the person, it is necessary to get hold of him. If he gets hold of him in order to arrest him, he can also do so in order to serve a summons on him. It is so simple. Surely this is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s whole problem. If a policeman can get hold of the person in order to arrest him, why then can he not personally serve the summons on him&#x003F; I think this solves the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s whole problem.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir. Particularly in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister obviously agrees with the arguments advanced by this side of the House, I believe that under those circumstances, too, he should agree that we are proposing a good amendment here, and that, since this is also the practice in the courts at present, it should remain the way it is in terms of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let us just analyse the arguments of this hon. member right from the beginning. A warrant will only be issued in terms of clause 55(2) if the court is satisfied that the summons has been served on the accused and that there is a return to this effect before it. That return is defined in a clause which we have already dealt with here, viz. clause 54(2). That particular clause places an onus on the official who serves the summons to give meaning to this most important word in the clause, namely &#x201C;apparently&#x201D;. In other words, the person described in the summons must &#x201C;apparently&#x201D; be employed or residing at a certain place. If, therefore, the return comes before the magistrate concerned, he will, in terms of this clause, have to examine that return very carefully in order to see whether that official who served the summons did his duty, and whether he made sure that the accused &#x201C;apparently&#x201D; resides there. If the court is not satisfied that the official who served the summons did satisfy himself that such an accused is &#x201C;apparently&#x201D; employed or residing at a certain address, it will not take steps in terms of the subsequent clauses. Let us now dismiss the first part of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument by saying that the court has a specific task here, namely to interpret a return.</p>

<p>The second aspect of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is that if a person can be found for the purposes of arrest, he may just as well be found for the purposes of receiving a summons. What the hon. member forgets, is that if officials who serve summonses are continually to be made available by us for the purpose of executing a process in the same way as is done in the case where a person has to be arrested, that would involve a tremendous delay in the serving of those processes. We cannot use the exceptional case which the hon. member has referred to, and which he now wishes to elevate to the status of the general norm, for bringing about the more speedy disposal of the serving of processes. I think that this ought to be a decisive reply to the argument advanced by that hon. member. This legislation does not seek to provide for the absolute exception, but for the general, the most common, and we have here sufficient precautionary measures to prevent a warrant being received by a person who is apparently not residing at a certain place, because the presiding officer in the court will have to give an interpretation to that return.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s problem and that of those administering this aspect <span class="col_4877-4878" refersTo="page_0992"/>of the law. But, first of all, I think that one must realize that this particular clause has application to what one could term &#x201C;offences&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;crimes&#x201D;. It refers mainly to traffic offences, municipal regulation offences and matters of that nature, where a summons is normally issued, and in respect of which I suppose a large percentage is accompanied by admissions of guilt. First of all, there is a sifting out of the summonses to the extent that admissions of guilt are paid immediately upon receipt of the summons. But then we come to the second stage. I am not certain, but perhaps the hon. the Minister has some indication of the statistics, say in one of the metropolitan areas, indicating the percentage of this type of summons issued which are not acted upon, i.e. where the recipient or the accused, does not pay an admission of guilt or appear in court on the day of the trial. I believe, subject to correction, that the practice, as far as the Cape magisterial district is concerned, is that, where the summons has been served personally, there is no question that a warrant of arrest is issued. But where there is not proof of a personal service, namely in instances where a summons is served on somebody else, the individual is warned to come to court on a certain date. He is then visited personally, and not arrested. He is informed that there is a warrant for his arrest which has been issued. He must attend court at a certain time and give an explanation as to why he was not there on the first occasion. If it is accepted, of course, the warrant is withdrawn and nothing happens. If he does not give a satisfactory explanation, he then pays his fine for contempt of court in addition to being dealt with for the charge on the summons. I believe that system works fairly effectively in the Cape magisterial district. I am not certain what the practice is in other areas. It seems to me that here one is looking for some intermediate step instead of the drastic step where one cannot be certain that the individual who is now to be arrested, is in fact aware of the fact that a summons has been issued against him. It is that clause which presents the difficulty. As the clause stands here, once the magistrate issues the warrant of arrest, then strictly in accordance with the law that warrant should then be executed. The way that is being done in the Cape magisterial district is really an administrative alleviation of the law, although it is not in terms of the law. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could help us by indicating to what extent this is necessary. How many of these are, for example, being issued at the present time in one or other of the major magisterial districts&#x003F; I want to emphasize that the type of person who is being charged here is charged for an offence and not so much for a crime. After all, a man who has committed anything of a serious nature would have been arrested initially. Or if he is out on bail he would certainly be aware of the fact that there is a charge against him and that he has an obligation to appear in court on a specific day. These summonses, on the other hand, are sent out to persons who have not paid dog licences, or because they have not done this or that, e.g. in contravention of municipal regulations. I feel that in those circumstances it is harsh that there should be a provision in the law that, which if carried out to the letter&#x2014;which one expects the law to be&#x2014;would incarcerate people, or at least have them arrested while they have not really committed an offence to justify such severe action. The hon. the Minister might assure us that he will look at this again to see whether if a warrant has been issued that it is not executed without the accused having been warned to appear in court. The hon. member for Florida is quite correct that personal contact must be made if you are going to execute a warrant of arrest. It can just as easily be done by a personal directive or a person saying to an accused, &#x201C;I have a warrant for your arrest and if you are not in court at such and such a time and on such and such a day, this warrant will be executed&#x201D;. It certainly does not release that individual from the obligation, if he does go to court on that warning, of explaining why he was not there on the first occasion and being subjected to a fine for contempt of court if he in fact failed to act in accordance with that first summons.</p>

<p>The expense involved in this must be eliminated and hon. members opposite must realize this. All extra steps, such as those the hon. member for Green Point has just suggested, actually create additional documents which again make it more difficult to bring such a person before the court. As he rightly said, and this is why it is so strange to me that they are still opposing this matter so obstinately, it is a fact that a person who has committed an offence can, in any case, be arrested. I shall indicate at a later stage how much it costs to bring people before the court, in respect of parking tickets alone, by means of summonses or personal service. Here it is quite simply a matter of the problem of administration and I therefore support this provision.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope I will not contravene your request that there should be no repetition. I would like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to two aspects which I feel have a relation to this particular clause and to the thinking that has motivated the Opposition to ask the Minister to take some form of change into account.</p>

<p>Firstly, let me tell the hon. the Minister that it was my privilege as a student to read one of the finest contributions ever made to the law of evidence by a great jurist called Best, an English jurist, who stated that most people, most witnesses, talk the truth. If that were not so, he says, the whole of the machinery of the law would grind to a standstill and could never accomplish the maintenance of proper law and order in society. That is human reaction, but fortunately, he says, for those who study the law of evidence and the intricacies thereof it is evident that most people tell the truth. That is the first point I want to make. The second point I want to make to the hon. the Minister is that one of the main objectives of this legislation has not been to draw up a new Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act because the present one was <i>per se</i> old; its objective is to bring it up to date. In other words, its objective is to have some sense of reform in regard to what is taking place, to bring up to date the methods that are being used in view of the experience we have had. The hon. member for Green Point made reference to what happens in the Cape. All practising lawyers know that with all serious crimes warrants for arrest will be issued. With any crime of note a man will be arrested and brought to court where bail will be negotiated. If he is arrested over a week-end the question of bail will be arranged by the senior officer in charge and the man will be released to appear the next day. But he will have been apprehended. To the average type of case this service is not meant to apply and there is a relevance also on the civil side, where inquiries into debt have met with the same experience. There you can serve documents on a person or on somebody over the age of 16, an adult person in his employ or on his man or maid servant. Very often it is served on a Banty person many of whom are in fact illiterate. Let me put this to the hon. the Minister: If we are to save expense as the hon. member for Vereeniging has endeavoured to suggest, then you will find that on average most people will appear in court. In accordance with Best&#x2019;s point of view, you will find that on average most people will appear in court. Therefore you are saving time and the procedure is satisfactory. By all means serve the summons on a person or on someone in his employ who is over the age of 16.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I will give it to you in a moment. By all means, as I have said, serve the summons on him because on average you will find that the form of collusion to which the hon. the Minister referred, is rare. It is not usually the case. I need not tell the hon. the Minister his business. I do not even need an interjection to encourage me because I have a high regard for the experience of the hon. the Minister, who himself has been in practice for a number of years. In my opinion he is a man who has studied the law and knows the law. As the hon. the Minister himself knows, the position is that the average person <span class="col_4881-4882" refersTo="page_0994"/>will appear in court. This form of collusion is rare. The experience in Johannesburg, particularly with regard to municipal matters&#x2014;just to answer the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s question&#x2014;shows that, if they do not appear and the evidence shows that they have not been served personally, it is asked that a personal summons be served. They do not issue warrants of arrest if a summons has not been personally served. Thousands of traffic summonses are issued in Johannesburg and there are quite a number of people who rely on the possibility of getting free if they have not been served personally, but eventually they are caught up with. However, the average person is an honest person just as the average person will tell the truth.</p>

<p>The plea here is not made to meet the particular case which the hon. the Minister mentioned. The plea here is to avoid a person, who unfortunately does not have the document given to him, from suffering the indignity of being arrested. It could happen to each and everyone of us&#x2014;ordinary, honest people who find that a summons is served to a maid-servant or man-servant who may be an illiterate person who does not even understand what the exigencies of the occasion are when the summons is served and consequently thrusts it away. So a man may quite innocently not even be aware that he has to appear in court. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether from an administrative point of view, a point of view of justice and a modern approach in the administration of justice, it is right to retain something which does not even work in terms of the actual statute. Even some of his people have questioned this. Over a number of years it has been borne out, as has been pointed out so well by the hon. member for Green Point who is also a practising lawyer, that this system, administratively, does not work in terms of the actual statute. As we are reforming it and bringing it up to date, why should we not put the position in its truest and most practical way&#x003F; It will not encourage breach of the law; it will not encourage contraventions; it will not encourage dishonesty or subterfuge. I feel that it is to our credit that, in the administration of law in this country, the average person is not dishonest, nor does he stoop to subterfuge. My final point, so as not to repeat myself, is that if we did find that to be the case, God help us in the administration of law in this country or any country.</p>

<p>Ordinary people also commit traffic offences. The largest proportion of the summonses are, of course, in respect of traffic offences, which, by law, are offences as my hon. friend indicated. The hon. Minister, however, says that it is a good thing to serve summonses not only personally, but also to a place of business, a place of residence, and so on. That is fine. According to him it is good to have that service because you get an awful lot of reaction from it even though there has not been a personal service. That is a perfectly valid point. We do not object to it. It has the benefits the hon. the Minister talks of. However, that is not the point. What disturbs me about what the hon. the Minister has said here is that he has indicated that he wants, in fact, a warrant of arrest to be issued if a summons has not come to the attention of the accused.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is what it comes to. Even if he does not have personal knowledge of the existence of the summons against him, the hon. the Minister says he still wants a warrant of arrest issued and he wants him brought before the court. That is a most unreasonable attitude ! It is most unreasonable for various reasons; one of those reasons is that the offence for which he has been arrested, the offence in respect of which the warrant of arrest has been issued, is the offence of contempt of court. That offence is only committed if you are in wilful contempt of the court. You cannot be in wilful contempt of the court unless you knew that you should have appeared before the <span class="col_4883-4884" refersTo="page_0995"/>court. What the hon. the Minister has in fact suggested is that he wishes the situation to occur where persons in respect of whom there is no <i>prima facie</i> proof of the fact that they have committed an offence for which they are to be arrested are not summonsed, but arrested so that they can be brought before the magistrate. Such a person will then explain why it was that he did not get the summons. He might not have seen the summons at all. I think the hon. the Minister will concede that this attitude is not only unreasonable but that it is against the whole spirit and tenor of the present laws. If this is going to happen as of course in every case, the hon. the Minister will find that he will get no cooperation. If an attitude like this is adopted, he will find, because this is so manifestly unjust, an interpretation given to it by a Supreme Court which will then be binding in that area. Then somebody will find a few loopholes and everyone will take all the loopholes. What happens at the moment&#x003F; At the moment they do not take the loopholes, as the hon. the Minister has said. Even though there was not strictly personal service, if they know about the summons and if it comes to them somehow, they will then go to pay their admission of guilt. This happens, as the hon. the Minister conceded, almost every day. Therefore I wonder how many people the hon. the Minister thinks this is really dealing with. I hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us that my interpretation of what he said is not in fact correct because I would hate to feel that my interpretation was in fact correct.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the half-hour&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think any Prime Minister in my time in Parliament has faced the discussion of his Vote with more problems unsolved and more problems piling up, and so obviously piling up, as the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon. I think with the limited time available in this debate, one can only deal with a few of those problems, but I want nevertheless to take this opportunity of underlining certain of them.</p>

<p>Less than four weeks ago in the Budget debate, I described the Budget as a gamble. I think in the short time that has passed since it has been introduced, the signs are more than evident that in so far as the Budget is concerned, the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government have gambled and lost. I think they knew, or should have known, that since they could not contain inflation, since they could not contain the ever-rising living costs because of the policies they have followed over the years, their only hope was to promote economic growth, which could give rise to higher living standards for our entire population&#x2014;Black, White and Brown. Sir, growth has posed a problem to this Government in the past and it is continuing to pose a problem for it at the present time. Our population is growing faster than that of almost any other country in the world today. As a result the improvement in our living standards has tended to fall far behind the improvements in many of the civilized countries of the Western world and to fall even behind the rate of improvement in countries such as those in the European Common Market, where they have highly developed countries. I believe that today the situation is even more serious. It is more serious today, Sir, because living costs are rising at a much higher rate than the growth rate of the country. Last year our growth rate was of the order of 3,7%, while living costs from March last year to March this year increased at the rate of very nearly 10%. Most economists, I think, foreshadow an even bigger rise in the coming year. If one has regard to the rise in February, then the annual rise is going to be of the order of 13%. If one has regard to the rise in March, then the annual rise is going to be of the order of 16%. It is interesting, Sir, to see what that is going to mean to people with small fixed incomes, to pensioners, to some of the employees of the hon. the Minister of Railways earning less than R200 a month and to many of the poorer classes of people in South Africa. One notices that when there was a rise of 8% in the cost of living in the United States of America the President, Pres. Nixon, found it necessary to warn the nation that an annual increase in living costs of 8% was unacceptable.</p>

<p>Sir, what happened here&#x003F; In the No-confidence Debate I raised certain economic issues with the hon. the Prime Minister. The hon. gentleman was not prepared to discuss them. He said that they could stand over until the Budget debate took place. Well, Sir, we have had the Budget debate, but we still have not got any <span class="col_4887-4888" refersTo="page_0997"/>answer. You see, Sir, living costs are rising faster than ever and the Government is as incapable as ever of containing inflation. No doubt the hon. the Prime Minister will say today that he is not going to discuss economic problems with me because there is going to be a Third Reading of the Appropriation Bill later on this session.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell the hon. gentleman that the people&#x2014; die volk daarbuite&#x2014;are suffering more and more and becoming more and more conscious of the utter incompetence of this Government when it comes to dealing with this issue of the cost of living and the ever-rising inflation. It was most significant, Sir, that after the Umhlatuzana by-election the leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal, the hon. Senator Horwood, ascribed the Government&#x2019;s poor performance to the fact that the United Party had fought on bread-and-butter issues, issues which it was not easy to counter, he said. Sir, let me tell him, and let me tell the hon. the Prime Minister, that these issues are becoming even more difficult to counter at the present time because they are affecting the livelihood of all our people, and they are leading to more and more dissatisfaction, to more and more bitterness and more and more privation. The strikes we had earlier this year were merely symptomatic of the sort of situation that was developing. The strikes were also symptomatic of the unfairness of the gap between White wages and non-White wages, which has not only developed under this Government but has grown even bigger and has been accentuated under this Government in the time that it has been in power. The whole trouble, Sir, is that this Government is prevented by its own policies from applying the only solution that is really left open to it today, and that solution would be to have a far faster rate of economic growth so that the income <i>per capita</i> of the population would rise. Then, in spite of inflationary pressures, the standards of living of the people in the country would also be higher.</p>

<p>But, Sir, an improved growth rate is important for another reason, too. If we grow fast it improves our position and our importance in the outside world, but it also ensures that we can give employment to those 50 000 Blacks who are coming on to the labour market every single year and looking for work in South Africa. Sir, people who study this matter and are able to make enlightened forecasts are unanimous about one thing, and that is that if we are to achieve a growth rate of even the 5&#x00BD;% to 6% per annum which is envisaged by the Economic Development Programme, then within seven or eight years we are going to require in South Africa far more skilled people than the White population can supply, and where are those skilled people going to come from&#x003F; Of course, Sir, immigration is a possible solution, but the figures at the moment are not the least bit encouraging, and there is no doubt whatever that we will not get adequate supplies of skilled people through following a policy of immigration. Accordingly, the only solution is the training of our non-White population, to become not only factory operatives, but also skilled workers, and it is precisely in this sphere that the Government has fallen down in the past and appears to be falling down at the present time. Sir, how much training is actually going on&#x003F; Much of the training is done on the quiet; there is no permanency; there is no job security, and more and more we are falling behind in the number of skilled workers we need to try to maintain a decent rate of growth.</p>

<p>Sir, some years ago in a Budget speech we heard from the hon. the Minister of Finance that steps were to be taken in respect of the training of non-Whites. That statement evoked tremendous interest amongst the businessmen and industrialists of South Africa, but the hopes to which that statement gave rise were very short-lived, because within a matter of a few days we had a statement from the Minister of Labour and a statement from the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development which conflicted with the statement of the hon. the Minister of Finance and which made it perfectly clear at that time that nothing really serious was envisaged, that nothing really realistic was going to be done. Of course the hon. the Minister of Transport ignored both these statements and went happily on his way consulting his staff and his artisans&#x2019; associations and using non-Europeans in ever more responsible jobs inside his organization. We suggested crash training programmes for Whites and non-Whites, to be trained for more skilled work. One of our members, the hon. member for Hillbrow, even introduced a private Bill providing for manpower training, but <span class="col_4889-4890" refersTo="page_0998"/>nothing whatever was done. Now, once again, we have had a statement from the hon. the Minister of Finance. We had a statement in his Budget concerning pre-service and in-service training of non-Whites in industry. This has been supplemented by a statement by Dr. Van Zyl, the Secretary for Bantu Education, about the steps being taken by his department in regard to a system of training factory workers. But what he said makes it perfectly clear that we are a long, long way from the training of skilled workers necessary to get the sort of growth rate which will be essential if we are to maintain our living standards, let alone improve them, in the face of the inflationary pressures to which we are subjected at present. There was also an interesting statement from the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in the Other Place, which seems to conflict with certain of the policies of the hon. the Minister of Labour, which makes them more interesting on that account. The hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs told us that in consultation with his staff association he is training non-Whites amongst other things as electricians. Coloured and Indian electricians are apparently to be used by the Post Office throughout South Africa. Bantu electricians are apparently to be used in the Bantu homelands and in the Bantu areas inside white South Africa. Now, I do not propose to quote what the hon. gentleman said. I take it he accepts that I am not misrepresenting what he said. But of course it is only a matter of time before the Bantu also will be used throughout South Africa as electricians, as skilled electrician artisans, because the hon. the Minister is going to find himself in the position where there will be a shortage of skilled personnel to do that work. Now, whether he takes this step sooner or whether he takes it later is not really of much importance. What is of importance is what system of communication and negotiation is going to be used with these workers in spheres outside the Post Office. Because as sure as night follows day what he is doing in the Post Office and what is being done on the Railways is going to be done by industry in South Africa very soon. Now, what system of negotiation, what system of communication, will be used in respect of these people&#x003F; Quite clearly a system of works committees will be totally inadequate to cope with workers with the status and the skills of artisans. This matter has been debated in this House before and it is quite clear that the Government&#x2019;s approach in this regard is totally unrealistic. The failure of the machinery which it has called into being was only too evident earlier this year when there was a series of strikes by Bantu workers, the overwhelming majority of whom were unskilled workers. When those strikes took place it was quite clear that the machinery existing at the present time was quite inadequate. It led to adjustments in wages because of the inflationary situation which had arisen. Now, as the hon. the Prime Minister knows, those strikes were virtually all illegal, yet so far as I know no steps were taken to prosecute either the strikers or those who organized the strikes. I think we all realize that a new era in industrial relations in South Africa has been rung in as the result of what has happened. What we want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister today is how the Government intends coping with this situation in future. Some system of collective bargaining to cover not only the unskilled workers, not only the semi-skilled industrial workers, but the increasing number of skilled Bantu workers now and in the future has got to be evolved and it has to be evolved quickly.</p>

<p>I said earlier that if we are to attain anything like the growth rate which is essential for improved living standards in South Africa, we are going to require far more skilled artisans than the White population can supply. Those skilled artisans are going to come from the Bantu population. If we want to have industrial peace in South Africa, then a system of collective bargaining will have to be evolved for those people, but nothing which the Government has proposed to date comes anywhere near meeting this problem. We, on this side of the House, have indicated that that collective bargaining should, in our view, be on a three-tier system with full trade union rights for the educated and most highly skilled, with affiliated membership through the existing trade unions for those not so highly skilled or highly educated and with works committees for the tribal Bantu doing manual and totally unskilled work. However, as yet there has been no indication of a realistic approach from the Government side. [Interjections.] Let me say at once that the Bill published for information by the hon. the Minister of Labour in the <i>Government Gazette</i> is certainly not the complete answer in so far as the skilled and more highly educated Bantu workers are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_4891-4892" refersTo="page_0999"/>The essential economic growth and development which will have to be sought by this Government is going to raise certain other problems for it. One was mentioned only the other night by Dr. Van Zyl in his broadcast when he spoke of the importance of trained industrial workers being retained permanently in the White area. You will notice it is true that he spoke only of &#x201C;temporary permanency&#x201D; but it is quite clear that if we are to have economic growth, we are going to require an ever-expanding permanent labour force of trained industrial workers in our White areas. No suggestion of border development to meet this problem can ever be entertained realistically at all. Unfortunately I do not have the time to quote what the hon. gentleman said. However, I should like to refer to an article which appeared in <i>Tegniek</i> of April this year in which it is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar word dan ook algemeen aanvaar dat daar &#x2019;n permanente Bantoe-arbeidsmag in die stedelike gebiede gaan wees, selfs al is dit tydelike permanensie.</block>

<p>They then go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is seker nie verbasend dat gebiede soos Rosslyn naby Pretoria en Hammarsdale naby Durban snel ontwikkel het nie, maar in die meer afgele&#x00EB; gebiede het ons geen ontwikkeling verkry nie. Wat het ons hiermee reggekry&#x003F; In die mate dat die beleid suksesvol was, het ons die stroom van Bantoes na die stede gekeer, maar dit gekanaliseer na ander gebiede wat ook Blanke-gebiede was. Onthou, die grensgebiede was almal binne die grense van die Blanke-gebiede en nie in die tuislande nie.</block>

<p>Nor is there any prospect, now or in the future, of industrial development in the reserves being either of the order or at a rate which will give us the industrial growth rate we require in South Africa or will give job opportunities for the Bantu coming on to the labour market every year. This is what they say in <i>Tegniek</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wat die ontwikkeling van die tuislande self betref, het ons nie gevorder nie. Om die waarheid te s&#x00EA;, vir &#x2019;n geruime tyd was dit teen die owerheidsbeleid om Blanke-kapitaal te gebruik vir die oprigting van sake-ondernemings in die tuislande. Dit sou goed wees as ons konophou om geesdriftig te kere te gaan oor onbenullighede en liewer die hande uit die moue kon steek (en in die sak) om iets te doen wat die moeite werd is om te cloen. Ek ys by die gedagte dat ons dalk &#x2019;n verdere 20 jaar wil sit en toesien dat Gods water oor Gods akker loop.</block>

<p>This brings me to another facet of the problem with which the Government is faced and in respect of which it has been quite incapable of giving us an answer up to the present time.</p>

<p>That is that this Bantu labour force is not only going to become permanent but that it also is growing. It is growing in numbers every year; it is growing vastly in numbers and it is becoming one of the most rapidly expanding portions of our population in South Africa. If we are to have the economic growth which is vital to our survival as an industrial nation and which is vital to improved living standards and good race relations, which in turn are essential for our security, that population of permanent Bantu workers must not only grow, but it must grow at a faster rate than it is at the present time. It is precisely in respect of this population that the Government has no answer at all in its present policy. I have raised this matter in this House on many occasions before and I have indicated that the urban Bantu population has been the flashpoint historically, and will undoubtedly continue to be the flashpoint, for racial disturbances in South Africa. The mere fact that by a fiction their permanency is not recognized, that they are given no proper stake in the maintenance of law and order, that they have no political rights where those political rights are of any importance to them, and that is where they live and where they work, that their families have no security and tenure and that they are still regarded as temporary sojourners, makes the situation the danger that it is. The hon. the Prime Minister will be aware that we on this side of the House asked our Native affairs group to consider the whole position of the urban Bantu over the last year. That group toured the country, visited all the big complexes where these people were situated and tried to make contact with those whom they regarded as representative of them. They contacted and held conversations with as many as they could of those whom they regarded as representatives of these people. They sought out those whom they believed could give them an insight into the thinking <span class="col_4893-4894" refersTo="page_1000"/>and into the aspirations of these people and into the problems of what today has become a very big section of our community.</p>

<p>The findings of that group were revealed by the hon. member for Transkei when he spoke in this House earlier this session. Those findings bore out very much the policies for which we have stood in the past, but what was interesting was that they evoked no response whatever from the ministerial benches. There was no response whatever; in fact, one got the impression that the Ministers concerned were indifferent to the views of hon. members on this side of the House in respect of that situation. What was important from our point of view was to find how much support there was from leading members of the Bantu community for the proposals which we on this side of the House have put before the Government in the past and fought for so long in this House. There was a very real appreciation for our proposals that they should be allowed to have home ownership in their own Bantu townships, for undisturbed family life, for a greater say in local government, for assistance in the development of a responsible class of urban Bantu, for better educational facilities and for the development of the use of their skills in the national interest. I do not propose to read from that report, but those facts are all covered. All these matters have been raised before, but they are of greater importance today because the hon. the Prime Minister is faced with the situation that many of the leaders of the Bantu people are no longer striving&#x2014;if they ever did strive&#x2014;for the ultimate objectives of Nationalist Party policy, of Government policy. They are no longer prepared to accept independence on the terms on which the Government is offering it to them.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman is faced with the fact that he has to try to accommodate these people in the plan which he envisages for the future of South Africa. So far what have we had from the hon. gentleman&#x003F; All we have had from him so far is an indication that if the various homelands were not prepared to accept independence on his terms, the situation would continue as it is at the present time. This is obviously ridiculous. If he plans for and believes in self-determination as he says he does, then the choice that he gives the present and former inhabitants of the various homelands cannot simply be independence on his terms or a continuance of the existing situation. That is not self-determination, not by any definition. Any suggestion that that is self-determination, or will be understood as such, is utterly ridiculous.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to lose my trend now. I will deal with that later. He knows that all thinking members of the public know that the present situation cannot continue either indefinitely or for a lengthy period of years. The situation is going to change and the hon. the Prime Minister is going to find out what self-determination means. He is going to find out that the future of these people is going to become the subject of negotiation between the hon. the Prime Minister and these people. He is going to find that if he wants to continue to use Black labour as he does, that Black labour is going to have a very material say in the terms on which they are used and on the position they occupy in the country. Then the hon. the Prime Minister will find out what self-determination means. Then he will find that he is dealing with people who have got something to offer and something to lose and who can exercise a very real influence on the course of events in the country in the future and at the present time.</p>

<p>What we want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister today and what the country wants to know is what his answer is going to be to this situation. He is faced with this problem to a limited degree with the Coloureds and the Indians, but thus far he has given us no satisfactory solution. Even his own people appreciate that he is in difficulties there. I do not believe that he has a real answer in respect of the urban Bantu population either, this vastly growing section of our community. We on our side of the House have made our views clear but the hon. the Prime Minister, I submit, has offered us no realistic solution whatsoever. To suggest, as he has suggested in the past, that these people will be satisfied with some form of political representation in their homelands, which can have little or no effect in the areas in which they live and make their living, is utterly ridiculous; just as it is utterly ridiculous to suggest that they will be satisfied with no adequate means for collective bargaining to determine their conditions of employment. These questions are fundamental to the future of South Africa; <span class="col_4895-4896" refersTo="page_1001"/>they are fundamental to future peaceful race relations in South Africa. I believe they have been evaded by the Government for too long. The time has come to get clear answers not from an odd Minister, but from the hon. the Prime Minister himself. The country wants to know what his blue-print for the future is and how he hopes to deal with these problems.</p>

<p>We are living in a time of change; things are changing far more rapidly today than ever before in our history. There have been unbelievable scientific advances which have clothed us with new powers, but are also presenting us with new problems in a world which is changing more in a matter of weeks and months at the present time than it did in decades in the past. The population is increasing out of all knowledge; improved means of communication are bringing the people of the world closer together than ever before. We have no hope whatsoever of believing that we can continue to live in a state of isolation or that we can remain unaffected by what is happening in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House will always try to adopt out policy wisely to the changing situations in the world. In our plan there is an important place for the Coloured people; there is an important place for the Indian people; there is a place for the urban Bantu and there is a place for the Bantu in the homelands. There is also an appreciation for what the might of the White man has meant to South Africa and for the contribution he has made. There is a recognition of the fact that that contribution deserves to be recognized and to be appreciated. But there is also a realization amongst us of the fact that times are changing and that adaptations are necessary. The essential weakness of the Government&#x2019;s policy is its &#x201C;either or&#x201D; approach. We all know the Government&#x2019;s approach. Complete equality or complete separation; complete independence or complete subjugation; and no acceptance of the possibilities offered by new experience and new development. I believe those policies will not only lead to disaster, but are in fact leading to disaster at the present time. We feel that the time has come for the hon. the Prime Minister to give this House a clear statement on the solutions that he is offering to the questions which I have raised. We feel that time is now. With the world changing as rapidly as it is, I do not believe that the hon. gentleman can remain silent any longer. I urge him not to fail South Africa in this regard this afternoon. If he has a reputation for anything it is a reputation of one who is concerned with the safety of the State. Let me tell the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon that the safety of the State is dependent upon the answers which he will give to these questions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us deal with the facts. I am not running away from the facts. What I said was that with this condition of rising prices, what had made our position so difficult was the extent to which the United Party in that campaign had exploited the position. [Interjections.] There are members of my party here who heard me say this at a public meeting. I said it quite openly. Do you know what one of the United Party campaigners said in Umhlatuzana&#x003F; He said that the cost of living in South Africa was rising more rapidly than anywhere else in the world. I said that was a complete and utter distortion and it was virtually impossible to answer that sort of distortion in the course of a campaign like that when you are dealing with the rank and file voter. But let us look at the facts. This hilarity on the part of the Opposition let us look at the facts and see what they look like then.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition <span class="col_4897-4898" refersTo="page_1002"/>comes here and gives us today a complete statistical fallacy, an absolute logical fallacy. He says that the cost of living is rising faster than the growth rate. The growth rate he quotes is the real growth rate. In other woods, the Leader of the Opposition comes here and says the cost of living is rising by, let us say, 7&#x00BD;% or 8% on the average &#x2026; [Interjections.] I am dealing with official statistics. Then, he says, you take the actual increase in the growth rate, which is about 12% per annum at the moment in terms of the rand as we measure it, and adjust that by the rise in the cost of living and you find it is then 4%. The cost of living is therefore rising faster than the rate of growth. [Interjections.] Now I ask you! At least the hon. member for Durban Point did not try that one at Umhlatuzana, because even the humble housewife would have laughed in his face. I listened to the same fallacy in the Other Place last year and several of us took time off to try to explain this. Yet we come here today and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition simply repeats it as a fact. It is completely illogical and means nothing at all. You have to compare the increase in the cost of living with the increase in the actual rate of growth in terms of the current rand, and that is 7&#x00BD;% with 12%. I will tell hon. members something else: That 12% increase in the current rate of growth per annum is at the moment one of the fastest in the world. Would hon. members like to deny that&#x003F; I said in the No-confidence Debate that one could count on fewer than the fingers of one hand the number of countries that can beat us in that respect. I repeat the challenge today to members of the Opposition&#x2014;to name those countries.</p>

<p>What is the position&#x003F; We have just had the latest announcement by the chairman &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member sitting at the back should rather listen; he might learn a few facts. The chairman of Union Acceptances, Limited, whom our hon. friends opposite know quite well, has just said in his chairman&#x2019;s speech&#x2014;and it has been given headlines in the paper&#x2014; that incomes in South Africa at this moment are rising faster than the cost of living. That is the position as we have been stating it all along. Increases in salaries are substantially higher than the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>There is another point, another simple fact: In real terms, the growth rate is increasing by at least 4% per annum today. The population is increasing by 2&#x00BD;%. A Std. 6 pupil would conclude from that that in actual terms, the standard of living is rising in South Africa today. That is the position.</p>

<p>Sir, we are told that America has shown us how to deal with the increase in the cost of living. Have hon. members seen the latest figures published in the papers over the week-end&#x003F; The cost of living has suddenly shot up so high in America that, on the basis of the last jump in March, they say that&#x2014;at the moment they abandoned phase 2 of their fight against inflation and embarked on phase 3,&#x2014;the cost of living could rise by 15% to 20% in the coming year. They say it could happen; I do not say it will. That is the position at the moment. This is the country we are told to look to.</p>

<p>Again in the last few days we have been told that we lag in the growth rate. We have just had the latest figures for the European countries, official statistics which show that the average figure is under 3,8% per annum at the moment. Last year it was 3%. These figures include all the countries, and in neither case can the percentages be compared with ours. That is the position. I just want to ask the hon. Leader of the Opposition and the members on his side a simple question. They talk about the cost of living and how to counter it. I want to ask a few simple questions. They talk about the rise in the cost of living and say that we are not countering it. What is their policy&#x003F; We have not heard a single remedy. I want to ask them: What are the classical, established remedies for countering the rise in the cost of living&#x003F;</p>

I challenge them to say whether we are wrong in concentrating on stepping up production and productivity in every possible way.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, they talk about the urban African and the homelands. My hon. colleagues and friends on this side of the House will be able to answer that, but I want to say this in the minute I have left: I would like any member on that side to tell me in what country in the world, in the last 15 to 20 years, there has been such a fantastic achievement in the provision of housing for non-White people as there has been in South Africa. I want them to name one. I have travelled a lot and I have kept my eyes open. I have seen nothing to compare with this. That is the sort of issue which of not raised.

<p>Yes, one by one. But why cannot we impose these classical remedies&#x003F; We cannot impose them because the country is in the state where we have worse than stagflation, because we have a growth rate of probably less than 3% &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>What is nonsense&#x003F; [Interjections.] The growth rate was 3%, maximum, and we have an inflation rate which is running now at 10%. This is what prevents us from using the normal classical methods of curbing inflation. Our growth rate is too low and it is too low because of the policies of this Government. That is why we cannot use the classical remedies. I want to tell the hon. the Minister and the House that when we discuss this question of inflation we are not speaking for ourselves. We are speaking for 22 million people in South Africa who are wilting under the pressure of unprecedented inflation, inflation of a degree that they can no longer tolerate. The people who are paying the price of inflation have lost confidence completely in the Government&#x2019;s ability ever to halt inflation. They have lost confidence with very good cause, Sir. Year after year we have had measure after measure imposed upon the public of South Africa in the guise of curbing inflation. We had the compulsory saving levies, we had higher taxation, we had monetary controls, all to fight inflation. They were all measures that hurt the individual and they were all measures that retarded the expansion of the economy of South Africa. All this was done to stop inflation and what was the result&#x003F; In 1967 inflation in South Africa was 1,8%. In 1968 it was 2.7%. In 1969 it was 3,5%. In 1970 it was 4,2%. In 1971 it was 7%. In 1972 it was 7,4% and at the moment, from March to March, it is running at 9,86%. And the hon. the Minister is happy! [Interjections.] If one projects these figures on a graph, God alone knows where we are going to. But what is the attitude of the Government&#x003F; That inflation is imported, that inflation is a world phenomenon and that we have done the best we can to stop inflation. Those are the three classic reasons we are given time after time. There is some truth in them, Sir, but only in part. Inflation is imported but only to a very limited extent. Inflation is a world-wide phenomenon. Of course, it is, but the countries of the world are tackling it, and in the other countries of the world we do not have the high rate of inflation that we have here, with a low rate of growth&#x2014;what I call &#x201C;dragflation&#x201D;. And, Mr. Chairman, <span class="col_4901-4902" refersTo="page_1004"/>they certainly do not have something which is peculiar to South Africa, something that happens in no other country in the world. I refer to one of the remedies against inflation, namely the using of your potential labour, which is not allowed to be used by law in this country. You see, Mr. Chairman, we get the hon. the Minister of Finance telling us that &#x201C;there are, however, factors which may perhaps later during the year exert a restraining influence on the rising trend of prices&#x201D;. This is all we have had from the Government as to what is going to happen with regard to inflation in South Africa. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that that statement impresses nobody, and I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that he has a situation on his hands at the moment where the feeling of the public is one of utter helplessness when they talk about the cost of living. They are in a situation of complete perplexity as to how to cope with a situation over which they have already lost control. The wife is asking the husband month after month for a bigger allowance, and when the husband, if he can &#x2014;because his means are stretched taut&#x2014; manages to give the wife a little more housekeeping money, by the time the end of the month comes, she is in the same position in which she was when she asked for the increase because there has been a rise in prices all over again.</p>

<p>Sir, it is no longer only the lower income group that is finding itself in trouble. This applies to every single income group in South Africa, except for the very rich. Even the wealthy, the higher income group, the middle income group, the lower income group and, of course particularly the non-European, just cannot take this any longer, because a rise in prices, or inflation, is a cumulative process. If the rate of inflation last year was 4% and it is 2% this year, it does not stop there, because the 2% is on last year&#x2019;s 4%. And what have we had&#x003F; We had 7% in 1971, then 7,4% in 1972 on top of that, and if this year we are going to have 8, 9 or 10%, it is going to be a cumulative position, so it is no longer a question of a rise of 7 or 8%; we are running into rises of 21%, 22% or 23% over a period of time; that is what is happening to us in this country today, because the base changes all the time. When in 1970 we had a base of 100 and there was an increase of 7%, the increase in money terms was 7%, but in this year, when we probably have a base of 122, a rise of 7,4% will represent an increase of 9%. That is what is happening to us. Sir, prices are rising all along the line. The prices of foodstuffs and services are rising all along the line. The public is not concerned with statistics. I do not want to go into the increase in the price of butter and cheese and what have you, because there are hundreds of other items that one never even hears about. Rates and taxes are up; the cost of refuse removal is up; water services are up; electricity is up; bus fares are up; holiday accommodation is more expensive; telephones are up; the cost of school books and school equipment is becoming impossible for the average person; the cost of school clothing is up; dry-cleaning is up; shoe repairs are up; even the price of a haircut is up to R1-50. They wanted to cut my hair today, Sir, at that price! Even hon. members opposite will realize what it means when you have to pay R1-50 for a haircut, and I am sure the hon. the Minister of Finance will support me here ! We also have the situation where prices controlled by the Government are rising. Because of this vicious cycle, the cost of producing controlled commodities is going up and the Government has got to allow those prices to be increased. We are finding ourselves in this cycle which is jamming us and which is affecting every single person in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, what is the position that we have arrived at as far as the man in the street is concerned&#x003F; We have arrived at the stage where he is fearful of what is going to happen to himself and his family, if not next month, then the following month. The public are worried sick, Sir. That is the fact of the matter as far as inflation is concerned today. We can talk from morning till night and the hon. the Minister can make comparisons between South Africa and other countries of the world, but the reality of the situation in South Africa today is that people are terrified of their own futures and their ability to take care of their own families if prices are going to continue to rise as they have been rising in recent months. The hon. the Minister of Finance fights inflation but he is thwarted by his colleagues on one occasion after the other, and we have the situation where one begins to feel that the Government does not really care. We have a front-bencher from the Government getting up and moving a private member&#x2019;s motion thanking the Government for what they have done to stop inflation. What do you think the public&#x2019;s reaction to this is, Sir&#x003F; The reaction is that the Government is fooling with <span class="col_4903-4904" refersTo="page_1005"/>the question of inflation. That they see no urgency about the question of inflation. That they are not concerned with what happens to the public and the burden they have to bear as the result of inflation. Sir, let us make no mistake about it: I think the country is entitled, where you have a situation such as that, where you have the situation that on an annual basis inflation is running at the moment at the rate of 16% per annum, to have assurances from nobody less than the hon. the Prime Minister himself that every arm of Government will be utilized to curb inflation before this country ends up in tragedy; because we have tens of thousands of people in this country who cannot afford to buy the bare necessities of life. The hon. the Prime Minister is as concerned as we are with that problem, and he also knows that unless we are going to get an expansion in our economy following the lines mentioned by my hon. leader, we are going to have the twin problems of high inflation and of insufficient job opportunities, and the hon. the Minister has already told this House how he feels about it.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Parktown really astonishes me this afternoon. The hon. the Minister asked him what his solution was to inflation, and then he replied: &#x201C;No, but I am in the Opposition; I need not tell the Government.&#x201D; But what kind of politician is he then&#x003F; What kind of party are they&#x003F; If he does have a solution to inflation, then he should go to the people and say, &#x201C;This is my alternative; this is my solution.&#x201D; And if he has a just alternative, surely he can take over the Government. But apparently he is the kind of politician who does not want votes and does not want to sit in the Government benches either. But, Sir, I say they have no alternative. They cannot provide an alternative. The hon. member for Parktown has destroyed himself here.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>I am telling the hon. member for Parktown that his party has no alternative. Sir, he contradicted himself. He made the statement here that all the Government speakers would rise and say that there was inflation throughout the world, that the same position obtained in other countries, that we were not interested in that in South Africa, and then went on to say, &#x201C;Yes, but we have it in the world; we have that situation and we cannot argue that away.&#x201D; Then the hon. member compared the rate of inflation of 1969 and 1970 with the rate of inflation we have today. But he cannot compare the two. Surely he knows that there are various kinds of inflation, that the structure of the rate of inflation is the result of three or four components. Surely he knows that the inflation of 1970 was demand inflation and that the inflation prevailing today is basically cost inflation, owing to seasonal food problems which we had and over which the Government had no control. He knows, secondly, that this is inflation caused by cost increases in countries abroad and also by the devaluation which we had and over which the Government also had no control. But it seems to me as if the Opposition has seized upon the Vote of the hon. the Prime Minister in order to start a fight about inflation and to make a fuss about it, and as the only solution to it, the hon. member for Parktown spoke about our labour policy. I should like to know this from him, and I think the hon. member for Houghton also wants to know this. The hon. member spoke about our labour policy, and if he wants to solve inflation in that way, it means there has to be an absolutely free inflow of labour throughout the country and that any person can go and sell his labour at the best price. This is what he says, and this is also what is said by the Progressive Party. This is their policy, and I understand it and I accept it. But what in the name of Heaven is the policy of that party&#x003F; The hon. member for Yeoville says they are applying influx control. But what do they really want now&#x003F; On the one hand he pleads for that; he uses the policy of the Progressive Party. But now I also want to tell him this: Even if he had a free inflow of labour, and even if he applied the policy of the Progressive Party, he would still not escape from inflation, for in any country where there is complete integration one still has inflation, and today only 3% of the labour force is protected by job reservation. Then I want to tell him that at present Bantu labour is being enjoyed to the full in South Africa.</p>

<p>That hon. member may go to the border areas and he may even enter a homeland and establish a factory there and he may use as much Bantu labour as he pleases. Those hon. members want the Bantu to pour into the urban areas, where we would then have to provide them with employment at the same or at a much higher cost than that at which they can be provided with employment in the homelands or the border areas. No, the factories must go to the homelands and there we shall provide the Bantu with employment. However, that will not result in our evading the problem of inflation, for inflation is an international problem which we cannot evade. I shall come back to that later on.</p>

<p>Now I want to come back to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The speech made by him has astonished me more than has any other speech I have ever heard. He said that the hon. the Prime Minister had so many problems. Allegedly no previous Prime Minister had ever had so many problems. I think the hon. the Prime Minister has fewer problems than any previous Prime Minister had. How many problems does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not have! [Interjections.] Consider the problems his party has! We should like to hear about the burning problems and issues of that party. We should like to hear how things are with the <i>Sunday Times.</i> We should like to know to what extent the <i>Sunday Times</i> has now become the Opposition of this Government. We should also like to know who is in charge of the United Party. I see the <i>Sunday Times</i> has now elected a new leader for the United Party. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is now the chief leader of the United Party and he is also the person who is supposed to become the Leader of the Opposition. It does not seem to me as though the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has found out as yet how his party&#x2019;s federal policy works, for the hon. the Prime Minister invited him to come forward with it, once he has found out what is what, so that the federal policy may be discussed. However, not a word has been said in that connection. One would very much like to hear what happened in connection with that meeting on the Rand, when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had to go there in order to argue with his own people, in order to make it clear and justify to them that his party is, after all, still the party which wants to support the maintenance of the security of the state in this country. So far he has not discussed these matters, yet he refers to the problems of the hon. the Prime Minister! His own party does not even want to accept the fact that certain members of his party are serving on that commission and want to promote the security of the state. Therefore, who is talking about problems&#x003F; No, I want to say that he has major problems.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to escape from his problems, and in order to do so he followed the safe course of talking about economic matters. He blamed us for the inflationary conditions. He levelled the accusation at us that we could not effect a satisfactory growth rate. He did omit something though, for it has after all become fashionable now to level accusations at us in connection with devaluation. He might as well have done that, too. He should have said that we should not have devalued, for all the Opposition speakers have after all become clever enough now to tell us in retro-respect how we should and how we should not have devalued.</p>

<p>The statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, i.e. that our growth rate has failed in this country, is quite incorrect. Such a statement is completely unfounded. After all, the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs did explain very clearly that a growth rate such as ours was a real growth rate&#x2014;i.e. 4% after inflation. On a previous occasion the hon. the Minister of Finance explained to the hon. member for Constantia that it was a profit, an addition to the extent to which we had goods available and rendered services. It is an asset in the sense that the people&#x2019;s standard of living has risen correspondingly. The hon. member is complaining about the growth rate of 4%, but he should tell me who prepared the Economic Development Programme. It was not the United Party, nobody in the outside world, not a person who acted as an umpire, but we, this National Party, we prepared it ourselves. We prepared it at a target rate which was considered to be ideal. What happened&#x003F; Unfortunately we cannot surpass ourselves, and we are sorry about that, but the fact that we have still had a growth rate of 4% is very encouraging. Then I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that one may not judge these matters on one year&#x2019;s results only. These matters are very difficult and very delicate. Our country <span class="col_4907-4908" refersTo="page_1007"/>has an annual gross domestic product of approximately R13 000 million, and it is not always possible to prepare estimates and to say that one wants to have a certain percentage of growth within that framework. In respect of the one year one&#x2019;s estimates may be 1% too high and in respect of the other year one&#x2019;s estimates may be 1% too low. Something of that nature must be judged over a period of 5 years so as to obtain a mean. Only then can one judge it and say whether or not we were successful. I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that if he tells the country that we have failed, I want to tell him that we may have failed in terms of the level we set ourselves as an ideal, but that we have not failed the country. We have had more than enough growth for meeting the added needs of our population and for absorbing all our people into the labour market. Hon. members must show me whether there is any unemployment in the country. That is something one does not see. That is the basic principle of a growth rate. I think that this idea of the Opposition, i.e. always to attack us on the basis of our growth rate, is quite wrong.</p>

<p>Now I come to another point. I want to tell the hon. member that we have in fact succeeded in controlling our inflation. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. overlooked aspirant deputy has not done his cause very much good this afternoon. We have heard that the answer to inflation is to discuss the United Party&#x2019;s race federation policy and the <i>Sunday Times.</i> That is the new answer to inflation. For that hon. member&#x2019;s benefit, let me remind him that we have put our alternative in all the economic debates and we make no apology for coming back to the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon with a demand for answers to the questions raised by my hon. leader. We make no apologies because when all the plans have been planned, all the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s dreams have been dreamed and schemes have been schemed, when you have dissected budgets, when you have talked of imported inflation, cost-push inflation, demand-pull inflation and all the rest, at the end of it all the hon. the Prime Minister is still responsible for the fact that 20 million mouths have to be fed in South Africa every day. There are 20 million mouths which should be fed three times a day but which in fact are not being fed three times a day as is the case in millions of South African homes. The hon. the Prime Minister is responsible for a Government &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I said that there are millions of people in millions of homes in South Africa today who are not being fed three times a day but who are only eating twice a day. They are only eating twice a day for two reasons. Firstly, they cannot afford it. Secondly, the Government policy means that they have to get up so early in the morning that they do not have a chance to eat before they travel to work. The hon. the Prime Minister is responsible too for roofs over the heads of 20 million people. Then we have the hon. Minister of Indian Affairs, the leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal, whom even the housewives of Umhlatuzana do not believe and which they showed quite clearly in the recent by-election. He quoted figures. He can quote all the figures he likes but when we deal with the basic problems of the housewife and of the breadwinner who has to feed the mouths of his or her family, the hon. the Government shrugs it off. When we talk about the increase in the price of bread we are asked why they do not eat brown bread. Hon. members will remember that in this House this year the hon. the Minister of Agriculture or one of the members said: &#x201C;Let them eat brown bread&#x201D;, when we complained about the increase in the price of bread. There was somebody else who said: &#x201C;Let them eat cake&#x201D; and what happened to her!</p>

<p>I think that this Government has completely lost touch with the ordinary people. It has lost touch because it has sheltered under the umbrella of privilege. When we tell of the difficulties and hardships of people here, the Government translate it into economic theory. I have heard hon. members on that side of the House and on this side say over recent weeks: &#x201C;I cannot come out on an M.P.&#x2019;s pay&#x201D;. An M.P.&#x2019;s pay is over R500 per month. Members on both sides have said that they cannot come out on it. And they indeed cannot. Many of us, if we did not have other incomes, could not decently bring up our families on the pay of an M.P., which is about R540 per month. But the hon. the Minister of Transport has in his department 83 000 Whites earning less than R300 <span class="col_4909-4910" refersTo="page_1008"/>per month. I have the figures here: There are 83 000 earning between R101 and R300 per month; there are nearly 47 000 earning between R200 and R300 per month and 36 000 earning between R100 and R200 per month. It is those people we are talking about. If those people are Whites, what about the non-Whites&#x003F; We have tried to get it across and I am trying to think of a new way of getting across to the Government what their glib percentages which the hon. the Minister of Tourism talked about mean to the housewife.</p>

<p>I want to try today to get across to the hon. the Minister what it means. I have here a loaf of bread. For this loaf of bread a person used to pay 10 cents or 11 cents. Today he pays 18% more. I have cut off 18% of the loaf to demonstrate what the Government has done to the bread-eater of South Africa. The family of five which used to get the full loaf of bread, now gets 18% less for the same money. Either one member of that family does not eat or five people have to eat that much less. The potato I have here cost six cents this morning. These fives potatoes cost 30 cents. Through the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Government&#x2019;s administration a man who six months ago could buy those five potatoes, one for each member of his family of five, can now buy only three potatoes. The other two have gone into inflation. The hon. members laugh! They are laughing because I have shown to them in real terms what inflation really is, what inflation really means to the mother feeding her children, what inflation really means to the breadwinner who has to scrape out an existence on his R50 or R60 per month and to whom a 10% theoretical inflation rate&#x2014;which does not affect those hon. members&#x2014;means that much less bread for his children to eat when he gets home with his pay at the end of the week.</p>

<p>When we talk of inflation we are talking of the problems of the people. We are talking of the problems of the people who must be fed and who want to bring up their children to be decent South Africans. We talk of imported inflation, but there is such a thing as hunger inflation. I do not accept the cost of living index, because that is based on an average basket of food. However, the low income group of people in South Africa do not have that average basket of food; they do not have that average spread of expense which makes up the statistical index which is quoted here by all the members. The hon. the Minister of Planning comes with his index&#x2014;that is all fine in theory, but the lower you come down in the income scale, the more basic food fills that basket. It is not the motorcars, the cinemas and luxuries that fill the basket, because those have disappeared. When you get down to the man earning R10 per week, that basket consists almost entirely of food. He has lost all the other luxuries. What he has left in that basket is food. When we come to food, a Chamber of Commerce calculated&#x2014;and I quote from its <i>Digest</i> of 14th April&#x2014;that on food alone a person who before required R36 per month to feed a family of five, in January, 1973 required R43 per month to feed that same family. That loaf of bread is cut even more. More and more of the staple foods are the ones that are going up. In two months this year over 1 000 items of food, canned and fresh, increased in price from 4% to 25% and 30%. I do not have the time to list them but I have examples of them here. The price of milk went up again this year. You cannot cut a bottle of milk as you can cut this loaf of bread. You still have the bottle for which you must pay more. It means that you buy less and that people all drink less. Meat today is almost an unheard-of luxury in many homes, certainly a joint in any working man&#x2019;s home is an absolute luxury. These things have gone&#x2014;have disappeared&#x2014;from the normal life of people. Those members laugh &#x2026; [Interjections.] [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I shall give it to the hon. member if he does not know it.</p>

<p>If the hon. member wants to listen I will instruct him, as a teacher, so that he will know something in a short while, including how to prescribe a policy for his party. What is self-determination&#x003F; Before a nation can have command of itself, one must at least give it some content; one must lead it to that spiritual emancipation; one must lead it to a kind of economic and political independence before it can adopt the attitude of an independent, self-determining nation. While we, the White nation, are still the guardians, it goes without saying that we must place them on the road to development, so that they may eventually conduct themselves with self-determination. But what do the hon. gentlemen want&#x003F; They want us, as guardians, to allow the Black man, when he reaches independence and self-determination, to use his self-determination to destroy our self-determination as a White nation. That is what it is all about. There is not only the striving towards self-determination as far as the Black man is concerned; there is also the self-preservation urge on the part of the White man. These appear to be two conflicting urges; but I want to tell you that we can reconcile them beautifully. It is specifically this policy of Christian guardianship, whereby the Black people, the Coloureds and everyone are being placed on the road to development, so that they can eventually find themselves. It is this self-preservation urge on the part of the White man and the Black man&#x2019;s urge to self-determination that can be reconciled in this way. The policy of separate development is a policy of reconciliation in this respect. It takes world opinion into account and even takes into account what the U.N. says. The U.N. knows that the world is going through very difficult times in the sphere of human relations, more difficult than ever before. There they have an international machine and also an inclination to try to neutralize the impacts between nations, thereby bringing about peace, and to ensure quiet, peaceful relations between states. But that is exactly what we are doing. If they want to lead the states to international maturity, it is our task as a White nation also to place these separate peoples on the road to development, so that one is not master of the other. They must not all occupy the same living area, they must live in adjacent areas as independent states on a basis of mutual esteem and respect. What is wrong with that&#x003F; That is also self-determination. The end product of our policy is that when <span class="col_4913-4914" refersTo="page_1010"/>these nations have self-determination, with our policy we will have led them to take up a place as full-fledged states. Surely one does not only serve one&#x2019;s own people, one also serves the world, humanity. That is what we are doing. That is why I hold it very much against the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for having said that the Bantu will not exercise this right to self-determination as we want to prescribe it to them. But let me say this: We are the guardians, after all; they are the wards. &#x201C;They are the wards and we are the guardians.&#x201D; It is wrong in principle for the wards to prescribe to the guardians.</p>

<p>Long after the hon. member is dead. For how long&#x003F; It is a natural development that must be taken the full length. Can the hon. member then not understand that the relationship of Christian guardianship is not that of an M.A. Bantu to an M.A. White person; it is the relationship of one people to another. We as Whites are the key to the solution of this complex problem. It must be expected of this guardian to determine the policy on a sound basis, a dynamic policy that will not result in the people remaining in a kind of servitude. We are not oppressing the people. But hon. members want to give them freedom, and in what way&#x003F; To cause tension in the same Parliament&#x003F; Do they want freedom over the bodies of White and Black people when it comes to revolution in this country&#x003F;</p>

Does the hon. member now understand it&#x003F; Sir, I want to state it clearly again: The Opposition is now doing again what they did when the present premier became Prime Minister of South Africa. Then the Leader of the Opposition played the same game. When he is afraid of confronting the Prime Minister, he comes along with the kind of capers he displayed here today. That is why that side of the House falls so flat. That is why they have to allow the film actor of Umhlatuzana to stand up here with his bread and vegetable basket. Why did he not refer to tomatoes as well&#x003F; He was afraid the hon. member for Yeoville would hold it against him. That is the trouble.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Chief Whip on the Government side, who normally tries to emulate the Prime Minister in his joke telling, today fell flat completely. I do not want to devote any time to him. The subject under discussion is the economic situation in South Africa, and more particularly the labour issue. I want to return to the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs who was at one time a professor in economics. He showed surprisingly little perception and understanding of what is happening in South Africa. He is so happy with himself because he says that our growth rate compares well with that of other countries. Why does he not tell us that we have 50 gold mines&#x003F; Where do you have another country in the world with 50 gold mines&#x003F; Why does he not tell us that we have the biggest untapped reservoir of labour in this country that you find in any of the free enterprise states in the world&#x003F; But in any case, Sir, he ought to know that you do not compare our growth rate, in a young economy, with that of mature countries. It is a totally different situation, and he ought to know that.</p>

<p>What we are driving at is that in South Africa, to secure our future survival, we ought to have a rapid economic growth rate. We have all the ingredients to ensure a rapid, non-inflationary growth rate. We have liberal natural resources. We have, as I have indicated, a vast reservoir of labour. We have entrepreneurship of a very high calibre. We have all the investment capital that is necessary. And we have a trade union movement that is on the whole responsible. But why is our growth rate so depressingly low&#x003F; Why is our economy so sluggish&#x003F; Why can the Government not cope with inflation&#x003F; Because of the Government&#x2019;s own policies. They have failed in the first instance to evolve a long-term cohesive economic strategy for South Africa. Secondly they have failed because of their antediluvian approach to the labour issue.</p>

<p>I should like for the moment to concentrate on this labour issue. Was it not from <span class="col_4915-4916" refersTo="page_1011"/>the Treasury benches that we were told that this Government would bend or break the laws of economies to conform to an ideology&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he supports that point of view. And what has happened&#x003F; To-day we are plucking the fruits of this economic short-sightedness of the Government. You see, Sir, they now realize that they have made a disastrous mistake, and they are trying to change their direction. But if they did so, they would blow up the whole myth of their ideology. That is why all these adjustments they are making are made in such a half-hearted way that they will have no impact at all.</p>

<p>What is happening is that pronouncements on labour now seem to come from the hon. the Minister of Finance. He probably is to a lesser extent compromised on this issue than some of his other colleagues are. Last year he told us that provided industrialists observed normal social conventions, they could make freer use of labour. What does that mean&#x003F; This year he has told us that they can now have pre-service and in-service training. But the hon. the Deputy Minister told us today that this would only extend to operators. So what does this add up to&#x003F; Here is a patient who is dying; he is pining away and they are giving him Aspros. That is the situation we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>Let us look at the latest statistical position, Sir. I want to draw my statistics from the EDP, as was issued to us recently. In 1970-71 the real output per worker in South Africa increased by slightly more than 1%, whereas the EDP projected an output growth rate of almost 3%. That is the kind of situation that has developed. In secondary industry, which is the generator of our whole economic system, it in fact declined by almost 2%, and there the projected output growth rate was more than 2%. That is why we have inflation. It is not what we import from outside, but what is being done here, and in fact what is not being done here which leads to inflation.</p>

<p>What is quite apparent too is that there are major distortions in the distribution of our labour force. I contend that this is primarily due to the Government&#x2019;s ideological obsession. When you look at the composition of our labour force you find that almost 30% of the people who are economically active are employed in agriculture, and yet their contribution to the GDP is only 9%. In secondary industry, on the other hand, we employ 13%, but their contribution to our GDP is 23%, and in the tertiary sector we employ about 13%, but their contribution to the GDP is 37%. Sir, here you have the two most productive sectors of our economy and the Government, by virtue of their ideology, is inhibiting the growth in these sectors. What is of even more concern to us is that the Government or Public sector itself employs nearly 14% of the total labour force of South Africa, yet their contribution to the GDP is only slightly more than 9%. Mr. Chairman, here we have one of the fundamental problems of South Africa. Forty-five per cent of the people employed in the Government sector are White; this compares with 19% for the whole of South Africa, but do you know, Sir, that of all the White people in South Africa who are economically active the Government sector employs 30% of them&#x003F; Even worse than this is the fact that 44% of all graduates and diploma-holders in South Africa are employed in the Public sector. Don&#x2019;t you see, Sir, what is happening&#x003F; The Government is syphoning off all the cream of our labour; most of the high-level skills are being employed by the Government, and yet their output level is lower than that of any sector of our economy, and this is a direct result of their ideological obsession. This situation will get worse; it will not improve; it will become endemic; it will have a self-generating sort of force until there can be a complete change in approach.</p>

<p>Sir, we are continually asked from the other side, &#x201C;What is your solution&#x003F;&#x201D; I want to put a few to the hon. the Prime Minister, because I think the country expects him now to react to this labour issue. I think there are certain short-term remedies and also longer-term ones. The first short-term remedy is that the Government must drop all these ideological plans, because what is happening is that ideology is seriously retarding our economic development. What the Government does not realize is that if this happens it will in fact inhibit the achievement of their ideological objectives in any case. I think the second thing that the hon. the Prime Minister must realize is that his whole organizational system is wrong. He has four Ministers dealing with labour now&#x2014;not only the Minister of Labour, but the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the Minister of Indian Affairs and the Minister of Coloured Relations. Sir, labour in South <span class="col_4917-4918" refersTo="page_1012"/>Africa has become indivisible. The hon. the Prime Minister must put one man in charge of labour. I think in the third instance he must realize that his present Minister of Labour has failed; he is inadequate to deal with the immense problems which face us. He has forfeited the confidence of both organized industry and of the trade union movement, and I think the hon. the Prime Minister should find him one of these cushy diplomatic jobs that he seems to reserve for his cabinet failures.</p>

<p>In the fourth instance, Sir, we will not get on top of this situation unless there is greater mobility of labour in the vertical sense. People must be able to move up in the hierarchy of jobs and they can never do that as long as you perservere with job reservation. They must also be able to move laterally; they must be able to move from the less productive sectors of our economy to the more productive ones, and the Physical Planning Act is planned to stop precisely that movement. Sir, in the fifth instance, the industrialists must be given the green light; they must be told to make optimum use of our human resources. The hon. the Prime Minister tells us every second day that he wants to narrow the wage gap between White and non-White. I say to him now, Sir, that he will not have success in narrowing that wage gap unless our real growth rate is 7 % a year or higher. You cannot do it unless you have a high growth rate. The hon. member over there says that there is no unemployment in South Africa. This is rubbish, too, because the figures camouflage the real state of affairs. But let me accept for the moment that there is not a high unemployment rate in South Africa; then I want to say that our labour force is probably the most under-employed one in all the industrial states of the world. There are a series of long-term steps which obviously ought to be taken. We must phase out the migratory system because you cannot build up a modern economy on the migratory system. Secondly, there must be far more emphasis on education. All the work that has been done overseas shows that increases in output and in productivity to the extent of 80% stems from improvement in education, and only about 20% from increased capital investment.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>We have just had another typical example of how the United Party operates. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, should just have told us whether he was a member of the United Party or of the R.R.P. We would like to know whether he is a member of the United Party or of the &#x201C;Rejuvenated Reformers Party&#x201D;&#x003F; Listening to him, we can come to no other conclusion than that he and the hon. member for Port Natal and the hon. member for Wynberg are definitely members of that party. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must tell us where we stand with this R.R.P. or the H.V.P., the &#x201C;Hervormde Verenigde Party&#x201D;. I say it is time they told us. This argument concerning labour which the hon. member advanced here today, is one we have been hearing year after year under this Vote. However, the hon. member knows we can duly discuss those matters when we come to the Labour Vote. [Interjections.] Let me say to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central that if he had been a traditional U.P. supporter, I would still have listened to him, but I pay no attention to a testament United Party supporter. Year after year we hear this sorry about labour. There is only one policy which they want and that is this: Throw open the flood-gates and abolish influx control. By this time we are sick and tired of that story.</p>

<p>However, I should like to dwell on another matter for a moment, one which to me is far more serious and of far greater importance. Sir, throughout the world the Republic of South Africa has always been noted for the peace which prevails here. We have the highest degree of industrial peace. This is a factor which has contributed enormously towards the foreign investor, the economist and the industrialist investing their money here in South Africa. I say that this is a factor which has resulted in these people not only investing their money in this country, but also playing a tremendously important role in the sphere of industrial development. But recently a cloud has appeared on the horizon, one which is somewhat disturbing. As far as industrial peace in this country is concerned, there is disturbance and confusion, and I should like to dwell on that for a moment. It is something of which we must make a very serious analysis and when we do this, some very important questions arise. One of the first questions is why we now have that threat of more and more strikes. Is it simply as a result of the lower wages which are allegedly being paid to the Bantu&#x003F; I want to say at once that this is not the only reason. It seems to me that <span class="col_4919-4920" refersTo="page_1013"/>there are certain militant influences which are active behind the scenes and which are the cause of this labour unrest which is rearing its head these days. I am the very last person, and this applies to the National Party as well, who is opposed to justified increases in wages, whether for Whites, Bantu or Coloureds. But I say that there are unambiguous signs that there are influences, and here I want to refer directly to certain influences in this country. I refer to Nusas. I also refer to certain groups of students at some of our universities and, yes, I want to refer to the &#x201C;Young Progs&#x201D; who have been coming to the fore recently. These are the people who are creating labour unrest in this country. In making these accusations, I want to tell you, Sir, that I do not wish to do so lightly, nor do I wish to drag in innocent people. Even businessmen, every employer, every person in this country is worried about this situation. Now I want to ask you, Sir, where does this inclination to strike which has taken root come from and who is behind it&#x003F; I say that Nusas is behind it and I want to refer to a report which appeared in the <i>Financial Gazette</i> of 6th April, 1973, under the heading, &#x201C;Militants behind Black strikes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>We find that the Police officials who conducted investigations into the strikes by the Bantu were informed that the Bantu had gone on strike because payday was on Thursday and not on Friday and because they preferred yellow uniforms to green, etc. When told that that could be no reason to strike and asked whether they were not perhaps striking for more money, they replied in the affirmative but were then unable to say how much more they wanted. Furthermore, I want to refer to the following which to me is very important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Senior Police officers handling the strike situation told me that they could duplicate this story of senseless disruption over and over again. Latest stick stirring the labour cauldron is of course Nusas who are now busy circularizing Black workers throughout the country, telling them what they must demand and advising them how to go about making such demands.</block>

<p>The article is concluded with&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Police feel that this sort of outside meddling can only add fuel to an already dangerous situation.</block>

<p>From this it is very clear that a direct accusation is being made against Nusas. However, I want to go further. One of the hon. members of the United Party makes the same accusation. I should like to bring this fact in all seriousness to the attention of this House. I refer to a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 1st April, 1973. Hon. members will of course say, &#x201C;Yes, but that is the <i>Sunday Times."</i> I refer to a meeting addressed by Senator the hon. Piet Swanepoel. Do you know, Sir, what he said&#x003F; The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Senator Swanepoel caused a furore at the meeting when he announced that students who appeared before the Schlebusch Commission had admitted their involvement in the strikes which swept Durban recently. Amidst shouts of &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D; from the audience Senator Swanepoel said, &#x201C;They admitted they had a hand in the strikes in Durban. You see the sort of dangerous unrest they can cause.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I have made an accusation here which is not unfounded. I want to go further. It is not only Nusas that is involved in these things. There are also other groups of students in this country who are engaged in these things. I should like to refer to a pamphlet distributed by Wits students. These students belong to the so-called committee of the Wage and Economic Commission of Wits Students. This is a pamphlet of which thousands of copies were recently distributed in the streets of Johannesburg when the Wage Board had to hear representations concerning Bantu wage determinations there. What did those students do&#x003F; They engaged in nothing other than inciting Black Power in this country. The following, <i>inter alia,</i> appears in this pamphlet&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Workers, are you satisfied with your wages&#x003F; If you cannot live properly on the money you earn, now is the time to do something about it.</block>

<p>They go further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The law says your bosses cannot fire you or take money off your wages for going to the meeting.</block>

<p>I say that this is in absolute conflict with all laws in this country. These people are engaged in inciting the mass of Black <span class="col_4921-4922" refersTo="page_1014"/>people and in creating unrest on a scale which we will bitterly regret later. The Wits students went among those Bantu and caucused with them. Many of the people who wanted to give evidence, had to be warned that they were not qualified to give evidence. I want to know what those people were looking for there. We have here another report under the heading, &#x201C;Ikey campaign on wages against German firms&#x201D;. According to the report appearing under that heading, they demand a signed charter of worker&#x2019;s rights from certain German firms. This is concerned with the conditions of service of the Bantu workers. What is that filthy, ragged riff-raff doing there&#x003F; They are only parasitizing on this country. Never have we seen a bigger buch of parasites. They have never done one day&#x2019;s work for South Africa. They have never made any contribution. Nevertheless they are engaged in inciting the mass of Black people.</p>

<p>I want to address a very serious plea to the hon. the Prime Minister today to extend the terms of reference of the Schlebusch Commission so as to include the activities of these groups of students who are creating unrest in the labour force. It should also be possible to take action against them. The people of South Africa can tolerate this no longer. The people of South Africa will tolerate this no longer. In addressing this plea to the hon. the Prime Minister, I want to ask him that these people be dealt with because they must be eliminated from our community in their entirety. Then we will no longer have all these other problems concerning productivity and the solutions advanced by these hon. gentlemen. They are engaged in fanning the flames of unrest in this country and South Africa dare not tolerate it.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark that he must remember that even if we were for argument&#x2019;s sake to concede that there were agitators behind the surprisingly sudden upsurge of strikes in South Africa, we must at the same time concede that agitators cannot succeed where there are no real grievances. I think it behoves us as a responsible Parliament to give serious consideration to why, if there were in fact agitators in this case, and although they probably tried other things as well, they achieved this spectacular success where the issue was the wages and the grievances over wages of our Bantu employees in our manufacturing sector, our Black industrial workers in South Africa. I must today, together with other hon. members of my party, appeal to Caesar. These matters were discussed time and again with the Ministers in question, but we did not receive the replies to which we felt we were entitled. I now come to the source of all authority, to the source of all executive power in South Africa, namely the Prime Minister himself, and I want to ask him to clear up this matter for us. We must realize that inflation in South Africa will show a rate of 16% this year, if one converts the rate of the past month into an annual rate. Even experts who are well disposed towards the Government, warn that we will have to expect a rate of inflation of approximately 12% this year. This is an extremely serious matter for the man in the street and his family in South Africa. It is all very well for the hon. the Minister of Tourism to say that the wages are increasing more rapidly than the cost of living in South Africa, but the fact of the matter is that the wages are not increasing uniformly for the entire population. The wages of large sectors of our population are not being increased in time to save them from the consequences of inflation.</p>

<p>Take as an example now those many thousands of Whites in the employ of the South African Railways, to whom my hon. friend for Durban Point referred, who are earning less than R200 per month. As a result of the findings of the Hiemstra Commission they recently received an increase <span class="col_4923-4924" refersTo="page_1015"/>of 17% to compensate them for the rise in the cost of living since they received their last increase, and a further 1% or 2% more by way of a pension concession. This is all gone. From now on they are again losing out. When are they going to receive their next relief&#x003F; Is it going to be in a year&#x2019;s time, or in two years&#x2019; time&#x003F; Where will they be then&#x003F; If things continue as they are doing today, i.e. if we maintain a rate of inflation of 16%, they will for one year lose R32 of their monthly salary of R200. People earning R200 per month do not have that saving capacity in their income to absorb a drop in their real income of 32% or even 24%&#x2014;i.e. if one were to accept that the rate of inflation for this year will be 12%. That is the problem facing us. Just think of our old-age pensioners. Until recently they received R42 per month; now they are receiving R46 per month.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it will only be with effect from October, but I am still coming to that point. The cost of living is perhaps rising by 16% per annum. However, we must certainly expect that it is going to increase by 12% per annum. This means that when they receive an increase for the first time in October, they are going to buy less with it than they would have been able to buy with R42 when the welcome concession to them was made. I cannot be so dramatic as my friend, the hon. member for Durban Point, but the facts are dramatic. I am coming to the Prime Minister today with facts. I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister, with all due respect, to give attention to this matter. His Cabinet is not giving satisfaction to the people of South Africa with their replies, to say nothing of their deeds. For that reason I am appealing to Caesar.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Tourism discussed all kinds of measures. One of the measures against inflation is that we should save. Now the hon. the Prime Minister must help us, for what incentive is there for the citizens of South Africa today to save&#x003F; If they invest their money in the orthodox way with a financial institution, 84% is the maximum interest they may receive. That has nothing to do with any increase in income. It is a maximum which is determined by the Government itself. The citizen invests it for a year and receives his 8&#x00BD;% interest. He does not live off it, but puts all of it back into the bank. If he does that he has less money as far as actual buying power is concerned than he had before he received the 8&#x00BD;%, for the value of money has in the meantime diminished by almost 10%. These are the hard facts.</p>

<p>What insurance agent can today approach a young man and with a clear conscience ask him to take out an insurance policy&#x003F; It means in fact that he is buying cheap money with expensive money. The National Party has been in power now for 25 years. One can calculate that 25 years ago&#x2014;I do not want to go back any further than that&#x2014;ten shillings was worth 250 cents of today&#x2019;s money. Today a rand has the same value as 40 cents in 1948. Think of an endowment policy taken out 25 years ago, in 1948, for an amount of R10 000. If he had taken out that policy with a good company it would probably, now that it had matured and had been paid out, have been worth R20 000. The policy holder therefore receives his cheque for R20 000 which he bought month after month or year after year over 25 years with better money. With that R20 000 he cannot even buy what he bought in 1948 with the R10 000. He can only buy something to the value of R8 000. That is the position.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I like reacting to interjections. I am very fond of my hon. friend; he and I had a hard time of it together, but he really must not make nonsensical interjections.</p>

<p>I can tell hon. members why these strikes spread so rapidly. It happened because we did not know that they were coming. We <span class="col_4925-4926" refersTo="page_1016"/>did not realize what was happening among the Bantu workers of South Africa. We created no means of communication between them and their employers. We have what is probably one of the best security police forces in the world, but we were ignorant of what was happening among the Bantu workers. I was astonished to find out how effective our security police are, but they were caught unawares by the strikes. Even if there were agitators, the agitators succeeded so rapidly that we were all caught unawares. Why is that the case&#x003F; If one wants to know why, one must consider what happened. Let me mention for example what happened at the Alusaf factory at Richards Bay. There the strike took place and the employers, fair people, wanted to negotiate. There was no one with whom they could negotiate.</p>

<p>That may be, but Japie will have to speak for himself. I reiterate: The employers tried to negotiate with the employees, but there was no one with whom they could negotiate. They were not even able to discover from the people what their grievances were, although they must have had grievances, otherwise they would not have gone on strike. They are unorganized, unrepresented and left to their own devices as individual, unattached people. I believe in all earnest that the time has arrived for us to devise plans now, such as those published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> with the Bill which the hon. the Minister of Labour is going to introduce, and other measures as well which are going to be suited to the more sophisticated and more developed non-Whites, and particularly the Bantu workers in South Africa, in order to obviate such a situation.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have now listened to the feast of words with which the hon. member for Yeoville has once again regaled us. He held a whole long dissertation on the increasing costs of living, and at the end of his speech he returned to the question of labour. He referred to the strikes and advanced reasons for them. I want to say at once that we have again experienced the problem with the United Party that one cannot rely on what they say. The hon. member for Yeoville has just said that one of the reasons for the strikes was <i>inter alia</i> because the Black worker is unorganized, but that is not true. I have here a little pamphlet, <i>Southern Africa,</i> of 10th February, in which Drake Koka, the secretary of the newly established Black Allied Workers&#x2019; Union, states that his aim is to organize 5,5 million Black workers in South Africa into one massive organization. Now, a further aspect of the matter is that the United Party, with the kind of statements they make from platform to platform, and from day to day, is being instrumental in ensuring that these people do become organized in this way, which is in fact very perturbing. Such an organized power, within trade union context&#x2014;for that is what the United Party wants&#x2014;will in fact be able to do the South African economy tremendous harm. But the United Party is persisting in its conduct and endeavour to see the Black worker in South Africa within a trade union context. We had to listen to this again today. If we think back to the speeches made here during the Second Reading debate only, it is clear that time and again we had only one thing, i.e. that the Black worker in South Africa has to be prompted to rebel against the present arrangements introduced by the National Party. That is the basic difference between the United Party and the National Party. The National Party stands for an orderly labour community in this country. For that reason the National Party is again coming forward with proposed legislation to establish works committees which will be the medium through which the worker in this country will be afforded the opportunity of making his representations. But time and again, and here it is in Hansard, the Opposition says that they want full trade union rights for these workers. The hon. member for Johannesburg North as well as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central advocated this in the Second Reading debate. They are making this suggestion for one reason only, i.e. that they might possibly in that way be afforded the opportunity, when they have brought us to our knees economically, of taking over the political power in South Africa. They made a song and dance here today about the so-called change in the policy of the National Party in respect of the question of training, i.e. pre-service training and in-service training. In this respect as well they tried to create a completely incorrect picture. They placed words in the mouth of the hon. the Minister of Finance which he never uttered. <span class="col_4927-4928" refersTo="page_1017"/>They alleged that what he had said was simply that the training of non-Whites would now take place on a large scale. But they omitted the key section of his entire speech. He said very clearly and significantly&#x2014;these were his precise words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This does not mean that the Government is by so doing throwing overboard its policy of control over the influx of Bantu labour.</block>

<p>Sir, the Opposition has set up their own skittles here which they are trying to bowl over, but surely they cannot get away with it. The fact of the matter is that the National Party has always been very consistent in respect of this matter, i.e. that the productivity of the worker has to be increased. The Government takes the necessary steps, and then a completely false picture is created. They say that this is consequently the solution to all our problems. Productivity has to be increased and the workers have to be employed. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central said that if this system were applied, there would be far more employment possibilities for non-Whites. All the unemployment among the non-Whites would be eliminated! I can quote it to him if he wants it.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree; these are very important matters, but in two or three days&#x2019; time the opportunity will be there to discuss these very relevant matters with the Ministers in question. But I find it interesting now that the United Party should try to use this debate to advance arguments which suit their political book. But they dare not discuss matters such as their federal policy. As soon as they discuss that, the <i>Sunday Times</i> hauls them over the coals again. The electorate outside then begins asking questions again, to which they have no replies. For that reason they are shying away from those very essential matters, and are trying to discuss matters which are politically expedient for them at this stage. I just want to reiterate that as far as labour is concerned it must be understood very clearly that the National Party&#x2014;and it makes no apology for this&#x2014;is the party of the White worker in this country. It will do nothing to endanger the position of the White worker; instead, it will ensure that the position of the White worker improves. That assurance we can once again give the people and this Committee this afternoon. There are other things which the National Party will still do. During the course of this session there will also be an opportunity for, and we will also be able to discuss that. The United Party with its policy&#x2014;there can be no doubt about this&#x2014;is creating a constant danger to the survival of the White man in this country. It is placing the bread and butter of the White worker in this country in jeapordy and this dare not be allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was very kind to me when he rose today and sympathized with me in all the problems and difficulties I have. I should like to return that compliment to my friend. I want to inform my friend that I am aware that I have many difficulties and problems. I am aware that South Africa has many difficulties and problems. But let me say this in all humility to my friend: I should not like to change places with him, not for anything. When it comes to the difficulties and the problems which my friend actually had in mind when he was speaking, I think that he has more of them than I will ever have, no matter how long I may remain sitting in this bench. But I shall return to my hon. friend in a little while.</p>

<p>I want to reply, as fully as I can, to the matters raised by hon. members opposite. I want to begin with the last Opposition speaker, with my hon. friend the member for Yeoville. I wanted to discuss with him the first argument he mentioned. I want to accept the figure the hon. member mentioned, viz. that the rand of 1948 is now <span class="col_4929-4930" refersTo="page_1018"/>worth 40 cents.

If I cannot meet the argument of the hon. member for Yeoville, then I stand guilty not only before this House, but also before South Africa. Then he could justifiably charge me with having neglected my duty&#x2014;not only me, but also my colleagues seated around me here. Now I want to take the example which the hon. member himself chose to use. It is an example with which hon. members opposite make a great deal of propaganda. It is also a field in which my hon. friend the hon. member for Durban Point &#x2014;and I readily concede this to him&#x2014;is an expert. We have no one who can touch him when it comes to this kind of thing. I am pleased to see that the hon. member has returned. I want to accept now that he, too, as all the people before him did, will take action.

<p>Mr. Chairman, my hon. friend chose to take a sensitive example, and I want to meet him in respect of that sensitive example, viz. the example of the elderly people who are suffering hardships.

But any responsible person knows that one has to cut one&#x2019;s coat according to one&#x2019;s cloth. Let me take the hon. member&#x2019;s example now. If my hon. friend&#x2019;s argument, which I accept now, is correct&#x2014;and for the purposes of the argument I shall accept that it is in fact correct&#x2014;then surely I should have seen to it today that the Minister of Finance made provision in his Budget, on the basis of 1948, the year of milk and honey, the year of the generous heart for the orphan, the widow and the poor, for giving them only R25.

If I had today given such a person R30, then I would have dealt fairly with him, and I would have done what the hon. member for Yeoville wants me to do. But we are not giving him R30, Sir.

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there are many ideals which every Government sets itself, but if that were an absolute norm, then the Government of my friend, when it was in power, had no self-respect whatsoever. My friend can look up the figures himself. In other words, Sir, not only have we made good the depreciation of money in respect of those people who unfortunately cannot, as a result of circumstances, look after themselves; we have added an additional portion, an additional amount to the concession I made to my friend, of at least R16, for a raised standard of living. Now my friends could easily argue and say that this is not good enough. My hon. friends could easily argue that this is not good enough, but I want to ask them whether they could have done any better, and if they tell me that they could have done better, then I want to ask them why they did not do so when they were in power. Surely those are the practical, political questions confronting us at all times.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Yeoville said, &#x201C;How can one expect people to buy insurance today&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, it is easy to use an argument like that, but go and ask the insurance companies; they are selling record amounts of insurance every year.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member referred to persons earning less than R200 per month. Sir, I on my part want to make the following statement to the hon. member for Parktown, who is the authority on the Opposition side; it is a statement which I have checked with the best economists, and it is a statement which I make here on the authority of statistics: The hon. member for Parktown can take 1948 as a base; he can take 1955 as a base; he can take 1960 or 1965 as a base. I do not mind what period he takes as a base, but it should at least be a reasonable period of time. It is and remains a fact that the cost of living in South Africa has risen, but I do not think there is one single country in the world in which the cost of living has not risen, and nothing I say here today can argue away that fact; it is a fact. But, Sir, surely that is only one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is that salaries have also risen. But what is more important is this: Surely any balanced person would present the picture in its entirety; surely it is not fair to present only one side of the picture. One can do so from the platform outside, where my hon. friend is the expert, but when we debate across the floor of this House, it is surely an entirely different matter.</p>

<p>Sir, the increase in wages and salaries has more than kept pace with the rise in the cost of living. If this statement of mine is wrong, then I challenge the hon. member for Parktown to furnish the proof to me in this debate, and then I shall apologize to him for having made this statement.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon&#x003F; I thought the hon. member for Parktown had made an interjection in this regard. Sir, it is quite true what the hon. member for Parktown says; if he goes to a barber, he has to pay more for his haircut. [Laughter.] But, Sir, the basic fact of life is that the salary of the person who cuts his hair has, after all, not remained static since 1948; surely his salary has also increased, and that is the reason why the hon. member has to pay more. He has to pay more because the salary of the person who cuts his hair has gone up, but my hon. friend&#x2019;s salary has also gone up; surely it has not remained static. The hon. member also said that bus fares had increased. That is true, but surely the salary of the bus driver has also increased; the salary of the conductor who has to clip his ticket has also increased, and the price of the bus has increased. Surely one cannot view this matter from one side only; surely one has to see these things in their true perspective, otherwise we would merely be arguing nonsensically at cross-purposes in this House, and what would that avail us&#x003F; But I shall come back to that later on.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville told us, with reference to the State, that agitators could not succeed if there were no grievances. Once again I want to concede that point to him, but it is nevertheless strange in this case that one had strikes in areas where the grievances had already been eliminated; and it is also significant that one had strikes after it had been announced that one was going to eliminate the grievances. It is also significant, and I shall return to this later on in the debate, tomorrow or the day after, that some of the people who levelled the most vehement criticism at the Government in the past, were themselves guilty of underpaying their employees in South Africa, and some of them are even involved in the hotel industry in South Africa. All those things are significant and, as I have said, I shall come back to them again in the course of this debate.</p>

<p>As far as the Government is concerned, my hon. friend the Minister of Labour has definitely taken the necessary steps in this connection. In the first place it was even being suggested in certain circles that the Government lay down for non-Whites a maximum salary which an employer in this country dare not exceed. That is absolute nonsense, and I am pleased to see that it is only in certain circles that that argument is still being advanced.</p>

I readily admit&#x2014;who of us cannot produce those examples here in South Africa and in any other country in the world&#x2014;that there are people who are in fact having a very difficult time and who even go hungry at times. We know that there are such people. However, to refer in this debate to millions upon millions who are starving in South Africa surely does not bear any relationship to the truth. [Interjections.] No,</p>

<p>it is not true.</p>

<p>We can look up the Hansard report of his speech tomorrow. However, I am prepared to argue with him on that statement he made. I say that it is not true if the impression is created that there are millions upon millions of people here who are starving. Most of the Bantu I know&#x2014;I grew up with them &#x2014;only have two meals a day. They do not have three meals a day as we Whites do. The hon. member and my hon. friend the member for South Coast know that it is the custom of the Bantu to have two meals a day, not three meals a day. If the hon. member says that, and he appends to it the statment about starving, his offence is even more flagrant than it appears to be at first sight. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member said that meat had become a luxury. It is true that meat is expensive, but what do the statistics tell us&#x003F; They tell us that there is a constant increase in the consumption of meat. I want to go further and say that I have the idea&#x2014; my hon. friend the Minister of Agriculture can correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that the percentage increase in the consumption of meat is greater than that of the population growth.</p>

<p>My hon. friend and colleague says that this is correct, and if it is, it proves one thing. Surely my friend and I cannot eat more meat than we ate yesterday and the day before yesterday, and which gives us the constitution we have. All that the increase in the meat consumption means is that the standard of living has increased to such an extent that people who were previously unable to buy meat can now even afford to buy expensive meat. Surely that is the argument <span class="col_4937-4938" refersTo="page_1022"/>we have to meet, and when we do so in this way, we are putting it in its correct perspective.</p>

<p>Tell that to the housewives.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the housewives. Since my friend has raised that argument now, I want to say that I know that it is difficult to explain to housewives why prices have risen; it is particularly difficult to explain this to those who, day in and day out, hear only one side of the story. Not one of us likes to see the cost of living rising, but all of us would like to have our salaries increased. It is the easiest thing in the world to make political propaganda out of that. Surely all of us know this, and my hon. friend is having a good laugh up his sleeve at the fact that he was able to make this propaganda, and because he succeeded with it. It may be that he will succeed with it in other constituencies as well, but the fact remains that too much emphasis is being placed on the one side only, while little or no publicity whatsoever is being given to the other side.</p>

<p>My hon. friend was very concerned, and I share this concern of his, about the 83 000 people who are earning less than R300 per month. Has my hon. friend ever for one moment asked himself what those same people were earning when the United Party was in power&#x003F; Let him go to the older people who can still remember, and they will tell him what happened then. In fact, that is the reason why those hon. members are sitting on that side of the House and we are sitting on this side. My friend can make as much propaganda out of that as he wishes, but the facts of the past speak for themselves in this connection.</p>

<p>I have already issued a challenge to the hon. member for Parktown, and if the hon. member for Parktown thinks that I am wrong I should like him to correct me in this regard. I am not a theoretical economist, and everyone in this House knows that, but what I found significant was that the hon. member for Parktown, who professes to be one, made no attempt to reply to the academic statements of the hon. the Minister of Tourism. That I found particularly illuminating as a spectator. The hon. member then came forward with this lame allegation: &#x201C;Because we are not the Government, it is not necessary to say what our policy is.&#x201D; What is involved in respect of this problem is surely not the Opposition or the Government; what is involved is our people. If the hon. member for Parktown has a solution to these problems up his sleeve, it is in the first place his duty to furnish it across the floor of this House &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Why does the hon. member say that it is not his duty to furnish it because he is in the Opposition and not in the Government&#x003F; In the second place, since this is again at issue now, surely the hon. member can win great praise for his party by coming forward with solutions &#x2014;Heaven knows his party needs that praise! But that simply does not happen.</p>

<p>Now I come to the argument raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this connection. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition began by saying that the Budget had been a gamble. He maintained that he had said it at the time, and that he had now become convinced of it. I want to ask my hon. friend who his authority is, because he did not quote any authority to us. Of course, I am not at all prepared to accept either his word or his view as far as this matter is concerned. What I do know&#x2014;and in this connection I have read just as widely as any normal hon. member on the opposite side has&#x2014;is that I have not read of anyone of any significance who had arrived at the conclusion that the Budget of my friend was a gamble, and that it had now been proved to be one. It astonishes me that, when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition makes such an accusation and, as it were, reports my good friend the Minister of Finance to me, he does not even attempt to prove it. Or have we now reached the stage where we can say just anything, and think that it is good enough as an argument&#x003F;</p>

<p>Last year the hon. the Minister of Finance stated the intention of the Government very clearly. He not only stated the intention of the Government, but also laid his finger on the three problems awaiting the Government and therefore the country as well, viz. the problem of the balance of payments, the problem of inflation and the problem of growth. I need say nothing about the target in respect of the balance of payments, for the figures speak for themselves, and have already been debated over and over in this House. Coming to the question of inflation, I do not wish, as I said at the outset, to deny in any way that <span class="col_4939-4940" refersTo="page_1023"/>such a phenomenon exists, for it does indeed exist here in our country and in the rest of the world. In fact, if hon. members had listened to this morning&#x2019;s news broadcast they would have heard that world experts thought that as far as Europe was concerned there would not only be a further rise in inflation this year, but it would get completely out of hand next year. In other words, it is not a problem which can be viewed in isolation as far as South Africa is concerned; it is a problem in regard to which one must view South Africa against the background of the world which is contending with this problem. This Government, with all the monetary, fiscal and other means which are known to economists and which it has at its disposal, is trying to combat this problem, just as countries all over the world are doing. Up to now not one single country has succeeded, as far as I know, in combating it successfully. One can curb it for a while, as was done by means of a certain policy in America and as is being done at the moment in Great Britain, but as soon as one removes the restrictions and the measures which one adopted, two devils come to take the place of the previous one. That is what most economists tell us. I think the hon. member for Parktown is as aware of this as I am or any other person is. It is true that to a certain extent the consumer price index has risen at an accelerated rate in comparison with the 7,4% for 1972. That is perfectly true, and one cannot argue about it. But it is also true that increases in import prices and food prices were still the main contributory factor to this increase. As far as the prices of imported goods are concerned &#x2014;these are for the most part goods required by us for keeping our factory production going and for establishing new factories&#x2014;there is absolutely nothing we can do, just as little as we can do anything in respect of the prices which oil-producing countries may charge for fuel now or in the future&#x2014;and they are going to charge more and more in the future. Even the mighty America and other countries cannot do anything about it. In the same way we cannot from the nature of the case do anything about it either. In respect of the drought I want to hope and trust, along with all the hon. members here, that we shall have a very good second half of the year so that there may be an improvement in respect of those foods of which the prices have increased as a result of the drought, as I argued with the hon. member for Durban Point. Should an improvement take place, it stands to reason that it must affect the increase. Should the drought continue, it stands to reason that this is not the kind of thing about which one can do anything at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But what about foods such as rice, etc.&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But surely we do not produce rice here in South Africa. We are, after all, getting our rice from elsewhere. The little which we do produce here, my hon. friend can finish off before breakfast if he is in a mood for doing so. But my hon. friend referred to bread. Surely he knows that regardless of the loaf of bread which he held up to us here, he is not going to get cheaper bread anywhere else. I challenge the hon. member to go to any other place in Europe and to buy that loaf of bread for the same price for which it can be bought here in South Africa. Surely my hon. friend is also aware that over the years this Government has spent millions upon millions of rands on subsidies for the very purpose of keeping the price as low as it is. He also knows, surely, that whereas this amounts to R40 million at present, we cannot simply go on increasing it to R60 million and R100 million; after all, from time to time one does have to draw the line somewhere and ask the consumer to make his contribution. If my facts are correct, we have only done so twice over the past 10 years. Surely, if in 10 years&#x2019; time one has only changed the price of bread on two occasions, it amounts to an outstanding achievement on the part of a Government. Then, surely, it is an outstanding achievement on the part of a Government and not something to reproach it with.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that we now have these increases, I may point out to my hon. friends that this is not the first time that we have had these increases. We had similar increases in 1951-&#x2019;52. We also had them on subsequent occasions; they occur from time to time. The question is whether one was able in the past to combat them successfully in the long run. My reply is that one was able to bring very great relief in the past, and that that relief was in fact brought thanks to the measures that were applied and thanks to the way in which this country was governed. But what my hon. friends are forgetting completely, is that this country <span class="col_4941-4942" refersTo="page_1024"/>has a problem which few other countries have. We were, to be specific, called upon to provide in this country, in virtually less than the space of two decades, the infrastructure for the industrial growth that has taken place in South Africa, an infrastructure which did not exist previously. But, what is more, for the information of the hon. members of the Opposition who are now waxing so lyrical about the education of workers in South Africa: Surely this matter also goes back very far, it has a long history. After all, when the United Party was in power, it did not pay any attention whatever to the education of the Bantu or tire itself out in that regard. As the State it did not accept any responsibility in this regard at all. Its responsibility only went as far as to share out a few million of them to churches and mission societies in order that these might care for the education of the Black people in South Africa. This Government, which is being reviled by hon. members opposite, was the first Government which accepted responsibility for Bantu education in the fifties and which raised the level of Bantu education to what it is today. We can, to be specific, boast to the rest of Africa and to many other countries in the world of the fact that within a short space of time we have been able to raise the level of education of the Black people to the extent to which we have in fact done so in South Africa.</p>

<p>Answer the question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I say that one can, after all, never be satisfied with anything. How can one say that one is satisfied with it&#x003F; I can say that I am satisfied with the progress we have maintained; but we are still going to make a great deal of progress here in South Africa, because this Government is still going to be in power for a very long time. That is why we are going to make more progress. But if hon. members opposite should come into power, I would of course guarantee nothing whatever to any person.</p>

<p>When we come to the question of inflation, we find that signs of a deceleration in the increase in consumer prices may be expected within the next few months. I base this on the fact that at the moment the statistics show that the wholesale price index in respect of imported goods has begun to show a downward trend of late. It goes without saying that if the wholesale price shows a downward trend, a downward trend in the retail and in the general trade must also follow. In other words, Sir, the prospects are there. At this moment I do not want to hold out more hope than to say that there may be a downward trend.</p>

<p>But, as I said at the beginning, inflation is one of three problems. The first problem, namely that of the balance of payments, has been solved by us to the complete satisfaction of the sharpest critic. The problem of inflation is receiving the attention of the Government, both from the point of view of the workers, as my hon. friend put it here, and all the other possible points of view from which one can give attention to it. At the Economic Advisory Council, and wherever consideration can possibly be given to this matter, we are engaged in deliberations in this regard and in taking such measures as can be taken.</p>

<p>But the growth rate, too, is just as important as the other two aspects. We have set ourselves the task of stepping up the growth rate. I am therefore in a position to reply to my hon. friend, who put many questions to me in that regard, by furnishing him with the following figures. In the first place, in January, 1973, the volume of factory production showed an increase of 8,5% over the figure for January, 1972; in other words, the task which the Government set itself in that regard is bearing fruit, and as this task bears fruit, one will also curb inflation accordingly, in so far as it can be curbed from that angle. This increase of 8,5% occurred on a wide front and serves as a strong confirmation of the signs of revival in the manufacturing industry which already started to become apparent towards the end of 1972.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>What was it last year&#x003F; Was the increase in the volume not only 2%&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it does not matter what it was last year. We set <span class="col_4943-4944" refersTo="page_1025"/>ourselves the target of improving it, and we did improve it by 8,5% according to the statistics.</p>

<p>But, Sir, let us take a look at the building plans. In January, 1973, the building plans and buildings completed were, respectively, 10,1% and 4,6% higher than the figures for January, 1972. In other words, in spite of the curtailment of public spending, we succeeded in having greater activity on the building front, and I want to point out that in these days in which we are living it is very good if one can achieve a growth of 10,1% and 4,6%, respectively, in South Africa.</p>

<p>But, Sir, we could mention a third example: In January 1973, 11,4% and 7,1% more motor cars and commercial vehicles, respectively, were licensed than was the case in January, 1972. If hon. members tell me that things are going so badly for South Africa on the economic front, then I want to say that according to all civilized countries there are two norms which one may use as a barometer for the economic growth of a country; the one is the units of power consumed and the other is the number of motor cars bought. If one considers the enormous growth in the consumption of power in South Africa and the projections in respect of the power which one will need in the next decade and the two or three decades after that, then one realizes how sound in fact South Africa&#x2019;s growth is not only in the short term, but how sound its growth can in fact be in the long term if regard is had to those projections. Sir, the well-off people have already bought their motor cars; they are not responsible for all these motor cars that are being bought, but the purchasing power of the man in the street has improved to such an extent that in January, 1973, 11,4% more motor cars and 7,1 % more commercial vehicles could be licensed than was the case in January, 1972; and during the first quarter of 1973&#x2014;i.e. in January, February and March, motor car sales increased by 31%&#x2014;31% in three months&#x2019; time. Sir, I ask hon. members in all fairness whether they know of any other country which can boast of the fact that its economic position is such that its ordinary people could buy 31% more motor vehicles than they did in the previous year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>In value or numbers&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am talking about numbers, and this is the position in spite of the fact that prices have risen. In spite of the fact that prices have risen, one&#x2019;s ordinary people could still buy 31% more motor cars, in numbers&#x2014;and this makes it so much the more remarkable &#x2014;and the sales of commercial vehicles rose by 7,1%. In addition to that one notices, to one&#x2019;s regret, that tractor sales showed a sharp decline, and the reason for this decline is obvious. This is due to the failure of the maize and other crops as a result of the drought; one can therefore understand this very clearly, and this makes the figures which we can submit to the House today even more remarkable. But if one goes further and considers, in the fourth place, that during the first quarter of 1973 exports and imports were, respectively, 32% and 12,4% higher than was the case a year before, would one say that this was a Government which was sleeping on the job, Sir&#x003F; Is this a Government which is sleeping on the job, a Government which administers a country in such a way that its exports showed an increase of 32,6% during this year&#x003F; And is this a reflection of a weak economic position, i.e. that one&#x2019;s imports could show an increase of 12,4% as compared with the figure for the previous year, and that was the case while one had a record import year, so much so that it was to a very large extent responsible for our balance of payments problems&#x003F; I want to go so far as to say that the steps taken by the Government to stimulate the economy are bearing fruit and that even more stimuli will be introduced as far as the economy is concerned. The stimulating measures mentioned in the Budget, the Budget which my hon. friend has now called a gamble here, as well as the downward trend in the rate of interest pattern, are still to have their effect. Secondly, the gold sales by the S.A. Reserve Bank and other exports will have a beneficial effect on the profit position of the country and of the mines. In view of the major share which South African enterprises have in the Sishen-Saldanha contracts, it may be expected that this may have a stimulating effect on a wide range of branches of industry. I want to make this statement that any country which, in the midst of the uncertainty prevailing in the monetary sphere in the world at the moment, can still undertake such schemes as those in which South Africa&#x2019;s industries and its Government are engaged, may truly consider itself to be most fortunate under all these circumstances. And instead of the <span class="col_4945-4946" refersTo="page_1026"/>Government being accused, I believe that the Government should be praised.</p>

<p>What was the position in the past&#x003F; I have made inquiries in this regard. The answer to the one aspect is one which we know very well, namely that we can expect matters to improve with the revival, because it was generally accepted that there was unutilized capacity in our manufacturing industry, and that unutilized capacity can now be utilized. But I am told, and I must accept it, that this was only one part of the picture, and that there was not only unutilized capacity, but also an over-employment of workers. People kept workers in their service in spite of the fact that it was not an economic proposition for them to do so, because they did not want to lose those workers. They kept them in their service and consequently there was unutilized manpower, and the stimulus that has now been given and the growth which one already sees and still expects, will have the effect that unutilized capacity will be absorbed and that those workers who were under-employed will be fully employed, and this in itself will make a considerable difference to the overall picture in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I am concerned about one thing, and it is by no means my intention to say that the front-benchers of the Opposition are indulging in this practice, but I am afraid I shall not be able to say this of others. The hon. member for Parktown, for instance, has already come very close to doing so&#x2014; this is the impression I have gained from listening to him&#x2014;and outside this House there are a very large number of people who are playing a very dangerous game, that of breaking down to the ground this system which we have, this free economic system of ours. I am very afraid of arguments which begin to propagate socialism in a veiled form here in South Africa. I am afraid of people who are advocating a redistribution of possessions here in South Africa, and I want to make an appeal to all hon. members, irrespective of whether they are on this side of the House or on that side of the House or whether they are outside this House. We can afford many things here in South Africa, but if regard is had to the problems with which South Africa has to contend, if regard is had to the composition of its population, there is one thing which we cannot afford. That is to say or do anything which will eventually amount to a redistribution of possessions in South Africa, for then this country will pay until it cannot pay any more, and that will spell its ruin. I want to take up the stand that the labourer is and should at all times be worthy of his wage. I want to take up the stand that in so far as this is its responsibility, the Government has a duty in that regard. I want to say that the Government is fulfilling that duty. However, the private sector also has a duty in that regard. In most cases this duty has been fulfilled, but unfortunately there are also cases where it has not been fulfilled. However, I want to sound a warning against salaries being increased in a haphazard manner simply because a man is Black and because pressure is being brought to bear on South Africa from America, Britain and elsewhere. In this country a man should not be paid simply because he has this or that skin-colour; he should be paid according to the production he yields. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2026; so that he may become skilled not only academically, but also in other ways&#x003F; What has this Government done other than going out of its way to promote in-service training to the best of its ability&#x003F; The hon. members have read the report of Dr. van Zyl to which reference was made by my friend, and they have heard what he had to say on the radio in this regard. If hon. members say this is not enough, there may be some substance in their argument. However, the fact of the matter is that one is improving it all the time, as the need arises, as one has the manpower at one&#x2019;s disposal and as one has the money at one&#x2019;s disposal.</p>

<p>Take the matter of the housing of our people. It is terribly easy to talk the way my friend and others did by saying that the people should simply come. However, they must be housed somewhere. Surely <span class="col_4947-4948" refersTo="page_1027"/>this story of housing has a long history. After all, we know what the housing position was. Admittedly, there was a war. But, surely, we know what the housing position was just after the war. What is more, not only was the position as wretched as it was at the time, but we had a colossal influx as a result of economic and factory development which took place in South Africa. All of this has to be bulwarked by providing houses. However, the Government cannot be expected to do more than can be done in that regard. To those countries which are so fond of pointing a finger at the South African Government I want to say today, for the sake of the record, that we can compare our housing for Black people with anything which our accusers have, and that from such a comparison we could at any time come off very well and even better than they would. Having said all these things, I want to say to my friend that notwithstanding the arguments already advanced during the Budget debate and other debates, this Government has fulfilled its duty in the economic sphere as well as possible and just as well as any other past Government was able to fulfil it under any circumstances in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is always a special privilege to us on this side of the House to conduct a debate with the hon. the Prime Minister, for we admire the spirit in which he debates, we appreciate his sense of humour and we sometimes join in the laughter at his jokes. Still I fear that although the hon. the Prime Minister replied at length today to our questions and to the matters raised by us, he unfortunately passed by the crux of the Opposition&#x2019;s arguments. The fact is that he neglected to say what was happening to the ordinary family in South Africa today as a result of inflation. I know that the hon. the Prime Minister did not do so on purpose, but it happens because he is an impassioned speaker and he gets excited about his case. However, he made several statements which were simply not supported by the facts. I want to mention a few of them so that we may understand each other better in this respect. The hon. the Prime Minister attached great importance to the fact, for instance, that the ordinary family could not be in such a plight because the consumption of meat in South Africa was increasing. According to the reports of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing this is not the case, however. I have here the reports dealing with the meat prices from 1964-&#x2019;65 up to last year. If one compares the two one finds a very interesting situation. One finds that the consumption of pork and chicken has increased slightly, but that the consumption of beef, veal, mutton and goats&#x2019; meat has decreased. In general the consumption of meat has decreased, because it had to decrease. The other day I talked to a Johannesburg friend of mine who is a Nationalist, and he told me: &#x201C;In Johannesburg we buy a leg of mutton, but we no longer put it in a refrigerator, but in the display cabinet in the lounge, because it is so precious.&#x201D; The facts are that in 1965-&#x2019;66 the <i>per capita</i> consumption of meat in South Africa was 100 lbs., i.e. 45,4 kg. Last year, in 1971-&#x2019;72, the <i>per capita</i> consumption was 42,5 kg.</p>

<p>All kinds of meat. I have already said that there has been a small increase in the consumption of chicken and pork, but in general it has dropped because there has been a great decrease in the consumption of mutton and beef. Now we have the very interesting situation that the hon. the Prime Minister has told us that my hon. friend for Durban Point should not have referred to potatoes because we are experiencing a scarcity of potatoes. It was due to that scarcity, he said, that the price had gone up. If there is a scarcity of potatoes under his Government, the price increases&#x2014;that I can understand. But does the hon. the Prime Minister realize that when there is a surplus of maize the price goes up as a result of the surplus, too&#x003F; Last year, for example, there was a big maize surplus. We had to export in order to get rid of the surplus and to obtain foreign exchange. The cost to the end consumer rose by 21&#x00BD;%; 11&#x00BD;% was required to cover the cost of bags, the other 10% was required for strengthening the stabilization fund. So the more maize there is, the more expensive it is for the ordinary consumer, and it is in the interests of the maize consumer that there should be a drought, while a drought is not in the interests of the potato consumer.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not joking about it; it is a very serious matter, because maize is the food of the poorest people in the country. If there is an overproduction of maize they do not benefit by it, but they have to pay more for it. I think that the hon. the Prime Minister would be well advised to give some attention to this. Will the hon. the Prime Minister deny that 9,3 million sheep were slaughtered in South Africa last year, while it is believed that the figure for this year will be approximately 6,8 million&#x003F; Does he deny that the price of bread was recently increased by 18% in the case of white bread and 22% in the case of brown bread, while at the same time the price of wheat to the farmer was reduced by 20c a bag&#x003F; How is one to understand that&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But you know that bread has been subsidized by millions all these years and that the subsidy increases every year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Let me reply to that at once. A country which is able to produce a deficit Budget such as the one produced by the Government during this session can afford to continue subsidizing the staple food of the poorest of our people. However, this still does not explain why the price of bread to the consumer has to rise while the farmer gets less money. The hon. the Prime Minister made a great point of it. He said that because the farmers, too, were entitled to better prices because their costs also rose, one should expect the price to the consumer to rise. In the case of maize, too, the price paid to the farmer goes down while the price to the consumer rises. This contradicts the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s argument. I think he should go into the matter again.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Prime Minister rightly said&#x2014;I am glad that he said this, because we cannot give enough publicity to this; it is in the interests of our country&#x2014;that there were no legal restrictions on the salaries or wages that people might pay their workers of any colour in South Africa. The sooner we can get rid of that slandering of South Africa the better. In this respect the hon. the Prime Minister will certainly receive the assistance of the Opposition. But then the hon. the Prime Minister must also be fair and admit that there are of course other restrictions on the possible earnings of particularly the Bantu in South Africa. I have already referred, by way of interjection, to the job reservation that exists, statutory as well as conventional. There are other economic laws in South Africa as well that result from Government policy, for example the limited training received by these people. As the hon. the Prime Minister said by way of interjection, they are only being trained in the Bantu homelands where there is not the slightest possibility today of sophisticated labour being used. There is the question that they have no permanent residence where they are employed in White areas. I do not know what this new term means which I heard today, &#x201C;temporary permanence&#x201D;, for to me the one excludes the other. I cannot see how one can link those two words. The fact that the workers are not permanent in the White industrial areas where they are needed must mean that their productivity is restricted.</p>

<p>Then there is the fact, too, that we have not yet succeeded&#x2014;in this respect the two parties together can do something too&#x2014;in removing the unreasonable fear on the part of many of our White workers that if you do justice to the non-White worker the White worker must be done an injustice. This idea, too, we can try to destroy to the great advantage of everyone in South Africa. I want to say&#x2014;and I say this advisedly&#x2014;that there has been very little enthusiasm to be discerned on the part of the ordinary hon. members on the other side for accomplishing this in South Africa. Allow me to say to the credit of the hon. the Minister of Transport that he for one has set an example in this respect, with the assistance and the good advice of the Opposition, for counteracting that tendency in South Africa. I want to say this of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs as well. I think that he, too, sets a fine example in many respects. He is thwarted and frustrated by the Minister of Labour, of course, but I hope that the two of them will get together and come to an agreement in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_4951-4952" refersTo="page_1029"/>When we discuss the question of inflation and the question of South Africa&#x2019;s interests, both locally and in respect of the world, we are still faced with the problem of labour in South Africa. I am sorry that the hon. the Prime Minister did not devote a little more time to this. If I understand him correctly, he intends to elaborate on this later on.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to reply to a few of the statements made by the hon. member for Yeoville.

<p>Since then an increase in the consumption of certain foods has been clearly perceptible from the time that salary adjustments were made.

The hon. member asks why the price of potatoes increases when there is an inadequate crop.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>But the Prime Minister said it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is true, but I am replying to that now. I am still in full agreement with what the Prime Minister said. The price of potatoes increased because we did not have a crop. In the normal course of events ours is a country which exports potatoes, but this year we cannot export a single potato. At present we are unable to meet the demand, because there is a shortage of potatoes of 23%. What must we do&#x003F; Must we do what you did prior to 1948&#x003F; You said at the time: We set a maximum price of 75 cents for a large bag of potatoes. When there was a surplus, you did absolutely nothing and the price of potatoes then fell to 1s. 6d. per bag. That is the love you have for the farmer. That is what history has taught us. But we say no.</p>

<p><span class="col_4953-4954" refersTo="page_1030"/>But let me reply to the hon. member on the question of maize. Last year we had a maize surplus and what did the Minister of Finance and the Government do then&#x003F; We said we would subsidize maize so that a supply might be stored in this country. We than told the consumer that he had to contribute 10 cents per bag and to the farmer that he had to contribute 30 cents per bag. The consumer price must increase, because we had more than 100 million bags of maize while our consumption was 55 million bags. What did the State do&#x003F; Last year the State subsidized the whole industry to the tune of R37,8 million. Now we come to a year of shortage and what do we do&#x003F; That farmer does not have a harvest; he only has half a harvest. Now the Government says that his price has to be increased by R1 per bag. The Government brings a consumers&#x2019; subsidy of R9,9 million, i.e. 18 cents per bag, and the farmer gets R1 per bag more. In order to meet this price, the consumer need only pay 50 cents more per bag. Are hon. members opposite dissatisfied with this policy&#x003F; This year, too, the subsidy on maize amounts to approximately R30 million.</p>

<p>Let us take bread. We said to the baker and the miller, &#x201C;You may import your machinery from overseas after we have devalued. You may pay your labourers more. Your railage has increased. The Government will ensure that the price of bread does not increase by more than 2 cents per loaf, having last had an increase nearly more than two years ago.&#x201D; We originally thought that this year&#x2019;s subsidy, with an increase in price of 2 cents per loaf, would drop from R47 million to approximately R34 million. I can tell hon. members now that with the recent increases in costs, the subsidy on bread this year will again be R40 million.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But, after all, the baker is paying his Bantu more. Upon my word, Sir, hon. members do not understand how this subsidy system works. We say to the baker&#x2014;if hon. members would only listen&#x2014;&#x201C;The Government will foot the bill for your increases in cost. Through a type of subsidy we pay your increases in costs, but you may not make bread more expensive.&#x201D; That is how the thing works. Do hon. members understand it&#x003F; I think the most half-witted city U.P. supporter ought to understand it. It is a very simple thing. But now I should just like to know something: Next year the baker increases his price because of an increase in shipping charges and consequently in the price of imported baking and milling machinery. Must we continue to subsidize bread&#x003F; Must we pay a subsidy of R50 million or R60 million next year&#x003F; Or, after two or three years, must we say, &#x201C;All salaries and Bantu wages have risen. Would we not be justified in allowing the price of bread to increase&#x003F;&#x201D; Or should we say that taxes must be increased&#x003F; Where will we get the subsidy from&#x003F; After all, this is a simple question. I want to ask hon. members, &#x201C;If there is a general salary adjustment of 15% throughout the country, are they in favour of a salary increase of 15% being granted by my farming colleagues and myself to our Bantu on the farms as well&#x003F; Are hon. members satisfied&#x003F; Just answer me. Must we, too, have the opportunity of giving our Bantu a salary increase of 15%&#x003F; I am asking a question. Is the answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, or &#x201C;no&#x201D;&#x003F; Then, may I receive 15% more for my agricultural products&#x003F;</p>

<p>The wheat price was reduced because of the larger crop and because the volume income of the farmer was higher.

<p>As far as meat is concerned, we had discussions with the Meat Board this morning, and we said to them, &#x201C;For the sake of the consumer in this country and to the detriment of the producer, let us reduce the export of beef&#x201D;. They were magnanimous <span class="col_4955-4956" refersTo="page_1031"/>and said, &#x201C;We agree. We shall reduce the export of beef&#x201D;. Remember, we are still an importing country as far as meat is concerned. We shall take any amount of meat Botswana can supply. At present we get 1 000 carcasses per week from them. They say, &#x201C;We are not going to give you more&#x201D;. This is an old agreement, but we make a tremendous profit on the export market. We make a profit of 9 cents per kg. Is one of the hon. members prepared to stand up and say that it is not magnanimous of the South African farmer to say that we should not export our meat, but that we should rather keep it in the country at a lower price in order to supply our consumers with cheaper meat&#x003F; Then those members stand here continually venting their spleen about the price of meat. They are a bunch of farmer-haters as far as these matters are concerned.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I always believed that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture was a friend of the farmers. After what he said here this afternoon, I am convinced that he is neither a friend of the farmer, nor of the consumer. He has been at pains to explain to us that this whole fixing of prices, as far as the consumer is concerned, is a very artificial business indeed. I think the criticism of this side of the House is perfectly justifiable. The criticism on this side of the House is that with the available surplus that the Minister had when he introduced his budgetary proposals this year, it should have been possible for him to keep down the price of certain of these agricultural products to the consumer, particularly for the less fortunate members of our community. Sir, I believe it could have been done. I believe we could have afforded it and the farmer would not have suffered at all.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to the hon. the Prime Minister who dealt with the question of the activities of the Minister of Labour at the time of the strikes and the instructions which he gave to the wage boards after the strikes and the discussions which then took place. Sir, I think the hon. gentleman has not met the real criticism of this side of the House. That criticism is that the necessary machinery for negotiation was not in existence.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister of Labour was caught with his pants down, without any question at all. The fact is a perfectly simple one, and that is that the necessary machinery did not exist. No steps had been taken to see that it was <span class="col_4957-4958" refersTo="page_1032"/>in working order. But I think the other point that the hon. the Prime Minister has missed is that with the growing number of non-White workers, particularly Bantu workers, being engaged in semi-skilled and, in future, in skilled work, the machinery as envisaged by the Minister of Labour at the moment is not going to be adequate. He is going to have to have more sophisticated machinery; he is going to have to have another method of negotiation which has got to be tied to the existing trade unions by way of affiliation or some method of that kind. It is quite certain, Sir, that the system as it is working at the moment is not going to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister pointed out that the objectives of the Budget were to deal with inflation, to improve the balance of payments and to encourage growth. Of course, Sir, I have pointed out once before that these are likely to be mutually contradictory objectives to a certain extent. While we have had success with the balance of payments, inflation is taking place at a great rate, and unless we have adequate growth we are going to be faced with inflation towards the end of this year such as we have never seen before in South Africa, and the question is whether that growth is going to be adequate. The criticism of this side of the House has been that we are not making adequate use of the labour we have available or planning to make use of it in the future. The hon. the Prime Minister has had a lot to say about the activities of the old United Party when it came to Bantu education and labour training. I wonder whether the hon. the Prime Minister will tell me who it was who tried to close down the trade training school in Soweto run by Johannesburg municipality, and who it was who prevented the extension of that trade training school in Soweto. The hon. the Prime Minister has talked to us about Bantu education. Is he so young in politics that he does not remember the propaganda made by his party in the days when the United Party was in power against expenditure on Bantu education&#x003F; Here is a copy of a pamphlet given out by none other than Mr. M. D. C. de Wet Nel, Secretary of the Herenigde Nasionale Party in 1944&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where are we going&#x003F; Are such things possible in South Africa&#x003F; Expenditure on Natives and Coloureds! It is no wonder that you do not have labour.</block>

<p>Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This year an amount of over &#x00A3;1 million will be devoted to Native education. &#x00A3;615 000 has come from the White man&#x2019;s pocket.</block>

<p>This, Sir, was the propaganda which was made. This is the same pamphlet in which he complained so much because the Government had spent &#x00A3;78 000 buying stud bulls and stud cows to be used in the Reserves. That is the type of propaganda we were faced with. How was the late Mr. Hofmeyr not denigrated by that side of the House when he wanted to spend &#x00A3;4,5 million or R9 million a year on Bantu education&#x003F; For how long was the amount to be spent on Bantu education not pegged by that side of the House&#x003F; R13 million was the maximum they would give, year after year, despite our protests, and then they started incurring bigger expenditure but tried to hide it in the account. No, Sir, I do not think that that hon. gentleman should refer to what was done in regard to Bantu education. I think the record of his party is a shocking one in that regard.</p>

<p>But then we come to the point we have been hammering, and that is the training of labour not only for the present, but for the future in South Africa. I agree with the hon. the Prime Minister entirely that we want to tie, as far as we can, better wages to greater productivity. I agree with him also that there are dangers from those people who want to improve the lot of certain sections of the community by dragging others down. That is not the object of this side of the House. The object of this side of the House is to uplift the entire population and to improve conditions for everybody in South Africa. Our problem at the moment is that we have a vast potential in our labour force which we feel is not being used to the best advantage at present. We want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister what his plans are for the training of that labour force in the future; what is he going to do to make use of it&#x003F; He is already faced with the situation that he knows he will not have sufficient skilled workers among the White population in a few years&#x2019; time. If he is to retain anything like the rate of growth which is going to be necessary for this country he will have to undertake the training of non-Whites in South Africa to do skilled and semi-skilled work. What we want from the hon. gentleman <span class="col_4959-4960" refersTo="page_1033"/>is a statement of his policy; what is he going to do about it&#x003F; The second thing we want to know from the hon. gentleman is to what system of collective bargaining he is going to adopt for that labour force, once it is trained, to ensure that there is proper negotiation and understanding between employer and employee.</p>

The year 1970-71 is the last year for which authentic figures are available. Let us now look at mutton and goat&#x2019;s meat. It will be seen that the <i>per capita</i> consumption of mutton and goat&#x2019;s meat increased from 8,8 kg in 1965-&#x2019;66 to 10,1 kg in 1970-71.</p>

<p>Oh, would you just restrain yourself a little&#x003F; I now want to give the total <i>per capita</i> consumption of, jointly, beef, veal, mutton, goat&#x2019;s meat and pork. The <i>per capita</i> consumption in South Africa has increased since 1965-&#x2019;66 from 39,4 kg to 39,5 kg in 1970-71. Therefore, over that period of five years we have had an increase that cannot be disputed. As I have said, the figures in respect of the subsequent years are based <span class="col_4961-4962" refersTo="page_1034"/>on estimates. The figures I have quoted are the only official figures.</p>

<p>I now want to go further. Up to now I have only referred to beef, veal, mutton, goat&#x2019;s meat and pork, but our people surely eat other kinds of meat too. They also eat chicken, which is very much in fashion these days. Unfortunately the figures in respect of chicken are not included in this <i>per capita</i> increase I have just referred to. I should like to say what has happened in respect of the quantity of poultry slaughtered in the Republic. In 1965-&#x2019;66 we slaughtered only 61 600 tons of chickens in the Republic, but in 1970-&#x2019;71 we virtually doubled the amount and it stood at 105 100 tons. In other words, the consumption of chicken has doubled over that period. We did not export that chicken, we sold it locally. If I add this increase in the consumption of chicken to the total consumption of meat from 1965-&#x2019;66 to 1971-&#x2019;72, there is sufficient proof that there was a <i>per capita</i> increase over this period.</p>

<p>They are on page 52 of the epitome of agricultural statistics. The hon. member for Yeoville thought he had raised a very clever argument when he said that we have a maize surplus but that the consumer prices have nevertheless increased. He also added that the price which the farmer received for his maize was not in accordance with this. The hon. member for Yeoville must surely know that when we produce a surplus of a certain agricultural commodity in South Africa we do have to do something with that surplus. We surely cannot give it away for nothing; we surely cannot throw it in the sea. That surplus must then be exported and sold to the overseas buyer on the world market. On the world market one must negotiate the best price that can be negotiated under the circumstances. It therefore goes without saying that if the realization on the world market is low, the local prices must be increased slightly in order to be able to pay the producer a viable price. That is what the whole matter boils down to. The Government is the shock-absorber, the balancer, and it must surely protect the domestic producer and consumer. When there are fluctuations on the world market, there are two ways in which the shock waves can be absorbed. The one way is by paying a subsidy to the industry or to the consumer and the other way is by increasing the local price moderately so that stability may be achieved in the agricultural industry. The hon. member asked why the price of bread increased while the price of wheat paid to the farmer was lower. I just want to say in passing that in the present Budget this Government is employing about R90 million as a consumer subsidy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>It is R87 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>The amount of R87 million is being employed as a consumer subsidy so that the price which the farmer receives can be kept sound on the one hand and so that the price to the consumer does not become disproportionately high on the other hand.</p>

<p>While we are now on the question of the maize price, I want to raise another matter. In the Second Reading debate of this Budget the hon. member for Newton Park began by speaking about the Coloureds. Thereafter he spoke about the cost of living; he touched on all kinds of matters. I asked him five times&#x2014;and this is recorded in Hansard&#x2014;when he was going to lodge a plea for a maize price and when <span class="col_4963-4964" refersTo="page_1035"/>he was going to propose a maize price. However, the hon. member for Newton Park was too afraid to open his mouth about that. The hon. member for Newton Park and his party were too afraid to make a proposal about what the maize price to be paid to the farmer should be. I challenged the hon. member five times across the floor of the House, and he did not have the courage of his convictions to tell us what he proposes in that connection. I shall tell hon. members why. If the hon. members propose a higher maize price they cannot go and barter there in Umhlatuzana or in Aliwal North with the high cost of living. Hon. members are not prepared to accept responsibility for higher prices to the agricultural producer. After all, hon. members are accusing the Government all day long of the fact that the cost of living is increasing. I have asked the hon. member for Newton Park time and again to make his proposal as far as the maize price is concerned, but he does not want to do so. I want to go further with my statement about what the Government is doing. Although the maize price this year has increased by 20,5% as far as the producer is concerned, the Government has subsidized the industry and the consumer price of yellow maize has only increased by 11,5% and that of white maize by 15,5%. In other words, the increase in price which the producer has obtained is higher than the increase in price which the consumer must pay. In other words, there the Government has also done its best to try to make this increase in the costs easier for the consumer as well as for the producer. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is true that I find it difficult to learn about the meat question, but there is nevertheless something that bothers me. The hon. member for Lydenburg spoke about the <i>per capita</i> meat consumption. Let us just get the hon. member&#x2019;s argument in perspective. The statement of this side of the House is that the meat price today is so high that meat has, as it were, become a luxury article in numerous homes in South Africa. On the other hand, the hon. the Prime Minister has come along with the argument that it might in fact be so, but that South Africa&#x2019;s meat consumption is still increasing. I listened to the hon. member for Lydenburg, and all the consumption figures he quoted only went as far as 1970-&#x2019;71 when the prices were fairly normal. The question that arises as far as I am concerned is this: &#x201C;What has happened to the meat consumption in the last six to nine months, or even in the last year&#x003F;&#x201D; I want to put my head on a block that the <i>per capita</i> meat consumption has decreased and not increased in South Africa in the last six or nine months. I do not have the statistics here, but if it has decreased, it is exclusively attributable to the fact that meat has become unpurchasable in dozens of homes in South Africa as a result of high prices. That is the perspective. I do not want to argue about beef, chicken or pork &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, Mr. Chairman, I have only ten minutes.

<p>As far as I am concerned bread for the people is so important <span class="col_4965-4966" refersTo="page_1036"/>that I would be prepared to consider a much greater amount than is now being paid to subsidize bread. That is my answer to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Then I come to the second point I want to mention. I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that one does not easily or willingly argue with him across the floor of the House, and I am respectfully doing so. I want to say that I think that the hon. the Prime Minister is making a fatal mistake in continually comparing the present position in South Africa with the 1948 position in respect of the cost of living and incomes and salaries. To compare the present position with the position in 1948 as far as the standard of living is concerned, one could just as well compare a donkey cart with a moon buggy. In the past 25 years a new generation has emerged throughout the world and also in South Africa, a generation with new needs, with another standard of living, with greater needs, and to come and tell me that today my children and I must still live as my forefathers lived or as we lived in 1930 or in 1948, is really no argument in the new era in which we are living. I really think the hon. the Prime Minister is doing his argument no good by coming along and telling us that he is satisfied that the Government is doing its best in comparison with 1948. I do not think that is any comparison whatever, because we have entered a completely new era in South Africa. And this does not only apply as far as South Africa is concerned, but though out the world.</p>

<p>The fact is that we had to go much further because I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that even in spite of the Nationalist Government there has nevertheless been an increase in the standard of living in South Africa. We could really not stand still. We surely cannot now be where we were in 1948; that is surely a completely wrong argument.</p>

<p>The third point I want to make is to ask how far we could not have been if we had specifically accepted the arguments and the advice of the Opposition merely as far as the word &#x201C;productivity&#x201D; in South Africa is concerned. The hon. member for Randburg called out very effectively in this House the other day that the real answer to inflation is productivity.</p>

I do not want the hon. the Prime Minister to ask me questions, because I should like to deal with him on the level of Prime Minister. The other argument I want to use is that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition came to this House and stated a case that is fundamental to the whole future security of South Africa. He said that our biggest problem is inflation and that in order to combat inflation, as the hon. member for Randburg also says now, one must produce. In order to produce, one must have labour, and not only labour but trained labour to meet the modern world&#x2019;s needs. The hon. the Prime Minister says they have done enough, but I want to ask what the Nationalist Party has done in 25 years as far as the training of labour in South Africa is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not speaking of sporadic attempts, but of an attempt that would go to the root of the matter. In this respect nothing has really been done in South Africa. In fact, if one looks at the Riekert report, one finds that it is still their standpoint that the training of the Bantu has to take place in the Bantu homelands. Even the Minister of Labour said a year ago, as it were, that the Bantu would be trained in White South Africa over his dead body.</p>

<p><span class="col_4967-4968" refersTo="page_1037"/>Those days are past, and now I am not speaking of education. The Nationalist Party&#x2019;s record as far as Bantu education in South Africa is concerned is one which we should preferably not trace back to before 1948. It is not a record which the Nationalist Party can be proud of. In fact, I do not believe that they can even be proud of their record since 1948. But let us leave it at that as far as education is concerned. I am speaking of the mere training of the Bantu which has clashed with their ideology. They dare not train the Bantu in White South Africa because then the people become permanent, temporarily permanent if they want to call it that. And if they become permanent, then one is scratching at and discrediting the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s philosophy, and that may not be done. That is why it has not happened.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Prime Minister were to stand up today and say he supported the idea of the training of Bantu in White South Africa, I would say thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, but remember that you are digging your own policy&#x2019;s foundations out from under it. All that will remain is a situation such as we had in 1948, and throughout the years you would have done nothing to improve the position. This is the position: It has become relevant to speak about the Bantustans and the development of reserves. The real problem between one person and another, between Whites and Blacks, does not arise, to a large extent, in the Transvaal. It crops up here where the White man and the Black man are building up South Africa shoulder to shoulder. As far as that question is concerned, they have never yet thought of an answer over the past 25 years of Nationalist Party rule because you see, Sir, they did not want to think. I shall tell you why. The moment they think of the urban Bantu as a permanent being, the ideology collapses, the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s Bantustan policy again. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened with considerable interest to the financial debates conducted in this House. I have listened with considerable interest in particular to what was said on that side of the House. Let me put it quite clearly: To me it is most disturbing to hear to what extent and in which way hon. members on the opposite side of the House want to fight the question of inflation in South Africa. We on this side of the House realize that, where we are dealing with a cost-push inflation, the obvious solution in this regard would be to fight this inflation by means of higher productivity and a higher growth rate. But we appreciate full-well that we have to bring about this higher productivity and growth rate within a framework which would ensure political order and long-term stability.</p>

<p>We appreciate full-well that we could only bring about higher productivity and economic prosperity if we could ensure political order in South Africa. It is for this reason that we are prepared to sacrifice a certain measure of production for the sake of long-term political order. We are prepared to bring about a high productivity and a high growth rate within a framework which will ensure security for every person in South Africa. Just as a farmer will sacrifice a certain measure of production by contouring his lands and in this way putting aside a certain proportion of his lands for the sake of long-term security, productivity and order on his farm and, for example, by not planting maize on those lands, so we on this side of the House are prepared to sacrifice a certain measure of productivity for the very reason of bringing about long-term economic prosperity within a framework of political order.</p>

<p>But something which perturbs me even more, is the utter inability of hon. members on that side of the House to display some financial reality. I believe that if one makes inflation an integral part of the system, he cannot be serious in his aims to fight inflation. For that reason I find it perturbing that members on the other side of the House want to make inflation an integral part of our financial structure. I think it was the hon. member for Yeoville who suggested in the Railway Budget debate that we should make provision in the cost structure of the Railways to fight inflation by making a certain concession for the sake of inflation. If we were to make inflation an integral part of the cost structure of the Railways, whether in the wage policy or in the policy in respect of pensions, we would ensure that we would always have inflation far into the distant future and then we would not be honest and genuine in our endeavour to fight inflation. It is for this reason&#x2014;because all the members on this side of the House and I are serious in our aims and in our fight against inflation&#x2014;that I appeal to hon. <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="page_1038"/>members on that side of the House in all seriousness to act in a very responsible manner when making any statements in respect of the labour policy in South Africa. Sir, we are at present dealing with a cost-push inflation and we are combating it by means of a policy to outgrow inflation, but the greatest danger threatening us here is that demand elements could be dragged into the question of inflation; that, together with a cost-push, we would also be making demand an integral part of inflation and if we were to introduce unrealistic wages into this system owing to irresponsible actions and an irresponsible wage policy in respect of the Bantu, we would have to take into account that, together with the cost-push, we would also build in demand elements which would ultimately become uncontrollable in our fight against inflation. For that reason I want to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House cannot adopt a negative attitude towards any attempt to increase the standard of living of any group of the population in South Africa, but such an increase of wage levels, even if it were for the non-Whites, should always be most realistic and in accordance with reality.</p>

<p>Sir, it was in another place at another time that Pres.

<block name="quote">We are fighting not just the battle of the federal budget, but, even more important, the battle of your budget, the family budget, the budget of every family in America.</block>

Sir, we have not had the problem of a major war to make worse our own problem of inflation. He went on to say that having recognized four years ago that the rate of inflation was becoming unacceptable in America, his Government had taken steps and succeeded in halving the rate of inflation and today &#x2014;to quote his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our rate of inflation is the lowest of any industrial nation.</block>

<p>Then, too, Dr. Hupkes, addressing the Association of Accountants at Hermanus only recently, again warned that the gamble taken by the hon. the Minister of Finance could become disastrous unless his objectives were achieved and, to use Dr. Hupkes&#x2019;s words, we could be faced by unimaginable runaway inflation. Sir, we are playing with the nation&#x2019;s wealth; we are playing with the welfare of the individual, and what worries me most is that the Prime Minister does not seem to realize that it is not the privileged White South African we are discussing in this House today. In our battle against inflation it is not the United Party versus the Nationalist Party; we are fighting to save the value of the money of every individual in this country. We tend to overlook that when we talk about commodities such as meat and other basic foods, most White families are relatively privileged, but it is the families who spend most of their income on food who are the greatest sufferers under the inflation which this country is experiencing. It is not enough merely to indicate, as has been done before, that wages are keeping up with inflation. We <span class="col_4971-4972" refersTo="page_1039"/>have had sufficient warning to make us see that time is running out and that by the end of this year we may have inflation which can no longer be matched by wage increases. For as long as we have been in the Opposition we have been calling for the better utilization of the manpower of South Africa and of our natural resources, our capital and our know-how. We have pleaded for greater attention to be given to drawing immigrants to this country in order to increase the size of the total cake which now has to be divided amongst so many more people because of the population explosion. It has been said time and again that perhaps we have in this country five years in which to create industrial peace where the majority of our people do not feel frustrated, do not feel that they are forced to live under restricted circumstances and do not feel that they are not allowed to use what may be their God-given graces and skills. When you read the daily Press, and when you come to this debate itself, you see that this is the first time that the hon. the Prime Minister has realized&#x2014;as Nixon said about Truman, that he had a notice on his desk saying the &#x201C;buck stops here&#x201D;&#x2014;after 25 years of the Nationalist Party being in power, and they will be celebrating the fact shortly, that he has to face up to the fact that successive Nationalist Ministers of Finance and successive Ministers of Economic Affairs have maintained that they would stake the Government&#x2019;s reputation on containing inflation, but this is what they have failed to do. They are not containing inflation. In fact, it was said only recently that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of inflation during the first three months of 1973 was 13%, which is a rate four times that which we used to regard as the maximum a couple of years ago. This is the problem which the Government just does not seem to be able to face up to, and it has given us no solution whatsoever. There is no indication that the present Budget is having any success. The hon. the Prime Minister indicated that he was very proud to see that motor vehicles have had record sales. That is so, but the bottleneck which the motor industry is going to come up against immediately will be that after two or three months of record sales they will run out of stocks and they will not have the manpower to continue the production of motor vehicles at that stage. Then the Prime Minister has also not indicated the fact that out of the frustration of our people, our lack of public transport, the increased wages that have been made available are being canalized into a pent-up demand for motor vehicles which was at an all-time low only during recent months.</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that. Then again the hon. the Prime Minister has indicated that he is very proud of our export performance, but just as he has blamed the drought for the high price of potatoes, he does not give credit to the fact that it is an act beyond the control of this Government which has resulted in our gold price reaching an all-time high, that our wool prices have been restored to their old levels, that we are getting higher prices for minerals and that the overseas markets have increased. That has nothing to do with the efficacy of this Government. The fact is that we are merely, as has been said before, riding on the back of the old philosophy that &#x201C;Alles sal regkom&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But what does the man in the street see in the final analysis when he takes home his pay&#x003F; Compare 1968, a year when the Government was in power, with 1971. The basic figures show that in food there was a 30% increase since 1968, in meat a 46% increase, in fish 49%, in vegetables 61%, in fruit 39%, in sugar products 12%, in rental for homes 41%, in fuel and light 24%, in furniture 29%, and so it goes on. The burden lies on the man in the street who has a fixed income and not on those who are privileged to be entrepreneurs, speculators or property owners who can benefit from increased prices. This burden is today becoming a real one which they can no longer face. Again we have only five years or less in which to reconcile the attitudes of the White people with that of the non-Whites, the Bantu and the Indians. At the present pace this Government is moving there is no indication whatsoever that their desire to achieve productivity, the much-talked about productivity, can ever match the need to achieve that productivity if we are to maintain the situation that is so necessary and that has been stressed by my Leader, namely that if we want to increase our productivity to the range of 7% or 8%, an increasing intake of African labour must be found a home for. The situation of the African in the urban areas is something which will get out of control. As has been said before&#x2014;I think by the hon. the Prime <span class="col_4973-4974" refersTo="page_1040"/>Minister himself&#x2014;what we fear is friction between the races based on frustration of the lower-income races in not being allowed to achieve what they know they can achieve with their God-given resources and with State training.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in these times, students in South African politics are particularly interested in the persons of Mr. Harry Schwarz, the leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. They are not only interested in these two persons as individuals in South African politics, but also in their schools of thought and the ideals which they cherish for South Africa. Moreover, they are also interested in these two persons because of the connection which exists between them in present-day South African political life and also because of their connections with the major political directional trends of the modern world. In addition to this, students in South African politics are also interested in these two persons because of their particular association with the Press in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not wish to say a great deal today about the hon. the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, because I should like to express a few thoughts concerning the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in particular. The hon. the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, however, revealed himself during a debate in the Provincial Council of the Transvaal as a person incapable of occupying a responsible position in South Africa. I think the hon. the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal is suffering from conceited chauvinism. In this connection I want to quote a single example and then leave the matter at that. During a debate he referred to the member of the Provincial Council for Pietersburg in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My people were civilized in this world, I want to tell you, when you were running around, your ancestors were in skins. We built the civilization of this world and I am not ashamed of it.</block>

<p>He spoke these words and he referred to the hon. Mr. Hough and also to other members. Not only did he refer to the Houghs, but also to the Steyns, the Fouries, the Malans, the Bronkhorsts, the Pypers, the De Villierses, the Graaffs and also &#x2026;</p>

<p>When the hon. Mr. Schwarz withdrew this, he said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think perhaps I should not have said it.</block>

<p>Contained in that withdrawal, to my way of thinking, is the idea that we as politicians in the Transvaal are dealing with a leader of the United Party in whose personality and political aspirations there is a built-in standpoint which is dangerous not only to sound human relations in South Africa, but also to all those population groups who see meaningful values in their own identity and in their own continued existence. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout who is a good friend of the hon. the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal. Earlier this year he said the following in the course of a debate, and I quote from Hansard of 5th April, col. 4027&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one hears what Government speakers have to say and how they carry on, one would swear that the student community constitutes the greatest threat to state security the country has ever seen.</block>

<p>He was referring to us on this side, but then se went further and made the following general statement in column 4208&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems to me as though some people in the country are losing their balance in regard to the students.</block>

<p><span class="col_4975-4976" refersTo="page_1041"/>I want to point out that if there is one party in South Africa that realizes that the largest percentage of the students in South Africa are fine young men and women, it is the National Party. I think most of the members of the United Party agree with what I am saying now. [Interjections.] Do hon. members not agree that the largest percentage of the students in South Africa are fine young men and women&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>The point I want to make is that in this regard the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a statement which was untrue. I want to state categorically that the largest percentage of students in South Africa are fine young men and women. What is interesting, is that the hon. member as a front-bencher went further and said that it appeared to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as though some people in the country are losing their balance in regard to the students.</block>

<p>I can say a great deal about student communities in the world. In many parts of the world student communities have really become a problem, but I want to leave this matter at that because it is a wide field of study. The hon. member for Yeoville said, <i>inter alia,</i> that Nusas as an organization was engaged in painting conditions in South Africa as black as possible in order to give an impressing of the necessity for its own activities and for the financing of those activities. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, however, said that it seemed to him as though some people in the country were losing their balance in regard to students. The hon. member for Yeoville also said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With this campaign extending over many years, it is very probable that Nusas has made a major contribution to the hostile attitude which exists abroad towards South Africa today.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member for Yeoville said while the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that it seemed to him as though some people in the country were losing their balance in regard to students. The hon. member for Yeoville went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; because the Nusas donors have the same objective with the money which with the one hand they give to those organizations and with the other hand to Nusas, namely a substitution of the whole of the existing order in South Africa.</block>

<p>The hon. member went on by saying (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As against this Nusas is pursuing certain political directions, which are dangerous to the State, within South Africa &#x2026;</block>

<p>And consequently he mentioned these. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said however, that it seemed to him as though people in South Africa were losing their balance in regard to students in South Africa. In contrast to what the hon. member for Yeoville said, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout went further and said that what was necessary in South Africa was not that the members of the Schlebusch Commission, United Party members such as Mr. Marais Steyn and National Party members, should set out investigating organizations such as Nusas with all their connections and investigating a finding submitted by a commission, but that we should appoint a commission to investigate all apartheid measures which had been made applicable since 1948 in South Africa. This afternoon, in this hour, I want to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I as a member of this hon. House, together with the hon. member for Mooi River and other hon. responsible members on that side of the House would like to see peace, stability and order in this country of ours and now I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, in the light of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout told us, to indicate to us under this Vote what measures he as alternative Prime Minister of this country wants to abolish. What measures does he want to abolish in respect of the contact situation in White South Africa. We want to know this because the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is a frontbencher of the United Party. He is a frontbencher who co-operates very closely with the Leader of the Transvaal, Mr. Harry Schwarz, and it is very clear from the <i>Sunday Times</i> not only that these two gentlemen have a bond between them, but also that they consult the <i>Sunday Times</i> <span class="col_4977-4978" refersTo="page_1042"/>and the political correspondents of the <i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>It is only fair towards the electorate of South Africa for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give us a very clear indication of what role and what place a man such as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout takes in his party. What role does he play&#x003F; What role does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout play in the agreement we reached with regard to the security of the State, which concerns the security not only of the White man but also of the non-White, i.e. the Bantu, the Coloured and the Indian&#x003F; If it is true that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is not satisfied with the findings of this commission, it is his duty to stand up here and to tell us precisely where he differs from those findings. I want to ask him whether he wants to allow us to create student communities in South Africa who want to move in the same directions as the student communities we have seen all over the face of this earth. In the times in which we are living, the student is in contact with the major philosophic trends in the world. He is experiencing a time of the greatest uncertainty in his own mind, a time in which he is seeking for meaningfulness and value for his own existence and for his continued existence.

<p>I do not intend dealing with the hon. member for Rissik. Mr. Schwarz of the Transvaal has already dealt with the charge against him that he was insulting the Afrikaner race. I understand that he apologized and said he was only referring to one particular man who happened to annoy him. In any event, it was not original. Disraeli said the same thing in England. I do not know whether there was an uproar about it when Disraeli said that, but it was not an original remark when Mr. Schwarz said it. In any event, it ill behoves members on that side of the House to come with race relation charges against us after the Boerehaat campaign we experienced in Oudtshoorn.</p>

<p>However, the hon. members are not going to relieve the hon. the Prime Minister of our charges against him. They are not going to draw red herrings across the trial of the queries we want to put to him. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s portfolio is now being discussed and he is the man who has to answer for his Government. He is the man who must tell us what his policies are. We have been left out in the dark far too long with regard to which direction the hon. the Prime Minister is taking. Mr. Blaar Coetzee said in a recent article that the Nationalist Government had been in power for 25 years and that they had had four main leaders. He said that at no stage during that time was there any dissatisfaction with them. Dr. Verwoerd, he said, was expected to be a very controversial leader but he had achieved many significant things and was at the peak of his political power when he was assassinated. He certainly was a controversial leader and he was unfortunately assassinated at the peak of his career.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>You can get up and read it to me when I sit down. He was quite right that Dr. Verwoerd was controversial, and had Dr. Verwoerd lived longer he would only have fallem from grace because it has been proved that his whole policy of separate development, his whole ideology and his theories were blunders. The rigid observance of apartheid is gradually being broken down by this Prime Minister. I give him credit for it, but it is being broken down grudgingly and almost surreptitiously with plausible exonerations about reasons for multi-nationalism as <span class="col_4979-4980" refersTo="page_1043"/>against multi-racialism. The reluctance to depart from the teachings and the ideologies of Dr. Verwoerd still exists today. I do not know why that should be. Mr. Blaar Coetzee, now that he is an ex-member of the Cabinet had something to say on this score. In writing about the Nico Malan Theatre he said that he could see no reason why multi-racial audiences should not be allowed. He said that when he mentioned it, many people would say &#x201C;oh yes, the decision was Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s&#x201D;. Then he goes on to say that Dr. Verwoerd could have changed his mind and continued: &#x201C;Dr. Verwoerd said at Loskop that Maoris would not be allowed to come to South Africa. But they were allowed to come and if the policy in regard to Maoris could be changed, why could not the policy in regard to the Nico Malan Theatre be changed&#x003F;&#x201D; There is therefore no doubt about it that Dr. Verwoerd was a controversial politician &#x2026;</p>

<p>A great Prime Minister, but his critics have been proved correct. He was wrong in everything he did. His critics have been proved right. I say he was saved from ignominy, of having to admit failure and to yield from this granite-like impression he gave that he would stand firm. The Government has been compelled to depart from Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s philosophies by the ordinary facts of life.</p>

<p>The cornerstones of Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy of separate development were political and economic separation. He visualized a commonwealth of White South Africa and independent Black states which he was going to establish. How the Coloureds and the Indians were to fit in was not clear. He was obsessed with the Bantu. Fundamental to his ideology was the policy of industrial decentralization. This was a fallacy, a delusion. There is nothing wrong with industrial decentralization. We approve of industrial decentralization and it is done in every country of the world. They are all trying to do it, at any rate. We approve of it, but not for ideological purposes. Where Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy failed was that he tried to do it for ideological purposes. The whole facade of his depiction is crumbling and it is also crumbling as far as the decentralization of industry is concerned, the decentralization to the borders of the Reserves. Dr. Verwoerd was opposed to allowing White capital in the Reserves. He wanted industrial development to take place on the borders of the Reserves and not in the Reserves. He did not want private White capital to go into the Reserves. One of the reasons he gave for the rejection of private White capital was that it would promote the idea of economic partnership leading to political partnership. Foreign interests could be involved in this way competing from the homelands in the South African market as well as possibly complicating the country&#x2019;s political problems. Now I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister what his policy is in regard to allowing private White capital into the Reserves. Does he still stand by what Dr. Verwoerd said&#x003F;</p>

What we condemn is the hesitancy and the reluctance on his part to face up to the facts. The Prime Minister is said to be a pragmatist, and that approach is to be recommended, but then there must be direction, and at present the Prime Minister is not giving direction.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the speech made by the hon. member for Transkei merely emphasized one fact, i.e. that the Opposition is clutching at straws&#x2014;or should I say &#x201C;leaves&#x201D;&#x003F;&#x2014;to come into power. It was alleged here that the hon. the Prime Minister was supposed to disparage the policy of apartheid. I want to say to you, Sir, this afternoon that this hon. the Prime Minister is not disparaging a policy; under his guidance our policy is being expanded and developed even further. I think I can say this afternoon&#x2014; and I do so with the utmost responsibility &#x2014;that the position of the hon. the Prime Minister is as strong as anybody&#x2019;s could be in South Africa, just as strong as any of his predecessors, if not stronger.</p>

<p>Having also listened to speakers on the Opposition side, one could easily&#x2014;if one does not know what the true state of affairs is&#x2014;get the impression that the sun will not rise over South Africa tomorrow morning. I have listened to what was being said here this afternoon and, according to Opposition speakers, this country is in a very poor state economically and, according to them, there are probably millions of people who will go to bed tonight without their having had anything to eat. One does not have to go back very far to prove that the Opposition is wrong. What they said this afternoon, is further proof to me that this Opposition does not have any contact with the practical situation outside this House and that they have completely lost contact with the outside world.</p>

<p>The past long week-end alone served as clear proof to us that the economic situation in this country is not as bad as they have alleged here. In my constituency there is a major attraction for holiday-makers and I went to the trouble during the past week-end to go and see what was happening there. I want to say to you this evening, Sir, that there were thousands of holiday-makers&#x2014;not tourists from abroad, but our own people, Whites and non-Whites, who visited those places. This we do not begrudge them. It was the same at all the other holiday resorts in our country. I want to make the statement this evening that millions of rands were spent during the past week-end by people who simply went on holiday.</p>
