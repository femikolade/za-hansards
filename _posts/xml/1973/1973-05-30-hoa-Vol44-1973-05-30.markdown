<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position here is that the department is unfortunately unable to accept this recommendation. Accordingly I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this recommendation be referred to the Government for consideration.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am gravely disturbed and gravely disappointed that the hon. the Deputy Minister is not able to accept the recommendation of the Select Committee in respect of Dr. Tate. I believe that the department and the hon. the Deputy Minister are placing undue emphasis on legal technicalities and precedents, where the point at issue in this recommendation by the Select Committee is a moral one. It is a moral obligation which the Government owes to this gentleman. I do not think the facts of the case are in dispute at all. The facts of the case were accepted by the Select Committee. They were accepted by the Department of Health, in which department Dr. Tate is employed, and they were accepted by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. That is as far as the facts are concerned. I think the House should know what those facts are.</p>

<p>Prior to December, 1969, Dr. Tate was employed by the Cape Provincial Department of Hospital Services, and in that employment he had the right to choose to retire at the age of 60, although the normal retiring age in the Provincial Administration is 65. This is a right to which Dr. Tate attached, and still attaches, a great deal of value for personal reasons, those personal reasons being irrelevant to the consideration of this case. For more than a year prior to December, 1969, the Department of Health in Pretoria had indicated to Dr. Tate that they would like him to transfer from the Cape Provincial Hospital Services to the Department of Health, and to assume psychiatric duties at Valkenberg Mental Hospital. Dr. Tate himself was quite willing to accept this transfer, but the stumbling block, of which Dr. Tate was fully aware, was that if he accepted this transfer, he would lose his right to retire at the age of 60. For that reason, until December, 1969, he refused this transfer because he was not prepared to be transferred and to lose this right, which he already had, to retire at 60.</p>

<p>In about October, 1969, when Dr. Tate was Superintendent of Victoria Hospital in Wynberg, he received a telephone call from the Department of Health in Pretoria, again offering him this transfer to psychiatric duties at Valken berg Hospital, and giving him a clear undertaking that if he accepted transfer he would retain his right to retire at the a e of 60. This undertaking by the Department of Health was confirmed by the Superintendent of the Valkenberg Hospital, <span class="col_7907-7908" refersTo="page_1021"/>and on the basis of that undertaking Dr. Tate agreed to the transfer. On 15th December, 1969, a letter was written to Dr. Tate in which this undertaking to him was confirmed in writing. You can imagine, Mr. Chairman, the dismay of this gentleman when, in April, 1970, he received a letter from the Department of Health in which he was advised that the undertaking that he could retire at 60 had been erroneously given to him, and that it was null and void. I should like to emphasize to this Committee that Dr. Tate only accepted this transfer on the basis of the undertaking given to him by the Department of Health, an undertaking which was confirmed in writing. The Select Committee, in reaching its decision, clearly understood these facts and decided that its recommendation should be such that the undertaking by the Government to Dr. Tate would be honoured.</p>

<p>Sir, in the whole of my life I have accepted a man&#x2019;s word as his bond. Particularly have I accepted a man&#x2019;s word as his bond when that man has been a senior civil servant, and the word has been given to a person of responsibility such as Dr. Tate. I believe that there is not a single member in this House who would be party to the breaking of promises that would be entailed if this undertaking is not honoured. I believe that if it is not honoured, there will have been perpetrated a great miscarriage of justice. I appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to withdraw his objection to this recommendation of the Select Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I would like to support the hon. member for Constantia in his appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to withdraw his objection to this particular recommendation. I think we must bear in mind that this senior official only had one avenue of appeal. His only recourse is a petition to this House. I think the petitioner acknowledges the fact that in terms of the regulations and of the Act as it stands, his right to retain the retiring age of 60 years was forfeited when he joined the Public Service Pension Fund. However, I think we must bear in mind the information that was placed before the Select Committee on Pensions, a Select Committee of this House, which has to consider reports from the various departments concerned, and weigh the evidence which is placed before it before coming to a decision. In this case the Select Committee came to the decision to make the recommendation which is now before this Committee and in terms of which this senior official will retain his right to retire at the age of 60 years of age.</p>

<p>I think it is important to bring to the notice of this Committee the fact that at no stage was his statement refuted that he had been advised erroneously in regard to his right to retain this pension benefit. Indeed, the letter of transfer written to him, dated 15th December, 1969, clearly indicated that he would retain his right to retire at 60 years of age. This was then rectified in a letter addressed to Dr. Tate, dated 17th April, 1970, by the Department of Health, stating that he had been erroneously informed in his letter of transfer dated 15th December, 1969. This means, Sir, that this man was under the impression when he was transferred that he would be able to retain the right to retire at 60. He accepted the transfer on that basis in all good faith. His right to retire at the age of 60 years whilst he was in the employ of the Cape Provincial Administration came about when he purchased a pensionable service of some 3&#x00BD; years. This then gave him the right to retire at 60 years of age.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that this man would not have accepted transfer if he knew that he would not retain that right. It is also quite clear that the Deputy Minister has objected to this recommendation on the ground that it would create a precedent. I submit that all these cases which are referred to the Select Committee on Pensions are dealt with on their merits, and I doubt whether there could be a large number of officials who, when they were transferred from provincial service to the Government service, were erroneously informed of their retirement right at the time of the transfer, in other words, who find themselves in exactly the same circumstances as this particular gentleman. I believe that if the acceptance of the Select Committee&#x2019;s recommendation would create a precedent, and if in fact there is a large number of similar cases, then it certainly reflects on the administration of the departments concerned.</p>

<p>The evidence which was placed before the Select Committee influenced the Committee in arriving at its decision, which is now before this Committee in the form of a recommendation, and I do hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will see his way clear to allow this recommendation to stand. His acceptance of this recommendation <span class="col_7909-7910" refersTo="page_1022"/>would in no way prejudice other petitions which may be submitted to this House, as they would obviously be dealt with on their merits by the Select Committee on Pensions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to make it very clear that it is, of course, not the department&#x2019;s attitude towards Dr. Tate, as Dr. Tate, that is at issue here. It is a principle that is at issue here. The facts as furnished by the hon. member for Constantia are correct to some extent, and to some extent they are disputed. I just want to tell him why we dispute them. The position is that Dr. Tate was employed by the Provincial Administration. Then he approached the department and asked what his position would be if he should be transferred to the Public Service. Dr. Tate was told very clearly that if he should do this, he would fall under the ordinary pension fund regulation applicable to all public servants after June 1955, i.e. that he would only be able to retire at the age of 65. This information was given to Dr. Tate, and he acknowledged it in a letter dated June, 1968, which he addressed to the Director of Hospital Services and in which the following sentence occurs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am aware of the fact that should I transfer my contributions to the Public Service Pensions Fund effective from the above date, I will be required to remain in the Service until the age of 65.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Just give me a chance; then you can say something too. This was before he transferred. In other words, he transferred knowing full well what the position was. The Select Committee which sat on this matter received a report by the Department of Health in which he served. In this report the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Tate was informed on 15th August, 1968, by this department that he would on transfer become a member of the Public Service Pension Fund, in which case he would have to remain in the Service until the age of 65 before retiring on pension. Also that he may elect to contribute to the pension fund as from any date after his 18th birthday, but it will not entitle him to retire at the age of 60.</block>

<p>Now the problem is that the department feels that if we do not oppose this matter in principle, it is going to place this gentleman in a much more favourable position than several thousands of other officials who became members of the Public Service Pension Fund after 22nd June, 1955. Under those circumstances the department felt that it could not make an exception here for Dr. Tate. I just want to tell hon. members further that this hon. gentleman made a similar request to the Select Committee in 1971 and that it was refused; in 1972 he again made a similar request to the Select Committee and that, too, was refused, and this year he made a request again, and now it had been granted. Unfortunately my department is unable on principle to accept this recommendation, and I therefore ask that it be refused.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I think the principle involved in this matter is one of far greater importance in relation to the individual concerned, Dr. Tate, than on the basis on which the Deputy Minister puts the matter. The hon. the Deputy Minister has strengthened the reasons for Dr. Tate having the benefit of the undertaking given to him by the Secretary for Health. What did he do&#x003F; He was informed in 1968, from what the hon. the Deputy Minister has told us, as to what would be the consequences if he joined the Public Service, so he refused to go. He refused to go to the Valkenberg Hospital because of the consequences of which he was made aware. What happened next&#x003F; He was again approached and he was again urged to join and to serve at Valkenberg, and he said: &#x201C;The position is that I want to retain my rights to retire at the age of 60. &#x201D;So the Secretary for Health wrote to him in December, 1969, and said it was all right, he could retire at the age of 60. The hon. the Deputy Minister, surely, as a lawyer, will not contest the position that a person holding the office of Secretary for Health, a person who is empowered to make appointments, has the implied authority as far as anybody he deals with in the Public Service is concerned, to set the terms of his employment, especially in this case where Dr. Tate knew the danger. He knew what would happen and he asked specifically for an assurance. The assurance was given by the Secretary for Health, who employed him.</p>

<from><span class="col_7911-7912" refersTo="page_1023"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Confirmed in writing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, confirmed in writing in December, 1969. If there is any principle to be accepted, it is that the implied authority of the Secretary for Health should at least be recognized by the Government, that it should honour that undertaking by the Secretary for Health, whether he was acting <i>ultra vires</i> or <i>intra vires.</i> That is the principle in this case. I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister has only read a portion of the letter dated August, 1968. I understand that was when Dr. Tate refused to accept transfer from the provincial administration because of that very fact. He was then induced to accept transfer. He was induced to serve the central Government by the undertaking and assurance given by the Secretary for Health.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that the recommendation of the Select Committee puts Dr. Tate in a more favoured position than other public servants. What are the facts which the hon. the Deputy Minister has given us&#x003F; Dr. Tate was in fact in so far as the Department of Health was concerned doing it a favour in filling a post where his services were urgently required. He did not choose it. He was quite happy in his service with the provincial administration, but he was approached to come to serve at the Valkenberg Mental Hospital. He then decided to take up such employment after he had received a written undertaking, a written assurance by the Secretary for Health. But the hon. the Deputy Minister says there is no principle involved other than that this should be refused because it will put Dr. Tate in a favoured position.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister, because I think that in the light of the circumstances of the case, it is a case which stands on its own. It is a case in which Dr. Tate is entitled to the benefits which flow from his appointment with the assurances he received from the Secretary for Health.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to tell the hon. member for Green Point that as a lawyer I am quite aware of the fact that when a person is told something in writing he is entitled to react to it. However, I say that the Department of Health is disputing that fact. The Department of Health says in its report to the Select Committee that it never told Dr. Tate that he would be able to retire at the age of 60.</p>

<p>There was no letter. I asked whether there had been a letter. I have Dr. Tate&#x2019;s petition here, as well as a report by the Secretary for Health, and I quote from the report as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of the foregoing Dr. Tate declined the offer of appointment. He reapplied for transfer on the 21st October, 1969. His transfer was approved on the 15th December, 1969, and in this letter of transfer Dr. Tate was erroneously informed that he would be afforded the opportunity &#x2026;</block>

<p>Please. The hon. member should give me the opportunity to read out the letter before he starts shouting, for then he will find out that he should not have shouted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to elect to contribute to the Public Service Pension Fund in respect of his pensionable service with the Cape Provincial Administration. Sight was lost of the fact that the provision for an officer to elect to transfer his contributions from one fund to the other was withdrawn.</block>

<p>There is not a single word here about bis reaching the age of retirement at 60. Not a word was said to that man about his being able to retire at 60. For that reason I say that it is impossible for my department to make a concession in this regard, since the facts are disputable, and particularly since it is a principle which involves thousands of public servants. If the facts had been undisputed, our attitude might have been different. It is not possible for my department to concede to such a request where the facts are disputed, since it is a very important principle which affects thousands of public servants.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to make use of the opportunity of reading to this House the relevant paragraph of Dr. Tate&#x2019;s letter of appointment, dated 15th December, 1969, which was signed by the Secretary for Health. This letter was addressed to Dr. J. W. Tate. Paragraph 2, which refers to his pension position, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7915-7916" refersTo="page_1025"/>In terms of the provision of the Government Service Pension Act, Act No. 62 of 1965, as amended, you are required to contribute to the Public Service Pension Fund at the rate of 4% and to the Government Service Widows&#x2019; Pension Fund at the rate of 2% of your pensionable emoluments with effect from the date of your assumption of duty in this department. You will in due course be afforded the opportunity to elect to contribute to the Public Service Pension Fund in respect of your pensionable service with the Cape Department of Hospital Services.</block>

<p>It is that last sentence that refers to his right to retire at the age of 60. The letter received by Dr. Tate, also from the Secretary of Health, of 17th April, 1970, reads: &#x201C;In pursuance of paragraph 2 &#x2026;" which is the paragraph that I have read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of my evenly numbered letter of appointment dated 15th December 1969, I have to inform you that it was erroneously indicated that you would be afforded the opportunity to elect to contribute to the Public Service Pension Fund in respect of your pensionable service with the Cape Department of Hospital Services.</block>

<p>I submit that that was a clear undertaking by the Department of Health in regard to Dr. Tate&#x2019;s right to retire at the age of 60. Even if it was erroneously given, the department and the State should stand by that undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad that the hon. member has now read that particular letter which has been asked for, for in my humble opinion the question which is dealt with there is the question of whether the hon. gentleman can buy service, and it has nothing to do with his age of retirement as such. In the letter I have read out here the hon. gentleman asked the department very clearly whether he could remain in the service up to the age of 60. He himself clearly says that he understands that if he transfers he will have to remain in the service up to the age of 65.</p>

<p>That assurance was in the vaguest terms &#x2026; and I want to make it very clear, if hon. members would give me the chance, that the department has nothing whatsoever against Dr. Tate. We have said, and that is our standpoint, that on the information that was submitted to the Select Committee we had no other choice than to object in principle to granting this kind of retrospective pension benefit. We cannot allow it, for there are thousands of public servants who have to work until they are 65 years old. The moment this application is granted it will mean that other public servants will have the right to say, and quite rightly too, that the Select Committee has in fact granted it in the case of Dr. Tate and that they want the same benefits. We would have no option and it would completely disrupt our whole payments position in the fund. Consequently we cannot allow it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot quite follow the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s argument that there will be thousands of persons who will come forward to make similar claims. The hon. the Deputy Minister says there is a matter of the principle involved here. Certainly as far as this official is concerned, it is a matter of principle in that he was advised in 1968 what the consequences would be if he transferred to the Department of Health. He declined to transfer to the Department of Health. He was subsequently advised that he would still have the right to elect to contribute to the Public Servants&#x2019; Pension Fund in respect of his provincial pensionable service. Here the Department of Health indicated in its letter of April, 1970, that that letter of December, 1969, at the time of his transfer, was erroneous. This was some time after the man had made his decision, and consequently it was too late for him to transfer back to the Cape Provincial Pension Fund, where in any event he would also not have been able to retire at the age of 60. He was then placed in the position that he had to come to this House to ask whether his case could be considered. The fact his previous petitions failed is, to my mind, of no consequence and not relevant. <span class="col_7917-7918" refersTo="page_1026"/>The constitution of that Select Committee varies from session to session, and other facts and new evidence are brought in by petitioners which could result in a decision of the Select Committee being changed. Indeed, in this particular case, with the evidence placed before that Select Committee this year, it was felt by the Committee that a pledge had been given to the petitioner and that that should be honoured. It was felt that this would not in any way create a precedent as indicated by the Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions. The danger he mentioned of thousands of people coming forward seeking similar relief because of similar circumstances is not an argument. This man has a case and he put it forward, and on the evidence in the reports that was were placed before the Select Committee, the Select Committee considered that this man should have his plea granted. It is a great pity that the hon. the Deputy Minister is unable to accept this recommendation which comes as a majority decision by the Select Committee on Pensions.</p>

<speech by="#palm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, our experience yesterday was that several hon. members were expressing their concern about over-population in respect of the Coloureds in the Peninsula. I also just want to state this point briefly by telling the Minister that there are parts in the Western Cape where there is also a prevailing concern because there is a large Coloured population that cannot be employed. I want to ask the Minister whether he would not <span class="col_7919-7920" refersTo="page_1027"/>help the Municipality of Worcester to make progress in that connection in their negotiations with the Decentralization Board concerning the location of industries based on Coloured labour. I can give him examples of cases where Coloureds have come by the hundreds to apply to industrialists in the town for work. We would not like them to move away to the city, because here there is already an over-population problem. With the exception of a few hon. members, i.e. the hon. members for Turffontein, Port Natal, Bezuidenhout and Wynberg, it seems to me as if the majority of hon. members opposite, who have taken part in this debate, are quite slowly beginning to realize that the Government has good intentions as far as the Coloureds are concerned. Although the hon. members for Wynberg and Bezuidenhout did not take part in the debate, we know their standpoints. Except for those four hon. members, hon. members opposite are beginning to display a greater degree of realism with respect to the tremendous task this Government is engaged in and with respect to the upliftment of the Coloureds in the economic and other spheres. They realize that the Government is engaged in a great task of upliftment in the spheres of education, social services and also in the economic and political spheres. But these four hon. members, to whom I referred, remind me of the adage: &#x201C;None is so blind as those who will not see.&#x201D; These four hon. members are apparently wearing political blinkers and refuse to perceive that, in the years that have passed, this Government has made tremendous strides in its educative task and with respect to its political achievements and the political guidance given to the Coloureds. We could mention long lists of achievements in the sphere of education. We could tell them of technical colleges, schools, universities, etc. We could tell them of social and economic upliftment. They know the facts, but they are blind because they do not want to see. I think the time has come for hon. members of the Opposition and particuarly the four I have mentioned, to stop with their game of telling the Coloureds that this Government is doing them an injustice, that this Government is discriminating against them, that this Government is giving them inhuman treatment and that this Government begrudges them any human rights. I think the time has come for the hon. member for Wynberg to be told that she must stop speaking as she has done in the past. I am referring to Hansard, column 8374 of 1972, where she stated that the Coloureds are bitterly disillusioned and that the Government has manifested an overwhelming vote of no-confidence in our Coloured people and their leaders. The time has come for these people to stop giving the Coloureds negative guidance; the time has come for these four hon. members to also act as true gentlemen and to tell the Coloured leaders that they have a positive task to carry out. There are, of course, Coloured leaders who do not agree with us. I regret to say this, but it appears to me as if the hon. members for Port Natal, Wynberg and Bezuidenhout, in particular, rather speak to those persons than to those who think positively in respect of their own people. A true leader is not the front rank protester; a true leader is the person who gives positive guidance to his people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg has said that the Coloureds have been disillusioned. Sir, when does a person become disillusioned&#x003F; This happens when certain promises are made to one by one&#x2019;s friends and when one is subsequently disappointed because those promises are not kept. We can rightfully say that this Government has never made any promises to the Coloureds which it has not kept. I think that this Government has taken a very straight, honest and sincere course as far as the Coloureds are concerned. Can we also say as much about the hon. members of the Opposition&#x003F; Do you know, Sir, why the Coloured leaders, with whom the hon. member for Wynberg associates, have been disillusioned&#x003F; I think those people have been disillusioned because she promises them full citizenship; because she promises them equal civic rights, equal political and social rights. She promises this, Sir, and then her party comes along and say: &#x201C;No, that is not the United Party&#x2019;s policy,&#x201D; and then they come along with a federation policy in which the Coloureds would have such a faint voice politically and would be subservient to the Whites or the Bantu in that federal parliament for many years to come.</p>

<speech by="#palm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member had a chance to make a speech yesterday. Sir, if there is a party, if there is a government, which can say to the Coloureds with sincerity and pride: &#x201C;This is our policy; we are taking you along this road,&#x201D; then it is this Party and this Government. We have no reason to be ashamed. What is more important: Social upliftment, job opportunities, or just a political voice&#x003F; I think that the educational task we are engaged in, as far as the Coloureds are concerned, their social and economic upliftment throughout the years, are worth much more to them than an empty promise, by the United Party, of a political voice which, under their federal policy, they will never be able to give the Coloureds.</p>

<p>Sir, yesterday the hon. member for Turffontein said here: &#x201C;We are close to losing the goodwill of the Coloured community.&#x201D; Sir, if he really knows the Coloured community&#x2014;and I am now speaking of the members of the Coloured community and of the Coloured leaders who think positively, who are not bent on negative criticism&#x2014;I think he will agree with me when I say that he does not know what he is talking about. It is a fact, of course, that there are Coloured leaders who do not agree with this Government. We call them the protesters. But there are many other Coloureds, large numbers of them, who gratefully co-operate every day and are trying to go along with this Government in the direction which promises something good, something big for the Coloured population for years to come. Sir, I am saying that we can present long lists of achievements. I can tell you here of the decision of the Government on 11th January, 1973&#x2014;this is only one of many achievements&#x2014;to make an additional amount of R21 million available to the administration of Coloured affairs for its school building programme. Sir, R21 million for the next four years is a tremendous amount of money. Here I do not want to fling reproaches at hon. members opposite and remind them of what they had to offer in respect of Coloured education in the days when they still had political authority. Slapdash schools, or no schools at all, were the lot of the Coloureds in those days. If I were to dwell on education, Sir, I could tell you of the technical colleges at which almost 3 000 Coloureds are studying today; I could mention to you the advanced technical training at the technical college in the Peninsula, where almost 600 Coloureds are receiving post-school training. Sir, we could point out to you that according to the Minister of Coloured Affairs, 97,4% of all eleven year old Coloureds are at school today and that 94,2% of all twelve year old Coloureds are at school today. We could tell of the establishment of a University for Coloureds; we could tell of the attempts at rehabilitation of those addicted to alcohol; we could tell of our training of young Coloureds as sailors; we could speak of our youth camps for Coloureds. Sir, I could mention a long string of things&#x2014;positive steps taken by this Government throughout the years. I repeat that fortunately there are members on that side of the House who are beginning to realize this, but those four hon. members must take off their blinkers and realize what the Government is doing and co-operate with the Government in the interests of the Coloureds.

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Worcester will forgive me if I do not follow his argument, which was one relating to the Coloured people generally; because I want to deal with the Coloured people of Natal and a group of people there known as the Dunn community in particular. They are a group of people, Sir, whose circumstances are quite different from those of the Coloured people elsewhere in this country. They are indeed a community indigenous to Natal and to Zululand in particular, and they are a group of people whose cause has been pleaded here every year in the 12 years that I have been in this House, either by the hon. member for South Coast or by myself; and the tragedy of this group of people is that one makes so little progress on their behalf. As you know, Sir, the land which these people occupy, together with a whole lot of others who are not entitled to it, was promised to them by an Act of this Parliament some 40 years ago. It is not quite 40 years ago, but very nearly so. Year after year pleas have been made on their behalf but, as I have said, regrettably very little progress has been made. I have now debated this issue with, I think, three <span class="col_7923-7924" refersTo="page_1029"/>separate Ministers of Coloured Affairs, and I do hope that with the Minister who now holds this office some progress will be made. Sir, in terms of the recent consolidation proposals relating to KwaZulu, which I will obviously not go into in any detail at all, one can at least say in respect of those proposals&#x2014;and it is about the only good thing that comes out of them&#x2014;that the area occupied by the Dunn community is proposed to be demarcated as White, which means presumably that the Coloured people will be able to remain where they are. Together with that, Sir, there has been some slight progress in the sense that instead of placing them within the jurisdiction of a magisterial district of KwaZulu, the area in which they live&#x2014;in both places&#x2014;has been excised and they are to remain, for magisterial purposes, under the jurisdiction of the Republican Department of Justice. But at that point, Sir, any progress in respect of these people ends. The key to their situation is the refusal to grant them title to the land which has been promised them by legislation, land which has not only been promised by legislation passed by this House, but which has already been surveyed. All that is required is that the promise which the Prime Minister has given in respect of these people, in addition to the legislation, should be carried out. Sir, what is the hardship which stems from this situation&#x003F; It is not only the fact that they do not own the land, which is rightfully theirs, and that they cannot deal with it, but in every respect it is an economic hindrance to them. A four-lane highway of national road standard is about to be pushed through that community. Any owner of land, faced with those circumstances and, having a substantial portion of his land taken away for a national highway, is paid compensation. But, Sir, because these people have not got title to the land, they are not entitled to claim that compensation. I know that I have made representations to the relevant authorities in this regard and an assurance has been given that some device will be sought to enable compensation money to be kept in some way or another so that these people can ultimately claim it; but that in itself is not sufficient. Most of these people are sugar farmers. We are living in an era, Sir, so far as the sugar industry is concerned, where increased quotas can be worked for and obtained, but without title to the land on which they are farming, these people are in an invidious position so far as the improvement of their farms by the acquisition of additional quotas is concerned. These are merely two of the difficulties under which these people labour. There are Native squatters on their land. Week by week and month by month, from the Midlands of Natal and elsewhere, as Natives are moved off the White-owned farms, they come down and squat on this land of the Dunns because at the moment it is still scheduled Native area in terms of the law. The administrative officials in charge seem to be powerless to prevent this squatting from taking place. I know of instances where some of these people on the Dunns&#x2019; land, the Coloured people, have ploughed their property, property which is demarcated for them, for the purpose of planning cane, but the Natives move in and plant their own crops of mealies and potatoes, and the result of course is that the Coloured man suffers harm. Over and over again one gets a situation of this kind which has been pleaded for in this House year after year and yet no progress has been made. I do ask, now that the question is firmly before him, that this hon. Minister will take steps to see that justice is done to these people.</p>

<p>Then I wish to deal with the Coloured people in general, not only the Dunn community but the Coloured people in general in Zululand. The hon. the Minister will know that they may occupy areas like the suburb of Sunnydale and other places, and although they may be indigenous to Zululand they can occupy there and they can work there only in terms of permits from his department. In respect of the tremendous development at Richards Bay, where you cannot get White workmen in the skilled and semi-skilled categories, because they are simply not available, a lot of this work is done by Coloured people. The position there is that a camp has been set aside where the employers, the contractors, can build accommodation for their Coloured workmen, but it can only be bachelor accommodation. They may not bring in their families and they are apparently to go on living there indefinitely as single men, even though they may have families settled elsewhere. The result of course is that you are going to have immorality on a large scale. You have it there already. You have already in the local hospital a considerable increase in the incidence of venereal disease, and so you have a thoroughly unsatisfactory situation from both the sociological and every other point <span class="col_7925-7926" refersTo="page_1030"/>of view. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would, during the course of this debate, give an indication of what his attitude is to the position of Coloured people outside the Dunn community in so far as their working and living in Zululand is concerned. I believe that the time has come for a more realistic view to be taken of this situation. Everybody with whom I have contact, of all political persuasions, believes that a group area should be established within the Richards Bay municipality, which is an enormous stretch of country, largely undeveloped, on the lines of Sunnydale near Eshowe where proper family housing can be established for the Coloured people who are to work in this fast-growing centre. We cannot view these people there as temporary. They are there for as long as Richards Bay develops, for the simple reason that you cannot get White workmen to do this type of work anywhere in Natal and least of all in Richards Bay. Now, in respect of both the Dunn community, who are a peculiar community, and the rest of the Coloured people in Zululand, I believe it is time that they had the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention.</p>

<speech by="#roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. C. ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Zululand will excuse me if I do not follow up on what he has said. I should like to take the opportunity of saying a few words about the area in South-West Africa which is situated in my constituency and which also falls under the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs, i.e. Namaland. I now find it gratifying to state that I see that progress has been made with the agricultural planning in the northern portion of Namaland, according to the annual report which we obtained yesterday from the department, three-quarters of the area already having been planned for better farming methods. We want to tell the Minister that we are very grateful that he has made so much progress, but we want to ask him whether it is not possible to go faster, because these people, as you know, have been farming there in a very primitive manner throughout the years. I want to ask whether more guidance could not be given to them so that they may make better use of their farms and their land. It was also gratifying to see that the quality of their products has improved considerably. I notice that the average price of the pelts which they produced has increased from R3-50 to R5 over the past few years. We realize however that there is still a great task ahead for this department to get those people to the point of making the best economic use of the area they inhabit and the land they have at their disposal.</p>

<p>I now come to a matter which I have also discussed already with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor. I was part of a deputation which consulted the hon. the Minister about that&#x2014;petitions were also handed to the Minister. I am referring to the boundary fences between the White area and Namaland. Namaland is surrounded by proclaimed jackalproof areas which are free of wild animals. Namaland is still full of wild animals and the White farmers are in the position of having to maintain the boundaries alone and keeping their farms free of wild animals. This entails extensive costs to the farmers and frequently the farmers also suffer great losses. The farmers are also faced with the problem that people are forever climbing over the wire fences. The non-Whites climb over those fences regularly. It is very easy to steal a karakul lamb. If I must use the word, let me say that it is one of the easiest things in the world to steal a karakul lamb. The farmers consequently suffer great losses. This state of affairs does not, of course, promote good human relations between the White farmers and the inhabitants of Namaland. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>If that hon. member comes to South-West Africa one day I want to ask him to go and view the Brandberg, because the only thing he would be interested in is that rock carving that looks very much like him. That is about all he would know of South-West Africa. We are now dealing with things that are of importance to those people. We also know that the hon. the Minister is doing his share as far as those people are concerned.</p>

<p>There is a jackalproof fence around Namaland and the farmers&#x2019; request at the time to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor was that an improved fence should be erected with the assistance of the State. What they envisaged was a proper jackalproof fence with a wire coping on top so that one could make sure that wild animals would not climb over and also that people would not climb over the fence to commit thefts within the White area. We know that thefts are frequently committed in areas situated along the borders of non-White areas. I think that hon. members who represent Free State constituencies would be able to elaborate on that much more. As I <span class="col_7927-7928" refersTo="page_1031"/>have already said, such a situation does not promote better human relations. I therefore want to ask the hon. the Minister to investigate this matter again so that it can be determined whether the State cannot also contribute a share towards a more efficient fence being constructed round Namaland. That is my representation in this connection.</p>

<p>I also want to say something about Rehoboth. I am glad to note from the report that the Rehoboth Investment Corporation which we established a few years ago by means of legislation, is doing such good work and is showing progress in spite of the opposition to the corporation that exists on the part of the Basters. There is still a large degree of suspicion amongst the Basters as far as the investment corporation is concerned. I recently spoke to members of the board of directors and they informed me that they are making very rapid progress. We are grateful for the fact that we have those kinds of directors there who give up their time to do that work amongst the people.</p>

<p>I am also glad that progress has been made with the conversion of the Tsumis farm into a breeding farm where rams and bulls are bred so that the needs of the Basters can be provided for. We are very glad that to date it has already been possible to furnish so many of these animals to the Baster farmers. By means of this breeding station we shall succeed in making it unnecessary for these people to compete with the Whites in that it will not be necessary for them to go and buy karakul rams at auctions in the White areas. We want to express the hope that that breeding station at Tsumeb will produce sufficient rams and bulls to provide for the needs of the Rehoboth farmers in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister how far the planning has progressed as far as the Rehoboth township area is concerned. In the report which has been tabled I see that progress has been made in that the necessary aerial photographs of the Rehoboth township have already been taken and that the contour plan is now being prepared, subsequent to which the actual planning will take place. I want to ask the Minister whether those people are still vehemently opposed to development. In addition I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if there is opposition, it is my humble opinion&#x2014;I am now speaking from the experience I have had of those people from the &#x2019;thirties&#x2014;that the department must simply continue with the planning because it is only to the advantage of those people that that planning be done. As hon. members know, the main road from South-West Africa passes Rehoboth. It is very unsightly. As hon. members know, almost all the people of Rehoboth work in Windhoek and only live on week-ends at Rehoboth. Consequently nothing is happening in Rehoboth. It is completely unsightly for tourists and travellers to drive past a place that looks the way Rehoboth does. Notwithstanding the fact that these Rehoboth people do not want to know anything about apartheid, they implement apartheid amongst their own people. Absolute chaos prevails, and I want to ask the department to shift away from the road, as quickly as possible, the residential area of the Nama section which is employed by Rehoboth Basters. I think it is scandalous for such a slum area to be situated on the main highway. It actually makes one think of what it looked like in the United Party days. I want to state further that one must begin to bring it home, in a nice way, to these Rehoboth Basters who are so clever, that the things being done by the South African Government are to their advantage. It is not only to the advantage of the non-Whites, but it is high time that they began to realize that it is in no one&#x2019;s interest in South Africa, not in their own, not in the interests of the Whites, nor in the interests of the other Coloured groups, for them to adopt the attitude which they are adopting in opposition to the Government at present. The sooner they begin to realize that the Whites also have a right in South-West Africa and that the Whites are there to stay permanently, the better would it be for the coexistence of all people in South-West Africa. The Whites are there, not only to stay, but also to ensure that all the other people who are there will remain there and make a living with human dignity. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to discuss apartheid in South-West Africa and the apartheid of the Rehoboth Basters nor the integration of the other non-Whites in their economy. That I leave to the Minister himself. But I want to follow on the discussion by the hon. member for Zululand who dealt with the position of Coloureds in Zululand. I wish to deal with the Coloureds in the Transkei. I have raised the question of the Coloureds in the Transkei from time to time and unfortunately their position remains as unsatisfactory as <span class="col_7929-7930" refersTo="page_1032"/>it ever was. In 1967 we had quite a lengthy debate on the Coloureds of the Transkei. When I raised their position with the then Minister of Coloured Affairs he told me it was not his problem and that that problem fell under the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Of course, I do not agree with that as I contend that it is the duty of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs to look after the Coloureds who are resident in the Transkei. People do not realize how many Coloureds there are in the Transkei. In 1967 the then Minister of Coloured Affairs told me in this House that there were 10 000 at that stage. I thought there were more but nevertheless that was the number given of Coloureds living in the Transkei at that stage. They largely perform the same duties as the Coloureds in Zululand which was referred to by the hon. member for Zululand. They are the artisan type. Of course the Minister will know that there is great development now in the Transkei as far as buildings are concerned, and that Coloureds are supplying the labour. The position is that there are Coloureds living in the White towns and villages in the Transkei, as well as in the rural or Bantu areas. These fall under the jurisdiction of the Transkei Government. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he would tell us what plans he has for the Coloureds living in the Transkei. We know from statements made by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development that the Coloureds are in the same position as the Whites and that eventually they must leave the Transkei. What is to happen to them&#x003F; We know that some years ago an attempt was made to bring them down to Cape Town and to give them employment down here. They were given free travel facilities, but the scheme failed. We know, too, that there are Coloureds in the Transkei who can afford to leave and to establish themselves elsewhere and buy property, but one of the difficulties has been to know where to go, where they will be able to buy property and where there will be work for them. I will deal with this particular problem just now. The position of the Coloureds living in the villages is that in a few cases they own their own property, or otherwise they occupy properties which they hire from White owners. The White owners are selling out rapidly in the villages, in Umtata and in the areas which are zoned for Africans. The Coloureds are placed in the position that they are forced to leave. Some of them are allowed to stay, but others are given notice to leave. Now, where do they go&#x003F; There is no provision in the Transkei for them; there is no area zoned for occupation by Coloured people. There is no area zoned in Umtata for Coloured occupation. I know there have been discussions with the municipality, but I would like to know from the hon. the Minister if he can tell us what provision is being made for accommodating the Coloureds in Umtata especially, and also in the rest of the Transkei. When I raised this question in 1967, the then Minister said that the Department of Labour in collaboration with the Department of Coloured Affairs wanted to start a recruiting campaign to get in touch with the Coloureds in the Transkei with a view to placing them in employment elsewhere, for example in the Western Cape. He also said that they could not do that until they had housing for them and that it was therefore not a matter which could be put right overnight. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development told us on the same day that he had been consulted by Coloureds in the Transkei to come down here, and that the difficulty was to find housing for them. He said that he had interviews with Coloureds in Umtata and that they were concerned with the individual problem of a certain Coloured who was leaving the Transkei and who had already found himself work at a certain place in the Western Cape, but that he had not yet found accommodation for himself. The Minister said: &#x201C;The one Coloured who had that problem in regard to accommodation has already availed himself of the offer which we made him the other day, that is to get in touch with us. We are seeing whether he cannot be assisted to get accommodation in the Western Cape.&#x201D; That is the problem those who want to come down here have in regard to housing. I want the hon. the Minister to give us a comprehensive statement so that the Coloureds in the Transkei will know what the position is, because obviously there must be a procedure they must follow if they want work outside the Transkei. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell me what provision is made for housing for these people.</p>

<p>We have heard a lot of talk lately about educating the Coloureds to play a bigger part in serving their own people and to promote their development. I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister what is done for the education of the Coloureds in the Transkei. I was under the impression that there was no secondary school any more in Kokstad&#x2014;there are certainly none <span class="col_7931-7932" refersTo="page_1033"/>in the Transkei itself&#x2014;but I understand that there is still one in Kokstad, or so I am told, although the numbers of scholars have fallen off. It must be an unsatisfactory school otherwise the numbers would not fall off so materially. For the Coloureds in Umtata to get their secondary education, they have to go right down to Humansdorp or Uitenhage, where most of them in fact go. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister if any assistance is given to these Coloureds by way of bursaries for paying boarding fees. What assistance is given to them for better education for their people&#x003F; In the Transkei itself there are no facilities for them to get secondary education. I do not want the hon. the Minister to tell me that it is not his duty to look after these people, that it is the duty of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The latter certainly has some say in the administration of the Transkei, but I submit that it is the duty of this Minister to see that the people under his charge are properly catered for. I want him to give me a comprehensive statement as to what provisions are made for those Coloureds who wish to leave the Transkei so that I can tell them when I get back, because they always see me when I get back to ask me what has been decided.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not respond to what the hon. member said because I want to express a few other ideas. If there has ever been gratitude for the fact that the Coloureds were removed from the political struggle, the day for that has probably now come, because we are all agreed about that. I think the Coloureds are the most grateful of all because, if that had not happened, the Coloureds would by now have been ground to powder in the political struggle. Now, after 30 years, we are today forced to hear a great many honeyed phrases dropping from hon. members&#x2019; lips about the Coloureds. Since this debate began, it has been apparent that the United Party is really playing at being a chameleon, as the Press also puts it. If it is one party during the day, it is another party at night. It changes colour like a chameleon. We want to concede that hon. members opposite have, in fact, thus far furnished positive contributions to this debate, but they cannot help still rousing the feelings between the Brown people and the White people. We cannot imagine what the reason for that is, or whether they have a sound reason for doing so. Each time there are members of the Opposition who mention isolated cases which they use to show that the Government has not done its duty. We are certain that the Government is doing its full duty to all the people in our country. There has never been a Government that has done so much for every human being in South Africa as the National Party Government. We get this acknowledgment from the Coloureds and from the Coloured community. Recently we had the privilege on a certain occasion, when there were thousands of Coloureds gathered in my Prieska constituency, to hear the speech of the regional representative of the Karoo, Mr. Hollander. If hon. members had heard it, they would have noted that a large portion of it dealt with the Protea Club. I just want to quote a few of Mr. Hollander&#x2019;s words. He said (translation): &#x201C;The Lord gave us a Dr. Verwoerd, but Lord also took him away again; by a dispensation of Providence the Lord also gave us a John Vorster to rule South Africa for the welfare of all our people that have been placed here.&#x201D; If we get this kind of evidence, we know that a great deal has, in fact, been done and that the Coloureds are expressing gratitude.</p>

<p>I now want to ask the United Party: How much interest did they show in the Coloured population of South Africa and what progress did they bring the Coloureds when they ruled&#x003F; We still think of 1948 and 1943 when the Coloureds were driven to the polls by the hundreds, and only for one purpose, i.e. to keep the National Party under. We think of the organization that took place in the North to have every Coloured vote cast against the National Party.</p>

<p>When the general election was held in 1948, the National Party won the Victoria West constituency by 24 votes. The United Party then held a post-mortem. The finding was that 24 Coloured voters, who should have voted, nine of whom were on the Botterleegte farm, could not be at the polls in time. That was one cause which they advanced: Their people did not carry out the instructions of the party organization. [Interjections.] I resolved at the time that if the Lord gave me the opportunity I would fling it in their teeth&#x2014;so chew on that! <span class="col_7933-7934" refersTo="page_1034"/>Today there are still people who are prepared to issue a sworn statement to the effect that at the time they hired people to buy the Coloured vote for the United Party. They blamed the organizers who did that work for the fact that there was still 14 Coloureds whom they could still have registered. If they had done their work, the United Party would have won that constituency.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister to make more training opportunities available to the Coloureds, also in our part of the Karoo and in the Northern Cane. The Coloured potential there has already been developed intensively, but I want to ask whether opportunities cannot be created for them to be trained. We have thousands of Coloureds who have developed to a certain level and could be used to the benefit of the others who are still lagging far behind. We know that only a developed and responsible person can hold his own in life. We have such people in the northern parts of the Cape. I do not doubt for a single moment that in future, with the co-operation of local bodies, we shall be able to put right the injustice to Coloureds, as some United Party members call it here, as far as their housing is concerned. Those local authorities will co-operate to prevent things happening which we are sometimes blamed for while it is really not the National Party&#x2019;s fault.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the hon. member who has just sat down and who made a completely negative contribution to the discussion today, remembers the High Court of Parliament and enlarged Senate days as well as the extremes of petty apartheid which still exist in order to destroy the dignity of the very Coloured man for whom he claims his party has done such a great deal.</p>

<p>In talking about local authorities and housing, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister, not wanting to waste my time replying to this hon. member&#x2019;s negative remarks, whether he is aware of the serious situation which exists with regard to the Coloured people in the city of Johannesburg. Is he aware, for instance, of the projection that has been made, according to which the Coloured population of about 85 000 at the moment, will increase to nearly 150 000 persons, by 1985, approximately 10% of the total population at the time.</p>

<p>Is he aware, for instance, that their rate of growth at this stage is approximately 3,8% per annum as against 3,4% per annum, which is the average growth rate of population throughout the country&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. the Minister to direct his attention in a very specific way to the plight of these people who are desperately short of housing. Far from being grateful to the Government for what they are doing, these people are already developing a sense of militancy, unhappiness and discontent, which some authorities which deal with these affairs, such as the Johannesburg City Council, feel could even lead to an explosive situation because of the serious overcrowding and lack of satisfactory recreational, cultural and other amenities in the townships where they presently are, and also because of those who are completely homeless and live in odd spots throughout the city. It is a fact, and we are well aware of this, that as far as Alexandra Township is concerned, nearly 400 families were displaced. We know that in the case of a township called Noordgesig, which adjoins Soweto, the Coloured population of more than 1 000 families will shortly have to leave because their houses are to be demolished and replaced by homes for the Soweto people. We are also aware of the fact that some 2 000 houses have to be rebuilt because of an urban renewal scheme in Western Townships, where the houses are now approximately 50 to 55 years old I may say that these houses have stood the test of time remarkably well, under the circumstances. Nevertheless, they must be replaced. It is an absolute fact that at the moment we are short of approximately 9 000 houses for Coloured people in Johannesburg. We base that figure on an average of six persons per family.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the most important and serious aspect of the matter is not just that the Minister&#x2019;s attention should be directed to the housing requirements. Side by side with that is the question of the normal, general amenities which go with any township for any people. Here we have a people who are very fruitfully occupied in the commercial and industrial life of the community. They are a people who have, in a sense, almost been forgotten as far as the Coloured Affairs Department is concerned, because that department has concentrated its attention largely on the Coloured people in the Cape, where the majority of the Coloured people live. But nevertheless, with a community approaching <span class="col_7935-7936" refersTo="page_1035"/>100 000, one cannot close one&#x2019;s eyes to their normal development and to the normal requirements that any community needs if it is to live decently in any city. In the case of this community recreational facilities, facilities for religious purposes, cr&#x00E8;ches for children, business areas in which these people can conduct their own businesses in their own areas, and other community facilities, are lacking. The city of Johannesburg has played its part with regard to Bosmot particularly, which is fairly well-developed, but that is merely, one might say, a pilot scheme in relation to what is required. It would appear from the figures which have been given to me, and which I understand are absolutely authentic, that at least R6 million per annum will have to be provided in order to build approximately 1 000 to 1 500 homes per annum over the next 12 or 15 years, if we are to overcome the constant shortages and if we are to provide accommodation for families so that they will be decently and properly housed.</p>

<p>Sir, I take the strongest exception, as I have for a long time&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Minister will give this some thought&#x2014;to people being hounded from what are known as the White areas of a city in order to go to where they are supposed to belong, to places where no provision has been made for them. In the human sense this is even moje important than the actual accommodation which is needed, because these people live in a constant state of fear; their lives are clouded at all times by the knowledge that at any moment they may be evicted. I believe that that is the problem which faces us, and I say this in contrast to the negative approach which was adopted by the hon. member who has just spoken.</p>

<p>I would like to say further that what we require today is action. It is a well-known fact that even though the Department of Community Development is responsible for the housing side&#x2014;and we found this in the case of the Department of Bantu Administration&#x2014;the Minister in charge of the particular department dealing with the people who have to be housed does play some part in ensuring that action is taken, and that is what we would like the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations to do. It is quite clear from the speeches that we have heard from hon. members on both sides, except for the hon. member who has just sat down&#x2014;and I am sorry to be so outspoken, but that is the impression that I got&#x2014;that in this matter there is a note of urgency on all sides, which I think should impress the hon. the Minister. I hope the hon. the Minister will appreciate that there is this sense of urgency and my appeal to him is to ensure that before people are displaced from areas in which they are living at present, adequate alternative accommodation is provided for them. It should not be a question of displacing people, but rather a question of moving them into better and more congenial quarters.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the only comment I wish to make on the speech just made by the hon. member who has just sat down is that it is clear from what he has said that the policy of the Government of decentralization of industries is the correct one. We cannot keep on expanding in our metropolitan areas; we have to decentralize, and then these problems of overcrowding and congestion and moving of people from one place to another will fall away. If hon. members opposite would support us and help us to execute that policy, I think we will find that it is much cheaper to provide these facilities, for which the hon. member for Jeppes pleaded here, in border areas than it would be in our metropolitan areas such as on the Reef.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have made my point. As far as the Coloureds are concerned they, too, can become involved in this border area development. There is no reason why they cannot become involved in it.</p>

<p>I should like to make a few other remarks. I see in the annual report of the department that reference is made in paragraph 5.10 to the Peninsula Technical College, Bellville. This Technical College is situated in an area known as Bellville South. It was known as Bellville South when that area was still inhabited by Whites, before the Whites had to vacate that area as a result of the application of the Group Areas Proclamation in terms of which this area was allocated to the Coloureds. But because we in Bellville gladly endorse the policy of the Government, an advisory <span class="col_7937-7938" refersTo="page_1036"/>committee of Coloureds has now been established on the municipal level, and this advisory committee, in its wisdom, has decided that this area, which was commonly known as Bellville South, would in the future be known as Proteaville, and I wonder whether the wishes of this Coloured Advisory Committee should not rather be acknowledged in this report in future. To me this is a step in the right direction; it bears the stamp of the process by which our Coloured communities and our Coloured towns are becoming autonomous. May I also say that Proteaville is going to be a very important town. It is envisaged that it will become one of the first municipalities which will be fully manned by Coloureds. It will be the municipality within the borders of which the Coloured University will be situated; it will be the Coloured municipality accommodating within its borders the seat of the Coloured Council, and I think that it is only right that this Coloured community should have the desire to identify itself with its residential area by way of a new designation which will not create the impression that it is an appendage of the White community of Bellville. For this reason I think that those who draft reports could perhaps also take note of this movement within our Coloured community in the direction of autonomy.</p>

<p>But there is actually another matter I should like to raise here. Two evenings ago I had the opportunity of addressing a group of people outside this House and there I pointed out the necessity for a stimulus to be given by way of the establishment of industries in the Western Cape, to the absorbing of Coloured labour in the Western Cape. On that occasion I referred to certain figures I had obtained from the Department of Statistics, and one of these was, that seen in general, seen in the context of the Greater Boland, in other words, the area this side of the mountains including Worcester, Ceres and Tulbagh, extending to Vredendal, approximately 35% of the Coloured population was economically active. To be precise, the figure is 34.9%. This gave me the figure of 334 250 Coloureds who are actively involved in industry at this stage. I took the same figure and projected it to the expected Coloured population in the same area by the end of the century. You will know, Sir, that it is estimated that by the end of the century there will be 2 414 000 Coloureds within this area. If we maintain the <i>status quo</i> as far as employment is concerned, and if the percentage of economically active Coloureds is still, only 35% by the year 2000, then my finding is that by that time we shall have a Coloured labour force of 844 000 people, or 510 000 more than at present. If I take this figure of 510 000 people and divide it by the 28 years remaining before the end of the century, then I find that in our employment of Coloureds in the Boland we shall have to make provision for 18 200 people annually. It appears to me that my findings in this connection are endorsed to some extent by this report to which I have referred, because in this report reference is made to the fact that 15 000 18-year olds become available every year for registration in terms of the cadet scheme. At this stage 15 000 Coloureds are turning 18 every year. To me this seems correct. This figure must increase progressively and by the end of the century it will no longer be 18 200 people, as my average annual projection states, but quite probably 20 000 or 22 000 people who will have to be absorbed into industry here in the Western Cape and for whom employment will have to be provided. Let me say that it is my standpoint that unless we receive a fairly substantial stimulus, the kind of stimulus we expect by way of the establishment of the ore plant and steel processing industry at Saldanha, this labour will quite probably be absorbed into the service sector, which is manned chiefly by Whites here in the Western Cape; and unless we are able to absorb this Coloured labour into new jobs, we shall to an increasing extent experience the replacement of White labour by Coloured labour here in the Western Cape, and thereby also bring about a disproportion between White and Coloured as far as the whole of the Western Cape is concerned. At present it is already a fact that there are more Coloureds than Whites here in the Western Cape. I think that in some parts the proportion is 2,5 Coloureds to every White person, excepting the Cape Peninsula, and by the end of the century there will be three Coloureds to every White person in this greater area. That is why it is so essential for new employment opportunities to be created and for the White person not to be crowded out.</p>

<p>Now I want to go further. I find in this situation that the one common complaint in regard to the available Coloured labour, a complaint which is a factor and an argument in the matter as to why it is not possible to proceed with the establishment <span class="col_7939-7940" refersTo="page_1037"/>of industries on a large scale in the Western Cape, is the so-called unreliability and indiscipline of Coloured labour. I also find this complaint in this report before us. Just look at the declining figures as far as school attendance is concerned. While there were 95 000 at school in Sub. A last year, one finds that there were only 42 600 in Std. 4 and 9 300 in Std. 8 and only 2 000 in Std. 10, a drop from 95 000 to 2 000 in these ten standards, which is an indication that somewhere there is a lack of discipline, and an inadequate sense of discipline being instilled in the Coloured community, something which must eventually have an effect on discipline in labour as well.

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Bellville that we have always advocated industrial decentralization, provided that it rests on an economic basis and not on an ideological one. Then he referred to border industries for the Coloureds. I do not quite understand this statement, unless he has a Colouredstan in mind. I think that it is axiomatic that the Government is not satisfied with its Coloured policy. This is attested to by the appointment of the Erika Theron Commission, which is charged with undertaking a searching investigation into all the facets of the Coloureds and their position in South Africa. Is the Coloured an Afrikaner, as Mr. Chris Barnard, the Hertzog prizewinner, maintains&#x2014;and the standpoint of the hon. member for Moorreesburg is not very far from that&#x2014;or are they Brown Afrikaners, as Dawie of <i>Die Burger</i> would have it; or are the Coloureds one of the peoples in South Africa comprising the South African nation, as the United Party maintains&#x003F; In other words, are they also citizens of the Republic of South Africa&#x003F; But as for the Government&#x2019;s present policy of parallel development with a twin parliament, is it going to lead to permanent supremacy, under which the Coloured Parliament will always remain subordinate to the White Parliament, or is a Coloured homeland being envisaged for these people, as I have just said&#x003F; Sir, I want to suggest that the Erika Theron Commission could perhaps become as much of a milestone on the road of the Coloureds as the Carnegie Commission in the &#x2019;twenties was for the White population of South Africa. It will be remembered that in the late &#x2019;twenties, from 1924 to 1933, a Nationalist Party Government was in power. It will also be remembered that in those years that Government, just like the present Nationalist Party Government, made something of a mess of our economy. We all remember the d&#x00E9;b&#x00E2;cle of the gold standard. At that time the Nationalist Party Government was unable to implement various recommendations of the Carnegie Report. It was the United Party Government which had to solve the poor-White problem. I wonder whether history is going to repeat itself. Will it be a United Party Government which will have to implement the various recommendations of the Erika Theron Commission so as to lead the Coloureds to greater heights in the socioeconomic as well as the political sphere&#x003F;</p>

<p>You only have to listen; if you do, you will become a little wiser. One does not want to anticipate the recommendations of the Erika Theron Commission, but I am convinced that there will be two aspects on which special emphasis will be laid. The first is education and, in particular, technical training for the Coloureds. The second is the combating of the abuse of liquor.</p>

<p>From the Economic Development Programme for the period 1972-&#x2019;77 it is clear that the envisaged growth rate could be speeded up from 5,5% to 5,75% per annum, because we are now able to supplement the shortage of White skilled manpower from the ranks of the non-Whites. We already find that it was stressed in the Budget speech that pre-1973-05-30 and in-service industrial training for the Bantu in the White areas would be allowed and encouraged by the Government. It was also announced that facilities for this propose would be made available. We cannot allow the training of Coloureds up to the skilled level to lag behind. In South Africa we have an acute shortage of mechanics and trained artisans in the building industry and in industry in general, but&#x2014;and this is the rub &#x2014;some of our White workers&#x2019; unions are still not prepared to train Coloureds as apprentices. This attitude of unwillingness on the part of the workers&#x2019; unions does of course stem directly from the Nationalist Party Government&#x2019;s policy of racial discrimination in the field of labour as is apparent from legislation aimed at job reservation and the Physical Planning Act.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport, however, has achieved great success in his <span class="col_7941-7942" refersTo="page_1038"/>negotiations with these workers&#x2019; unions, and today the Railways Administration employs more than 10 000 non-Whites, who, as skilled artisans, are doing jobs previously done by Whites. I know that the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations will tell me that these matters which I am raising now are not within his province but within that of the hon. the Minister of Labour. However, the hon. the Minister must use his influence with the hon. the Minister of Labour in order to prevail on him to negotiate with these workers&#x2019; unions. He must prevail on them to extend a helping hand and undertake the training of these Coloureds.</p>

<p>There is an extensive shortage of trained manpower, and the greater the number of trained, skilled artisans active in the economy of South Africa, the faster our economy will be able to grow. When South Africa flourishes, the Whites flourish and so do all the non-White groups. When this happens, peace and calm can prevail in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Nationalist Party slogan of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; has caused us to be described as the &#x201C;skunk of the world&#x201D;. If the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s economic slogan of &#x201C;poor but White&#x201D; is applied, we can write &#x201C;Ichabod&#x201D; across the White civilization of this country. When will the average Nat begin to realize that only when we have progress in South Africa in the industrial sphere will South Africa be able to occupy a strong position, not only in its relations in regard to its fellow-countrymen in South Africa, but also in relation to countries abroad. Only then shall we be able to uplift all peoples in South Africa. Economic growth is directly proportionate to the artisans, the trained manpower, available in South Africa. Because there has been a shortage of manpower, the growth rate aimed at in South Africa was, until recently, only 5,5 % per annum.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In 1972 the hon. member for Walmer asked the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, this hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, whether training facilities were available in South Africa for the Coloureds to be trained as welders, electricians, carpenters, motor mechanics and blasters. The reply was that there were facilities and that at that stage 33 Coloureds were being trained as welders, 105 as electricians, 1 023 as carpenters and 104 as motor mechanics. Perhaps the Coloured Development Corporation could give more attention to the establishment of Coloured businesses such as garages, electric appliance repair shops and other light industries for the extensive training of these people.

Only last year the hon. member for Wynberg stood up in this House and said that the Coloured Persons Representative Council was nothing but a rubber stamp.</p>

<p>Now hon. members on the other side of the House want to come here and establish two of these councils which are supposedly rubber stamps. The hon. member went even further than that. He was prepared to establish a Coloured Council for the South and a Coloured Council for the North. Let them tell us now whether they also intend to establish a Coloured Council for Natal. Do they intend to establish a Coloured Council for South-West Africa&#x003F; We want to build up a Coloured identity here in South Africa.

<p>I am not arguing about a people or a nation now. Is it not the intention of the United Party to sow dissension between the Coloureds of the North and the Coloureds of the South in this way&#x003F; How are those two Coloured Councils going to operate&#x003F; There must be continuous consultation with this White Parliament. Are these two Councils now to liaise with this Parliament&#x003F; This is something which is ill-considered in every respect. I find it very strange, however, that last year the Coloured Persons Representative Council was a rubber stamp according to the United Party. At the beginning of this session, in the course of the no-confidence debate, the United Party had the opportunity to announce this new policy, but they did not say a word about it. Now, however, at the end of this session, the United Party comes along with its new policy. This new policy of theirs is nothing but a means by which they want to deceive the Coloureds. It is all a bluff.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that under these circumstances, in the late hours of this debate, the United Party has come to the fore with this new policy of theirs. I should like to know since when it has been the task of the hon. member for Newton Park to announce the new policy of the United Party. Where is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x003F; Is it not his task to announce the new policy of the United Party&#x003F; Where is the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who was the main speaker for the United Party on this Vote last year. Does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout agree with this new policy of the United Party&#x003F; Does the hon. member for Wynberg agree with this new policy of the United Party&#x003F; Is this a resolution passed by the caucus of the United Party&#x003F; Is this new policy of the United Party a unanimous resolution passed by their caucus&#x003F; But now they are going further and want these two councils, the one for the South and the other for the North. In the same vein, however, they want six representatives in this Parliament as well. They want those two councils plus representatives for the Coloureds in this House as well.</p>

<p>Now I come to another point. Yesterday the hon. member for Simonstown said here by way of interjection that when they should come into power the Group Areas Act would not be repealed, but amended. I should like to know from hon. members opposite in what respect the Group Areas Act will be changed. I shall tell them why I ask this. It is the Group Areas Act which actually forms the basis of the future development of the Coloureds here in South Africa. If it were not for the Group Areas Act there would never have been this development in the socio-economic sphere, in the sphere of education or in any of the other spheres for which pleas have been made here and on the other side.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down, talks of policies. I want to talk of facts because the Coloured people are a little tired of hearing of policies and politics from members on the other side. I believe the time has come that unless we deal with some of the facts, as I have said before, none of the policies that we offer will be accepted anyway.</p>

<p>I am pleased to have this second opportunity to take part in this debate because I saw a glimmer of sympathy in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech yesterday with regard to the difficulties experienced by the Coloured people. On this occasion I would like to confine myself to the plight of the Coloured people in the Wentworth area of Durban because what happens in the Wentworth area is merely an echo of what is happening in most of the Coloured townships all over South Africa. Today there was a report in a Durban newspaper on the Wentworth area, but the hon. the Minister obviously has not had time to see it yet. Let me say to him that this report substantiates everything I have said in this House over the last two or three years in connection with this particular area. The report talks of gang warfare that has erupted in the ghetto of Wentworth in Durante Road, which I have mentioned in this House in the past. It talks too of the terror of the people in Wentworth and of the lack of facilities there. All I can say is that the things that are stated in this report are things which I have seen myself on more than one occasion. Despite the fact that a commission has been appointed, I would like to invite the hon. the Minister in his capacity as Minister, to come with me to Wentworth and the surrounding areas at the first opportunity. I want to say that this report deals with the suicides which I have mentioned to the helpless and frustrated people; it deals with the hatred, particularly among the young people, in this Coloured community and, what is probably very alarming, it makes it quite clear that the young people in the Coloured community have lost all patience with White people of all political persuasions. They no longer believe anything they are told. No doubt the hon. the Minister has looked at this area&#x2014;I believe he has visited it in the past&#x2014;but I want to assure him that it has not improved one iota since he was there. I would like to plead with him to come with me to Wentworth once again. Let me just give an example of the sort of thing that happens. During the recess I was instrumental in helping to form a Coloured Self-Help Community Society, because I felt, as they themselves felt, that they could not lay all the blame for their problems on other people, but that they must help themselves. One of the first tasks that was to be tackled, was the construction of swings in the parks for children to play on. We had all possible assistance from the department, and I certainly do not blame the department and the officials of the department in Durban for anything in this respect. The Coloureds themselves made the swings. We intended to have 12 of these swings erected by Christmas for the children. But, Mr. Chairman, you would have been surprised at the difficulties we experienced in trying to have these swings put up in the Coloured area of Wentworth. People said that the parks did not belong to the Coloureds and that we therefore had to have special permission. Only after tremendous difficulties did we manage to put up a few swings in an area in which, quite frankly, I would be a little nervous to have my children play, because of the <span class="col_7947-7948" refersTo="page_1041"/>topography. This is an example of what happens when the Coloureds try to help themselves. I know of another instance, about which I believe the Minister should know, of a Coloured man who cleared some bush in a Coloured area so that he could coach children at soccer. He was seen clearing this bush, and he was approached by an official of the Durban Corporation, who threatened to prosecute him for damaging bush on Corporation land. Now, how in heaven&#x2019;s name we are going to obtain the goodwill of the Coloured community I mentioned yesterday if we behave in this manner, I do not know.</p>

<p>I would also draw to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention another matter. I know this is a difficulty he has, but all I can ask him, as I asked him yesterday, is to please use his own good offices to see that something is done about the question of shopping centres at Wentworth. They still exist in old garages which were built during the war. They leak, and since the Coloureds moved into this area no shops, community centre, churches or playing-fields of any worth have been built. I know that the CDC itself was anxious to start a project in this area, but every time private Coloured people wanted to start something in this area, they were blocked by the Department of Community Development. The Department of Community Development has said that plans have been drawn up to build a shopping centre. It said it was going to do this, that and the other, but the years go by and nothing is done at all. So those people who are trying to see to the upliftment of the Coloured people are frustrated. Not only are the Coloureds themselves frustrated and becoming bitter, but White people and White organizations, for example the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department itself, have become frustrated at having to try to get past the door of the Department of Community Development. Sir, while I do not blame the hon. the Minister for these things, I should like to see him insist, for instance, that the local authority does not move Coloureds out of houses for the sake of building freeways, and what have you, and then put them into temporary transit camps, telling them that they will be there for a few months until alternative accommodation is found. They find that they have to stay in these transit camps for years. I would like to add to what the hon. the Minister said yesterday, namely that development of this sort must not take place at the expense of a person who lives in a home, no matter how humble it is. The housing position is critical enough. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to emphasize again that no reads and no fancy projects by city engineers with grandoise schemes would be allowed to proceed at the expense of anybody&#x2019;s home, even if it is a tin shack. Finally, I repeat that I hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to pay a visit with me to the Wentworth area during the recess, and the sooner, the better.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that the hon. the Minister will reply in his capable manner to the problems concerning Natal as raised by the hon. member for Port Natal. I shall therefore leave him at that.</p>

<p>In my speech last night I quoted from a speech which was made last year by the hon. member for Maitland in the course of the discussion of this Vote. I should very much like to quote another passage from what he said on 30th May last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but they do not have the courage to tell the public that some time or other they will again have to steal the United Party&#x2019;s policy. Sir, the time will come when hon. members on that side will see that I am right. They want us to vacate our policy so that they can move in.</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Chairman, I am not sure who stole from whom, nor am I quite sure what the policy of the United Party is, but I should not think that we are very keen to move in there. The Scriptures say: &#x201C;How pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.&#x201D; Unfortunately, Sir, they now have in their ranks a sister, the sister from Wynberg, and it seems to me as if these things are not working out so well for them.</p>

<p>In the Greater Western Cape the Coloureds have through the years made a very important contribution in the agricultural industry. I want to make the statement that the Coloureds are indissolubly bound up with the agricultural industry in the Greater Western Cape. I believe, too, that some of our finest relationships between White and Brown may be found on our farms. It is with gratitude that one is able to mention the mutual interest prevailing betwees Whites and non-Whites on our farms, and that one is able to mention what is being done for our Coloureds on our farms.</p>

<p><span class="col_7949-7950" refersTo="page_1042"/>Now, it is true, Sir, that as far back as 1964 the demand for Coloured labour far exceeded the supply. Since then the position has deteriorated even further. One of the most important reasons for this is the tremendous industrial development which has speeded up the rate of urbanization. We all know that this is a world-wide phenomenon. A very heavy responsibility therefore rests on the farmers to accept this challenge to keep their Coloured labour on their farms. Now we can say this afternoon that they have already initiated very extensive efforts in this regard. If we consider remuneration, for example, we can say that the farmers have already made numerous attempts in this regard to pay our Coloured labourers a living wage. It is a pity that articles appear in our newspapers from time to time which wrest these matters from their context and only emphasize the aspect of hard cash, without taking note of the other benefits enjoyed by the Coloureds on the farms. Sir, special attention will also have to be given to housing on our farms. We were grateful to learn from the Minister of Agriculture that a committee had been appointed and was already attending to this matter.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I should like to emphasize this afternoon, and this is in connection with education facilities for the child of the Coloured farm labourer. It is accepted everywhere that scholastic training is the basic right of every child. Now, we realize that the administration has to contend with financial problems and that the necessary funds for meeting all the needs are not always available. I want to express my thanks this afternoon for what has already been done in the sphere of education. This has led to schools being virtually within the reach of every child, but I do want to put a question to the hon. the Minister in this regard. Would it not be possible for a more attractive scheme to be introduced, a scheme which would make it a more attractive proposition for farmers to build schools on their farms out of their own funds&#x003F; For example, here I have in mind that the rent allowances paid could be substantially increased. I am aware of the fact that there are many farmers here in the Western Cape who would build those schools. I believe that we should make it a paying proposition for them. The funds which they invest in these schools, must provide them with such dividends or interest as they could also earn by investing that money in other spheres.</p>

<p>I believe that there is another important factor which should be taken into account in our attempt to keep the Coloureds on our farms. This is that agricultural training could also be provided for the Coloured worker. Here one should mention the great work done at the Kromme Rhee Training Centre, of which mention is made in the annual report of the department. We note that in 1966 there were 146 enrolments. By 1971 this number had risen to 337. I believe that we could turn our Coloured labourer on the farm into a much more productive worker if we were to provide him with this agricultural training. It would mean that the farmer would need fewer people on his farm, because the workers in his service would then be more productive. We are grateful to hear that there is a possibility that the Kromme Rhee Training Centre will be developed into an agricultural training institution. However, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether there is any possibility of more training centres being established here in the Greater Western Cape. If there is such a possibility, I should like to ask specifically for such a training centre for the Southern Cape, and it will probably not be taken amiss of me if I ask this specifically for Oudtshoorn and its surrounding areas. I believe that on our farms today we have many farmers, people with degrees in agriculture, who would be willing to serve as part-time lecturers in such training centres. I really believe that our Coloured workers would attend these training centres, that our farmers would support them, and that is this way we would be able to present a new image, a better image, in regard to the Coloured worker on our farms. If we were to give attention to this matter, and if my request could be implemented in practice. I foresee that we shall be able to meet the existing shortages within a short time. From the report of the Boland Agricultural Union dated 2nd March, 1972, we note that in 1969 a total of more than 28 000 additional regular male Coloured workers were required. According to a survey by the University of Stellenbosch this position will deteriorate further when provision is made in towns and cities for larger housing schemes for our Coloureds. I feel that here we are faced with a challenge, a challenge which we can accept, and I believe that we all agree in this regard. If we can make the necessary provision as far as these matters are concerned, we shall be able to keep the Coloured workers on our farms.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Oudtshoom lodged a plea to the effect that more assistance should be given by the department, in the first place, for the establishment of farm schools. I think that question of farm schools is dear to the hearts of most of us, but I want to point out to the hon. member that in modem times this is no longer a duty that we can simply saddle the farmers with. Such a farm school makes provision for between 30 and 50 Coloured children, and the farmer is responsible for a large portion of them, even though he can, in fact, obtain assistance from the State, but the majority of those children eventually enter the service of other industries. They become professional people and frequently they never return to the farm again.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to help the hon. member, but I want to go a step further. I want to say that this responsibility should not, firstly, be placed solely on the shoulders of the farmer; it must also be placed on the shoulders of the community, of the State, so that they can help in this respect. There I consequently disagree with the hon. member. I cannot see how we can expect the farmers to establish farm schools and provide the necessary facilities, even though they receive a subsidy from the State for that purpose. I believe that under modern circumstances the establishment of these schools ought to be the responsibility of the department itself. As long as the farmer is prepared to make the necessary land available, I think he is doing enough. Sir, where schools are established elsewhere today, they are the responsibility of the State, the responsibility of the community. Why, in this case, do we want to place the responsibility on the shoulders of the South African farmers&#x003F; If we place this responsibility on their shoulders, we shall not succeed in making more education available to the Coloured children. Therefore I would rather see bigger and quicker steps being taken by the State itself in that connection.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to the hon. member for Krugersdorp. I am glad to see that he is in the Council Chamber again. For a number of years that hon. member has not been in the House of Assembly. He was not here from 1966 to 1970, and it seems to me as if, during that period, the hon. member has got slightly out of touch with politics. Previously that hon. member was very well acquainted with the policies of the political parties, and now he comes along here and asks whether it is the policy of the United Party to repeal the Group Areas Act when it comes into power. As far back as 1963 the United Party stated very clearly that there is certain legislation which it would examine, when it came to power, with a view to amendments and with a view to repeal. I want to quote to the hon. member what our policy is, as laid down as far back as 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Immediately on return to power, the party will examine and review all legislation which is discriminatory, offends the rule of law or impinges on the dignity of the individual to determine which laws should be amended or repealed.</block>

<p>In that connection certain Acts were mentioned by name, Acts like&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the pass laws, the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act and a few more.</block>

<p>There it is stated clearly, but the hon. member now comes along and asks us whether we are going to repeal that Act. The hon. member will recall what the attitude of this side of the House was in 1949 when the Group Areas Act was discussed here in the House of Assembly. We had no objection to the idea of separate residential areas being set aside for the various race groups in South Africa. The United Party&#x2019;s objection&#x2014;and today it is still a fundamental objection&#x2014;was that areas are set aside and that race groups are asked to move to those areas before decent alternative housing is established for them in those areas. Our second objection&#x2014;and this applies to the Coloureds, in particular&#x2014;was to the shifting of people from areas where they had been making a living as businessmen or entrepreneurs, or whatever the case may be. Those were our two biggest objections. If the hon. member thinks that this is not a source of irritation, I want to remind him what happened, under this Government, in Kloof Street, where there is today still a Coloured shoemaker in a White residential area. Even this Government had to let these people remain there because they have built up goodwill and are furnishing a service there. If a person resides in an area where he is making his <span class="col_7953-7954" refersTo="page_1044"/>living and where he is furnishing a service to the community, why must one deprive him of that opportunity&#x003F; That is the type of thing which the United Party objected to at the time in connection with the Group Areas Act. The hon. member asks me whether the creation of two Coloured Persons Representative Councils is now the new United Party policy. Sir, I do not know why the hon. member so vehemently objects to that, because his party wants to create 22 separate legislative assemblies for the non-Whites in South Africa. Now we are proposing that in the greater Boland and Western Cape metropolitan area such a Legislative Assembly be created for the Coloureds. We must not forget that there are more than 2 million of them and that a large portion of these Coloureds live on the other side of the Eiselen Line. There are already 100 000 or more of them in the Transvaal and a large portion in the Free State and also in Natal. Therefore, it is surely not so far-fetched to create a second Legislative Assembly for these people. On the contrary, this is to give them a greater opportunity to administer themselves and to create proper forms of self-government for them. Now the hon. member says that the United Party has always regarded this Legislative Assembly as a rubber stamp, and he asks why there is now this change of heart. But surely the hon. member is not correct. If this Government had been prepared, from the very start, to make this a properly elected body with proper powers, and had not nominated or appointed a large portion of the members, do you think there would have been any objections from the United Party&#x003F; In 1967, if my memory is not playing me false, we made certain changes here to the Coloured Persons Representative Council and we said nothing against that. On the contrary, we agreed with that because for the first time the Government was at least decreasing the number of appointed members of that council and increasing the number of elected members. The hon. member must consequently understand that we call it a rubber stamp because the majority of a considerable portion of these members were appointed. But if they had been elected members, there would have been very little objection by this party to the principle involved. The hon. member now asks whose decision this new policy is&#x003F; Is the hon. member then not acquainted with what happened, and does he not know that this was approved last year after the Leader of the Opposition appointed a constitutional committee. These principles were approved by the central executive of the party in a joint sitting with its caucus. That was the decision. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED RELATIONS AND REHOBOTH AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Today I shall concentrate solely on the more important matters which were raised. If there are any particulars in regard to which I did not furnish hon. members with replies, they must not take this amiss of me. We shall try to introduce a system this year by means of which we shall furnish them with replies to those matters which they raised here and to which they should like to have replies; we shall do this by means of the department which will consult with me in advance. Towards the end of the debate yesterday I said that I should like to reply to the hon. member for Boksburg. However, the hon. member is not here today and for the purpose of the record I should now like to give my reply. He discussed dwelling units for the Coloureds in Boksburg, and he discussed the Indian traders who are still in Boksburg and who are creating problems there. I shall in due course ensure that the hon. member receives the replies to these questions, replies which at this stage are not of interest to this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Worcester, who was the first to speak, asked for assistance on my part to promote decentralization in Worcester by means of the encouraging task which the Department of Coloured Relations has in respect of the Coloureds, and its interceding task which it can perform in respect of other departments. We are merely the intercessors, and plead on behalf of the Coloureds in such cases as these. As the hon. member knows, this is a matter which falls under the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. The hon. member also knows that the Cabinet feels that industrialists in our Boland towns and further into the Western Cape should be accommodated. Then, too, there are already certain towns which have been singled out so that we can help industrialists to proceed with the establishment of industries there if they intend making exclusive use of Coloured labour.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Zululand was concerned about the problem of the Dunn people in Natal. I know that he did mention this on a previous occasion as well. <span class="col_7955-7956" refersTo="page_1045"/>However, on that occasion I did not handle the matter and I only became acquainted with the problem in the course of this year. The actual stumbling block in their way to get title deeds to the land, is that the land forms part of the land of the Bantu Trust. I suppose the hon. member is aware of this fact. We cannot give title deeds to the Dunn people until such time as we have land available to compensate the people who are living there at this moment. It is the task of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development to acquire such land, as the hon. member will realize. I said yesterday that I do not like to pass the buck, but this is really a problem which I cannot solve by myself. This matter has been discussed at great length in the Coloured Representative Council. Last year Mr. Dunn came to see the then Minister of Coloured Relations and I was present when he put his case. We tried our best. At the beginning of this year I saw the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education and I was then told that they were experiencing a lot of difficulty in settling these squatters. The Department of Bantu Administration and Development is also doing its utmost to get the consolidation of the Bantu homeland KwaZulu finalized. The granting of title deeds to the Dunn people is dependent upon the finalization of this consolidation.</p>

<p>I am just as concerned as the hon. member. The Dunn people were promised this land, as the hon. member has pointed out, in terms of an Act of Parliament of 1935. More than 35 years have elapsed in the meantime and these people have all along been trying to get title deeds to this land but as yet they have not succeeded. I am well aware of the problems with which they are confronted. I am glad to hear that the hon. member has information that the Department of Transport is considering a compensation payment to these people as though they were the holders of the title deeds to this land across which a big national highway is to be constructed. I suppose that I could also assist in this regard by making an anneal to that department to establish whether they can contribute in some way in order to let these people feel a bit more secure.</p>

<p>The hon. member also pointed out that one of their problems is that the Coloureds must have permits in order to develop their allocated area in Richard&#x2019;s Bay. The hon. member will realize that here again it is a question for the Department of Community Development and the group areas. Did I understand that the hon. member would like to have a group area proclaimed in Richard&#x2019;s Bay&#x003F;</p>

<p>I can only promise that I shall try to alleviate the position of those people. I fully realize, as he does, that those people being there and being required for the tasks which await them there, will have to stay there for a very long time if not permanently. Something of a more permanent nature will have to be devised in order to let these people feel more secure. It is also necessary that their employers should feel secure. I feel that we should not leave the matter at that and I am prepared to start correspondence in this regard.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Mariental spoke as befits a South-West African. He referred to Namaland and Rehoboth and made certain requests in that connection. I concede that the development of Namaland could take place more rapidly. We placed 2 163 000 hectares at the disposal of those people. Of course one must also give thought to the upliftment of those people who still in reality have a long road of development ahead of them. The land was in a bad state of erosion, but fortunately great things have already been accomplished with the aid of agricultural officers, and recently, too, as a result of the organization of the four areas. Soromas. Tses, Gibeon and Berseba, which were the old reserves. As a result of this organization, and with the aid of the existing advisory councils, we are gradually making progress there. In Rehoboth there is still opposition on the part of the Basters, and I just want to mention that we are proceeding with this planning despite the opposition. We have already consented to the money which remained in the development fund which was borrowed at the time from the South-West African Administration, an amount of R141 000, being used for the development of the town of Rehoboth. As the hon. member will know, we are planning a water reticulation system at Rehoboth. We are also thinking of an electricity supply, but the problem is to obtain servitudes across land belonging to Basters. These people are very difficult to negotiate with, and they are very suspicious in this sense that they do not readily grant servitudes. The idea is that <span class="col_7957-7958" refersTo="page_1046"/>they should link up with SWAESC, the South-West African Electricity Supply Commission, and that they, too, will then eventually be able to move into the modern age. I want to say here that Rehoboth has lagged very far behind. We are concerned about this, and we will in the end simply have to use the authority of the State, in terms of the 1924 proclamation by Gen. Hertzog, to do what is essential for these people, who are being kept where they are at present by an advisory council which is obstinate. If matters continue in this way, it will eventually lead to Rehoboth becoming completely stagnant.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Transkei mentioned the question of the Coloureds in the Transkei. He expressed concern about them and I myself do not feel too easy about the Coloureds in the Transkei. There are more than 10 000 of them or perhaps there are less; I do not know. The position of the Coloured people there is handled by an interdepartmental committee and they try to persuade them to go somewhere else. However, this is a voluntary matter at the moment; these people are not forced to go. This interdepartmental committee has lately decided to appoint a liaison officer who is stationed at Umtata. This man must see to it that these people are helped in finding the right type of work. They must be assisted in choosing or deciding where they want to go. We are embarking upon a system where these people will go voluntarily. The problem of housing for these people has been solved. Last year we received R350 000 from the Cabinet with which houses are to be erected for these people. However, at the moment we consider the possibility of providing only temporary housing. This might prove to be permanently temporary&#x2014;I do not know at this stage. In any case, eventually these houses are supposed to be at the disposal of the Bantu people. These houses are in the process of being erected at the moment. As far as education is concerned. we do not have any Coloured schools in Umtata in the Transkei. There is a school at Kokstad where there were 11 matriculants in 1972. Education is provided from Std. 6 level up to matriculation level. I cannot say anything more than that because I do not know anything else about this school. If the hon. member wants to know more about it, I will let him know.</p>

<p>As far as technical education is concerned, there are amenities for them at Queenstown and at Grahamstown. There are also some supplementary classes at other places. These amenities are not in the Transkei itself but outside the Transkei. I have been informed by the department that boarding grants are available at Queenstown and at Grahamstown. A technical college exists at Durban and Port Elizabeth; so, as far as that matter is concerned, I am afraid that we cannot provide for them in the Transkei. They can at least go to these places which are able to supply them with the necessary amenities for training.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Prieska, <i>inter alia,</i> discussed political aspects which I do not want to go into at this stage. He pointed out the evils which existed in the past in regard to the Coloured vote, a fact which everyone acquainted with the history of this matter will confirm. It began as long ago as 1850 and persisted for more than a hundred years, until 1956. The hon. member also discussed training for Coloureds, particularly in a vocational direction because the Coloureds are that way inclined, in the area in which he lives as well. There are a total of 152 000 Coloureds living in the area which the hon. member represents, in the area of my constituency, in Namaqualand and also in the Kuruman and Vryburg areas. These people definitely have a claim to some or other form of vocational education. At this stage I can only say that the number who are coming forward is not yet sufficient to justify a college. However, there is sufficient need to enable us to establish a youth camp in Gordonia where young Coloureds may also be taught to adapt more successfully in the field of labour, and may even be taught certain skills. When we undertake planning in this direction again, that area will in fact be taken into careful consideration for this purpose.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Jeppes spoke about something which is not really the concern of my department, namely the provision of housing and other amenities in the Johannesburg area. Some two or more years ago I visited this area as a Deputy Minister and I saw what was going on here. I share the hon. member&#x2019;s concern. I can only say that now that the Coloured people encounter every day. This set-up needs and problems are being discussed in the Coloured Representative Council as well as here in this House. We must therefore have an ear for the troubles and trials these people encounter every day. This set-up <span class="col_7959-7960" refersTo="page_1047"/>makes for a doubly effective democratic process. I know what is going on there and I have made some representations, but so far I have not been too successful. In view of the fact that I have had many representations since then from the Coloured Representative Council, I have decided that I will visit those parts in August with the Minister of Community Development to see what can be done in a comprehensive way to improve conditions in Johannesburg and on the East Rand. In this respect I am the beggar and the borrower, but at least I do not answer these people coming to me for help that I do not have the legal right to act. The Department of Community Development is also concerned about the conditions in this area and that is why we decided to work in conjunction. The hon. member also spoke about sports facilities, and so on, but I think all these considerations are included in what I have just told the hon. member, namely that we plan to visit these parts to try to do something about it.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F; Will he give some consideration to inviting interested members of Parliament to visit these areas&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. member asked that question because I think we are all concerned with liaison and dialogue. It is also appropriate that we should consult with the members of the Coloured Representative Council who represent that area. They talk to their people, live with them and experience with them even the squalor and dirt sometimes. We can then all come together to see what can be done. This is a department where we want something done; it is not a department where we can afford to squabble all day about what happened 20 or 25 years ago.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Bellville discussed the economically active Coloureds of our country. I see the hon. member is not present at the moment. Actually he discussed the economically active Coloureds of the Western Cape. He juggled a little with figures here, and drew conclusions, etc. I do not want to dispute them, but I just want to inform him that as pessimistic as his feelings are in regard to the tremendous increase in Coloured labour and since there is now, in a period of inflation, no Coloured unemployment, I am as optimistic that we will have enough Coloured labour and enough work for the Coloureds who will be available in the Western Cape in 15 or 20 years&#x2019; time. Recently we have been making use of Bantu migrant labourers, people who do not live here permanently, but travel back and forth. The Bantu living here permanently are diminishing in numbers. In particular the number of Bantu employed by local authorities have diminished by 1 304 within a question of a few years, while the number of Coloureds increased by 15 000. As far as migrant labourers are concerned, the number of Bantu increased by 46 000 within a question of four years. When we become pessimistic about the Coloureds and their ability, and about the labour waiting for them in the Western Cape with the kind of development which is taking place here, I cannot entirely share that pessimism. When we use this pessimism and the relevant figures for the development of the economy of the Western Cape and the growth points there, I am agreed on that score. That is in order. We must create work opportunities for our people, but when we want to use Coloured labour as the only pillar in the establishment of a fourth Iscor at Saldanha, we are constructing a pillar which will crumble away completely beneath us. We cannot be certain that Coloured labour will initially be the labour which we will be able to rely on exclusively in that sphere. We will require Bantu labour for the heavy industries. This does not mean that I do not regard this very sympathetically, because I do in fact regard it sympathetically. I should like us to create expansion possibilities for these people in the Cape Flats, at Mamre and at Saldanha where, as I understand, a shipyard costing approximately R35 million is to be constructed. We are therefore expecting great developments in future. However, we have other problems, and the Cabinet will eventually decide where this so-called fourth Iscor will be established, and where the manufacture of steel will be undertaken. I do not in any way want to speculate further about this now. It is a decision for the Cabinet and I think that a little less speculation, both outside as well as inside this House and in the newspapers, would be welcome at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central raised a very interesting matter here. <i>Inter alia,</i> he discussed the Commission of Inquiry into Coloured Affairs. I do not know whether he wanted to anticipate the commission, but I just want to inform him <span class="col_7961-7962" refersTo="page_1048"/>that the commission has very clear terms of reference. These are in fact to investigate the socio-economic and educational problems and development of the Coloureds over the period of 12 years from the time when Dr. Verwoerd supposedly made certain promises; to determine the present position, to examine the bottlenecks, and then to come forward with advice. This does not only cover political policy, but we are also thinking in terms of political factors; and why not&#x003F; Politically we have moved away from the old Coloured Persons Advisory Council which the United Party Government of the time appointed on 1st January, 1944. Please note: They appointed it; they did not allow it to be elected. This is what happens in regard to all developing bodies: They are first appointed, subsequently a minority is elected, after which a majority and finally all of them are elected. That is what we are engaged in at present. This is the way the development took place. It would therefore be wrong to omit the term &#x201C;political&#x201D;. I am not anticipating the report of the commission. I have every confidence in these people, and I think they will do a thorough job of work.</p>

<p>But the hon. member raised another point. He spoke of employment opportunities, and referred specifically to the training of our Coloureds as artisans, etc. Now, I just want to issue a statement arising out of a resolution recently adopted by the Cabinet after we had discussed the problem to which the hon. member referred, viz. that there are White trade unions that want to keep the Coloureds out of certain industries, for example the motor industry. This is a problem to us. We must have the courage of our convictions. These people are driving around in thousands of cars, and who must repair those cars&#x003F; The Government then adopted the following resolution:</p>

<ol>

<li>1. To afford Coloureds under 31 years of age, for whom it is for some reason or other not possible to register as apprentices, the opportunity to qualify as artisans, the Government has consented to placing at the disposal of the Executive of the Coloured Persons Representative Council the means to establish a centre where such persons may be trained as artisans.</li>

<li>2. The establishment, administration and control of the centre will be entrusted to the Administration of Coloured Affairs. The centre shall therefore be under the administration of their own people. I could just mention in passing that it will cost a few hundred thousand rand.</li>

<li>3. It is being envisaged to construct this training centre in the Cape Peninsula, and steps are being taken to establish the necessary facilities so that training may commence in January, 1974, or as soon as possible after that date.</li>

<li>4. Initially only a course in motor mechanics will be offered, but if it should appear to be necessary, the facilities will be expanded to make provision for the training of artisans in other technical fields.</li>

<li>5. To ensure that the standard of training at the centre compares with that of other training systems the requirements set for apprentices in regard to theoretical and practical training will be strictly adhered to. The duration of the course, both practical as well as theoretical, will be three years and will lead to the acquisition of a National Technical Certificate II and/or III. Upon completion of the course the trainees will undergo a trade test, as applicable to apprentices in the motor industry, after which the Department of Labour will assist in placing successful trainees in suitable positions.</li>

<li>6. Provision will initially be made at the training centre for the admission and training of 40 selected trainees per annum. The admission requirements will be a Std. 8 certificate, as prescribed for apprentices in the motor industry, and the trainees will have to be between 17 and 21 years of age. Trainees will also be expected to furnish a written undertaking that they will, for a period of at least two years from the date of completion of their training, work in the Republic at the trade for which they have been trained. If they should, for unacceptable reasons, fail to comply with this undertaking, the costs of training will be recovered.</li>

<li>7. Board and lodging amenities for the trainees are not being envisaged at this stage. Selected candidates will consequently have to make their own arrangements for board and lodging.</li>

<li>8. It is being envisaged to pay trainees an allowance of R16 per week for the duration of their training. In addition to this trainees will be issued with two overalls free of charge for every year of their training, and after the successful completion of the course, the trainees will be provided with a set of tools.</li>

<li><span class="col_7963-7964" refersTo="page_1049"/>9. This training scheme does not replace the present apprenticeship system of training, but is additional thereto.</li>

<li>10. The introduction of this training scheme is a contribution on the part of the authorities to cope with the present critical shortage of trained artisans in the motor industry, as well as similar shortages which may occur in other industries. The wholehearted co-operation of those concerned in this matter, and more specifically the industry itself&#x2014;and I may as well include the Opposition here as well&#x2014;is being relied on to make a success of this scheme. Consequently an appeal is being made to all interested persons and bodies to lend their support.</li>

<li>11. In this connection the employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions concerned, as well as the National Apprenticeship Board, will be consulted.</li>

</ol>

<p>It is no more than right that one should do this. Hon. members should regard this statement in its correct perspective.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, then he is an artisan. If he does not pass that test, he is afforded a further opportunity to do his trade test six months later. The Department of Labour is in charge of this matter; they place such a person in employment. Hon. members must not ask me any further questions about this matter now. We shall explain the rest to hon. members. I tried to be very complete.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Krugersdorp made a very fine contribution. He exposed the United Party as far as the deficiencies in their policy are concerned.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Port Natal was worried about the poverty, the squalor and the social conditions in Wentworth, and also about the fact that gang warfare was taking place. I can tell him that I promised the C.R.C. members&#x2014;those of them who did not think too highly of themselves to attend meetings of the liaison committee&#x2014; that I would visit Durban in the second half of the year. I see that the hon. member is not here at the moment.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, will you give him the message&#x003F; I can give the hon. member the same assurance that I gave the hon. member for Jeppes. I want to say that the hon. member must not forget about the C.R.C. members who represent those parts. They must be in on it. I may consider inviting all of them, when I visit those parts, to see what is going on there. As I have <span class="col_7965-7966" refersTo="page_1050"/>said, I intend visiting Durban during the second half of the year.</p>

<p>Sir, although I quite often disagree with the hon. member, especially as far as bilingualism is concerned, I am very glad that he is so concerned about this polarization between White and Black and White and Coloured and so on, but I think there is something else he must realize. There is also a polarization, in the case of some people, against law and order, and we must be sure that we are on the side of law and order. That is very important. The other matters the hon. member raised, I think we can clear up at a later stage when I visit Durban. I have not yet managed to fix a date for my visit to Durban; I do not know when I shall be able to go there, but I think it will be some time during the second half of the year. They say the weather is very good in Durban at that time.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Oudtshoorn discussed Kromme Rhee. I am grateful for his fine words about that institution, where 2 128 persons are already receiving training in the short term to make better farm labourers of them. Some of them have even become more competent than the farmer himself to look after his tractors.</p>

<p>He presented a plea for farmers who-establish their own schools, and asked us to pay them interest. Sir, this is already being done, and there are constant negotiations to see whether that interest cannot be increased.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park then raised a few further arguments of a more political nature here. I think that I said what I wanted to say about the matter of the Coloureds yesterday, and I am not going to tire hon. members with that matter any further now. I do not think the hon. member&#x2019;s argument was convincing enough to justify a reply to it. I just want to refer again to this matter of an elected body for people who are still developing. It is a matter which has to develop gradually. You cannot simply allow people to elect their own representatives if for example, they have a primitive election system, for then one finds the position which one has in Rehoboth today. There the advisory council, which exercises tremendous power today, is elected as follows: the voter has to enter on horse back and declare before everyone for whom he is voting. This is of course a kind of democracy as well. Another problem is that one does not always get the right people if one has only elected members. It is therefore a question of gradually moving forward. Sir, I explained to hon. members why we are following an ever-rising line of development along with these people, and that we have already reached the stage where these people hold discussions with us and where they are not merely addressed, and that is one of the reasons why the commission, to which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central referred, was appointed. The hon. member was not quite certain why the commission was appointed. He arrived at the conclusion that the commission had been appointed because the National Party did not have a policy. I want to inform the hon. member that during the past three to four years there has been a tremendous amount of discussion of the Coloureds by various people, but a tremendous percentage of these people who have a great deal to say about the Coloureds, do not know them at all. A tremendous percentage who have a great deal to say about the Coloureds, have not lived with them, do not know them in their heart of hearts, and do not know what they are capable of. A tremendous percentage of people who talk about the Coloureds do not know what the State is doing and what its officials are doing in their inspired approach to help the Coloureds and to really educate them to the stage where they may accept full responsibility. We felt that the time had arrived to appoint a commission, consisting of private persons, for whom everyone would have respect, to establish the facts. We are willing to submit ourselves to the factual report which that commission will eventually publish. Of course no Government can commit itself in advance to accepting the recommendations of any commission. Not even the United Party Government did so in the case of the 1937 commission. But the motive with the appointment of this commission, consisting of unprejudiced people, who are recognized by both Whites and Coloureds as being competent individuals, was to determine the actual position, and the commission may then come forward with facts for all to take cognizance of, so that it will not be said that the Government is simply making propaganda, and then we can on that basis decide whether, during these 12 years, we have been doing our duty in so far as it was within our means, or whether we were not doing our <span class="col_7967-7968" refersTo="page_1051"/>duty, and then we can discuss the matter again; and in that process we are working in the closest collaboration with the Coloureds. Sir, that is the principal idea with the commission, and the sooner hon. members on that side understand this and the fewer derogatory remarks are made about this commission here or outside, the better it will be for us, for some of these Coloured leaders, who want nothing to do with dialogue or co-operation, sometimes derive considerable courage from what opposition speakers as Whites say to Whites on this side. In this connection I want to warn hon. members, and not only hon. members in this House but anyone who makes irresponsible statements. I find that even when I sometimes say certain things in an effort to educate my own people, it is twisted against me, and then I have to explain what I meant. That just goes to show how important it is that we should act in a very responsible way when discussing these matters.</p>

<p>Sir, all that now remains for me to do is to thank the hon. members who participated in this debate. I think that this debate was conducted on a very good level. We undoubtedly had a few relapses here and there, but in life one expects relapses and one expects ups and downs. I want to thank all hon. members for the spirit in which this debate was conducted, and also for the contributions with which they supported me. Then, too, I want to thank the officials who were present here and who supported me at times, officials such as Mr. Bosnian, the Secretary for Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs, who has already come a long way with the department and who is always there and always has been there to help us; I should also like to mention the name of Mr. Gaum of the administration of Coloured Affairs, who for the past 3&#x00BD; years has been walking a difficult road with Coloured Affairs. I also thank the other hon. gentlemen who were present here. Perhaps I should mention them all by name, but I do not think that would be the correct thing to do. I want to say thank you very much to them as well. With these few words, Sir, I want to express the hope that as far as Coloured politics are concerned we, in this Parliament, will always play an augmentative and constructive role, and will never be destructive, and that we will never try to steal a political march on one another.</p>

<p>Votes agreed to.</p>

<p>Revenue Vote No. 45.&#x2014;&#x201C;Indian Affairs&#x201D;:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have the pleasant duty this afternoon&#x2014; the first occasion on which this Vote is discussed under the new Minister&#x2014;to congratulate the hon. the Minister on assuming office as Minister of Indian Affairs. I would like to wish him every success in his administration of his portfolio in&#x2014;if I may add&#x2014;the short time that remains before the next election.</p>

<p>Sir, I think this Committee hopes to get &#x2014;and indeed is entitled to expect&#x2014;formation of the philosophy which motivation to an indication of the spheres with him as Minister of Indian Affairs, in addition to an indication of the spheres with which he will deal in the course of administering this portfolio. In other words, we would very much like to get an indication from him of the spirit which guides him, in addition to what one might call the nuts and bolts of the administration of his department. I feel that this is particularly important because for the last three years we have attempted to obtain from his predecessor an indication of the Government&#x2019;s and the Minister&#x2019;s philosophy in this regard, but I am afraid we failed completely. With a new broom I hope that we will now get a better indication in this field. In particular I would ask the hon. the Minister to deal with the manner in which the Indian people as a group fit into the Government&#x2019;s philosophy of separate development, because the Government ties the various non-White groups to the philosophy of separate development by virtue of their attachment to a homeland, a geographical area; and we have had it said, certainly in respect of the Bantu&#x2014;this is basic to the thinking&#x2014;that the idea of accepting identifiable separate communities as part of a unitary or a federal state, not necessarily linked to geographical areas, is the basis of the United Party&#x2019;s thinking, and we have also had it said over and over again, as it was said again this afternoon by the hon. member for Krugersdorp, that the United Party&#x2019;s point of view is an untenable proposition; that you must have either separation or separate development or you must have integration and that there is no road in between. If the Minister should require something more authoritative than this statement by the hon. member for Krugersdorp, I would like to read to him what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Affairs said in 1970 in this regard, <span class="col_7969-7970" refersTo="page_1052"/>because it sums up the Government&#x2019;s thinking, and in the light of that I would like the hon. the Minister later on to tell us how the Indian community fits into this thinking. He said (col. 3509 of Hansard)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The National Party&#x2019;s policy is based on principles and not on such opportunism as we have to hear and read as coming from that side of the House. The consequences of the broad policy are many, but I merely want to mention a few which are relevant in this regard. I refer to labour as seen against the background of our policy of multi-national development, where every ethnic group is on a course leading to a separate destination of independence. The first consequence which I want to mention to the hon. member, is that, on the basis of the reality of multi-nationalism, the White people and every Bantu people have to go through a separate development connected with their own homeland and their own people. By those means it should be possible for every people, in its human interests and rights, to realize itself fully within the framework of its own context and within its own ranks. This must be done without the people concerned being dominated by any other people, as was also said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, or threatened by any other people. Here we have the major gulf between the approach of the Opposition and the approach of the National Party.</block>

<p>Here he puts it perfectly clear that the United Party in his view is a party based on &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; because our policy does not create a separate homeland for the various Bantu people to which independence can be given quite separate from the White community. Now, as I understand it, Sir, there has never been any suggestion from the Government ranks that there will be a separate homeland for the Indian community, and in the absence of that homeland I should be very interested indeed to hear how this community fits into the philosophy of separate development and how it can be put on a basis of something other than domination when no provision whatever is either made or is intended at any time in the future for any representation of any kind, according to the words of the late Dr. Verwoerd, at the centre for the Indian community. The other point I should like to deal with in the few minutes left to me is the question of the Indian Council. This is another aspect in respect of which we were able to get absolutely nothing from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor. His attitude was summed up in these words, which I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am prepared to go to the Indian Council and discuss it with them and the <i>fait accompli</i> will be promulgated in this House.</block>

<p>That was his attitude over and over again. He was not prepared to discuss the issue with this side of the house or with the Government side of the House or, indeed, with Parliament. Apparently a discussion with the Council for Indian Affairs was all that he was concerned with. Well, we are interested in Parliament and I am sure the hon. the Minister as well is interested in Parliament, and Parliament as a whole, and not only the Opposition, is entitled to the benefit of the Minister&#x2019;s views in regard to the manner in which he proposes to develop the Indian Council, more particularly as, until quite recently, it was not realized, due to the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor&#x2019;s reticence, that the limit of five elected members&#x2014;and this is borne out by the Minister&#x2019;s own departmental report&#x2014;applied only to the first council, as it were, the council which is about to be brought into being when once the rolls and the voting procedure is settled, and that thereafter there is no limit, as I understand it, to the number of elected members who can be put into this council. We would like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s thinking in that regard is, the manner in which this will develop, the procedure which will be adopted in respect of electoral machinery, the progress which has been made in that regard and the extent and the manner in which the elected element in this council will be provided for as time unfolds. One further thing is this.</p>

<p>Last year I, on behalf of the United Party, gave a fairly detailed exposition of the type of powers and executive functions which we would give to an Indian Council were we in office. The hon. the Minister will find this in col. 6537 of Hansard of the 5th May, which was when this Vote took place last year. I did that in the hope of inducing the then Minister to give us the benefit of his views as to what sort of executive powers he was thinking of for the Indian Council when it should <span class="col_7971-7972" refersTo="page_1053"/>become an elected or a partly elected body. We never received any indication of what was in the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s mind and I should be glad if the hon. the Minister could tell us what he sees as a likely evolution of that council, both in regard to its make-up and the powers which it will receive.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we passed a Bill giving the Minister a greater say in the movement of the Indian people between the provinces. The Minister is given a discretionary jurisdiction and I should be glad if he could give us some indication of the manner in which he will exercise that jurisdiction on the movement of Indians between the provinces.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Zululand put specific questions to the hon. the Minister in regard to his policy, which of course is also the policy of the Government. I believe that the hon. the Minister would like to reply to those questions himself. I could also have supplied the hon. member with replies to those questions, but since he put the questions to the hon. the Minister, I shall instead deal with other aspects in the course of my speech.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his speech the hon. member congratulated the hon. the Minister on his appointment as Minister of Indian Affairs. On behalf of this side of the House I should like to associate myself with that statement and wish the hon. member success in his handling of the activities of this department in future. We hope that he will be at the head of this department for many years. I also want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his unanimous election to the post of chancellor of the University of Durban-Westville. We know that the hon. Minister has a wide background in handling tertiary education affairs and we believe that he will handle this post as well with great distinction.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister was elected as chancellor in the place of Prof. A. J. H. van der Walt who held that office for only a few months. He was chancellor from May up to the time of his death in August, 1972. I should also like to pay tribute to the memory of Prof Van der Walt for the work he did. From 1961 to 1971 he was chairman of the university council and he really had the interests of that university at heart. Fitting tribute has also been paid to the memory of Prof. Van der Walt by the chairman of the Indian Council, Mr. A. M. Rajab, and to the pioneer work he did by taking the lead and helping in the founding and establishment of this particular university. Mr. Rajab paid tribute in the following appreciative words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This campus will be an inspiring monument to his memory, because his vision and care for us at the University of Durban-Westville will never be forgotten.</block>

<p>As a former student of Prof. Van der Walt I want to associate myself with that tribute. He did a great deal for tertiary education in general and for Indian education in particular.</p>

<p>Since I have now made mention of the University of Durban-Westville, I want to refer to the official inauguration of this university earlier this month. The construction of this university cost R15 million and it is one of the most modern in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister spoke on that occasion. I am very sorry to say that there were elements who wanted to suck poison from that inauguration ceremony. Some English-language newspapers, for example, referred to the university as &#x201C;the Nat university&#x201D;. The students of the University of Durban-Westville apparently tried to misuse the inauguration ceremony to boycott the Prime Minister. An English-language Sunday newspaper in Natal disclosed the intentions of the students two weeks before the time. The headline in this particular newspaper read <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Protest Time for Indian University&#x2019;s Opening Day. Students plan Vorster Boycott.</block>

<p>The article read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Students at the Indian University of Durban-Westville plan to boycott the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, at the official opening next month.</block>

<p>After the opening, which was an outstanding success, English-language newspapers again gave headlines to students who had not, however, succeeded in their attempts. This time the students and many others, too, were disappointed. The headlines read <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Varsity Opening a Fraud; Ceremony was a Fraud, say Students.</block>

<p><span class="col_7973-7974" refersTo="page_1054"/>The attitude taken by the students was apparently due to influence by elements outside the student community who would have liked to get at the rector, but more particularly the Government. We know that the Indian community as a whole is very proud of this new university and that the whole community as such pays no heed to remarks of that sort.</p>

<p>Some time ago we heard about the fire which destroyed the Indian market in Durban. As hon. members know, that market is 100 years old and of course a great deal of damage was done, in that the livelihood of many Indians was destroyed. That Indian market was a very great tourist attraction for every visitor to Durban and Natal; they all paid a visit to the Indian market to take away some souvenir or other. The Indian market has always reminded me of the well-known Flea Market in Florence, Italy, which has acquired a great reputation. The news of the burning down of the Indian market has spread far and wide and everyone who has come to hear about it, particularly those who had paid a visit to the market on some occasion or other, felt sympathy and compassion towards the holders of the hundreds of little stalls as well as their employees who were in a flash deprived of their livelihood. The Indian community of Durban and the surrounding areas, as well as people from other communities, clubbed together after this disastrous event to offer temporary assistance to the afflicted stall holders and the dependants of the employees and also to attempt to rebuild or replace the market in one way or another. It seems that at first the Durban City Council failed shamefully in its duty and did nothing tangible. <i>The Graphic</i> of 13th April, 1973 referred as follows to the attitude of the Durban City Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is, the Indians&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; could not be blamed for thinking perhaps that under pressure of the recent tragic event, the City Council would put aside its notorious propensity for neglecting (indeed actually harming) the interests of the city&#x2019;s Indian population &#x2026; That it may be persuaded that it should not allow its long-standing campaign against the Indian market storeholders to act as if the rampaging fire was an ally, however unexpected &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then followed the accusation in regard to the absence of immediate assistance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the event, the Durban City Council gave as much help as he who refuses water to a man dying of thirst on the ground that he, well-fed and well-hydrated, has no authority to give the water.</block>

<p>Because the Durban City Council failed, or were perhaps unwilling, to offer immediate assistance, two people, Messrs. Rajab and Redi were sent to Cape Town and had interviews with the Minister of Community Development and the Minister of Indian Affairs. These two Ministers gave immediate and sympathetic attention to the Indians&#x2019; cry of distress. The Indian community as such and the victims of this disaster in particular, tremendously appreciate the rapid action taken. Consequently these striking words of appreciation appeared in an editorial in <i>The Graphic</i> of 20th April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The speed with which Senator Owen Horwood and his colleague, Mr. A. H. du Plessis, moved in the question of the Indian Market is heartwarming.</block>

<p>The Minister took the initiative and established a committee under the chairmanship of the Under-Secretary for Indian Affairs, Mr. Van Eyssen, and representatives of the Department of Community Development, the City Council of Durban and the S.A. Indian Council, to provide assistance in the first place by constructing something temporary in the meantime and in the second place, to search for a long-term solution to the problem. To the question of why the Durban City Council were inactive for such a long time and were unwilling to do anything positive, the Durban City Council itself can supply the answer. Whether they wanted to embarrass the Government, I do not know &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down dealt with the students at the university and other speakers on this side will deal with that subject. He also dealt with the Indian Market and the unhappy events there. I would like to add that I too am unhappy with what happened in regard to the re-establishment of that market, but I will deal with this later if I have the time.</p>

<p>I welcome the hon. the Minister to this department as well. I add my welcome to that of my colleague, the hon. member for <span class="col_7975-7976" refersTo="page_1055"/>Zululand. I also welcome him for another reason, I think he is probably the first Minister for some time in this department who has had some association with the Indian community and therefore he should understand them a little better than the previous Ministers. I hope that some of the comments and actions of the department will be less uninformed than they have been in the past.</p>

<p>I have always maintained that the functions of this department and particularly that of the hon. the Minister is to stand between the Indian community and the harsh and sometimes very cruel action of the Department of Community Development and the Department of Planning. I hope the hon. the Minister sees his role in the same light.</p>

<p>I would like to turn immediately to another matter which is one of very great moment to the Indian community in the city of Durban, where after all most of the Indian population of South Africa is residing. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what role he and his department is playing in the establishment of the separate local authorities for Indians in Durban within the present city council area of Durban. I know the Minister must be aware of the plan to amalgamate both the north and the south Local Affairs Committees of the Indians with full control of Indian affairs and with ultimate full autonomy. It will have its own town council and mayor. This would be the first time in South Africa that in the confines of one city we will have two town councils and two mayors. If the plan goes through Durban will of course in time have three, because one would have to add the Coloured community as well, who is in exactly the same position. We will therefore have three town councils and three mayors in the city of Durban. I know that this is possible in terms of Government legislation of 1962 with amendments to the Group Areas Act. It has already been implemented with some degree of success in Verulam and Isipingo, but I would suggest that Durban is an entirely different matter, because the Durban area is not separate like these other areas. What would happen in Durban is that we would have islands of various group areas in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>One must bear in mind that the Grey Street complex, which has been declared Indian, will be part of a separate local authority for Indians right in the heart of the City of Durban near the business complex. Not having heard the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views on this matter, I should like to point out that it is an accepted principle in the world that amalgamation of smaller local authorities, where this is agreed to by the inhabitants, is the only way out of the financial dilemma the local authorities find themselves in. Indeed, Durban decided to do this itself some years ago when it extended its boundaries to take in areas such as the Bluff and so on. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he seriously considers that Durban should disintegrate into separate city councils against the principle which is, as I say, recognized world wide and which is in fact in the process of being implemented to a degree both on the North Coast and South Coast of the City of Durban. These separate councils, I submit, will hardly be viable when one considers that the larger cities of South Africa have their own very serious economic problems. I would like to pose the question whether separate city councils which are already part of a larger area, can in fact be viable. The Indians have already claimed&#x2014;and quite rightly&#x2014; the Grey Street complex to be included in their sphere of influence under their own city council. They are quite right; after all, it has been declared an Indian area. The Durban City Council on the other hand, has said that it will not hand over the complex because Durban has its problems too with regard to making ends meet like every other city in the world. So the question of disintegrating a city council into separate councils is in fact one which flouts all known practices today. I believe that the hon. the Minister and his department should give guidance in respect of this question in the very near future.</p>

<p>Let me be the first to admit, and let me admit it very strongly, that the Indians of Durban have every reason to complain of their treatment in the past by the Durban City Council. I make no bones about that. One only has to visit these areas to see that the development there is retarded. This happens in other cities too. The Indians therefore certainly have a legitimate grouse in regard to this development, but we must be very careful in accepting that all race groups in a city must help to develop that city. For the life of me I cannot see how this particular system has any merit whatsoever. It flouts, as I have said, every known economic principle of local authority <span class="col_7977-7978" refersTo="page_1056"/>today. I do not believe that this should be accepted because succeeding generations, who are bound to change their thinking&#x2014;after all we even have the phenomena that the Nationalist members are changing their thinking&#x2014;are bound to change this order to reunite the city because it cannot exist in separate bits and pieces. I do not see how you can tear the heart out of a city in this way. These people, and all the people living on the city&#x2019;s boundaries, have contributed to the growth of the city. They owe their living to the city and the city owes them a living as well. I would suggest that if one is to move in this direction, the only fair way to deal with the matter is to let, for example, the Indians unify their local affairs committees. That we must accept; I think it is inevitable, so that they can speak wth one voice. Ultimately we must move in the direction &#x2014;and I am not playing politics at all with the hon. the Minister&#x2014;of letting the Indian local authorities control their affairs, the Coloured theirs&#x2014;they must in due course come with their proposals&#x2014;and the Whites theirs, but over all of these there must in time, in the not too distant future, be a metropolitan authority to control all these matters. Although a metropolitan authority may not be round the corner, no action we take now should make it more difficult to achieve this because this is obviously the way in which things are going to move in the future.</p>

<p>I have one or two questions to ask with regard to the Indian Council. My colleague, the hon. member for Zululand, spoke a great deal about it. I should like to know what progress has been made with regard to the voters&#x2019; roll. I should like to point out to the hon. the Minister that the previous Minister said that the election of these five members would not be delayed. The life of the present council is coming to an end, and I would like to know whether these five members are going to be elected before the life of the present council expires, or is it going to happen when it expires. Secondly, I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister, as I have appealed to his predecessors, that the Indian Council should behave in the same manner as the White, Bantu and Coloured authorities behave. All these bodies have their meetings open to the Press, so that the public can see what is going on. I believe it is time the Indian Council, too, opened its doors, even if it is only to its own Press. At any rate, there is certainly no justification for it to continue any longer in the manner that it has been doing.</p>

<p>To interpret politics in South Africa correctly, it is also necessary to analyse the role of the propaganda machinery of the anti-National Party groups. As far as the anti-National Party Press in particular is concerned, we find its insinuations, destructive criticism, etc. particularly in its political commentary, headlines, etc. As an Afrikaans-speaking person I am only too well aware that every time a person turns against the National Party, they praise him for being &#x201C;enlightened&#x201D; and for being an &#x201C;intellectual&#x201D;. But if one adheres firmly to <span class="col_7979-7980" refersTo="page_1057"/>National Party principles, one is &#x201C;controversial&#x201D;, &#x201C;out-dated&#x201D;, or has a &#x201C;laager mentality&#x201D; and is &#x201C;Ossewa-minded&#x201D;. The English-speaking person with a sense of discipline and decency, those to whom the continued existence of the White man is meaningful and who do not regard the acknowledgment of diversity and the right to one&#x2019;s own identity and sovereignty, as something unnatural, experience the same treatment in the Press and by the anti-National Party propaganda machinery. I should like to mention the hon. the Minister as an example. When the hon. the Minister was appointed as principal of the Natal University, people, quite justifiably, waxed lyrical about his abilities, and I agree with that. I want to quote examples to you. In the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 18th September, 1965, we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">University authorities yesterday said that in appointing Prof. Horwood the University Council had related his wide experience and grasp of finance to the urgent demand for expansion that will face the university during the next two decades &#x2026;It is fortunate that Prof. Horwood also has an intimate knowledge of academic life, and he will be able to pay due regard to those factors which will afford the greatest benefits and facilities to the students of the University.</block>

<p>In addition we find the following in the <i>Mercury</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The man who has been chosen as the next principal of the University of Natal has a rare talent for unravelling the complicated fabric of economics and weaving the threads into simple, easily understood patterns of words &#x2026; He shares this interest with his wife, who was a double full Blue at the University of Cape Town. Mrs. Horwood captained the hockey and tennis teams and obtained bachelor degrees in arts and education as well &#x2026; As an economist, Prof. Horwood is well versed in the science of household affairs and domestic management. The University of Natal, the home of higher education in the province, could not have wished for a better housekeeper.</block>

<p>I want to quote to you further, Mr. Chairman, from the <i>Natal University News.</i> There we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prof. Horwood, head of the department of economics, has combined a distinguished academic career with many contributions to economic thought at national level. Indeed, it is the intimate connection between his academic life and the everyday problems of both business and government that fits him so well for the task as the University&#x2019;s chief administrator.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can quote many other examples of this kind. This one, from the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 3rd April, 1966, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prof. Horwood is no impulsive firebrand. Temperamentally he exudes the essence of moderation and of rationality, but there is no denying his innate sense of justice and, at times, the outspoken courage of his convictions.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I quote these examples to you from the Press, from the anti-National Party machinery, when they looked objectively and fairly at a man who attained to a very high post in Natal. It is interesting to note that this reflects the so-called broad-minded, broad, wide, enlightened way of thought of the anti-Nationalist group in South Africa, but as soon as a person comes forward, in the light of his knowledge and his wisdom, and adopts a standpoint aimed at drawing attention to and helping discipline and honesty, then the great propaganda machinery starts to act against the National Party, whether the National Party is represented by an Afrikaans-speaking person or an English-speaking person, and whether one is a Bantu, an Indian or a Coloured. That machinery then operates to destroy the person of that man and commit character assassination. Sir, I want to quote to you from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 3rd August, 1969. In an editorial in, that newspaper we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Quite the best thing that has happened to the Natal University in years is the resignation of its principal, Prof. Owen Horwood &#x2026; It is simply that as principal of that university he was what is sometimes described as a square peg in a round hole.</block>

<p>Sir, the last paragraph, which I shall quote in a moment, is one of the dirtiest to be found in journalism. Sir, you know my background; I am accustomed to church <span class="col_7981-7982" refersTo="page_1058"/>council meetings and it is difficult to find a term to describe this kind of journalism. This paragraph reads&#x2014;</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say here today that the hon, the Minister, as well as Mrs. Horwood, are not only an asset to the National Party, but an asset to politics in South Africa. Here we have a proof that an English-speaking person may become a member of the National Party and that he can reach the highest rung in the National Party without in any way having to give up his identity and his sense of the values peculiar to his cultural group which, on the other hand, is the case when an Afrikaans-speaking person joins a political party other than the National Party. Sir, we are dealing here with the political head of the Department of Indian Affairs, a man who has not only reached the highest academic rung, but a man who, while he was in charge, gave meaningfulness and dignity to academic life in South Africa. Today we have at the head of the Department of Indian Affairs a man as capable as one can get, and my wish is that more Prof. Horwoods will come forward in South Africa, who will not only take their place in the academic world, but also in politics. Sir, the hon. the Minister became chancellor of the Indian University, and there he said the following, which is a model of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s philosophy of life and point of view in regard to universities. He said <i>inter alia</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our universities and their members, staff and students alike, have a far greater measure of freedom to run their affairs according to their own likes and discretion than many universities throughout the world. But such freedom does not exempt any of them from the general obligation of responsible behaviour and the need to abide by the established law of the land and, what is more, the rules and regulations of their own university.</block>

<p>Sir, the impression one gets of the Nationalist Party is that for twenty years they did not want to think about the Indian question and that they preferred to wait until this question became a problem to South Africa. The Indian community has been waiting for 20 years to hear from the Nationalist Party Government what their political and constitutional future in South Africa is. The mere fact that 620 000 people are patiently waiting, is certainly no reason for this Government not to give a decisive answer to their political future in South Africa. It is more than time we heard from this Government what their approach in regard to the Indians is, but before I come to that point, I just want to add that the potential of the Indians in South Africa is one of the greatest assets available to South Africa. But what is being done on the part of this Government to mobilize this potential-charged mass of people, 620 000 of them, to the maximum benefit of South Africa&#x003F; Their potential, particularly in regard to the manufacturing industry, commerce and the construction industry, is being totally neglected under this Government. One of the most important reasons I want to mention here today is the job reservation measures by means of which the potential of this community is being restricted, and which make it impossible for them to develop to their full potential. One of the main reasons why South Africa has immigration schemes, is to bring skilled manpower to South Africa in order to create more job opportunities for the more unskilled and the more under-developed masses of South Africa. Here <span class="col_7983-7984" refersTo="page_1059"/>we have in our midst a mass of people, the Indian community, which offers an unlimited potential to assist us in this regard. But what is this Government doing&#x003F; These people are subject to the worst form of discrimination, namely the job reservation measures.</p>

<p>This community, 620 442 in number according to the 1970 census, is also unaware of what its political future is to be under this Nationalist Party. The South African Indian community, certainly the most developed, the most mature, the most civilized and most westernized of all non-White groups in South Africa, is at present under the Nationalist Party r&#x00E9;gime, still at the lowest level of political and constitutional development.</p>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>It took them 20 years and on 1st September, 1968, they eventually came to their senses to some extent and appointed the South African Indian Council. Last year we had legislation in this House in order (a) to make it possible for the Minister to increase the number of members of the Indian Council from 25 to 30; (b) to enable the Minister, after consultation with the Indian community, to make recommendations to the State President in regard to the method of electing the Indian Council, and (c) to make provision for the delegation of certain powers to the Council, in addition to education and welfare, for which provision was made in the legislation. The question of the increase in the number of Council members from 25 to 30 is in my opinion not of importance at this stage, but something we want to know more about from this hon. Minister is what is happening in regard to the future election procedure and delegation of powers to the Indian Council. We on this side of the House have said hundreds of times that we feel very strongly about the principle of a fully elected Council. And let me say that the excuse one finds in this report of the department, that a common voters&#x2019; roll for the Indians does not exist, is not acceptable to us on this side of the House. After being in power for 25 years this is really not something which this Government can be proud of. We want a reply from the hon. the Minister in regard to this matter. I want to say at once, and I do not want there to be any misapprehension about this, that I have the greatest respect for the good work and the inspiring way in which the S.A. Indian Council are performing their task. In fact, four of the seven Transvaal members are very well known to me and every year in the recess I try to get in touch with them. But the argument is that if all the Bantu peoples who in my opinion are at a far lower level of development than the Indian community of South Africa, have the right to elect territorial regional councils, and the Bantu in a city such as Soweto have the right to elect an urban Bantu council, there is no reason why the Indian community should not have the right to elect its own council. As long as the Indians do not have the right to elect their own representatives and the elected representatives do not have to be accountable to the Indian community, justice will not be done to the mutual trust between the representative and the voter. I am convinced that the majority of the present Indian council appointed by this Government, would prefer to serve in that council as a result of an election rather than by way of appointment by the Government.</p>

<p>But there is a third measure placed on the Statute Book by way of last year&#x2019;s legislation. I refer to the delegation of powers to the Indian Council. I want to repeat that this community is surely capable of dealing with the administration of and responsibility <span class="col_7985-7986" refersTo="page_1060"/>for any of the powers at present administered by the Coloured Representative Council or by any of the territorial Bantu regional councils. We should like to hear from the hon. the Minister about progress in this field. I believe that the Indian community in general is also very keen to hear what the Government is going to do in this regard.</p>

<p>I believe, too, that the time has arrived when there will have to be clarity on the part of the Government in regard to the question of where they want to take the Indians politically and constitutionally and in what direction they want to move in regard to the Indians in South Africa. Our standpoint on this side of the House is very clear. Together with the legislative assemblies for the Whites, Coloureds and Bantu in the homelands or in the White areas, we will create an Indian legislative assembly for the 620 000 South African Indians within the framework of the federation of South African nations. As one of the units of a federal concept, the legislative assembly of the Indians would be co-ordinated with those of the other peoples in the federal council which would develop on an evolutionary basis under the leadership of this hon. House.</p>

<p>What, however, does this government offer in contrast&#x003F; A kind of Indian council which hangs between &#x201C;nowhere and somewhere&#x201D;, like the Coloured Persons Representative Council which is a mere appendage of this House and will be under the domination of the Whites in South Africa for all time.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Newcastle who spoke before the adjournment has been forced by circumstances lately to repudiate public figures in his constituency. Over the weekend <span class="col_7989-7990" refersTo="page_1062"/>it was necessary for him to repudiate his mayor on the matter of mixed sport where you had Indians playing not only against Whites, but also with Whites. Now it was necessary for him to repudiate his Provincial Councillor on the important matter of job reservation. I should like to know what the views of the hon. the Minister are in regard to these important matters which affect the Indian community. I expect answers from him because, after all, the hon. the Minister seems to be a very versatile man. In fact, it seems as if he is a man for all seasons. We know he has to carry the responsibility of two State departments. In addition, he is the chancellor of a university, having had previous experience as a principal of another university. Apart from that, he is in fact the leader of a party, the Nationalist Party in Natal, where he has to lead a team of three M.P.s and three Provincial councillors. It looks now as if he has a division within his team at the moment, because the hon. member for Newcastle is at loggerheads with his Provincial Councillor in regard to the matter of job reservation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his appointment as a Minister. He follows in the footsteps of a previous Minister who had to carry the responsibility of three State departments, namely the Department of Indian Affairs, the Department of Tourism and the Department of Sport and Recreation. I do not pretend to know why the hon. the Prime Minister entrusted the responsibility of only two State departments to him. I can only hope that he has enough work to keep himself occupied. It seems to me that the hon. the Minister has accepted an additional responsibility, namely the chancellorship of the University of Durban Westville. In this respect I want to wish the hon. the Minister all the luck in the world, because I think with his past experience of university administration, he will need all the luck in the world. In a more serious vein I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think it was a mistake in his own interest and in the interest of the Indian community to have accepted the responsibility of being the chancellor of the University of Durban Westville. This university can easily develop into a focal point for Indian politics and it would be far better for the hon. the Minister and also for the Indian community if he refrained from accepting this appointment.</p>

<p>*There should be a mutual tie between the chancellor and the community which he serves. Mutual acceptability is of great importance. I accept that the hon. the Prime Minister, for example, is an acceptable chancellor for the University of Stellenbosch, although his name is not acceptable for Despatch. There is a mutual tie between himself and Stellenbosch. For the same reason I do not believe that the hon. the Prime Minister would ever have been an acceptable chancellor for the University of Cape Town. It is for this reason that I am giving the hon. the Minister this advice. The mere fact that he is the leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal and also Minister of Indian Affairs does not make him acceptable to the Indian community in the sense that he should be the chancellor of their university. It is not a reflection on the hon. the Minister in his capacity as Minister; the problem is that, in the policy of separate development, not even the theoretical advantages which are held out to the Bantu population groups in South Africa are held out to the Indians. Separate development does not offer this to the Indians. The possibility of political frustration of the Indians is a hundred times greater than in the case of all the other population groups. And whether we want to know this or not, they are going to give vent to these frustrations somewhere. In some way or other they are going to use part of the system of separate development to give vent to their frustrations. I may tell the hon. the Minister that the chances of the University of Durban Westville being used for this purpose are actually very likely. However, this is something which can be prevented, and which has to be prevented. I fear that events at this university during the past few months point very clearly to the university&#x2019;s being quickly drawn into the political sphere. As far as this is concerned it may be a good thing that the hon. the Minister happens to be the chancellor of that university. There can be no doubt about it that political considerations have led to certain lecturers at that university having been discharged. I refer to Prof. Gering, and the lecturer Mr. Lamb. I accept that the university is an autonomous body. I also accept that they may lay down rules and regulations which people have to obey, but in the process they may not make themselves guilty of <span class="col_7991-7992" refersTo="page_1063"/>double standards. I believe that unfortunately this is the case, however.</p>

<p>I am sorry about this, but in this connection I have to refer to the political part played by the registrar of the University of Durban Westville. I respect him as a political opponent. I personally have nothing against his political activities, although he denies that he is active on a political level. I may tell you that I personally like the registrar of the University of Durban Westville to ask political questions at public meetings. Someone who asks questions can sometimes make a speaker&#x2019;s meeting through the questions he asks, and the registrar of Durban Westville does have the special talent of asking one questions which can in fact make a success of the meeting. In spite of the fact that he has stated that nobody could prove that he had ever done it, I can bear witness to the fact that, when I together with the hon. member for Port Natal addressed a meeting during the 1970 provincial election, it was the registrar of the University of Durban Westville who asked me questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister is chancellor of that university, the University of Durban Westville, and he replies to questions put to him in this House. In that respect I can refer you to a question that was put to him, the reply to which appears in column 572 of this year&#x2019;s Questions and Replies. About this specific matter a question was put to him. In his reply to this question he attempted to hide behind <i>Government Notice</i> No. R.47. dated 8th January, 1965, to the effect that his appointment was really a State post appointment. Now we must also accept that we have this very year passed a Public Service Amendment Bill, and that in clause 4 of that Bill we accepted that such a person could indeed take part in politics, could attend a meeting, but was not allowed to address it; and &#x201C;address&#x201D; includes the asking of questions. I just wanted to tell the hon. the Minister that in the set-up of the Indian community in South Africa they have a tremendous respect for education. In other words, the university plays a major part in their lives. The fact that double standards are now applied in regard to the administrative staff and the lecturing staff is going to lead to a confrontation. It is going to lead to the Indian community&#x2019;s giving vent to their frustrations. I may just remind hon. members of the fact that a lecturer, Mr. Lamb, was apparently discharged as a result of certain letters he had written to newspapers. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is an exceptional privilege for me, as Minister of Indian Affairs, to be able to deal with my Vote in this House tonight. I want to express my sincere gratitude to my hon. colleagues on both sides of the House for their kind words of encouragement tonight, and the congratulations they addressed to me. I can tell them that I am most appreciative of the things they said. My friend, the hon. member for Rissik&#x2014;he represents in this House the constituency in which I reside&#x2014; made such kind remarks that even my wife, who was sitting in the Gallery, could not help blushing. However, I want to thank him sincerely too.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In thanking hon. members for their very kind sentiments, I cannot but be struck by the very jarring note of the last speaker. Well, Sir, he is entitled to his views. If he thinks that this sort of petty and rather childish approach is the view he likes to take, then he is free to take it. I am not in the least interested or impressed by his views about my qualities or qualifications as a chancellor of a university, but I thought that it was a little unfortunate that he should have taken this opportunity tonight to go even further and in a very derogatory manner say that, after all, I only have two portfolios in the department&#x2014;that perhaps it was a good thing, because I probably was not being fully employed anyhow.</p>

<p>Will the hon. member just keep quiet&#x003F; I will talk to him in a moment. You know, Sir, Lord Birkenhead once said that to be offensive, some people had to try to be offensive and others could not help themselves. I will leave it to the hon. member for Durban Central to decide in which category he falls.</p>

<p>As we know&#x2014;but it needs to be said as a reminder perhaps&#x2014;this is a young department. The Department of Indian Affairs was established in 1961. That is barely 12 years ago. I have been asked what our policy is. It is a perfectly legitimate question. In any case, I would have wished to <span class="col_7993-7994" refersTo="page_1064"/>try and say something about it tonight, and I shall do so. But I would like to remind hon. members of this House that the Indian Council was only established in statutory form in 1968, four years ago. I think it was the hon. member for Turffontein who wanted to know what this Government had really done for the Indians. Here it is, I think, perfectly fair and just to put the question in another form back to him, namely to ask him what his side of the House did when they were in power&#x003F; What did they do for the Indians&#x003F;</p>

<p>*You know, Sir, the policy of that side of the House, as far as the Indian population of South Africa is concerned, may be summarized in one word: i.e. repatriation. After all, there was a repatriation scheme. What became of it&#x003F; But in 1960 and in 1961 perfectly clear statements of policy were made by the late Dr. Verwoerd, as well as in the following year by the then Minister of the Interior, Senator De Klerk, in which it was stated quite clearly where we were going with the Indian population of South Africa. I just want to remind the hon. member of what that policy involves.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, this brings me back to the hon. member for Zululand, who asked the same question. He asked me particularly to tell him how I see our policy in relation to the Indian people as part of the overall policy of separate development in South Africa. He went further and stated that after all this policy of separate development was tied to the idea of a separate people or nation being themselves connected to their own geographical area or homeland. In the light of that he wanted to know where the Indian people, and the Coloured people too, for that matter, stand. I want to say to him that it has been said very clearly by the hon. the Prime Minister and others on this side of the House many times that our policy is a policy of separate development&#x2014;that is perfectly correct&#x2014;in the sense that we recognize the separate identities of the several different nations or population groups of this country. We want to bring them to a point where they can achieve their own aspirations in their own way. We recognize that there are fundamental differences such as cultural differences, ethnic differences and others, and by recognizing the separate identities of these several peoples, we would like so to devise our policy as to give them every opportunity to advance themselves to achieve those national aspirations for themselves. I cannot at all see why one has to qualify that policy, in the sense that one must distinguish between the policy as related to a people who have their own geographical homeland&#x2014;there are historical reasons and logical reasons for this&#x2014; and on the other hand as related to a people who are not, as it were, tied to a given geographical area, namely people like the Coloureds and the Indians, who are spread much more widely over the country.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am dealing with our policy now. The hon. member had his opportunity to state his policy if he wished to. Perhaps he will have a further opportunity to do so. I am busy answering his question.</p>

<p>Sir, he then came to the Indian Council. One must look at what we have achieved in this period of at most 12 years since this political philosophy was postulated by Dr. Verwoerd. Look at the constitutional developments that have taken place. We have this Indian Council. Now, it is perfectly true that this Indian Council is today an appointed body, consisting of 25 members. It is four years old&#x2014;I am referring to the statutory body. We made provision in the amendment to the Act last year for a further five members who could be elected members. That will bring the number of members up to 30. I was asked how these members will be brought into this council and what methods will be adopted in this regard. I was also asked by the hon. member for Turffontein what powers would be delegated to this council. As far as the constitution of the council is concerned, the present term of office of members expires in August, 1974. After that it will be perfectly possible, in terms of the legislation, to vary the number of elected and appointed members. In fact if it were deemed possible, necessary, practicable or desirable, one could even go so far as to make them all elected members, but then the question still remains: In what way&#x003F; I merely want to say that at this moment I am negotiating and consulting with the South African Indian Council on this very issue, to determine how they see the constitution of this council when the present tenure of office expires. We are dealing with that, and I have already arranged some time ago that shortly after the end of this <span class="col_7995-7996" refersTo="page_1065"/>session I shall be meeting the council in Durban for this very reason. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to anticipate the discussions, but there are very responsible discussions taking place and I have had some very responsible views put to me by this council. As to the methods to be used, if we are going to have a certain number of elected members as against appointed members, I must say that at the moment we have not got a satisfactory electoral roll.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Turffontein said that what is lacking is a general voters&#x2019; roll for Indians; that is true.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We are still in the process of having to organize a great deal of the mechanics of this matter, but there are methods; I am merely giving this as a possibility; I am not expressing any preference and I am not wishing to suggest in any way what I have made up my mind; my mind is absolutely open, but a possibility under present conditions would certainly be to use the principle of an electoral college. That is one possibility; and you could use the local affairs committees; you could use the town management boards, and you could possibly use other important national bodies. I have in mind, for example, a representative body like the Indian division of the Chamber of Industries in Natal. From all these bodies and others you could get a pretty representative body of voters, but I merely give this as a possibility and I say again that this matter is very much under consideration at the moment and I do not want to anticipate any discussions which are going to take place.</p>

<p>*I just want to tell the hon. member for Turffontein that, as far as the delegation of powers is concerned, provision has already been made for the delegation of powers in regard to welfare and education matters. It is simply a question of a date which the State President has to promulgate before this can be implemented. Provision has, therefore, been made. After that, i.e. once the newly appointed council is functioning, the Minister may even be able to transfer further duties and functions to the Indian Council. All these aspects of this important matter, i.e. the duty and functions of this council, will then of course be reconsidered. With this I hope I have replied to that point.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I do not want to talk at too great length, but I wanted to make a short reference to the constitutional development. Sir, look at the progress that has been made with regard to residential and housing development. When I went to Durban towards the end of 1957 I found that on the western side of the University of Natal campus, down that hill, there was this absolute eyesore, Cato Manor, one of the biggest slums that one could see anywhere, I suppose.</p>

<p>Sir, within a matter of a few short years that whole area, which the Police told me contained something like 200 000 people over a weekend, was cleared; Chatsworth was constructed and the whole of that population was put into Chatsworth. Hon. members from Durban and Natal will know what Chatsworth looks like today. It is in fact an enormous town, and that is only one example. I have also been to Ladium outside Pretoria; I have been to Actonville and other places, and what has been done in these places is something of which I think this country can really be proud.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Newcastle pointed out tonight that some of these Indian houses are among the best in South Africa; that is true; that is the position in Westville and in Actonville and in Ladium. To my mind that is an achievement this Government may truly be proud of.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then, Sir, when we come to the question of education, we come to what is perhaps the most important aspect of all in this process and policy of the development of the Indian community. What have we achieved in this connection&#x003F; We have 175 000 Indian pupils at school in South Africa today; we have more than 6 300 Indian teachers; we have 367 schools and two training colleges. There is a school for the blind and a school for the deaf, and there is a school of industries. There is a magnificent college for advanced technical education, the M. L. Sultan Technical College, which has between 7 000 and 8 000 students. It is one of the biggest in South Africa. Then we have a university which is in its infancy and which was only officially opened the other day by the Prime Minister, and which I believe, as it is being constructed and developed at the moment, is going to have not only one of the most <span class="col_7997-7998" refersTo="page_1066"/>beautiful campuses in South Africa, or anywhere for that matter, but is going to be a very fine university. There are already in that university, after a short period of at most 12 years, 2 300 students, whereas when it started there were 114. There are 157 members of the academic staff, of whom 38 are Indian already, and I say &#x201C;already&#x201D; because when we started that university I think there were only two Indian staff members.</p>

<p>*As I understood him to say, the hon. member for Durban Central referred to political considerations which applied in the appointment of certain staff members. I want to reply briefly to what he said. I shall come back to that aspect. I think that was a most unreasonable statement to make.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, when it comes to education, it is not generally known, even in this country today, that we have had compulsory education in Indian schools as from the beginning of this year. Sir, I want to ask hon. members in how many countries of Africa there is compulsory education, yet for the Indian community of this country, the costs of whose education are being substantially borne by the Whites, as it happens&#x2014;and we do not object to this; I merely mention it as a fact&#x2014;we have compulsory education for students up to the age of 15 years, as from the beginning of this year.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must give me a chance to put my case. There will be other opportunities for members to speak afterwards. What I am saying is that the Indian community are not by any means footing the whole bill for their education, and I am not criticizing them for that. The cost of running the university, for example, is being borne entirely by the Government. Provision is being made in these Estimates for R4&#x00BC; million for this year. Sir, in saying this I am not criticizing anybody, but I am stating this as a fact to be borne in mind. You know, Sir, in 1927 when the Cape Town Agreement came into being, it was a milestone in the development of the Indian community and particularly Indian education. The Hon. V. S. Sastri was the agent of the Government of India in this country. In 1927 he explained this Cape Town agreement to the Indian community at a meeting in the city hall of Durban in a speech worth reading. In that speech he congratulated the Indian community even then on the progress they were making in the economic sphere and he drew attention to the substantial number of their members who were making a very good living indeed. He congratulated them on the success they were making in their economic life but he impressed on them the absolute importance of their putting aside something of that, as he said, generous reward they were receiving for their work, for education. And I believe the Indian community took that lesson to heart. But I draw attention to the great development of Indian education and I say this is something which I think this Government, in the last few years particularly, has had a very big hand in; it is indeed a very fine achievement that we can talk about.</p>

<p>Sir, we talked about separate education and many hon. members opposite have criticized this concept a great deal, right from the inception of the Extension of University Education Act. We have a separate university for Indians. What was the position&#x003F; When I was at the University of <span class="col_7999-8000" refersTo="page_1067"/>Natal in 1957 we had in the University of Natal a separate non-White section consisting mainly of Indian students. That was set up first in the 1930s and it was developed under the term of office of Dr. Malherbe as principal of the university. It was a separate non-White section where we used to give lectures in the late afternoons and the evenings, the same classes and the same lecturers, but it was an absolutely separate wing of the university. If that was not separate development on an educational basis, what was it&#x003F; I want to ask, if that could have been freely and voluntarily adopted by the University of Natal in the 1930s, without the criticism we heard later, why then could this university, which has been developed in Natal as a university for the Indian people, and which has achieved such tremendous success in s short time&#x2014;why must this university be attacked and subjected to the sustained vendetta which it is facing today&#x003F; And I want to come back to this point because I think it is one of the most scandalous things that is happening in our country today, when we talk about the Indian people. Why should it be so when this university is such a success today&#x003F; It is exactly the same philosophy; it is a separate institution. I want to say to this House today that I know the Indian people. I really did try to get to know the Indian people in the 15 years I spent in Natal and I can assure this House tonight that the Indian community of South Africa, apart from a few of the difficult and dissident members of the Indian Congress and that type, have accepted this university in the fullest sense of the word.</p>

You want to read the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and <i>the Daily News</i> for weeks and weeks before this, but what happened&#x003F; There was a magnificent turn-out.

<p>During the past few months we have succeeded in bringing about some relaxation in the restrictions on the movements of Indian persons from one province to another, restrictions which have existed ever since 1913. We were able to change this state of affairs towards the end of last year. During the last few days we succeeded in abolishing the advisory council at the university so that Indians themselves are able to serve on the council during this transitional period. As I have already mentioned, we now have compulsory education in the schools. All these things we achieved during the past few months.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to say this. Sir, in order to show you the sort of spirit which we still find in this country today. Here was this very far-reaching measure which the Indian community have hailed as one of the most important concessions they have had in years. I have these things in letters. The Indian Council have told me this. What does the <i>Natal Daily News</i> say about this, when it was announced that there was this big relaxation of the restrictions on the movements of Indians&#x003F; What does the <i>Natal Daily News</i> do&#x003F; It was said that it would be a very substantial change and the <i>Natal Daily News,</i> without bothering to ask anybody&#x2014;they do not hesitate to get into touch with me when it suits them&#x2014; published an editorial saying: &#x201C;Thanks for nothing.&#x201D; Sir, this is the trouble in this country today. When this Government goes out of its way to make a major contribution to the improvement of race relations, what is the reaction on the part of a newspaper with a big circulation in Natal where the majority of the Indians are&#x003F; It says to the Indian community: &#x201C;Thanks for nothing.

<p>Thank you, Sir, There is another concession which we have made. In the Transvaal the Indians have for a long time been asking that Indian households be given the opportunity to employ Bantu to work in their gardens and their homes, where these people are in business all day and the Bantu are available. In this regard the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has seen his way open to grant this permission, and I am very grateful for it. Again it is immensely appreciated by the Indian community. This has happened only in the last few months.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal mentioned the proclaiming of Grey Street as a commercial area for Indians. I think this is a further piece of evidence of this Government&#x2019;s whole attitude towards this community in South Africa.</p>

<p>And it took you 12 years to do it.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In all these matters we cannot go faster than the means at our disposal will allow. I believe that within the limits of that extremely important requirement we are really doing everything we reasonably can to assist the Indian community to bring themselves to a stage where they can really help themselves, because that is the great aim of our policy: To put them in a position where they can feel they are a substantive self-supporting community who can go forward in co-operation with us, in the spirit which exists today, to fulfil their real destiny as they see it. I have already referred to the need for this to happen, for the Indian community themselves to make the maximum effort and the maximum contribution to help themselves.</p>

<p>There are one or two other points. The hon. member for Port Natal asked me why the meetings of the South African Indian Council could not be open. I may say to him that the position at the moment is that the Press are allowed into those meetings at the discretion of the chairman. It is therefore entirely up to the Indian Council. If the chairman is agreeable that they come in, they come in and this has happened many times. However, we do not have the facilities at the moment&#x2014;the Indian Council itself pointed this out&#x2014; to allow the public as such to come in there. We are looking into that matter in view of the fact that the new council will have to be constituted very soon and we hope that we shall be able to provide the necessary facilities.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Port Natal also asked me about the establishment of a local government body for Indians in Durban. The hon. member raised an important point, but he should not have addressed the question to me. He should have addressed the question to the United <span class="col_8003-8004" refersTo="page_1069"/>Party provincial administration in Natal, because this is a provincial matter, [Interjections.] The hon. member shakes his head but this is a provincial matter. The position is that my department, as one can imagine, is extremely interested in this and we are keeping, as one might say, an interested eye on the situation, but we certainly do not wish to intervene directly at this moment where we have competent authorities, I hope. I really hope so. I want to say, however, that if the United Party provincial administration wishes to bring this about, they have to move on, because we have some designs on Natal ourselves. [Interjections.] I do not want to frighten them, but I have to warn them.</p>

A few weeks after he had gone overseas and when he was well out of the way, there was a huge article in the <i>Daily News</i> which was almost a page long wherein he said the most dreadful things about this university and its senior officers. He did that when he was out of the country and I can tell hon. members that it is a tissue of untruths and half-truths. I say this because I know what the facts are. Now we come to a further issue. These things are serious matters because they affect a university very badly. Now we come to an issue where we have had a temporary lecturer appointed in the law department.</p>

<p>There was a committee of three senior staff members appointed to make the recommendation as to whom of the three applicants should be appointed. One of those applicants happened to be an Indian, but by a majority of two to one that committee decided to recommend, for good reasons which they set out, a particular gentleman who was a White. The Indian did not get the job. Members of this House may have seen the agitation that has been on the go since then. There has been absolute intellectual defamation of this university and its senior officers as a result: Yes it was done in an absolutely regular way.</p>

<p>Worst of all, there was a professor of law whose appointment was on probation. His appointment&#x2014;and I hope the hon. member for Durban Central will listen to this &#x2014;was not confirmed. After the first year on probation it was decided that they could not confirm his appointment, but that he would be given an extension of his probationary appointment if he wishes to take it, and he took it.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that any man who has any sense at all must immediately realize that there must be something that is worrying the authorities that they cannot confirm his appointment right away. He is perfectly free at any time to go to the proper authority to discuss the matter. When it came to the end of that second period it was decided that the appointment would not be confirmed. It was the end of March, 1973. Then out of the kindness of its heart the university, and as I think, if I may say so perhaps misguidedly, said that they would give him until the end of the year in order to make other arrangements. Then the fun really started. There was an enormous agitation in these newspapers, amongst certain students and among certain members of the staff that this man was done this grave injustice and that the whole thing was irregular. The gravest reflections were on cast on Prof. Olivier, the council and the registrar&#x2014;absolutely unjustly. This man said that he was never given the reasons why his appointment was not confirmed. The fact of the matter is that in front of senior members of the university he had been told precisely why his appointment was not confirmed. I have the reasons here.</p>

<p>Yes, Prof. Gering. Things got so bad after 31st March that recently the council decided that things could simply not go on like this any longer and they then said that they would terminate his appointment but that they would pay him up to the end of June. That is the position. But now there has been this tremendous agitation and it has been said that this is unjust. It has been said that this is done because this is a Nat. university. I have all the papers here. In the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> it was said that this is a Nat. Broederbond university and that this has been done in order to get this man out because he is the great champion of the Indian <span class="col_8007-8008" refersTo="page_1071"/>cause. They gave that as the reason why there was this so-called discrimination against him and why he was being victimized.</p>

<p>I want to ask in this House tonight who are greater champions of the Indian&#x2019;s cause in this country than Prof. Olivier and the council of that university under Prof. Nienaber, who is a very great personal friend of mine, one of the finest men in any university in this country today. Who is a greater champion of the Indians&#x2019; cause than those men&#x003F; I do not want to attack Prof. Gering, but I will defend the honour and the integrity of these men, Prof. Olivier and the members of the council. I want to say that I consider this to be a national disgrace. I think it is high time that the chairman and the directors of the Argus group should go into the question of the competence of the editor of the <i>Daily News</i> and the competence of the editor of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> to hold the jobs they are holding, because they have been doing nothing but casting the gravest reflections on these men by espousing the cause of Gering morning, noon and night for months on end against the facts.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will answer that question. I am coming to the question of the registrar, I can assure the hon. member, but I do not want to be deflected for the moment from this all-important point because we are talking of academic freedom.</p>

<p>We talk of academic freedom but this is the grossest abuse of academic freedom I can think of. This is abuse of academic freedom from beginning to end. I do not want to read from all the documents and newspaper articles I have, but I want to say that this is a disgrace. This is something any self-respecting and responsible Government must look at. Why is this university being subjected to this scandalous attack by people who are not fit to tie the shoe laces of the Rector and the members of the council of the university&#x003F; I want to know why. We demand an answer from those newspapers, and not only from the newspapers. What I think is equally bad&#x2014;this is something unprecedented&#x2014;is that certain professors of the University of Natal have seen fit to join in this witch hunt. Professors from a sister university have joined in the witch hunt against the Rector and the council of the University of Durban-Westville on the Gering issue. I refer particularly to a man who should know better as he is head of the law faculty of the University of Natal, Durban, namely Prof. A. S. Mathews. He has cast grave reflections on the council. He said that there had been irregularities and that the procedure, as adopted, was not the procedure that was adopted at reputable universities. I challenge Prof. Mathews tonight to substantiate those very grave charges. Let me just remind hon. members that this is the gentleman who has written an article, and also a book; he is of course the self-appointed authority on the security laws of South Africa. This is what the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prof. Anthony Mathews, one of South Africa&#x2019;s foremost legal experts, has accused the Government of camouflaging the real purpose of its draconian internal security laws behind a smokescreen of crisis rule in a process which could lead to Nationalists assuming total power.</block>

<p>In other words, a totalitarian state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This unwarranted legislation, in a system which has tom the heart out of the rule of law, is designed mainly to overcome all legitimate opposition to a system which entrenches a permanent state of emergency, according to Prof. Mathews. In a careful analysis the dean of the faculty of law at the University of Natal, Durban, sketches a chilling picture of an almost total withdrawal from all recognized principles of civilized law by South Africa.</block>

<p>As I say he is one of the most respected men in Natal and any lawyer here will know his standing in the legal profession. The hon. Mr. Justice Broome referred to an article by Prof. Mathews which dealt with the Suppression of Communism Act and gave the description of this Act that Prof. Mathews gave. He quotes what Prof. Mathews said. The hon. Mr. Justice Broome went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A perusal of the definition &#x2026;</block>

<p>The definition given by Mathews&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; however, makes it clear that the legality of the scheme does not depend, as Prof. Mathews says, on the results or probable result of the implementation of its aim, but upon the nature of the aim itself; that is to say, upon the manner in which a change is to be brought about.</block>

<p>Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A scheme falls within the definition only if it aims at bringing about a change by the promotion of disturbance or disorder, or by unlawful acts or omissions or the threat of them, or if it aims at the encouragement of feelings of hostility between the European and the non-European races. Now (says Judge Broome), by omitting all reference to the portions of the definition which I have underlined &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the last part of what I have read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Prof. Mathews makes the legislation appear to be much more objectionable than it really is, thereby strengthening his own argument. That a professor of law should seek to strengthen a political argument by misstating the terms of a statute is surprising. An advocate who sought to strengthen his argument in court by such a misstatement would get short shrift from the Bench.</block>

<p>Sir, this is the man who is now attacking the University of Durban-Westville on an absolutely unfounded basis. I ask, why&#x003F; When I said some years ago that there was a conspiracy involving certain pressmen, certain university people and&#x2014;I regretted then and still regret to say&#x2014;certain church people in South Africa to subvert the proper constitutional system of government and the way of life in South Africa, I was absolutely hounded down. I repeat it here tonight, and I say it is the most serious matter. What are they trying to do&#x003F; They are trying to incite the Indians against the Whites by attacking this university.

<p>Sir, I just want to refer to one other point. The hon. member for Koedoespoort referred to the Indian market in Durban which was destroyed by fire towards the middle of March. Do you know, Sir, I waited a few weeks to see what the Durban City Council was going to do. It did absolutely nothing. In fact, it did less then nothing&#x2014;it accepted a formal decision to do nothing. [Interjections.] I have here the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 30th March, 1973, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Final &#x201C;No&#x201D; to market&#x2014;Durban&#x2019;s world famous Indian market is not to be replaced and the fire-scarred rains of the old building will soon disappear under the bulldozer&#x2019;s blades. The city council&#x2019;s Policy and Finance Committee decided not to re-establish the market. This decision was taken yesterday.</block>

<p><span class="col_8011-8012" refersTo="page_1073"/>&#x2020;When I saw that, I immediately asked the Mayor of Durban to come to see me here in Cape Town to find out what was going on. He came here with certain of his councillors and officials, and I was told in no uncertain terms that the city council was not going to do anything about the matter. They were not going to rebuild anything. One has to know Durban and Natal to know what this market means to the Indian community and to Natal. For 63 years this market has been a landmark. 5 000 to 6 000 people were directly dependent on this market for a living. Apart from that, thousands upon thousands of Whites, Bantu, Indians and Coloureds have done their shopping there day by day. Hon. members will know that this is so. Here this market burns down; there is calamity overnight, and the Durban City Council says: &#x201C;We wash our hands of it. We will not touch it.&#x201D; Sir, do you know what the Durban City Council did a couple of years ago when there was a flood in Port Elizabeth&#x003F; They voted R50 000 immediately as a relief measure. And yet, when the Indian community&#x2019;s immediate interests were involved, they said: &#x201C;It is no concern of ours.&#x201D; Well, Sir, we did some straight talking and as a result the Durban City Council eventually agreed that they would cooperate to put something in its place. I took the initiative and set up a small representative committee to study the position and to advise us how to go about it both immediately and in the long run. The City Council told us then that they could find the money; they would lend money to put up temporary facilities, as I thought, on the market site. Eventually they agreed that these temporary facilities should be erected there, but only after a lot of objections. Then they came back and said that they would not put up the money; they could not find the money. I then went to the hon. the Minister of Finance, and immediately I was given permission to say that the Government would put up to R100 000 for this project. As a result I was able to say: &#x201C;Let us start this immediately.&#x201D; R100 000 was granted, Mr. Chairman, with no strings attached. Again, after a few weeks during which nothing seemed to be happening, the mayor, with a deputation of his people, came to see me here. I expressed my grave concern that nothing was happening. Then all sorts of practical issues were raised. There was the question of the competence of the Durban City Council to do this, the question of compliance with medical requirements, and the question of the dangers resulting from the operation of the market&#x2014;the police had been unhappy about the area there when the market was in operation. All these things could have been dealt with administratively quite easily, and I pointed this out. So, then, again it was decided that the Durban City Council would go ahead and that they would put up temporary facilities. But, Sir, this has not yet started because the Durban City Council now say that they insist that the Government guarantees in writing that this market will only stand for three years; it must be pulled down after three years. Now, Sir, what has the Durban City Council done&#x003F; Let us be quite fair.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not at the moment. They have built a wall to separate those stalls, about 40 or 50 of them, which were undamaged or relatively undamaged, and those are being used by produce and meat dealers. Another 40 stalls have been found in Chatsworth, and we are anxious that they should be used as well. But that still leaves 150 to 160 stalls which are desperately needed by these traders to get going. The money is there; everything is there, but the willingness and the co-operation on the part of the Durban City Council to get moving is lacking, because they say we have got to give them an undertaking that that temporary structure will be there for only three years. Those are the facts, Sir; it is all here. I do not want to take up more of the time of the House. I do, however, want to say this tonight: Whatever legal powers we have and whatever authority we can bring to bear, I want to assure this House and the Indian community, as well as the public&#x2014;because the public in Durban want this market re-established, particularly as a humanitarian act&#x2014;that we, this Government, will not shirk our duty. That temporary structure is going to go up there by hook or by crook and it is going to happen very soon. I would like to leave it at that.</p>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, once again we are discussing one of the departments dealing with one of the peoples of Southern Africa, one of the non-White peoples. The National Party firmly believes in separate development and rejects the idea of integration. Equally important, however, is the fact that the <span class="col_8013-8014" refersTo="page_1074"/>National Government is serious and honest in its intentions with regard to every population group in South Africa, non-White or White. Surely this is the most important aspect. The situation in South Africa, as is probably the case in all countries in the world, is still far from the ideal, but something that is very certain, is that a considerable amount has already been done and that considerable progress has already been made. Not only has considerable progress been made; indeed, through this Government much progress has been made in the development of the social, economic and political participation of every population group in the Southern African context. Therefore it is very clear that there is much progress.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, the United Party continually makes a political playball out of not only the Indian community, but also the non-White communities. In the South African context this is something we can no longer afford, because there is a tremendous amount of goodwill that must be built up in Southern Africa. Not only in South Africa, and not only in Africa, but in the whole world, this conflagration is something that is rather explosive and I would appeal to the Opposition to stop using the Indian community or any other community purely as a political playball. Responsible leaders of the Indian community are appreciative of the positive work that has been done and is being done by the Government for the development of the Indian community. To an increasing extent the attitude of the Indian community towards the Government has changed and is changing from one of distrust to one of trust. But there is also an increasing distrust by the Indian community in the lip-service being paid by the Opposition. That can be seen by what the hon. the Minister has just referred to, namely the lack of any positive contribution to their development by the Durban City Council, for example, and by the way in which the Natal Provincial Council has been dragging its feet in the matter of the political development of these people at the local level.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein asked the Minister a question about the political aspirations of the Indian community. He wanted to know what was being offered to them. Sir, he should know that of all the Indian communities on the whole of the African continent, the Indian community in South Africa is most appreciative, has the least to fear for its political future, and feels the most secure as far as its economic and social security is concerned. The Indian community, unlike the hon. member for Turffontein, is not nearly as worried about its political development as is the case elsewhere on the African continent. In this respect I feel it is necessary to comment on a remark read by the brother of Mr. Rajab from a speech which he was supposed to hold, but could not, due to illness. He said that the Whites should be prepared to share political power. This is the type of speech one becomes accustomed to from the leaders of the Transkei KwaZulu and other Bantu areas, and it almost appears as though they are being led into this sort of attitude by the Opposition Press. But what Mr. Rajab appreciates, and should appreciate, is that if the principle of the Whites sharing political power with non-Whites within a single political context should be accepted, there is no guarantee that the same fate will not befall the Indian community of South Africa that has befallen the Indian communities of Uganda, of Tanzania and of other countries in Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I take that remark from whence it comes. There is still a tremendous amount that requires to be done but, as I have already said, the progress has been phenomenal. Mr. Chairman, as far as housing for the Indian community is concerned, it is true that in spite of what has been done there is still a tremendous housing shortage, but I am confident that many tens of thousands of Indians who have been provided with housing at a reasonable cost are appreciative of the fact that they have at last been released from the savage grip of exploitation, in many instances by unscrupulous Indians themselves, and once again in this field there has been tremendous progress.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one further aspect which I feel I would like to raise under this Vote. I feel that the time has arrived for serious consideration to be given to the installation of a full-time F.M. radio service for the Indian community. In the same way as radio services have been provided for the various Bantu communities of Southern Africa, so I feel that a full-time F.M. radio service should be made available, especially in Natal, to the Indian community. I feel that the short time of two hours&#x2014;one hour on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays&#x2014; which is made available to them is not nearly sufficient for this community who have done a tremendous amount to develop themselves and, for that matter, to contribute to the progress not only of their own community but to the progress of the whole of South Africa. It is in this spirit of co-operation but at the same time in a spirit of separate development that progress can be made. Mr. Chairman, I would like to know from the hon. member for Durban Central and other hon. members of the Opposition exactly what members of the United Party have done in relation to the replacement of the Indian market which was ravaged by fire recently. I feel that there has been tremendous progress, and this Government primarily has been responsible for the tremendous development that has taken place and that will continue to take place in future.</p>

<p>This from a Minister of a Government which in respect of almost every town in the Transvaal has driven the Indian community to a place in the veld 10 miles out of the town. This from the leader of the party in Natal whose member for Klip River has just spoken and who did his utmost to see that the Indian community in Grey Street did not retain that area. [Interjections.] This from the leader of the party in Natal whose member for Newcastle did his utmost to get all the Indians out of Newcastle and into a place outside the town; this from the leader of the third member of the Nationalist Party we have in Natal, the hon. member for Vryheid, who represents an area where not a single Indian can go in without a permit. Sir, to listen to this sort of thing from a gentleman whose leader and whose party stand for that, for the removal of every existing economic right the Indian people have had for the last 50 years, and for the crippling of them in the economic field at every opportunity is, as I say, the most sickening thing I have heard for years.</p>

<p>Now, what was the position in regard to the Indian Market in Durban&#x003F; The attitude of the Durban City Council, which is not a United Party body, but which nevertheless deserves a hearing, was based on two things, firstly the strong opposition by the S.A. Police to its being re-established in that place &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; and secondly, because there are plans for a ring-road to go through that area. [Interjections.] But let us forget for a moment about the Indian Market, which is a very small trading centre.</p>

<p>Let us deal with the Grey Street complex which is the main economic powerhouse of the Indian people of Natal. Until last year, year after year, those people did not know where they stood, and not because of the Durban City Council. The Durban City Council pleaded year after year for those people in Grey Street to be given their permanence. Those people did not know where they stood because of the pressure of the Nationalist Party in Natal who were against it.</p>

<p>As I have said, we listened to this hon. Minister for 1&#x00BC; hours. What did he say on the main issue of the day, namely the philosophy of the Government in regard to the Indian people&#x003F; Absolutely nothing, Sir. We had a series of platitudes from the hon. gentleman about the Indian people being able to aspire to great heights, and there being no impediment placed on their advancement. Sir, I say to him again: Where do they fit into the philosophy of separate development&#x003F; They may never have any representation in the sovereign body which governs this country. They are to remain for all time part of White South Africa. There is a limit on the development of their Indian Council.</p>

<p>There is a limit on the development of their Indian Council. Where then do they fit into the philosophy of separate development&#x003F; Or is it the intention of the hon. the Minister to develop a homeland for the Indian people&#x003F; This is the crux of the matter, Sir, because we all know&#x2014;we have heard it so many times&#x2014;that in respect the Bantu people their rights in the White areas are limited because the sky is the limit in their homelands. There is no ceiling on their development in the homelands but there is every limitation on their development in the White areas. Now, the Indians do not have a homeland, or have they&#x003F; How then does the philosophy that they can have everything in their area that we have in ours apply to the Indian people&#x003F; This is the key to politics today. We have given our standpoints, chapter and verse over the last three years. It is time that the Government who has been in power for 25 years gave us just one little chink of light as to its policy in this regard.</p>

<p>We come to the Indian Council. Numbers of us on this side last year and the year before gave chapter and verse as to the powers we would give to that council, as to the direction we believe it should take. The hon. the Minister has been in office for nearly a year, the department has been in existence for nearly 11 years and the Government has been in power for 25 years, but what did we get today&#x003F; Platitudes that he is going to consult the Indian Council. When I first stood up I wondered, but I realized after all: Frankie Waring had <span class="col_8019-8020" refersTo="page_1077"/>something after all. [Interjections.] What have we been told about the progress that has been made for the voters&#x2019; roll, about the qualifications voters will have to have, about the type of constituencies that they will have, about the degree of an elected element that the Indian Council will have, about the executive powers that the Indian Council will have&#x003F; We can only speak for ten minutes, but the hon. the Minister talked for an hour and a quarter, but we are no further forward than when we started.</p>

<p>Let us come to the Durban-Westville University. I had thought when I was elsewhere in another place that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Achilles heel was the enormous chip that he carried on his shoulder of his experiences in academic spheres elsewhere. I had occasion to say elsewhere that it was the bore of the year to listen to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s troubles when he was in the academic sphere. We face precisely the same situation tonight. We are not the least concerned with or interested in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s troubles of the past in regard to his academic troubles.</p>

<p>They had to obtain permission to be there.

Of course, the worst of the lot is the registrar, Mr. Heystek, as anybody who has the slightest acquaintance with party politics in Natal will tell you. The trouble is that the academic staff and the Senate, which is appointed from universities outside of the University of Durban-Westville, and the governing authority until now, have been hand-picked. The hon. the Minister has said that he has never asked the principal of the university whether he is a member of the Broederbond. I suppose he was afraid of the answer, because these things are widely known throughout the province. Half of the animosity which surrounds that university &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and which has developed in the sphere of that university is that the teaching staff to a large extent and the governing council have been drawn from people who have a known history of antipathy towards the Indian people. That is why. The Indians are a sensible people and they are aware of this and consequently there has developed this immense annoyance with what has been going on at that university. Of course, the crowning glory and indeed one of the major psychological mistakes of the era, with great respect, was the appointment of a Nationalist Cabinet Minister as chancellor of the Indian University.

<p>The hon. member said that he took it amiss of the Durban City Council for not having taken steps in this regard. The two hon. members therefore differ about this matter.</p>

<p>In the discussion of this Vote in recent years the Opposition has regularly criticized primary and secondary education. Accommodation, &#x201C;shift&#x201D; classes, standards in education and poor examination results and achievements were the issues raised. So far in this debate, we have heard very little about those things. I think that that constitutes a tacit admission on the part of the Opposition that good progress has been made in the field of education, particularly on the primary and secondary levels. On all levels in education the progress made was simply phenomenal after the taking over of Indian education by the Department of Indian Affairs on 1st April, 1966, in Natal, and on 1st April, 1967, in the Transvaal. One calls to mind the opposition we had in this House on the part of the Opposition and the predictions which were made at that time. One recalls unwillingly the prophets of doom who said that the standards would drop, that the examination results would be poor, and so on. But none of those predictions came true. On the contrary, the growth of education and the tremendous increase in numbers in all sections and the improvement as far as accommodation and other facilities are concerned, speak volumes. In addition, the overall standard of work and examination achievements has improved. In some cases the previous achievements and the previous standards have at least been maintained. All this is clear from the illuminating report of the Department of Indian Affairs.</p>

<p>I should like to express my thanks and appreciation for this illuminating and comprehensive report which reflects the achievements of the department in all its aspects. I want to express thanks and appreciation to the Secretary and his entire staff because they set about their task with great dedication and responsibility. I should like to congratulate them on this report. I want to express my sincere congratulations to the section of the Department of Education in particular.</p>

<p>This evening the hon. the Minister also referred to education and the extent to which progress has been made in this regard. Last year I pointed out to hon. members that 99% of Indian children between six and 13 years of age had attended or were still attending school. All of them enjoy the benefits of general education. There has been agitation or appeals for compulsory education from various quarters. This evening we heard from the Minister that compulsory education will come into operation now in any event. The Indian Council is grateful for this step taken by the Government and a member of the executive council of the South African Indian Council, Dr. M. D. Dadoo, said <i>inter alia,</i> that they are aware of the difficulties involved in making education compulsory. The first stage starts in class one in the junior primary school and in future it will be moved forward annually step by step. This means that school attendance will be compulsory for every Indian child in the country until he or she attains the age of 15 years.</p>

<p>In 1972, 175 742 Indian children were already attending school. Measured against the 1970 census, the school-going Indian youth represents 28,8% of the Indian population. This does not include the enrolment at the M. L. Sultan Technical College. This is really a tremendous achievement. One would like to express sincere gratitude and appreciation towards the department entrusted with Indian education.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to make a few remarks in regard to the application of differentiated education in the Indian high schools. It is striking how the Indian Education division, under the leadership of a dynamic director who has at his disposal an enthusiastic and energetic team of high officials, reacts like a barometer to modern education methods and to new scientifically-grounded systems in education. I want to refer to the approach of the Indian Education division to and the introduction of the new system of differentiated education which will form the basis of all education in all schools in South Africa, White as well as non-White. On the 22nd, the 24th May, 1972, the Indian Education division organized a training course at the University of Durban-Westville, for principals, deputy principals and vice principals of all <span class="col_8023-8024" refersTo="page_1079"/>high schools falling under the division. Here they were informed about the whole system of differentiated education and how it would be introduced in the high schools. The information was extremely valuable and in <i>Fiat Lux,</i> the monthly publication of June, 1972, this conference was referred to <i>inter alia</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The conference was an historical event for Indian educators because this was the first time ever that such opportunity was made available to them. It is confidently anticipated that the results will prove beneficial to the delegates themselves, resulting ultimately in the enhancement and progress in the quality of education for Indians in South Africa.</block>

<p>So the heads of that division proceeded with their task and invited, <i>inter alia,</i> Professor Thom, who is a very well known educationist, to address the South African Indian Teachers&#x2019; Association. Professor Thom also explained the matter there and <i>inter alia</i> added this remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Parents have an important role to play. They should be thoroughly conversant with the aspirations and abilities of their offspring in order to give guidance and recommend subject and course preferences realistically.</block>

<p>The role played by the parents in regard to education, which the Indian parent will also have to play in regard to his child&#x2019;s choice of direction, was emphasized. Subsequently, in two editions of <i>Fiat Lux,</i> much prominence was given to the whole system of Indian education so that teachers and everyone who read it could see what the direction was in regard to differentiated education. The South African Indian Council was also fully informed and they too gave their blessing in this regard. In <i>Fiat Lux</i> of November 1972 the following was reported&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After discussing the matter fully, the Council decided to lend its full support to this move.</block>

<p>I stress this point, because it has also been mentioned in other quarters, by other bodies and people who are perhaps not so qualified to pass judgment on education as such, that this system of differentiated education was another system of indoctrination. After they had been informed, however, the Indian Council gave their blessing to this sytem. In 1975, matriculants will have to write their examinations in accordance with this system. The department has already made such progress that they have already approved 166 different courses in high schools for Std. 8. It depends on the school whether it is capable of offering various courses because the importance of differentiated education is that there are so many possible courses offered under the same roof, so that pupils may study in various directions. The department is already fully under way. Of the departments dealing with non-White education, this department is at present the only one which falls in with the system of differentiated education. I think that we can congratulate this department on the undertaking which it has tackled at this early stage. At present there are only two other departments which are at this moment applying differentiated education, namely the Transvaal Education Department and the Natal Education Department.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to associate myself with the hon. member for Koedoespoort in his complimentary remarks regarding the production of the report. I believe that the staff has done a very good job. It is a clear, comprehensive report. One of its great advantages is that it has been issued timeously so that it gives us a chance to study the report before the Vote is discussed. I think that this is an example which could well be followed by other departments. It would be churlish of me if I were not to join in the general felicitations which have been showered upon the hon. the Minister this evening. Until the hon. member for Rissik spoke&#x2014;I am sorry that he is not here to share this unique experience with me&#x2014;I felt that I enjoyed a unique situation in this House because the hon. member for Rissik and I have shared in representing the hon. the Minister as his member of Parliament. I have here the voters&#x2019; roll of the Berea constituency. Due to the laxity of the Department of the Interior we only received ours towards the end of January but it is the roll which closed on the 31st October, 1972. I see here the entry: <span class="col_8025-8026" refersTo="page_1080"/>&#x201C;Horwood, Owen Pieter Faure: 113 Chartwell, 37 Ridge Road, Durban; Cabinet Minister.&#x201D; It would seem that I have had to relinquish the distinction of having a Cabinet Minister in my constituency. One thing I do believe, and I believe it sincerely, is that in the three elections I have fought in Berea, the hon. the Minister has voted for me because I would say he is far too perceptive and too astute to have voted for a Progressive.

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I leave the matter there. I want to refer to the University of Durban-Westville. A great deal has been said about the University of Durban-Westville and the important part it plays in the life of the community of the Indian people of South Africa. It represents, as far as I can work out, 0,3% of the Indian population in the Republic, having an enrolment of approximately 2 000 members.</p>

<p>I want to deal with certain matters which affect the other 99,7% of the Indian population, matters which arise in the report of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department and matters which I believe require not only the attention, which I know they will get, but also the opinion of the hon. the Minister. First of all I want to refer the hon. the Minister to page 47 of the report where it deals with the applications for naturalization. The report briefly states that there were 159 applications of which 153 were forwarded to the Department of the Interior. It subsequently advises that 131 of these applications for naturalization of stateless Indians were approved and 26 were refused. The hon. the Minister will remember, I am sure, that in November last year, I raised two cases with regard to the application for naturalization of stateless Indians. We had a discussion in his office in Pretoria. It is not my intention to mention names across the floor of the House, but I am sure the hon. the Minister will recollect the two cases in question. My question to the hon. the Minister is: Can he tell me what is the apparent cause of the delay in the decision regarding these applications for naturalization&#x003F; Is it a delay caused by the Department of the Interior, or can the delay be attributed to his own department&#x003F; Some of these applications have been pending for a long time, and I feel that the suspense and frustration which accompany the delay should be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>On page 50 of the report we read that a departmental survey on drugs and alcoholism has taken place. I am quoting very briefly. As far as alcoholism is concerned, the comment was that &#x201C;it is no mean measure, especially among the male Indians&#x201D;. Then we read that dagga is the most commonly used of the drugs. We read further that peddling of drugs is claiming victims among the Indian populations. This problem is not confined to any particular racial group. We know that. I looked through the Estimates of the Revenue and Loan Accounts, and I have not been able to arrive at any specific indication as to what his department intends doing with regard to the rehabilitation of these people, to give them as much assistance as possible, and to plan ahead to see that there will be adequate rehabilitation facilities to meet this growing problem. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to give me some information in that respect.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the question of telephones. I want to refer to page 44 of the report, which deals with telephone services. The report reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Although some progress has been made with the provision of telephone services in Indian areas, an acute shortage of telephones is still being experienced in some areas. The position is, in fact, critical in those areas where there are hardly any telephone services at all, and this causes dissatisfaction among residents who previously enjoyed the facility. The department is in constant touch with the postal authorities in regard to this matter.</block>

<p>I want to quote a few figures to the hon. the Minister, because the picture is a very depressing one. The figures, which I received today&#x2014;official figures&#x2014;represent the position for the last 5&#x00BD; years. What do we find&#x003F; We find that out of a total number of applications of 1 386 there have been only 295 installations. This means that 14% of applicants eventually received telephones. But what is particularly disturbing, I think <span class="col_8027-8028" refersTo="page_1081"/>&#x2014;the number which I have quoted, includes private and business applications&#x2014;is the fact that of the 252 business applications during the 5&#x00BD; years, there have been a mere 110 installations, which represents 43% of the total number of applications. The hon. the Minister spoke with a certain degree of pride about the acumen and the ability of the Indian traders in their business endeavour; but I want to ask him if he could give us an easy way to advise the other 57% of the Indians in business who cannot obtain telephones how to operate a business successfully without a telephone. Not only is the position critical, as is stated in the report, but it is deteriorating. We find that in 1972, the latest full year, there were 266 applications and 21 installations of telephones&#x2014;a mere 8%. Of the 35 business telephone applications, there have been 12 installations. Sir. I realize that this matter does not fall completely within the ambit of the Minister&#x2019;s activities, but I believe that he has a very important part to play in establishing a priority for a need which is obvious to anybody who examines the position.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, in the short time which is still at my disposal, I wish to raise certain other matters and to ask the hon. the Minister what his attitude would be in regard to certain of the day-to-day matters which seem to be worrying the Indian community. We on this side of the House have our means of consultation, and we have discussed the affairs of the Indians with all strata, from the semi-skilled and skilled to the highly qualified professional people, and what do we find&#x003F; As far as the semi-skilled and the skilled workers are concerned&#x2014;and let us admit that they constitute by far the great majority of the Indian population&#x2014;many of them, I believe, do not appear at this stage to be politically militant, but they have two fundamental grouses. The first one is the question of housing. They want houses. The hon. the Minister has referred to the development of Chatsworth, but I want to tell him that there are many residents at Chatsworth who are totally dissatisfied with the type of housing which is being provided for the Indian people because in many instances it cuts right across their way of life.

<p><span class="col_8029-8030" refersTo="page_1082"/>Sir, the hon. member for Zululand is very worried about the constitutional future of the Indians in South Africa. We have made it very clear over the years that we foresee a constitutional evolution. The Prime Minister has indicated repeatedly that the method of liaison with the Government will not be prescribed to the Government, but that it will be adapted over the years by way of negotiation. But, Sir, what does that party offer the Indians&#x003F; They offer what I could only describe as &#x201C;a glorified debating society on a federal basis&#x201D;; they suggest that our Indian policy offers the Indian&#x2019;s absolutely nothing in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, today hon. members opposite have proved here very clearly, by talking about all kinds of things except the real interests of the Indians, that politically they are poor in ideas and policy in regard to this important matter. In the middle of my speech the hon. member for Zululand came along and asked me about job reservation in Newcastle, a matter concerned with the Bantu. He dragged this into debate on Indian affairs. Where have you ever heard anything as ridiculous in your life&#x003F; The fact remains that the hon. members are terribly obsessed with job reservation in Newcastle, which is a border area in any event, where the Government may issue permits as it deems fit. But they sent Senator Crook there, and having put on an overall, a pair of heavy boots, a crash helmet on his head and a pair of dark glasses as well, he proceeded to walk around there trying to catch the people. Then they went further by trying to give out to the people that they were concerned about job reservation. But they did not tell the voters of Newcastle that they wanted to abolish job reservation. That is the kind of politics practised by that party. But here, with great to-do, they make themselves out to be the great apologists for the Indians. Today that party has been shown up well and truly. But let us please guide this debate, at this late stage, to a higher level. The fact remains that this Government has definitely created new horizons for the Indians in various spheres, and one of the most important aspects is the educational sphere. I have the privilege of having the School of Industries for Indians in Newcastle.</p>

<p>I am very sorry. The hon. member poses such ridiculous questions and I have very little time. This institution is a major step forward in the development of Indian education in general. I should like to point out that in a report issued in connection with this school, the following was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sociology of education is becoming progressively a more and more important field of study. Sociology of education deals with the manner in which modern society copes with the education of the child and the extent to which it fails to achieve that aim &#x2026; This will especially be the situation in an industrial school where the child, although inherently possessing the same capabilities for education as those in normal schools, will adversely be affected by the erosion of negative social and environmental influences.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Now I want to pay tribute this evening to the fine work done at that fine school in Newcastle under the able guidance of Mr. Louis Bester and his staff, people who are dedicated and who, in the short space of two years, have already performed a really tremendous task. Here we are dealing with people who are socially disturbed, people who have been uprooted from their families, and after this short period, we already find that people have been sent out into society, people who are capable of making a fruitful and major contribution to the productivity of the community. Today I want to point out to you that those who are sent there are people who have had serious problems. I should like to point out that of the 78 pupils enrolled there, 23 were there for theft, 14 for truancy, and for &#x201C;uncontrollability, 13 pupils; parental neglect, 9 pupils: aggressiveness, 6 pupils; vagrant life, 6 pupils; dagga, gambling and delinquency, 4; alcohol, 4; undesirable company, 2 pupils, and then one pupil each for begging, drugs and criminal tendencies&#x201D;.

<p>We are dealing here with very difficult material, and that is why I want to pay a special tribute this evening to the outstanding work which is being done there. These people are not only taught a trade or a profession, but a tremendous amount of time is spent on character training, in respect of which a great deal of success is being achieved.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say something in reply to the point made by the hon. member for Durban Central in regard to the registrar of the University of Durban-Westville. The fact is that the registrar of this university is not a public servant. Consequently the Public Service Act is not applicable to him.</p>

<p>He holds a public office.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he holds a public office and not an office in the Public Service. There is quite a difference. He was appointed to a public office in terms of the Extension of University Education Act, 1959. The regulations to which the hon. member referred were made in terms of this Act and the conditions of service applicable to this office are those applicable to the holders of public offices. Those regulations do not prohibit participation in party politics. I am sorry that it was deemed necessary to make this personal attack on the registrar of the University of Durban-Westville, who as far as I know is doing excellent work there.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am sorry that the hon. member for Zululand is not here at the moment.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In that case I shall continue by referring to the points raised by the hon. member for Berea. I am sorry to have to disappoint the hon. member, but I honestly cannot recall ever having voted for him. [Interjections.] Anyway, we shall leave that at that.</p>

<p>I should like to say that as far as the drug issue is concerned, we are dealing with a very important issue. I am glad the hon. member raised it. At the moment the department&#x2019;s welfare division, which is a professional welfare division, is handling those cases. However, the establishment of a retreat for alcoholics and for drug addicts was approved a little while ago and we are hoping that this project will be established as soon as possible. We are very anxious to do this.</p>

<p>I quite agree with the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks about telephones. This is an unfortunate position. We are doing our very best in the department and recently, in particular, we have endeavoured to bring about an improvement. What we have said in the report is perfectly true. We are in touch with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and we are hoping very much that when it comes to the next occasion, we shall be able to present a much better report in this respect. I take the point made by the hon. member and I agree with what he has said.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned applications for naturalization and certain delays which appeared to occur. It is true that some of these applications do take a little while to be dealt with. We have to refer them to another department and we find that in a number of cases&#x2014;not all of them&#x2014;the information given to us is either not correct or is not sufficiently complete to allow the proper investigations to be done and as such applications have to be referred back, a delay is caused. The hon. member did refer two cases to me. He is perfectly correct; those cases did take a little time to go into and I am sorry that he has not yet been informed of the outcome. I shall inform him of the outcome immediately, outside, but I must say that it should have been brought to his attention earlier on. I apologize for any delay which there may have been. However, those cases have been dealt with.</p>

<p>I think I have dealt with most of the main points which the hon. member raised, apart from housing. It is perfectly true that one can find Indians who are dissatisfied with the housing position and some of them who are desperately wanting housing. I know that myself, but I want to say that when you look at the position in regard to the tremendous demand from a rapidly <span class="col_8033-8034" refersTo="page_1084"/>increasing population, not only of the Indians themselves, but of all the sections of the population, and you see what is in fact being provided in the line of housing, and when you take into account that a great part of that is being achieved with public funds, the hon. member will tend to agree with me that a very fine effort is indeed being made. I am very much aware of the problems of the Indians here and I can assure the hon. member that my department and I are giving every attention to this matter, because it is an important matter. I think that those were the main points which were raised by the hon. member for Berea.</p>

<p>I cannot for the life of me understand why the hon. member for Zululand should have been so angry. I surely did not say anything to him that should have caused him to lose his temper, but he certainly was in a rage when he got up. That hon. member, as he said, was in the Other Place and we served together there for a short time. Now we confront each other again in this House. It is a fact that on almost every occasion when the hon. member has spoken where I have been involved, he has seen fit to attack me personally for some reason or other. I think I can say that I have on no occasion ever attacked him personally. He can look it up in Hansard and he will see that that is the case. That is just a matter between us, and I do not see any point in attacking the hon. member personally. I shall rather try to stick to the issues, but if the hon. member wishes to be personal, it is his matter. I am not going to adopt the same kind of tactics, but I do want to say with all respect that the hon. member made an irresponsible speech earlier this evening. I am sorry to have to say that. I was at pains to reply and to state how I saw our policy of separate development for the Indians in the context of our policy for this multinational country as a whole. I think every hon. member who listened to me must agree that I really did deal with that matter. I dealt with it very clearly, although briefly. I explained exactly how this policy aimed at recognizing the separate identities of the several different national groups and did not depend, for its practical implementation, on tying a particular group to a homeland or a concrete geographical area.</p>

<p>What does &#x201C;as of right&#x201D; mean&#x003F; There was an agitation which I referred to and which I have not exaggerated at all. It was fanned by those newspapers and unfortunately also by certain members of the Indian Congress and also by a few people in the university. The situation could in fact have been a very difficult one. I believe it was magnificently handled by the university and there was no trouble whatsoever. It was a most dignified thing. The dissident student group said they were going to have a huge demonstration. They were going to have a sit-in involving 1 000 students the morning the Prime Minister opened the university officially. I was informed that 50 turned up and that within five minutes they disappeared and the whole thing collapsed. This was the sort of nonsense we were expected to put up with. The hon. member for Zululand insisted that the appointments there were political appointments. He spoke in the most derogatory way of the principal whether he was a member of the Broederbond. What has it got to do with me&#x003F; What has the Broederbond ever done to this hon. member&#x003F; Why should the newspapers when an appointment is made absolutely on merit, following all the statutes and regulations of the university and according to well-established Western university practice, which has been followed right through, attack that appointment immediately in this disgraceful manner&#x003F; Why is it said that this is a &#x201C;Nat-university&#x201D; and that it is a Broederbond take-over and that it is discrimination and victimization&#x003F; I want to tell the hon. member for Zululand tonight that not more than 40% of the staff of that university are Afrikaans-speaking.</p>

I also want to thank the hon. member for Koedoespoort for his very constructive remarks about differentiated education. I believe that the information he gave us was very valuable. I also want to thank my hon. friends from Natal who are sitting behind me for their fine contribution. They made fighting speeches which seemed to have got under the skin of a few members opposite. Finally I should very much like to thank the Secretary for my department, his staff and my Ministry most sincerely for the work they are doing.

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Certainly, if the hon. member for Zululand wants me to go further, I will do so. My colleague, the hon. the Minister of the Interior, introduced a Bill to amend the Aliens Control Act and that Bill was passed recently. According to that legislation I have been given certain powers which I will use. We are at this moment framing the policy accordingly. This was done only recently. I would like to remind the hon. member that at the moment, as I have said, any Indian who wishes to travel from one province to another&#x2014;and they mainly travel from Natal to Transvaal and back&#x2014;has to have a permit. Last year we had to issue approximately 25 000 permits. You can imagine the administrative work involved. What we have in mind is to allow the Indians, who normally travel this way, to travel just as anybody else does. In other words, we trust them&#x2014;as we do&#x2014;to behave responsibly. We will apply this and test it and, if we find that it is abused by certain people, we will know how to deal with them. In practice, therefore, there is going to be a very substantial relaxation. I can assure the hon. member of that.</p>

<p>I would like to conclude. At one stage during the debate we were talking about students, universities, etc. and we became a little serious. You know, Sir, I live in Rondebosch and in the morning as my driver enters the road, he has to make his way into a stream of traffic.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half hour&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes I have at my disposal I should like to take the opportunity of welcoming the hon. the Minister to his new post as Minister of Tourism. I wish him a fruitful term of office. I trust that he will bring new vitality to this particular portfolio. We hope to goodness that he will do better than his predecessor. In the few minutes at my disposal I think it would be a good thing if I dealt with the Vote Tourism very briefly. There is a slight and almost insignificant increase in the Vote. It has now risen to the colossal amount of R2&#x00BD; million in total. There is an increase of R357 000 as far as Satour is concerned, for which we are grateful. Then there are no fewer than five instances where we have decreases. I do not want to question at this stage the reasons for these decreases. I should like the hon. the Minister to pay attention to what I am saying. On salaries, wages and allowances there is a decrease of R31 000. I was wondering how under the existing circumstances with an increased Budget there could have been a decrease in respect of salaries, wages and allowances. In the particular circumstances that is all I have to say in regard to the budget. I have already said that we are grateful that an additional amount is set aside for Satour.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister during his term of office as head of tourism made a couple of statements. He <i>inter alia</i> made a statement with regard to his visit to Mauritius in connection with Sartoc. The information the hon. the Minister gave was very meagre and I am sure he would like to give us some more information about the establishment of Sartoc as such. There are some questions I should like to put to the hon. the Minister in connection with the rationalization of travel and publicity between the five countries taking part in Sartoc. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether there is a prospect of group tours from participating countries, particularly from Malawi, Mozambique and other Portuguese territories and Swaziland. Will these group tours visit these countries or is it the main object to get group tours from abroad to visit these particular countries&#x003F; Obviously the object is group tourism. My first question dealt with tourism, and group tours between the five countries that are participants in Sartoc. Will the hon. the Minister indicate how he sees the position and whether it would be a feasible idea&#x003F; As far as group tours from abroad are concerned, in joint promotion the emphasis must surely be on group tours as such. If this is the case will we not suffer in joint enterprise or would group tours as they come be welcome regardless of composition or colour&#x003F; This is one of the items that is worrying us. I presume that we are playing our part by making a similar sort of contribution that the others are making. I see that a greater amount was voted in the previous year. It has been reduced to R66 000 this year. I presume that the others were not in a position to make up their share of the bigger contribution.</p>

<p>Revenue Vote No. 46.&#x2014;&#x201C;Tourism&#x201D; (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the debate was adjourned on Wednesday, I was on the point of concluding my remarks on Sartoc. I was busy putting a question to the hon. the Minister, which I should like to repeat at this stage in case, in the hurry of the moment, he did not hear it. In spite of our great enterprise as far as Sartoc is concerned, does he not think that we shall suffer by virtue of the fact that the other four partners in Sartoc allow groups of tourists to enter their countries irrespective of composition or colour, whereas we are possibly not following the same sort of policy&#x003F; I should like to hear the hon. the Minister give us a policy statement in this connection; I should like him to tell us what the position is.</p>

<p>To continue from that point onwards, I should like to deal with Satour. In this connection I should like to say that we have nothing but praise for the activities of Satour. They are working on a shoestring budget. I should like to thank the Minister for making it possible for us to see some films this morning which were prepared for Satour. I have a feeling that he laid this on specially, and that he delayed the discussion of this Vote until such time as we could see those films. In this regard I should like to make particular mention of the two <u>film</u>s that were prepared for Satour, namely &#x201C;The Peace Game&#x201D; and &#x201C;On the Third Day&#x201D;. As one who has had to have many films prepared for the wool industry all over the globe, I can only say that these films are of outstanding quality. They have been exceedingly well prepared, with beautiful subject matter. I want to say that they compare very favourably with any films that can be produced anywhere in the world. But they are better by virtue of the fact that we have subject matter that no other country in the world has. By virtue of that fact, obviously, films were exceedingly well prepared. I would venture to say that Mr. John da Silva, who produced, directed and photographed some of these films, deserves very high praise indeed.</p>

<p>As far as the publications of Satour are concerned, I want to say that I have a number of these publications in my possession, and some of them are well worth mentioning. They are printed with an attractive glossy finish and are extremely well presented. I refer particularly to the publication entitled &#x201C;Discover South Africa&#x201D;, which is outstanding. Other publications I should like to mention include &#x201C;Travel Impressions of South Africa&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Travel Companion&#x201D;, which contains packaged information. I have seen no better anywhere. These publications are of outstanding quality.</p>

<p>I now wish to refer to advertising by Satour, and to the information I could glean from the department&#x2019;s report in this connection. I may say that I am sorry that we do riot have a newer report; the latest report deals with the period ending 31st March, 1972, which is almost 15 months ago. We would certainly have liked to have a fresher report. Be that as it may, I want to say that the advertising being done by Satour abroad is well staggered and extremely comprehensive. Again I may say that they are doing this on a very small budget. Their activities are as wide as can be expected, bearing this small budget in mind.</p>

<p>I now come to the Department of Tourism as such. Having praised Satour to such an extent, I am afraid to say that I have gained the impression that the hon. the Minister and his department consider that Satour is an agency to carry all their activities and that that is the be-all and the end-all of the matter.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, it is in this regard that I want to put a few questions to the Minister. I hope he will be able to furnish us with the necessary replies to them. I want to repeat that quite apart from the activities of Satour, not a great deal of work has been done by the Department of Tourism. In this regard I should like to refer briefly to the annual report of the department, where the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the previous annual report mention was made of the fact that the Department&#x2019;s Liaison Officers and their staff carry out surveys of all the tourist attractions and facilities in the Republic on a <span class="col_8043-8044" refersTo="page_1089"/>continuous basis in the course of their normal duties. The basic and most important part of the survey has now, with a few exceptions, virtually been completed. From time to time new tourist attractions and facilities are established, particulars of which are entered on forms by the Liaison Officers and their staff in the course of their normal duties when working through their respective areas.</block>

<p>Sir, I want to say that it is essential for research to be undertaken on an ever wider basis, and I want to suggest that a standing research committee be called into being, a committee comprising members of the advisory committee, of travel agencies, of the hotel industry and other interested bodies, to develop methods to give the tourist industry the necessary forward impetus. When talking about a forward impetus, I want to point out that we are aware of the fact that we are a long way from where we hope to get in regard to tourism. We are certainly not there yet. We are still in the red, as far as tourism is concerned, because South African tourists abroad spend more money than tourists spend in this country. I have already said that I do not expect the Minister to have rectified all these deficiences in the short period he has been in charge of this department, but I do hope that he will be able to do this in the foreseeable future. There are obviously deficiencies in the department which must be rectified. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to what extent he has implemented the recommendations of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council, and when he intends implementing the remaining parts of these recommendations. I quote the following from these recommendations by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been suggested that recommendations 1-12 be considered by the Government, and when and as soon as the Tourism Advisory Committee is established, for this committee to consider recommendations 13-52 and submit them to the Government together with its own comment.</block>

<p>Sir, this advisory committee has been established, and I should be grateful if the hon. the Minister could tell us what number of these many recommendations, from No. 13 to No. 52, have been accepted and when he intends implementing them. I should like to quote a few of the recommendations in regard to local tourism (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(6) That the Department of Tourism approach the national industrial organizations in an attempt to obtain their support for the idea of an improved distribution of the functions of the industry in that some industries close for the three weeks before Christmas and others for the three weeks after Christmas.</li>

</ol>

<p>Sir, this is a very important factor for tourism in this country. The next recommendation reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Department of Tourism, together with the regional committee for the promotion of tourism and other particular organizations continue to compile a country-wide register of private houseowners and farmers who are prepared to hire out accommodation to tourists on a part-time basis and that this register be made available to the tourist industry.</block>

<p>Sir, we know what problems we have in many centres as far as accommodation is concerned, and it is to that end that I should like to have this information from the hon. the Minister. Then paragraph 29 reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, with the expansion of its longdistance passenger train services, the South African Railways, in the first place, consistently takes account of the requirements of the local tourist and the middle and lower income groups.</block>

<p>Then paragraph 30 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the improvement of the quality of touring bus facilities still be left to the transporter himself, but that the department uses its influence with the controlling bodies concerned to improve and alleviate, where possible, all official measures which limit the ability of transporters to improve their facilities, and that the National Transport Commission, in considering road transport applications from tourist transporters, should also consistently emphasize these facilities.</block>

<p>A further recommendation reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8045-8046" refersTo="page_1090"/>That the desirability and possibility be investigated of freely allowing private and unscheduled chartered flights to South Africa, specifically for the transporting of students and other groups whose internal touring arrangements in South Africa exclude them from the benefits of the group tariffs offered by the IATA lines. It is also recommended that this matter be taken further by the proposed Tourist Advisory Committee in co-operation with the official and non-official bodies concerned.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not want to quote any further from this, because it will take up too much of my valuable time. I have put sufficient questions to the Minister about that aspect. We just want to say that we are pleased to see that the Cape Technical College offers diploma courses for tourist guides. Those of us who have often toured abroad and know the tourist guides there, know that they have taken diploma courses and that, as a result of the experience they have had through the years, they are capable of making a tour extremely interesting for the tourist from beginning to end. This is something we miss in this country as far as tourist guides are concerned, because they only tell the tourists those specific things they were told to talk about, and apparently they do not have the general knowledge required to make the tour interesting for tourists. We also notice that the South African Airways have an air hotel plan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The scheme has been described as a major break-through, which will make a big impact on vacation travel in South Africa.</block>

<p>Then they state the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They announced last night an air hotel plan which will mean not only substantial savings for holiday-makers, but will also result in a boom for the tourist industry in Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg. The cut-rate holidays are likely to prove highly popular with the family man and step up tourism to the three cities during the off-season periods, although the special rates will be applicable throughout the year. In some cases people will be able to travel between these cities or from Windhoek to Durban and stay at three-star-rated hotels for a week at a cost equal to the normal return airfare.</block>

<p>Sir, this is a tremendous concession. We all know that it is expensive to travel by air. From here to the Witwatersrand and back, for example, it costs no less than R94.</p>

<p>Sir, I just want to address one final request to the hon. the Minister, i.e. that this dual control over hotels be abolished. I think the time has arrived for the Hotel Board to take over control of hotels, while the Licensing Board should exercise control over liquor so that we may have uniform control over hotels.</p>

<p>Sir, my time has almost expired. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able, during the next session, to surprise us by being in a position not only to announce some fruitful activities on the part of Satour, but also to tell us that his own department has made far more progress and that a substantially larger amount will be voted for this department.</p>

<p>Sir, I think we are slightly surprised at the fact that the hon. member who has just spoken furnished so little criticism with respect to this department. Last year, and on previous occasions, there was an abundance of criticism, but I do not think that criticism was actually based on fact; it was based on the person who occupied the position, i.e. the hon. Frank Waring. Hon. members opposite simply wanted to hit out at him for all they were worth because they did not like the idea of his sitting on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Two or three years ago the hon. member for East London City said that if things continued in this fashion in politics, he would be Minister within ten years. Sir, today is the 25th birthday of this Cabinet, and the hon. member&#x2019;s hopes of becoming Minister are becoming increasingly threadbare. At the same time I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the hon. Owen Horwood on his appointment to this office. I want to express the hope that in the discussion of the Votes which the hon. the Minister is handling, hon. members on the other side of the House will get down to realities to a greater extent and be less personal than in the past. Last Wednesday, with the discussion of the Indian Affairs Vote, there were again such signs, and I want to express the hope that this will stay out of the discussion of the Tourism Vote.</p>

<p>Sir, I do want to refer, in that connection, to a matter which was discussed last <span class="col_8047-8048" refersTo="page_1091"/>Wednesday under Indian Affairs, i.e. the disaster which struck the Durban Indian market. It was amazing for one to have had to listen to how spineless the Durban City Council was in connection with the reconstruction of that market, because apart from the fact that a few thousand people make their living out of that market, I think it is one of the biggest tourist attractions in South Africa. I think the hon. member for Durban Point will agree with me that the Indian market in Durban has grown into one of the biggest tourist attractions in that part of the country. That is why I want to thank the hon. the Minister for what he has managed to do, for the assistance, which he announced in the debate on his Indian Affairs Vote, which will be forthcoming from the Government to restore that Indian market. I want to express the hope that everybody, who is interested in tourism, will assist in restoring this big tourist attraction again.</p>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if one looks at the annual report of the Department of Tourism one is struck, in the first place, by the steady growth in tourism from abroad to this country. All of us believe that this country has tourist attractions matched by very few other countries in the world. But we are situated at a great distance from the majority of countries from which tourists come. Until a number of years ago the greatest number of our foreign tourists came from neighbouring states in Africa, from Rhodesia. Mozambique and earlier from Kenya, the Congo and other areas. But if one now looks at the annual report and sees how that graph is changing, and particularly if one looks at the latest figures that have not yet been presented in this annual report, one sees, on the one hand, the impact of the expansion of our own S.A. Airways and of other airways which bring tourists in great numbers from the rich countries of the world, but recently also from Darts of the New World from which tourists did not come in large numbers previously, because links were not so quick and so direct. It strikes one how great the increase in tourists from the U.S.A. is, from Europe &#x2014;particularly Western Germany&#x2014;and also from Australasia, from Australia and New Zealand. One can imagine that with the expansion of the S.A. Airways to the Far East, and also with a direct link to Argentina, we can also expect a considerable extension in tourist traffic from those countries in the next few years. This is all to the good, because not only do tourists come and spend money here; they also come to observe, and 99% of them go back as silent ambassadors of South Africa. After they have observed here what natural scenery we have and how we are trying to develop and govern this country, they leave with the impression of this country&#x2019;s potential and the tremendous future that awaits us. For that reason I am saying that this development, this increase in the number of tourists from the New World and from Europe, as against those who came only from our neighbouring states in Africa earlier on, is something to be welcomed, and we can indeed regard ourselves as a privileged country, because although we are situated at a great distance from those countries, and although it costs a great deal for tourists to travel here, it is nevertheless a fact that the sojourn of tourists who come here from so far off, and perhaps also visit one or two of our neighbouring states, is considerably longer than the visits to some of the European countries whose tourists position is frequently presented to us as being so much more favourable and better than our own here. If a tourist stays here for 14 days or three weeks, he inevitably spends much more money than he would have spent in a day or two in a country on the Mediterranean. He takes in much more here, and carries away with him many more impressions, because what he observes here, is something real; it is not something that has been created here just to draw tourists It is still South Africa in its true sense. I have calculated that in the past year in 1972, the growth was about 14 to 15%, 74 000 more tourists visited our country than in the previous year, many more than previously coming from the richer countries of the world. But then we must also keep pace with our facilities for tourists, our transport, our hotel accommodation, and the other facilities that tourists want. Because it is a fact that a tourist who is not satisfied, who has complaints after a visit, will not only not return, but he will also dissuade others from coming, and what is more, he will leave here with a poor impression of our country. For that reason all the bodies concerned must cooperate and that is why I want to advocate today a collective attitude for the promotion <span class="col_8049-8050" refersTo="page_1092"/>of tourism here in South Africa. We must indeed become tourism conscious.</p>

<p>With the evolvement of the industry and with the advent of more tourists, all of us in this country, whether we are directly connected with the tourist industry or not, must become tourism conscious. The tourist does not only come into contact with those who look after him, for example those who supply him with hotel accommodation or transport; he also comes into contact with the general public and there he could also gain a poor impression. That is why I am advocating that our local population be made aware of the value of tourists. Although the pilot of an aircraft, whether on local flights or flights abroad, the bus driver transporting tourists and many other people, do not come into direct contact with tourists, they can do a tremendous amount to keep tourists informed, to make them feel at home and to have them like this country. When, on occasion, we have come across members of the general public who are not directly connected with the tourist industry, but who furnish an exceptional contribution towards making tourists feel welcome, have we ever thought of giving them the credit they deserve&#x003F; I want to mention an example. Some time ago I was on an aircraft en route from Johannesburg to Cape Town. It was a connecting flight for a flight that had just come from abroad &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say first of all that I agree with what the hon. member for Stellenbosch has said in regard to the desirability of South Africans becoming more tourism conscious. I think at the same time that what we need in this country is that the Government also should place a higher priority than they have done during the past few years on the development of tourism and I shall have something more to say on that in a moment or two.</p>

<p>Then, I want to add my good wishes to the hon. the Minister on his appointment as Minister to direct this important Department of Tourism. I should like to leave the hon. the Minister in no doubt whatsoever that we on this side of the House regard tourism as an industry with a tremendous future in South Africa. The Reynders Commission&#x2019;s report on exports contains estimates of foreign exchange earnings for which the tourist industry ought to be responsible in future years. The estimates are as follows: R200 million in 1980 and R800 million by the turn of the century. Already the tourist industry is an important invisible exporter and although the figures for 1972 are not yet available, I would estimate that last year the tourist industry could have been responsible for bringing in something like R90 million by way of foreign exchange earnings, in comparison with the total export earnings of the whole country of R2 000 million. It is therefore a considerable earner of foreign exchange. It does not yet rank with the big league of exporters such as the gold industry or diamond industry, but it does rank in the next stratum of importance of export industries, such as copper, wool, sugar and metal ores. Although it is not yet in the big league, the potential is undoubtedly there, and we on this side of the House agree with the emphasis which the Reynders Commission placed on the importance of developing the potential of this industry. However, if the potential is to be developed, it is going to require a major effort by the industry itself and by the Government. It is also going to require co-operation between the Government and the private sectors of the industry, co-operation of a calibre and quality that have been absent for the last few years. As far as the effort by the industry itself is concerned, I should like to mention to the hon. the Minister that there are private sectors in the industry that would be greatly encouraged to put greater effort into attracting tourists to this country if they were to benefit by the export allowance which the hon. the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget speech. He announced that service industries selected by himself and by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, would benefit from the export allowance, and I appeal to the hon. the Minister to use his influence in order to see that private sectors in the tourism industry, those sectors who are responsible for spending money abroad to attract tourists to this country, should be included in the industries qualifying for this allowance.</p>

<p>As far as the Government itself is concerned, I hope that under this new Minister we will see a higher priority and a greater sense of urgency given to the development of the tourism industry. I should like to see a sense of urgency such as has been applied to the Saldanha-Sishen scheme, such as has been applied in the enrichment of uranium and such as has been applied to the development of our armed forces <span class="col_8051-8052" refersTo="page_1093"/>being applied also to the development of such an important industry as the tourism industry.</p>

<p>From my own contacts, I am pleased to say that I have had encouraging reports that the hon. the Minister is tackling this important port-folio with a measure of realism. We on this side of the House will watch his progress, and will give credit where credit is due, but we will also criticize where we think criticism is justified.</p>

<p>I believe that there is a great deel of leeway to be made up as regards co-operation between the Government and the private sectors in the industry. The Riekert Committee which was appointed by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council, and which reported two years ago, has given us clear guide-lines as to how this co-operation between the Government and industry could be established. Its first proposal was that national tourism congresses should be organized as a channel whereby the Government can obtain the advantage of the opinions of the relative private interests concerned with tourism. Those congresses, the committee recommended, should be held yearly at first, and later on be two-yearly. I consider that there has been a very considerable vacuum in the direction and co-ordination of the tourist industry since the department was established more than 10 years ago, for the reason that no congresses which provided platforms for discussion and the exchange of ideas between the various sectors of the industry, have been held. The last one was held by the South African Publicity Association under the auspices of the South African Railways more than 10 years ago, or before this department was established. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor is on record as saying that such congresses are a waste of time. I hope that that is a view which is not shared by this hon. Minister. I certainly agree with the Riekert Committee&#x2019;s recommendation in this respect, and not with that of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor.</p>

<p>The second recommendation which was made by the Riekert Committee was that the board of Satour should be broadened to become an advisory committee on tourism. The Riekert Committee clearly had in mind that this advisory committee should be a statutory body because they suggested that the basis of it should be the board of Satour, which is a statutory body, and that it should be representative of the Government departments and the various sectors in the private industry. What has happened is that a committee has been appointed, a committee that has no statutory standing, consisting of persons&#x2014;some of whom I agree are very able and very well qualified &#x2014;who are chosen by the Minister and not by the private sector and are acting in their personal capacities and not as representatives of the industry. We in Parliament have had no report from this advisory committee, but we do know that there are important sections of the industry that are not represented on it. I refer, for instance, to the various publicity associations which do a fine job of attracting tourists to South Africa from outside of the country. I feel very strongly that the hon. the Minister would be well advised to follow the Riekert Committee&#x2019;s recommendations and, first of all, make this committee properly representative of all sections of the industry and of the Government departments concerned with tourism, and secondly, to make it statutory so that we in Parliament, the industry as a whole and the country as a whole would know what is happening with tourism as far as the Government is concerned. I believe that such a committee could play a very important part in the development of tourism in the country. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in respect of the Vote itself I want to say that I should like to issue a warning&#x2014;let us call it that&#x2014;to the Minister and that is that we must be careful and not take over-hasty action in respect of the development of this industry. We must bear in mind that facilities to promote tourism are extremely essential. We must develop the industry and provide for its needs as it develops. We must see tourism in perspective. In South Africa, in particular, we must see it against the background of the particular circumstances and facilities for tourism which our country offers. Tourism is a very sensitive industry, particularly in respect of economic conditions and State security. That is why it is gratifying for us to be able to say that the progress that has been made in tourism is a reflection of the confidence which the foreign tourist has in South Africa&#x2019;s economy and in the security within South Africa. There are, in fact, countries where it is no longer safe to go touring today. I have in mind, for example, the large-scale hijacking of aircraft etc., but as far as that is concerned, we in South Africa are fortunate. We must see tourism in South Africa against the background of our own conditions. In doing so, I think it is necessary for one to take into account, firstly, the fact that the tourist attractions which draw tourists to a country, and particularly to our own country, can be grouped into various classes. There are those things in nature that draw tourists. To use the words of the poet we have &#x201C;somer, en son en saffier&#x201D;. Then there are our mountains, our forests and so many other things. There are also those things that have been created by human ingenuity, for example buildings and other constructions that are interesting and informative, and which are visited by people. These things are of the utmost importance, but we must always remember that we must create the opportunity for the tourist to be able to see those things, but that we cannot create these things for the sake of tourism. I therefore want to repeat what I said at the beginning, i.e. that we must not progress too slowly when it comes to tourism, but that we should keep in step with development and ensure that the necessary facilities are there to promote tourism.</p>

<p>There are certain factors that perhaps keep tourists away from our country. We must not forget that South Africa is a vast country when we compare it with other countries, particularly on the Continent. We consequently understand what a tremendous difference there is. Because our country is so vast and because its tourist attractions are spread over so large an area, one must probably concede that this is a stumbling block as far as many tourists are concerned. The more travelling that has to be done to see those things that one would like to see, the greater are the costs involved. We must not forget either, that there are many foreigners who are hostile to us, and that can also be a reason why they do not want to come here. However, in spite of all that, when one views the figures, furnished in the annual report, about how the number of tourists that have visited South Africa have increased in recent years, I do not think we are far wrong in calculating that by the year 1980 about one million tourists will be visiting our country. Seen in this light, we must not lose sight of the importance of this, because this industry is probably the biggest single industry in the world. I feel that we must keep pace with the development of tourism in our country. However, we must not be over-hasty and try to force tourism to ripen in our country like a green fruit that one is in a hurry to eat.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on the basis of what the two hon. gentlemen opposite had to say about tourism, I can say that they have been altogether positive in their approach to this Vote.</p>

<p>It is estimated that in 1972 200 million people moved across the globe as tourists, of course apart from the astronauts who had an eye on the moon. In the process this tremendous number of people spent an estimated $24 000 million to $25 000 million. This excludes transport costs, particularly air transport. Sir, a tremendous amount of money is involved in the flow of tourists, and many countries, of course, are largely or chiefly dependent upon tourism to earn foreign exchange. In South Africa, and particularly on the part of the Opposition&#x2014; not so much so on this occasion, but only last year&#x2014;it was urged that tourism should <span class="col_8055-8056" refersTo="page_1095"/>make more rapid strides. The department was accused of the fact that South Africa was not drawing it rightful share of world tourism. The critics who have made such remarks, and hon. members of the Opposition who have flung these accusations at the department in the past, have done so without bringing themselves up to date with matters. The fact is that South Africa is definitely sharing in the tourist prosperity, or shall we call it the &#x201C;tourist explosion&#x201D;, and that in the past year a great deal has been done on the tourist front, perhaps more than is generally realized. The number of international tourists, who visited other countries in 1972, increased by 8%, in comparison with the number in the previous year. But in the case of South Africa the number of foreign tourists increased by about 16%. There were 459 478 tourists who came to South Africa in 1971. This in itself represented an increase of 17,9% on the number of tourists in the previous year. In other words, it can be stated, without fear of contradiction, that South Africa&#x2019;s crop of foreign tourism was exactly double the increase in international tourism as a whole in the oast three of four years. It is a significant fact that in 1960, for example, about 12 years ago, only 17% of the net total of tourists for the relevant year came from outside the territories of Africa. The rest came from the neighbouring states to the north of us In 1971 tourists from abroad already represented 50% of the grand total. At present this percentage is even higher.</p>

<p>It is estimated that last year tourists spent about R150 million here. If the spending of money as such increases to the same extent as the increase in numbers, it could be that foreign tourists will be spending about R400 million in South Africa in 1980.</p>

<p>The development of new aviation services is bringing South Africa closer to other countries; not only closer to Europe, but also closer to the two Americas. Australasia and the East.</p>

<p>Recently, on 14th May, 1973, the annual meeting of the Federated Hotel Association of Southern Africa took place in Kimberley. In his presidential address Mr. A. C. Burke mentioned various problems which the hotel industry is faced with, but which I do not want to elaborate on fully here. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that if the Government takes positive steps to really draw foreign tourists and make them feel welcome, and does something to make the costs of the visits of South African tourists more realistic, the hotel industry could look forward to a boom in tourism. I think this remark contains a subtle reproach against the Department of Tourism and the Government to the effect that not enough is being done to promote foreign tourism to South Africa. On the basis of the statistics I have just mentioned, I am convinced that the rate of increase in foreign tourism is normal or adequate. It does not help to stimulate tourism artificially. The annual growth of between 16% and 17% is completely adequate. The hon. member for Constantia also referred to this and said that high priority should be given to tourism. However, I want to allege that if one stimulates this artificially, we would not be benefiting tourism all that much either; we would possibly cause a blockage which could be detrimental to us in general.</p>

<p>It is surely logical that if the tourists cannot be absorbed, these people may return home with an erroneous impression of South Africa. It must be possible to absorb the tourists in hotels, as far as transport is concerned, etc.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Department of Tourism, the South African Tourist Corporation and private organizations to draw visitors from abroad, are already bearing significant fruit. The said bodies are constantly seeking and propagating new methods to promote tourism. In this connection I refer to the two informative annual reports submitted by the Department of Tourism and by the Tourist Corporation. Sir, it is necessary to be a jump or two ahead of one&#x2019;s opponent, because international tourism has become a highly competitive industry and every country wants to draw as many tourists as possible. In this connection I want to refer to the distribution of publications by Satour. Satour also realizes that in order to achieve success in the highly competitive tourist markets, the corporation&#x2019;s publications must be able to compete with the world&#x2019;s best. The production division of Satour has indeed succeeded in achieving and maintaining a very high standard. I am thinking, for example, of the fine Satour desk calendars which some of us have obtained. The Tourism Advisory Committee, which was also referred to by a previous speaker, and which was established at the beginning of last year, has <span class="col_8057-8058" refersTo="page_1096"/>already made recommendations, and we believe that those recommendations will also have a positive effect on the promotion of tourism as such.</p>

<p>South Africa is sometimes accused of not having put its house in order in time as far as receiving tourists is concerned, in other words that we are not absorbing the tourists. The Government and the private sector have co-operated to make positive and far-reaching contributions in this connection. Today South Africa can already claim to have a very well-ordered system of tourist facilities.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by again appealing to the Minister and the department to make a special effort towards training tour leaders or tour guides. Pleas have already been made for that on various occasions in this House, and efforts are being made, but thus far those efforts have not been crowned with the necessary success. It was interesting to note, in fact, that at the College for Advanced Technical Education in Johannesburg this year 40 people have enrolled to be trained as tour leaders. That is a fine start as far as that college is concerned. We hope that this will be the forerunner to a very efficient diploma in tourism. I just want to emphasize that the tour guide or the tour leader is the person who can advertise the country to tourists. He is the person who can make their tour very interesting for them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for De Aar, who spoke earlier this afternoon, unfortunately did not have the time to conclude his attack on me. All I can tell him is that I do not think I have ever said anything in this House for which I have had to apologize to my constituency.</p>

<p>Sir, this afternoon I should like to discuss the necessity of the promotion and expansion of internal tourism with the hon. the Minister. In the first place I want to tell him that it is imperative for him to convince the Cabinet to accept a more liberal policy in regard to this aspect. There are so many Government departments involved in the promotion of tourism in one way or another, that co-operation over a wide area is imperative. Take for example the case of the hotel industry. We concede that the hotel industry is an essential link in the promotion of tourism, but to be able to gear and organize the hotel industry in such a way that it will adapt to a flourishing and effective tourist industry in South Africa, the co-operation of various departments is required. For example one requires the co-operation of the Department of Justice, and to some extent the co-operation of the Police, the Department of Labour as well as the department responsible for the group areas. Anyone of these departments may take decisions or steps which could hinder the hotel industry and throw tourism out of gear, and for that reason I readily concede that the hon. the Minister has a difficult task here. But in other respects his task is much easier, where co-operation between departments is not specifically involved, and here I want to refer specifically to the promotion of internal tourism.</p>

<p>In this instance I think that it would pay the hon. the Minister to know that one of his great stumbling blocks in the expansion of internal tourism, is in fact the Department of Transport and the South African Railways. The two previous speakers on this side of the House, <i>inter alia,</i> referred, as I also want to do, to the recommendations in regard to the rationalization and promotion of the South African tourist industry, as approved by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. As we know, these recommendations were approved as far back as two years ago, approximately, but today, after two years, we find that very little has in fact been done to give effect to these recommendations, particularly the recommendations in regard to the promotion of internal tourism. The recommendations I want to refer to specifically, are those dealing with the expansion of internal tourism.</p>

<p>I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the following recommendations. The one is: &#x201C;That the South African Railways, in the expansion of its longdistance passenger services, should in the first instance consistently make due allowance for the requirements of the internal tourist and the middle and lower income group.&#x201D; Another recommendation I want to refer to, is: &#x201C;That the National Transport Commission should adopt a more liberal policy than in the past in the allocation of road transport certificates to tourist transporters,&#x201D; and the third recommendation is: &#x201C;That more scope for the ingenuity of transporters should be allowed in order to stimulate new tourist traffic.&#x201D; I am convinced that the hon. the Minister will in fact be able to obtain the co-operation of the hon. the Minister of Transport <span class="col_8059-8060" refersTo="page_1097"/>in this regard. We all know that the hon. the Minister of Transport is the most senior Minister in the Cabinet and at the same time he is also one of the most sensible Ministers in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Someone here says he is the only sensible Minister. The only problem here&#x2014;and I want to say this to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;is that there is a feeling that the Department of Tourism is too neutral as regards this matter, particularly when private transporters apply to obtain permits where the matter rests in the hands of the National Transport Commission. Two years ago, when these original recommendations were announced, the then Minister said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (col. 6528 of Hansard of 1971): &#x201C;The Government considers the growth of domestic tourism and recreation as an important factor in the healthy social development of its people.&#x201D; In other words, this is the viewpoint of the Government. To me these are very fine words, but after two years we have yet to see anything in practice which could indicate that internal tourism is really enjoying the priority as was anticpated here. I can tell the hon. the Minister that we and that in South Africa large areas of our country are simply lying fallow in regard to tourism, areas which are crying out for development. These are areas which we shall have to open up to the people if we are in earnest about tourism in South Africa. But one cannot open up an area unless one makes that area accessible.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall mention specific instances. In this regard I feel that we have to accept that private organizations are doing their best to open up areas for internal tourism, but every time they are brought up against this stumbling block, the National Transport Commission, which stands in the way of safari organizations. It is the task of the National Transport Commission to protect the Railways and the Department of Transport. Applications for permits are fought tooth and nail. The excuses offered, are always that sufficient facilities are available. For example I have here a typical objection. The grounds for the objection are: &#x201C;That no necessity for the granting of an application exists and that existing facilities are satisfactory and adequate to comply with the transport requirements of groups at a reasonable cost.&#x201D; Now, the above, for example, was said in regard to an application from a group known as the Kalahari Safari which wanted to open up certain parts of the Kalahari to internal tourists. There are certain misrepresentations here. Misrepresentation number one is that in regard to the question of reasonable costs.</p>

<p>The Department of Tourism and every person in this country ought to know that the transport facilities of the State are always more expensive than those of private entrepreneurs. Misrepresentation number two is that the existing facilities mentioned here do not exist at all. One cannot tour through the Kalahari by train or by railway bus. Now I want to give the hon. the Minister some advice.</p>

<p>I realize that the National Transport Commission will fight such applications tooth and nail because they are protecting their interests, which are the interests of the S.A. Railways and of the Department of Transport. But on the other hand the Department of Tourism, as I have said before, cannot adopt a neutral approach to this problem. In fact they can give more assistance and support to private people. They can assist private individuals by arguing that it is essential that private individuals should do this. Otherwise we shall simply continue to ask that internal tourism in South Africa be romoted, which will never happen. I can tell you that there are tremendous social reasons why we should give attention to the internal tourist. When I talk about the internal tourist I mean that person who perhaps works in the city but who hankers to experience a return to nature and look at natural surroundings for a week or two, so that he may learn to know his own country. It is of no avail the Minister or any other member opposite adopting the attitude that this is not a problem. It really is a problem. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#badenhorst">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I leave the hon. member for Durban Central, with his problems of a railway line through the Kalahari, at that. I think the hon. the Minister will probably reply to that in due course.</p>

<p>I believe that the extent to which <span class="col_8061-8062" refersTo="page_1098"/>tourism has already grown, as well as the progress which has taken place in an orderly and responsible manner most definitely deserves to be emphasized by us in this debate. For example I read on page 7 of the Annual Report of the Board of Control of the South African Tourist Corporation that the marketing challenge has been met. We are also told that in 1971 approximately 460 000 visitors came to South Africa. It is expected that in 1972 there will be 500 000. It goes on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; based on present travel patterns, South Africa&#x2019;s wide range of attractions should draw at least a million visitors a year.</block>

<p>It is mentioned that these people are drawn here by the wide range of attractions offered by this country. I am convinced this afternoon that in regard to tourism there is one aspect on which we shall perhaps never be able to place sufficient emphasis. This is that the greatest asset and attraction of a country is that which it has which no other country can equal or offer. In this regard South Africa is a privileged and I believe a richly endowed country, particularly if the emphasis is placed on the scenery of this beautiful country and everything that this signifies. That is why it is imperative for us to retain our own nature and character and that in this field we should not become more liberal as has just been advocated. I believe that we should retain what is ours and that which is peculiar to South Africa should be developed with the object of drawing tourists to this country.</p>

<p>In regard to the conservation and development of our natural heritage I believe that a great deal has already been done. On the other hand, however, I also believe that if this is seen in relation to tourism, one realizes that in this sphere we have not yet awakened fully, or, if I may put it another way, that South Africa has not yet been opened up properly. I believe that there is still too much in this beautiful country which is hidden and undeveloped. That is why there is a tremendous challenge in this field for local initiative and more specifically, rural initiative, because it is the rural areas in particular which are richly endowed with these fine scenic attractions in our country. I believe that these will have to be exploited on a larger scale.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to refer in all humility to the discovery, towards the end of last year, of the wonder cave in the Cango Caves where two speleologists, under very difficult circumstances, persisted for about six months with electrical hand drills until they had an opening in the rock-face. I was privileged to enter that wonder cave. I believe that this will mean a great deal for the Cango Caves and tourism on the road ahead.</p>

<p>Meeting the challenge could mean recovery and new life for many rural towns. Last year, in his opening speech at the congress of the South Cape Regional Association for the Promotion of Tourism, Mr. Frans Conradie, M.P.C., said, <i>inter alia,</i> according to page 6 of the minutes (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If reasons and an explanation are sought for the encouraging signs of recovery and new life in so many towns and communities in the rural areas, then there can surely be no doubt that tourism must be credited with a major role and share in the process. The credit for this must of course go to all those who assist in the promotion of tourism and in so doing contribute towards expanding this industry into the powerful factor which it is becoming in the country&#x2019;s economy, particularly if this is tackled, as it is being done by your Association, scientifically and with resourcefulness and enthusiasm.</block>

<p>This afternoon I want to plead for resourcefulness and enthusiasm among our regional associations in the promotion of tourism. I believe that these regional associations for the promotion of tourism could mean a great deal for the rural areas if they were to perform their task under the slogan of: &#x201C;We want to make the country bloom again&#x201D;. They can do so by protecting and conserving our natural heritage through a new approach to our natural attractions and through the creation of good roads and other means of communication to make sights which are worth seeing easily accessible to the tourist. I also want to plead frankly this afternoon for a tourist road through the Little Karoo with its wonderful branch roads leading to the coastal area and to the North. I believe, too, that in many areas the tourist attractions should be better sign-posted. In the speech mentioned above Mr. Conradie said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8063-8064" refersTo="page_1099"/>We must realize that the veld life is the property of the people as a whole and may not be exploited by private people for their own gain. Our scenery is our natural asset and it is sometimes misused by people for their own gain.</block>

<p>I believe that our regional associations for tourism can step in here and do an important job. I also want to plead this afternoon for closer liaison between the regional associations. I am convinced that there can and should be liaison on a provincial basis, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this could not take place under a provincial advisory council, a provincial advisory council which could co-ordinate all these activities of the various regional associations in the Province, which could prevent duplication but which could also bring about a linking up of tourist attractions in this country. I also think one could ask for a national association for the promotion of tourism. A biennial national congress in this connection could possibly be held at which these matters could be discussed. I therefore want to plead this afternoon for local initiative and for a greater degree of resourcefulness and co-ordination in all the bodies involved in tourism. If we have that then I believe that the interests of tourism as a whole could be served.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find myself in pleasant agreement with the hon. member for Oudtshoorn, more particularly where he pleads for recognition of the natural beauty of the Republic and the exploitation of it in a way which will not spoil it. I hope that he does not regard the advent of the Holiday Inn in Oudtshoorn as being something which will harm the natural beauty of Oudtshoorn or that it has perhaps introduced a liberal atmosphere to Oudtshoorn. Besides the ostriches and the Cango Caves, I think the Holiday Inn is performing a very good service not only for the people of Oudtshoorn who seem to enjoy that amenity as far as I know, but also for the tourists who visit that town.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member made the point that natural development and the exploitation of tourist amenities in the platteland areas can both take place. I am also in agreement with that sentiment. I feel that if he can give some attention within his constituency and within his province to some of the matters that cause the depopulation of the platteland, it will go a long way to assist him in his pleas for the development of the tourist industry, because we will then have a larger local population than we have at the moment, as a basis for it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I am in agreement with the hon. member, and I think this side of the House has pleaded for this before, where he asked that greater attention should be paid by the Government to the regional organizations which deal with tourism. His suggestion that there should be a provincial advisory council which will deal with tourism is also a good suggestion.</p>

<p>His last suggestion, that there should be a national congress on tourism is to my mind a suggestion worthy of consideration but my only worry is that in so many of the organizations that we have in South Africa, where you have provincial and national congresses, they have become talking shops and a means of letting off steam rather than a means through which something constructive is done.</p>

<p>I want to make three points to the hon. the Minister this afternoon. Before doing so, I would like to associate myself with the congratulations that have been showered on the hon. the Minister from this side of the House on his appointment as Minister and I would like to wish him success.</p>

<p>The first matter I would like to mention is the employment of a man of considerable distinction and experience in tourism. I am referring to Mr. Vladimir Steyn, the former Secretary for Tourism. Mr. Steyn was a man who fell out with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor but I am not going to go into the details of why he and his Minister fell out, but in the case of Mr. Steyn you have a man of enthusiasm, of drive, initiative and experience who I feel sure could be used to assist the expansion of the Department of Tourism in order to benefit tourism as a whole in South Africa. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to make use of the services of this very distinguished South African civil servant whom I think has been retired prematurely.</p>

<p>I think, also, that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to the suggestion made by the hon. member for Constantia, namely that Satour should become a statutory advisory committee on tourism. I think this is a good, suggestion and that the position could only improve if the hon. the Minister were to consider the possibility of making use of the services of a man like Mr. Steyn, who has had an intimate association <span class="col_8065-8066" refersTo="page_1100"/>with Satour and with the department. He is a very well-travelled man. Perhaps he could become chairman of Satour.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with a matter which, although it does not directly fall under tourism, nevertheless has a vital effect on the tourist coming to the Republic from overseas and on tourists coming down to the coast. I am referring to what appears to me to be a real problem in that there is no Government department of which I am aware that is able to provide facilities in our coastal areas for, for example, small boat harbours or yachting harbours. I think the hon. the Minister was in the House when the hon. member for Gardens suggested to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs that his department should take responsibility for the provision of yachting harbours. That is a good suggestion but I am afraid it will be turned down by the Minister of Economic Affairs because his attitude and that of his predecessor seems that the harbours provided by the Department of Commerce and Industries are essentially fishing harbours or fisheries harbours. There seems, therefore, to be no authority or department who is able to provide certain amenities; and the amenities I am referring to in this particular case are marine amenities in the form of yachting harbours or small boat harbours. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will be aware of the fact that in the South-Western Cape, between, say, Mossel Bay and Cape Point, there are a number of fisheries harbours such as Mossel Bay, Gansbaai, Hermanus, Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, Kalk Bay and Hout Bay&#x2014;those are all that come to mind at the moment. Those harbours are all fisheries harbours and very limited provision is made for small boats belonging to amateurs, either local amateurs or those who come from inland. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not give his attention to the possibility of his department, either by way of grants from revenue, or by the expenditure of capital, providing harbours of the kind to which I have referred. The hon. the Minister, knowing this part of the country so well, will agree with me that the sea between Mossel Bay and Cape Point provides some of the richest big game fishing grounds in the world. I believe that our sea is completely and absolutely unexploited at the moment in this regard. This could be not only a source of income from international tourists; this could also be developed far more than it has been to date to cater for internal tourism. We have on our doorstep this wonderful potential in the form of big game fishing. I have had the pleasure of attending some of the national tournaments, inter-provincial tournaments, that have taken place and I have also attended some of the international tournaments where we have had teams from Mauritius, from Madagascar, from Rhodesia and, I think, also from other overseas countries. Each and everyone of the international tourists who have attended the tournaments&#x2014;they bring their wives and friends with them&#x2014; have been at one in saying that we have the most wonderful natural resources here which are absolutely unexploited. Their main complaint is the absence of adequate hotel facilities, and more particularly the absence of harbours and boats which would be available for hire if we had those harbours. I would ask the hon. the Minister to give his consideration to this matter and perhaps next year come back with the suggestion that his department can take over, subsidize or assist with some of the facilities to which I have referred.</p>

<p>There is a third matter I want to mention. This concerns the question of international tourists coming into our ports of entry, particularly airports and harbours. Whilst this also is something that does not directly fall under the Minister, I think it is nevertheless something to which he should give his attention. One meets so many tourists from overseas who say that the reception they receive at the docks or at our airports is really second-rate. It appears as if the customs officials, some of the immigration officials and some of the airport officials, could, I think, be given a course in public relations. I feel that the hon. the Minister should give his attention to this matter. Some of his departmental officials can go to the ports of entry to see the way in which tourists are treated. I am not for a moment suggesting that tourists are treated badly at these places, but I do feel that they could perhaps be given more courteous attention and more consideration than they are being given now. The reason I think why this is so is that the customs officials and the immigration officials at the harbours and at our airports are people already busy with other jobs. The possibility comes to mind of the Minister providing at our airports and at each of our harbours one of his departmental officials in the form of a welcoming official who could make these tourists feel very much more welcome in the Republic than they are made to feel at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="col_8067-8068" refersTo="page_1101"/>Lastly, I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to a matter which I drew to the attention of the hon. the Minister of Transport recently, namely the rail service between Pretoria and the Kruger National Park, particularly that leading to Skukuza. It is a bad service, with an overnight stop at Nelspruit. The hon. the Minister of Transport said he would give consideration to this matter, but as the Kruger National Park is one of our most important tourist amenities, I feel that the hon. the Minister should also look into this matter to see whether it is not possible for the Railways to provide a first-class tourist train to the Kruger National Park.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is to be regretted that the hon. member for Simonstown spoilt an otherwise fine speech by dragging Mr. Steyn&#x2019;s name into this debating chamber. For what reason should that hon. U.P. member make an appeal on behalf of Mr. Steyn&#x003F; I want to tell the hon. member that Mr. Steyn is a Nationalist and that he is quite capable of handling his own affairs without its being necessary for that hon. member or his party to interfere. I therefore think that what the hon. member did was uncalled-for and in bad taste.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the fine tourist guides which the Department of Tourism now publishes. There has been a long-felt need for this series of route descriptions. They are very popular among motorists and we are greatly indebted to the department for publishing them. In this regard I should just like to ask for the department to consider indicating the year of publication on the inside every time such a guide is printed, because I think the fact that this is not done constitutes one of the lesser deficiencies at present. Because of my pride in my town, Verwoerdburg, I should very much like to ask that as far as the route map Pretoria-Komatipoort is concerned, certain tourist attractions in Verwoerdburg should be removed under the heading &#x201C;Pretoria&#x201D; and classified under their own heading of Verwoerdburg. There are, <i>inter alia,</i> the house Doringkloof of the late Gen. Smuts in my constituency which is a major tourist attraction and which I am very fond of showing to foreign tourists. The Air Force memorial, a picture of which appears in this year&#x2019;s telephone directory and which is the work of the Verwoerdburg Publicity Association, should also be removed from the list of places of interest under Pretoria and classified under Verwoerdburg, where they belong. From the administrative point of view we shall also ask the Verwoerdburg Publicity Association to take up this matter with the department.</p>

<p>Having seen three fine and exceptionally outstanding films his morning which were presented by the department, and since the hon. the Minister was already been congratulated on them, I should very much like to associate myself with what has been said by previous speakers who have emphasized the role of nature, a theme which the department has chosen as its tourism theme this year, too. A fine article, written by John Raw, appeared in the <i>Pretoria News</i> of 15th May. I just want to quote one paragraph in which he writes about the mountains, rivers and valleys&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the real South Africa, and here we can learn about ourselves, our weaknesses in the face of the power of nature, and our strength, not in dominating nature, because that we can never do, but by making nature a part of ourselves.</block>

<p>Now it is remarkable that on page 18 of the annual report it is said that while bodies and organizations such as regional development associations, farmers&#x2019; associations and others who had never before given much attention to tourism, have now become interested in and keen to make a contribution to the development of the industry. I think this is probably the first time that the farming sector as such has been mentioned in this official annual report of the department. It is true that city dwellers, particularly those from the large cities of the world, who travel through South Africa, as well as our local city dwellers, have mentioned what the heartfelt need it is for them when they speed along the tarred roads through the country, that the bus should only stop at a typical farmstead for half an hour, to enable them to make the acquaintance of our farm people in their natural surroundings, out there in the unspoiled rural areas. Some of the overseas tourists have told me that they would like to get to know the soul of the Afrikaner in the place where he lives.</p>

<p>Now I want to call to mind what has happened from time to time in the past few years here in the vicinity of the Cape Peninsula, in the lovely season when the spring flowers are blooming. I have in <span class="col_8069-8070" refersTo="page_1102"/>mind Mr. Kobus Louw of Gansekraal, near Darling, who regularly makes his tractors and trailers available over the weekends to take these people through those lovely fields of wild flowers. The hon. chairman of the National Party study group on tourism also showed a group of parliamentarians the wild flowers he has the other day in the same way. What does that typical South African farmer do when he received these city dwellers on his farm&#x003F; He does not charge a fee. At the gate he has a collecting box in which a voluntary contribution is placed for the building fund of his church. That is just typical of the hospitality of the South African farmer. But now I should very much like to ask the hon. the Minister something. Since farmers&#x2019; associations are most certainly going to appreciate the potential of organized tourism to an ever-increasing extent, could his department not perhaps introduce some guide lines, in co-operation with organized agriculture, to prevent our farms from being overrun by tourists and for our farming community, too, to know how to conduct themselves properly, correctly and hospitably towards tourists but also, in so doing, for them to have a share in this source of revenue&#x003F; Could it not also be made possible at the same time for small groups of sophisticated and interested visitors to visit our farms&#x003F; I think that such a set of guide lines for our farmers&#x2019; associations from the Department of Tourism would mean a great deal.</p>

<p>Then it is interesting to note that as far as nature is concerned, three Dutch couples spoke to me recently, just before they were returning to Holland at the Jan Smuts Airport at Kempton Park, and expressed opinions in direct contrast to those of the hon. member who spoke a short while ago and is not here at the moment; these couples mentioned the satisfactory treatment they had enjoyed throughout from both airline and customs staff at the various places they had visited. But what is interesting is that they evaluated, in the course of our conversation, the tourist attractions of our country and placed the following places which they had visited, in order of popularity: No. 1, for some reason or other, Swaziland; No. 2, Etosha; No. 3, the Kruger Game Park; and lastly, Pretoria and the other cities. This is an indication of the tremendous attraction our nature has for these people. They are not so interested in our cities as such. They know cities and masses of people. They are not interested in them. They are interested in our scenery. That is why it is so interesting to read in the latest report of the National Parks Board that the number of foreign visitors to the Kruger Game Park alone, once again showed an increase and that in the past financial year, 26 000 foreign tourists visited the National Kruger Park. This is an increase on the previous year, but in relation to the number of local visitors it is only 8%. We often hear criticism from our own people that the whole of the Kruger Park is reserved only for foreign tourists, but this figure indicates that only 8 % of the visitors do in fact come from Europe and other overseas countries.</p>

<p>Sir, this brings me to my last point. Particularly since criticism has been levelled at the National Parks Board to the effect that the Kruger Park is always fully booked so that our people are unable to get in, I want to suggest that some of our local tourists should also consider the outstanding possibilities of the Kalahari Gemsbok Park, of Etosha, of the Bontebok National Park near here and of the Mountain Zebra National Park in the constituency of my friend, the hon. member for Cradock.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District says I no longer have a constituency, but I want to tell the hon. member that it is not a &#x201C;Royal&#x201D; constituency; it is a &#x201C;loyal&#x201D; constituency.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was advised that the hon. member for Pretoria District was going to enter this debate, but that he was going to take a completely different line to the one which he took this afternoon. I want to say that I am glad that good sense prevailed with the hon. gentleman and that he did not take the line which I was advised he would. He took my friend from Simonstown to task and said that he had spoilt a good speech by referring to the ex-Secretary for Tourism, Mr. Vladimir Steyn. He went on <span class="col_8071-8072" refersTo="page_1103"/>to castigate my friend, and in the course of his speech he asked: &#x201C;Does he not know that Mr. Steyn is a Nationalist, and a good Nationalist at that&#x003F;&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, I want to tell the hon. member for Pretoria District that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, if an injustice has been done, it does not matter what political affiliation the person concerned has. We do not ask first, &#x201C;To which political party does he belong&#x003F;&#x201D; If my friend from Pretoria District does that, that is why we know that he will not come back after the next election. But, Sir, I want to go further. What did the hon. member for Simonstown ask the hon. the Minister this afternoon&#x003F; He asked the hon. the Minister to consider the qualifications of this man, a man who possibly has greater qualifications in the sphere of tourism in this country than anybody else at the disposal of the hon. the Minister. All that the hon. member for Simonstown asked was that the Minister should consider using this man somewhere on the board of Satour, if not necessarily as chairman, then at least as a member of the board. Let us use these talents in this country instead of having these talents absolutely wasted. But then, Sir, we hear the sort of remarks that have just been made by the hon. member for Pretoria District because he just cannot understand anything which is outside the National Party. He still has his blinkers on; he still believes the earth is flat; he still believes that if he goes too far he will fall off the edge.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Simonstown and the hon. member for Pretoria District mentioned the question of reception at ports and airports. Sir, these two gentlemen differed. I must say that only last night in the Durban airport I was approached by a fine gentleman who had arrived in this country three days ago and who was absolutely disgusted with what he found in the Durban airport. I agree with him that the facilities at Durban airport are too shocking for words, particularly when you consider that this is the second largest airport in this country and is the stand-by airport for international flights that come into Jan Smuts. I believe that this Minister must use his influence, if he has any, in the Cabinet to see that something is done about Durban airport immediately, if not sooner, because the terrible facilities that we have there are a blot on the fair name of South Africa. Sir, here I have something which was purchased at Durban airport last night, &#x201C;Holiday special: Australasian Post&#x201D;. Sir, I repeat that this was purchased at Durban airport last night, and do you know what the date of this is&#x003F; It is dated 21st December, 1972. I ask you, Sir, is this the sort of thing that we use to impress tourists when they come to South Africa&#x003F; Sir, the hon. member for Pretoria District and other hon. members opposite who are trying to tell us that everything is good and fine in this country must jack up their ideas; they must either take off their blinkers, or else they must speak the truth when they speak in this place.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to speak to the hon. the Minister in all seriousness about a Cinderella development in this country, one which has been neglected. I do not particularly blame him or his department for this neglect but I believe that the attention of his department could well be turned towards encouraging the development of snow-skiing facilities in South Africa, particularly in the Drakensberg. I believe that there is a move afoot by a club&#x2014; a private club at this stage&#x2014;to hold the first South African skiing championships, during July of this year in the Drakensberg, at a place called Tina Head. I believe that the Austrian ski champion has indicated that he is prepared to come out here, not only to assist with the judging at our own championships, but to demonstrate the latest ski techniques and to train instructors. I know, too, that a young South African has recently been granted a bursary to undergo two years&#x2019; training in Austria in ski techniques, that he will be trained as an instructor and will be a fully qualified instructor at the end of his training period. I believe that there is space for two more young South Africans to qualify for this course. I understand also that an American expert was out here during last winter, that he had a look at the snow in this area, that he agreed that the type of snow was excellent for skiing, that it was the right type, and that he believed that we could develop a ski resort in that area. He also believed that we could have ice skating and other winter sports and, of course, pony trekking through the magnificent scenery in that part of the world. I believe that a snowmaking machine has been installed and that this will provide sufficient snow and that the first ski lift is in the process of <span class="col_8073-8074" refersTo="page_1104"/>being developed. In fact, Sir, I am led to understand that in this area we could develop all the facilities required for a sophisticated skiing resort. Sir, there are, of course, also other areas where skiing fanatics can ski&#x2014;and I do not apologize for using the word &#x201C;fanatics&#x201D;. We have in this House a foundation member of a club which developed a ski run within 120 miles of Cape Town, which I have used and which I must say is very good. I believe that bodies of this kind require encouragement from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. I believe that the function of this Minister&#x2019;s department is not only to encourage overseas visitors to come to this country, but to encourage the use of our own facilities. The Matroosberg slope is owned, or is operated, wholly by a club and will not be open to the public, so I do not intend to speak about it at the moment, but I believe that there is also a move afoot in Lesotho to develop a similar ski resort. I do not believe that we should let Lesotho get ahead of us. I believe that this Minister should look into what is going on, and I hope he has. I hope his department has already had a look at what is going on in this particular sphere in the country and that he will tell me this afternoon that his department is giving the persons concerned all the encouragement necessary. I believe that 5 000 South Africans go to Switzerland every year to ski. Each one of them spends, on an average, just to get there and to pay the accommodation there, R500 for three weeks skiing. I believe that that R500 could be kept in South Africa if we developed a centre with the right facilities, so that these ski fanatics could have not just three weeks but two months skiing for the same amount which they are spending in Europe.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect to this. I said I was speaking only from the internal point of view but there is a large industry growing up in South America as well as in Australia, a tourist industry based on snow and skiing. It is a lot more expensive for Europeans to get there but I believe that at one resort in the Argentine this year they are catering for 35 000 Europeans, people from Europe, who will go there for the skiing facilities in the European summer. Surely South Africa could get a share of this. I am sure that we could develop these facilities and when I think of the foreign exchange that could be saved through people not leaving the country, I think that the hon. the Minister should look further into this matter. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us this afternoon that he is doing or has done something about this, or if he is unable to tell me that, that he will at least give an undertaking that he and his department will investigate this aspect further with a view to assisting that sector of our tourist industry in this country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to give the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, who has just resumed his seat, the assurance that this side of the House also has appreciation for the positive contribution made by Mr. Steyn, the former Secretary to this department. The hon. member for Pretoria District is on record in Hansard as having conveyed the appreciation of this side of the House to Mr. Steyn while he was still Secretary to the department. But I also believe that the right thing to do is to pay tribute when it is necessary, and also when it is time to do so, and for that reason I feel myself at liberty this afternoon to express a few brief words of special thanks to the present Secretary, Mr. Wessels, who is not only Secretary to the department but also chairman of the Satour Board. We should also like to pay tribute to Mr. Owen, the director of Satour, and then a special word of honour and thanks go to Mr. Da Silva, the photographer who made some of the films for Satour. This morning, when we had an opportunity of seeing some of these films&#x2014;and those that come to mind are &#x201C;The Peace Game&#x201D; and &#x201C;Vrede in ons Tyd&#x201D;&#x2014;one could not help realizing that one was dealing here with a master. Consequently we should like to congratulate Mr. Da Silva on the various awards the films which he shot have already won at international film festivals and exhibitions. It simply became clearer to me this morning that the charm not only for people from abroad but also for us in South Africa lies in the peace, quiet and tranquility which is to be found in our country; the charm lies in the natural beauty of the country, as was very effectively depicted this morning. For that reason we are grateful that the department and Satour accepted as theme that we should preserve what is beautiful and useful. May we express the hope and belief that this theme will bear fruit not only in South Africa but throughout the entire world, since there are so many beautiful, fine and unblemished things which could be preserved.</p>

<p><span class="col_8075-8076" refersTo="page_1105"/>It was gratifying to be able to observe in this report of the department that interest in tourism is no longer restricted only to those organizations which are directly concerned with national and international tourism. For that reason we are grateful that we are today able to begin to talk of a national effort to promote tourism in South Africa, in the interests not only of those who come to South Africa from abroad, but also of us here in South Africa who have so much to give and to enjoy in our beautiful country. It is gratifying to see that some of the organizations which themselves offered to render assistance, as well as organizations which are beginning to discuss tourism on a broader basis, include, <i>inter alia,</i> regional associations, farmers&#x2019; associations, women&#x2019;s associations, chambers of commerce, etc. I think it is a good and a fine thing that various organizations in South Africa are not only displaying interest, but are also making contributions in respect of ideas and constructive criticism on the expansion and development of our tourist potential. However, the question arises whether everyone in South Africa is pulling their full weight in promoting tourism. When I say this I am thinking of some of our big public companies and commercial enterprises. I think there is a wide field in which these groups could make a greater contribution in respect of conservation, beautification and the making available of areas for tourism in South Africa.</p>

<p>One finds that it is an almost daily occurrence that some of our bigger companies &#x2014;I am thinking in particular of fuel companies&#x2014;make thousands and tens of thousands of stickers available. These stickers have to be designed and printed at a cost of several thousands of rand, but some of these stickers in my opinion have no educational value. In fact, I think they are more of a burden than a blessing to us when we consider attempts to keep our country clean and hygienic. One wonders whether it is not possible to establish a publicity pool or an advertisement brokers&#x2019; association which could perhaps be managed by the department, through which the various organziations may be afforded the opportunity of paying the large amounts they spend on publicity into such a publicity pool so that it may be used to good effect by the department for the foreign as well as the local tourist in South Africa. The funds in such a publicity pool could, for example, be utilized for the purpose of beautification and for the establishment of services which have not as yet been properly developed in South Africa.</p>

<p>I also think that it is clear that a very specific distinction will be drawn between foreign and local tourists in South Africa. It is a good thing that a great deal should be done for foreign tourists, for we in South Africa want to be proud of what is being offered to those who come to South Africa from abroad. However, I think that there are still fields where more could be done for our local tourists. When we think of our local tourists, we find that they may be divided into two groups. In the first place there are those who want to see the country, who want to visit unknown places. However, there is the other group which we could call &#x201C;holiday-makers&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;tourists&#x201D;. They are the people who want to enjoy a rest.</p>

<p>Consequently I want to present a plea this afternoon for greater consideration of the possibility of establishing places of rest in South Africa, places of rest where the tariffs will not be exceptionally high, places of rest where South Africans who have a well-accomplished month&#x2019;s, or quarter&#x2019;s, or six months&#x2019; work behind them can relax for two or three days. One appreciates all over again the gospel truth that rest is in fact to be found in quietude.</p>

<p>I want to present a plea this afternoon to the effect that if it is possible to establish more of these places of rest in South Africa, modelled on the developments of the National Parks Board, the province of the Orange Free State should be borne in mind to greater extent. Sometimes we in the Free State cannot help feeling that we have been rather badly done by in some spheres. It is true that the Free State has the raw materials. We realize that the raw materials which we offer to South Africa through the Free State gold-fields require a national effort and offer a national income, but I think that a great deal of the benefit which is derived from the development of the Free State gold-fields does not accrue to the Free State as it should. In addition we have the water in the Free State which we gladly donate to the Vaal Triangle because we know that it is needed there as well and can be used to good effect. However, we feel that it is perhaps fair to make an appeal in this House to private organizations in South Africa to do more to make the Free State available to tourists from the other provinces as <i>quid pro quo</i> for our raw materials. I think that <span class="col_8077-8078" refersTo="page_1106"/>one could with a great measure of justification say that the Free State, with its people, has never left any organization or group in the lurch. When I say that I am not referring derogatorily to the fact that the National Party holds all the constituencies in the Free State, for there are some of our United Party friends in the Free State who, despite good-humoured banter on the part of those of us sitting on this side of the House, are still loyal supporters of that side. I think that there are other spheres as well where it has been proved that the Free State has never, in our history, left anyone in the lurch. Consequently we can give these private organizations the assurance that the Free State will not let them down with its support if they want to make use of the Free State for the purpose of sight-seeing. In the discussion of his Vote the hon. the Minister of Community Development said that there were two sides to every matter; that is true. In the Free State we have the Maluti mountains, but up the the present we have seen only the one side of those mountains. The south-eastern side of the Maluti mountains, bordering on Lesotho, are inaccessible from the Free State. When I speak of a publicity pool to which various organizations could contribute for the establishment of amenities, I wonder whether it is not possible to instil this idea in some of our big companies. They could then, jointly, construct a tourist road for us to the south-eastern side of the Maluti mountains, not only for the sake of South Africa, but also for the sake of visitors to Lesotho. I am thinking in this connection of organizations such as construction companies, cement manufacturers, bitumen manufacturers, engineering associations, fuel and rubber companies. If they were to contribute to this, they would not only be making publicity for themselves, but would also be rendering a service to South Africa. Cognizance would also be taken with great gratitude and appreciation of the contribution they would be making.</p>

<p>Since I have now extolled the virtues of a few characteristics of the Free State, I want to conclude with the following words: The greatest asset of the Free State is its human material, and in the past this human material has proved to us that they played their part. For that reason it is with gratitude that we took cognizance of the contribution made by the Secretary to this department. It is probably unnecessary to say that he is also an ex-Free Stater. I hope therefore that this department will in future not only make use of the human material of the Free State. We want to invite South Africa to come and see the Free State; there one will still find peace and there one will still find tranquillity.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to associate myself with the plea made by the hon. member for Bethlehem. He asked for particular attention to be given to our tourist facilities in South Africa, but also to our tourist facilities for our internal tourists. I also agree with his idea that we can make greater use of the exploitation of the beautiful Maluti mountains for our tourists. To my mind wonderful progress has been made in that hon. member&#x2019;s constituency, and particularly in the Golden Gate area, in recent years.</p>

<p>&#x2020;There are a few matters which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister. The first is in regard to existing facilities for the provision of guide books in South Africa for tourists. I know that guide books are issued by certain associations, by motorist clubs and so forth, and I know that some of them are beautifully printed, are in colour, are well bound and everything. However, I do not quite think that these guide books fulfil the purpose of the ordinary tourist. I am not suggesting that the hon. the Minister must now become a publisher of guide books, but perhaps he could drop a word in the right department so that we can have something which could compare with, say, <i>Guide Michelin,</i> or the guide book of the touring club Italiano in Europe, which are magnificent publications providing great details of the towns and the routes. For instance, you can take a guide book of the touring club Italiano or of the <i>Guide Michelin,</i> and while you are in South Africa you can plan your route right up to the front door of your hotel, whether it be in Paris, Rome or Florence. The guide book will give you a town plan indicating which streets are one-way streets; it will give you the hotel names, the prices at the hotels, the names of the restaurants, the quality of their food and the prices. I really do think that there is an opportunity in this country of ours for an improvement in the general level of our guide books for the internal tourist and particularly for the external tourist, and more particularly for the external tourist who wants to use his own vehicle to travel in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_8079-8080" refersTo="page_1107"/>Secondly, I have mentioned restaurants. I do not wish to burden the hon. the Minister with the task in regard to restaurants that he already has in regard to the hotels. Again I wish to submit to him for his consideration a matter which he might take up in certain quarters&#x2014;I do not know which; probably free enterprise quarters&#x2014; that the time has probably come for South Africa to grade the restaurants in our big cities with regard to quality, ambience, view, prices, the supply of wines and so forth, as is done in respect of every country in Europe today. It is something which I believe is needed. I know that there are one or two guide books which do give a sort of informal classification, but I do not think they have the same authority as for instance the <i>Guide Michelin</i> will have in France with their classification of hotels and restaurants. Again it is a matter which I think will improve our tourist potential in this country.</p>

<p>There is a third matter I want to raise. Again, it is not for the hon. the Minister himself to do something but I hope that the authorities that be at some time or other will see whether, particularly for oversea tourists, better facilities cannot be offered as regards night life and whether our Sundays cannot be made just a bit more attractive for those persons coming from overseas. If a person planning a holiday in South Africa decides to spend three days in Johannesburg and those three days were to be Friday, Saturday and Sunday, I doubt whether he really could do justice to a city such as Johannesburg with the facilities that are offered over the weekends. Tourists&#x2019; time is limited; they cannot afford more than three or four days in any particular city and they would like to plan for those days. They would like to know that on Sundays they can also enjoy facilities which would otherwise be denied them. I am not asking for us to change our pattern of life in this country and that sort of thing, but I do think we can be a little more tolerant with regard to these issues.</p>

<p>The final point I want to raise with the hon. the Minister concerns a matter I raised with him by way of a question, namely the excessive charges made by certain hotels who have installed the P.A.B.X. system. At the moment they are charging excessive fees for local and for trunk calls. The situation is apparently that if anyone wants to put through a trunk call at certain of these hotels about which I have had complaints, it goes through the P.A.B.X. system and instead of the person being charged four cents per unit or four cents plus 20% or 25%, the person is actually charged ten cents for a four cent unit, which amounts to a 250% profit per unit. I think that is excessive. The hon. the Minister has promised that he would look into the matter. I am glad that he has, but I was a bit disappointed to hear that he had no statutory power, really, to do anything in that regard. I do not know whether that means that he cannot do anything in regard to the grading of a particular hotel. Perhaps he could tell us what powers he actually has in regard to grading and so forth. I am sure that I have his sympathy in that he agrees that some of these charges are really excessive. I have here for instance an account which came to me in a letter an hour or two ago, in which a person complains that for a short trunk call he made between Johannesburg and Cape Town, he was charged R9-10. That is an excessive charge for a trunk call. I do not know how long the trunk call was, but I accept his word that the charge is excessive.</p>

<p>These are the few points I wanted to raise with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened to the debate with great interest, and I should like to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for their contributions. I found the debate very interesting. Many suggestions have been made. I do not know whether I will have the time to refer to every point that was raised, but I will do my best to reply to as many as possible. I should like to thank hon. members on both sides of the House very much for their kind congratulations on my appointment as Minister of Tourism, and for their good wishes. I appreciate this very much.</p>

<p>From the very start I want to stress that today it is accepted that the tourist industry has become the biggest single industry in the world. The tourist industry in South Africa today is a much bigger industry than many of us realize.</p>

<p>&#x2020;One gets the impression, an impression I have gained since coming into this department, that this industry is somewhat of a Cinderella amongst our departments and our industries, but I think that one must see this in proper perspective. Our tourist <span class="col_8081-8082" refersTo="page_1108"/>industry consists, as has rightly been pointed out, of the foreign tourist industry which deals with the bringing of people into the country. This tourist trade is today a very competitive trade. In addition to this kind of tourism, there is of course the domestic tourist industry, within the country. I would briefly like to say a few words about both.</p>

<p>Last year we received in this country 534 000 tourists from abroad, which is a substantial increase on the figure for the year before.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Koedoespoort quite rightly referred to this. The increase in foreign tourism is substantially more than the average world figure, and one is very grateful for this. I also want to say that included in this figure of 534 000 tourists from abroad there were more than 25 000 non-White tourists. I think hon. members will agree with me that we have not really had any problems in this connection.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to stress what was also said by the hon. member for Koedoespoort, that at the moment we are receiving at least one half of all our foreign tourists from countries in Europe. America and Australasia as against African and nearby countries. Five, six or seven years ago the proportion of tourists coming in from neighbouring countries was 80% of the total and we have therefore had much success with the number we have attracted from further afield. I think that is important, because these are the people who, we find, are in the first place spending more money than the tourists, on the average, who come from nearby African territories, for example. I also think, and hon. members will agree with me, that it is important for us to receive large numbers of visitors from European countries. America, Australasia, South America and I believe now also, with the development of new air services, from the Far East. I think there is a very big public relations function, a big public relations aspect, involved in this. I therefore welcome very much this larger proportion of foreign tourists coming from further afield, from the countries with which we have had long traditional ties in many respects. The most important sources of tourism for us today are the United Kingdom, North America, that is the United States and Canada, West Germany, which has become very important&#x2014;the rate of increase of tourists from West Germany over the last three years being very rapid indeed&#x2014; and also Australasia, Australia and New Zealand, from where the numbers are rising very fast. This I would put down partly to the improved air services between South Africa and Australia.</p>

<p>I should just like to comment on remarks about Sartoc, which was raised by the hon. member for East London City. This council formally got off the ground in March at a conference in Mauritius, a conference which I had the honour to attend. This was a follow-up of the agreement between South Africa and the Portuguese provinces of Angola and Mozambique, as well as Swaziland, Malawi and Mauritius. We hope that in time, as we go along, other countries will join in. Had it not been for the unfortunate constitutional position which appertains to Rhodesia today, there would have been no doubt that Rhodesia would also have formed part of the agreement. But I believe that other neighbouring countries are going to join as well. I believe that this council, Sartoc, has a very big role to play, not only in tourism, and to our advantage, but, indeed, in a wider sphere of international relations and goodwill as well, particularly for this country.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the spirit in which these discussions took place in Mauritius in March. The Secretary for Tourism, and the other members of his department who accompanied us, all agree with me, in fact, that there could not have been a better spirit than that which prevailed at all the discussions. What we did there was to appoint the Minister of External Affairs and Tourism of Mauritius, Mr. Gaetan Duval, as the first chairman of Sartoc. Until we appoint the first director, we appointed the town clerk of Port Louis, the biggest city of Mauritius, in a temporary capacity. He is a very distinguished authority on public administration and in other fields. Mr. Bukori made a very great impression on all of us. I think we were very fortunate that until such time as we can make a permanent appointment&#x2014;we are busy on that now&#x2014; we have the services of such an efficient and experienced official as Mr. Bukori at our disposal. I might just mention that we agreed amongst ourselves that for the first year there would be a budget of &#x00A3;50 000 and of that &#x00A3;50 000 South Africa is contributing just over &#x00A3;32 000. However, as I have indicated, we consider that a very good investment, and if Sartoc can continue <span class="col_8083-8084" refersTo="page_1109"/>in the spirit in which it was founded &#x2014;and I am optimistic in this regard&#x2014;we will increasingly find that that is a very small price to pay for this latest form of international co-operation involving South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member wanted me to go into great detail but there was another point he did raise. He asked how I saw the tourist position in South Africa in relation to Sartoc. The two great aims of Sartoc are, of course: (1) as first essential to encourage tourists to come to these six member territories, and (2) to promote and encourage inter-regional and inter-country travel among these six member countries. I am taking Angola and Mozambique as two separate areas. We are busy with this at the moment. We believe as we have seen so often&#x2014;take for example Europe&#x2014;that people today do not want to go just to France, West Germany or Italy. If they arrive there, they immediately want to go to a number of countries. The travel agent will tell you that this is always the case. We would like to say to people who want to come to South Africa that we have a workable arrangement according to which they can, without too much trouble, go to Malawi, Swaziland or Mauritius or wherever they like, and that we can organize it all at the same time. On the other hand, if these people say to agents abroad that they want to come to Malawi, or Mauritius, the agent can ask them why not include South Africa&#x003F; This is how the matter is being organized. We believe that we will not lose tourists in that they will now perhaps go to Malawi or Mauritius and who might have come to us. On the contrary, all of us believe&#x2014;and we have discussed this very carefully&#x2014;that we all stand to gain because we will now make a much bigger pool amongst ourselves. I believe the first indications are already very interesting. The first indications are that this has created a lot of interest in the international tourism field. These are early days as far as this is concerned, but I believe that this is going to build up, as it deserves to.</p>

<p>As far as group travel is concerned, to which the hon. member for East London City referred, I want to say that the facilities that are available, for example, to bring groups of people to South Africa by air, will be extended. This matter is being discussed at the moment. There are many details which have to be discussed, for instance with the different air-lines. This all requires a good deal of organization, but I may say that this is all under discussion at the moment. We do not see any insuperable problems in this connection.</p>

<p>Yes; I think one may say that the very first task we gave to the new executive, in other words to the chairman and the acting director and his small staff, was that this must immediately be made known all over, and this is being done, undoubtedly. As a matter of fact, I believe that Satour is going to play a very important part here. We have offered Satour facilities in this respect wherever we could, and again I believe that this is going to be very much to our advantage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. We have not encountered any problems in that regard at all.</p>

<p>*I just want to refer to an important aspect of this industry, i.e. the foreign exchange that is earned, the foreign currency that is brought into South Africa from outside by tourists. The hon. member for Constantia mentioned a figure of R90 million. This is far too conservative. The real figure is much higher. However, I do not take it amiss of him that he mentioned that figure, because, strangely enough, this is the kind of figure that is still being mentioned everywhere. One reads it in newspapers and in other publications.</p>

<p>&#x2020;One of the first things I did when I took office was to try to ascertain the amount of foreign exchange brought into South Africa as a result of tourism. This was the sort of figure I got; in fact, some of the figures I was given were much lower. I asked for a thorough study of this matter to be made. The trouble is that the official statistics, or rather the basis of these statistics, <span class="col_8085-8086" refersTo="page_1110"/>have not been revised for some time. The weakness was that the average figure being given in respect of the daily expenditure by the average tourist was hopelessly too low. I myself started asking tourists, wherever I met them, what they were spending, and after some months I made my own calculations. At the same time I asked my department to go into the matter very fully on a much more systematic basis. At the moment I think I can quite safely say that the amount of foreign exchange that is being brought into South Africa per annum is at least R200 million. It may be as much as R225 million a year. The reason for this estimate is that I am sure that the average tourist from abroad spends more than three weeks here&#x2014;my figure is 24 days&#x2014;and that during that period he is spending at least R15 a day. One must think of internal travel. A good deal is being spent on moving around in the country. The estimate I have given excludes the cost of coming here. Many of the tourists who come to South Africa make use of South African Airways, but I have not taken that into consideration.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F; Could the hon. the Minister tell me how he reconciles his estimate of R200 million with the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s figure for 1971, which is the latest figure available&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have mentioned that the reason for the large difference is that the basis on which the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s calculation was made was unfortunately an old basis which had not been revised for some time. The amount which tourists are spending is rising rapidly year by year. That is the real reason for this difference. The figure on which their calculations were based, relating to the average expenditure per day by the average tourist, was unfortunately rather outdated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Is the basis calculated <i>per capita</i> per day&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the figure I mentioned reflects the total expenditure per annum by all the tourists who come here. My basis for arriving at this figure is that each tourist spends R15 a day on average and that tourists remain here for an average period of 24 days. If you multiply that figure by the number of tourists who visit South Africa, namely 534 000,</p>

<p>you arrive at an amount of something over R200 million per annum. I should like to say that, at the present rate of increase in the number of tourists coming to this country, I estimate that before the decade is out, that is to say in less than seven years, we shall find more than a million tourists coming to South Africa. By then, bearing in mind the increase in expenditure each year by tourists, it could easily happen that tourism will be bringing in at least R500 million a year in foreign exchange. In a sense, Sir, one could almost say that this is pure profit. It is something we hand to the hon. the Minister of Finance with no strings attached; we do not deduct all sorts of things. We say: &#x201C;That is our contribution to the balance of payments.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister of Finance, I am quite sure, will feel that that is a sizeable contribution, and I am sure that if we should approach the hon. the Minister with justified requests for more money as we go along, he will bear that in mind. I do not want to bind him further than that at the moment. I thought I should mention this because, as I said at the start, this is a much bigger industry than people generally realize.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, one must take into account that the movement of people is not the only thing that we are concerned with here; the accommodation industry is also involved in this. We have created a very effective hotel industry, especially since the Hotel Board was created in 1965, which is only eight years ago. We also have a large transport industry. It is true that criticism is exercised in this regard, and I will come to that, but we have a large industry here which is important to the tourist industry. Then there is the entertainment industry which is being developed on a large scale. If one considers all these aspects one has to admit that this is a very large industry in which hundreds of millions of rands, and even thousands of millions of rands, have been invested. It affords work opportunities to thousands upon thousands of people of all population groups.</p>

<p>&#x2020;So, Mr. Chairman, I stress again that we must take a broader look at tourism than we have tended to take in the past. We must realize that this is becoming a major industry.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to come to domestic tourism in general. This matter has been raised on both sides of the House and there have been some very interesting contributions <span class="col_8087-8088" refersTo="page_1111"/>in this regard. I want to say that I agree that there are some aspects relating to the promotion of tourism domestically which need to be jolted and perhaps spurred on a little. I do want to say, however, that as far as accommodation is concerned, there has been an enormous improvement, particularly in the hotel industry. 1 377 Hotels have been graded, of which just over 70% are one-star hotels. There is also a very satisfactory number of five-star top hotels. In this connection I want to refer hon. members to a recent statement by a very well-known tourist, a man who has travelled the world many times, Mr. William Howard Robb, from England. He was recently here. He has spent a great deal of money on tourism and has been travelling the world with his wife since 1951. In an interview with the <i>Natal Mercury</i> the other day, he had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is way at the top of my list, so much so that we have visited this country every year for the past five years in succession.</block>

<p>Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is in fact no alternative to South Africa as a tourist venue.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have now come to spend four months of every year in South Africa and it is not enough.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Asked about his impression of South African hotels, Mr. Robb said he had yet to find a bad one. He was equally impressed with the standard of food. In fact, he said, &#x201C;We cannot keep pace with the South Africans, but we give it a good try.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I thought I would mention this, Sir, because this is not just the opinion of an ordinary run-of-the-mill tourist. If there is such a thing as a professional tourist, I suppose one could call Mr. Robb that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like at the same time to pay a tribute to the Hotel Board.</p>

<p>*I think that the Hotel Board in its short lifetime, from 1965, has done a wonderful job in improving our accommodation and, especially, in building up our hotel industry. Hon. members may be interested to hear that the Hotel Board at present spends almost 40% of its budget on the training of staff for the hotel industry. I do not have the time this afternoon to give all the details here; I had a great deal to say about this when I recently opened the hotel school in Johannesburg. It is worth while seeing that school. Young people are being trained there to hold the highest managing posts in the hotel industry. I was very much impressed by the standards maintained there. The Hotel Board is an excellent board, and quite a number of other bodies are being represented on it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, what is our aim as far as tourism is concerned&#x003F; Perhaps I could just read out to you what I said, amongst other things, in a public speech a little while ago on this subject. I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our aim is simply to bring in tourists to South Africa, and for three good reasons: (1) Foreign visitors spend money here and thus help to boost our much-needed foreign exchange reserves; (2) to provided all the facilities required by tourists, both from abroad and domestically, gives rise to investment and employment on a big scale and so boosts economic development for all in South Africa &#x2026;</block>

<p>My guess is&#x2014;and here I am sticking out my neck; we are trying to work out a reliable figure&#x2014;that the amount invested in our hotels in South Africa today must almost certainly exceed R600 million. If you weigh that up, Sir, I think you will agree that that is a very big investment in only one part of the tourist industry. I went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(<i>3</i>) The great majority of tourists go home with a better appreciation of our problems and better disposed towards us, thus contributing to a better understanding abroad for our country and its versatile and friendly people.</block>

<p>If you ask me. Sir, which is the single most important of these three reasons, I would say the last one. I then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But we should at the same time take care that we do not place an intolerable strain on the transport, accommodation, catering, entertainment and other essential services demanded by tourists.</block>

<p><span class="col_8089-8090" refersTo="page_1112"/>*This point was raised by the hon. member for De Aar, and I think also by the hon. member for Oudtshoorn and others, i.e. that we must not try to move too quickly. I went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The stepping up of the number of tourists must go hand in hand with the provision of all the necessary amenities and facilities, with supply and demand forming the cornerstone of a modem, up-to-date tourist industry. Our master plan, if I may call it that, is aimed to provide accommodation for all those visitors who can enjoy South Africa&#x2019;s long hours of sunshine, warm clear seas, magnificent inland and mountain scenery and incomparable game parks, but it should not stake its future on what is called the mass tourism market. It should concentrate rather on attracting visitors who will choose South Africa for its special and outstanding qualities. Finally, the comparatively long distances from South Africa of our chief tourist supply centres and the corresponding high cost of travelling involved tend to ensure that visitors coming to our country are in fact <i>bona fide</i> tourists, and that is perhaps no bad thing in the complicated world in which we live today. What I am trying to say is that we most constantly think of ways and means of developing tourism to South Africa and in South Africa simply because it makes sense to do so, but the development should be carried out in a way that ensures the protection and the enhancement of our natural, historical, aesthetic and other environmental values.</block>

<p>I have thought it fit, Sir, just to read these few paragraphs to you. This is how I generally see the matter. I immediately want to express my appreciation towards those of my colleagues who have stressed here that we must conserve nature. One hon. member spoke about the charm of nature. These are beautiful words to me. Someone else said that nature was our greatest asset. I think we should always observe this. I also immediately want to express my appreciation for the co-operation we are receiving from the National Parks Board and from other bodies that are concerned with the conservation of our wild life and our natural beauty. I think we are very fortunate in having this fine co-operation with other departments and Government bodies.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then perhaps I could just say that, talking of domestic tourism, I believe that the regional tourist offices, &#x201C;die streekkomitees&#x201D;, have a very important part to play in developing this whole industry. I am not sure that we are in fact using them or have been using them to their full potential. I can assure hon. members on both sides of the House, because it was raised by both sides, that this is something we are looking at very carefully at the moment. Our aim is to give these bodies the opportunity to be as effective as they would like to be because their interest and their dedication to the cause of tourism is something which is very good to see. I have met a number of these people and I believe that they are going to play a very big part.</p>

<p>The question has arisen from time to time whether these bodies, these regional tourists bodies, should fall under the central Government, i.e. under the Department of Tourism, or should they not perhaps be under the provinces. This matter has been discussed a good deal. I should like to say that after giving it the most careful thought over many months and talking to very many people who are involved in this matter, I have become convinced myself that there is a great need that there should be overall co-ordination over these regional bodies from the centre, from the Department of Tourism, but I believe at the same time that we can make more effective use of the provinces in this regard. We are doing everything possible, and will be in the next few months, to make this co-ordination and co-operation with the provinces a much more effective thing. I have not the slightest doubt that we will have the full co-operation of the provinces. I am sure of it, and I believe that this will be a very great factor in developing what we call domestic tourism a great deal more than we have been able to do up to now. I mention that in order to clarify that issue and I want to say immediately that I believe the provinces have a much bigger role to play, and I am sure they will play it.</p>

<p>Then the question was raised about a national conference on tourism. I should like to say that my department is busy with that very matter at the moment, and has been for some time. But it takes a good deal of time to organize a national conference in an industry which consists of so many different parts. We are busy with it. We will organize this national conference if not towards the end of this year, then early in the new year. I hope that it will be a <span class="col_8091-8092" refersTo="page_1113"/>very successful and a very wide-ranging one, because I agree that the time is ripe when we should get all the different parts of this rather wide-ranging industry together and have a thorough, open discussion of what the problems are and how best to achieve the aim we all want, which is a first-class tourist industry. That is on the drawing board; it is more than on the drawing board&#x2014;the detailed arrangements are well in hand.</p>

<p>I might just mention that when I spoke of the provinces and the provinces&#x2019; role in domestic tourism, I should also like to say that I think a very important role is being played and will be played by the publicity associations. They are part of the mechanism of the tourist structure. I met the national chairman of the publicity associations and certain of his senior officials a week or two ago. I can assure the Committee that we had extremely constructive detailed discussions. I believe that we were talking very much the same language throughout. I have mentioned the National Parks Board.</p>

<p>*Now I also want to refer briefly to the National Transport Commission which was mentioned here, and the Department of Transport which plays such an important part in our tourist industry. I immediately want to say that our relations on the part of the Department of Tourism with these bodies are of the best. I personally and some of my senior officials have on various occasions and especially during the past few months had discussions with the hon. the Minister of Transport, the Deputy Minister of Transport and some of their senior officials. To me those discussions have been very valuable, and I have no doubt that they will have very good results. I feel that we are receiving the fullest cooperation there, and I should like to mention this here.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Talking about transport, I should like to say that the air hotel plan, as it is called, this recent plan which has been mentioned here and which was introduced by the South African Airways to incorporate travel within the country with a holiday in a particular place, for instance taking a group of tourists from Cape Town to Durban to spend a week in Durban and then bringing them back, is working exceptionally well. It was only started recently, but it is having a tremendous success. I can say that only the other night I talked to the chairman of one of our biggest hotel groups and he mentioned this as one of the best developments in recent years that he could remember. I should therefore like to express my appreciation to the South African Airways and the Department of Transport for this latest and further practical indication of their interest in tourism.</p>

<p>While I am on that, I should like to mention the fact that we are criticized from time to time because we do not encourage chartered flights. It is said that this is something which is used widely throughout the world. That is true. We are criticized from time to time that we do not give overmuch encouragement to chartered flights. Well, there are good reasons why we cannot encourage what I like to call some of the fly-by-night enterprises where somebody books a plane. Later the persons who have made bookings through him find that there is no plane available and that he has absconded in the meantime. We had these things. During the course of this session the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport piloted a Bill through Parliament to amend the relevant Act in order to make it possible for the Department of Transport to deal with such pirate operators who do no good to anybody and least of all to our tourist trade. I think that is something which we support very strongly from our side. I just want to mention that whilst we may not have a great number of these charter flights, we have developed, through the S.A. Airways, group tours which are working well and which are extremely popular. I can tell hon. members that provision is made today for group tours to South Africa, consisting of not less than ten passengers, whereby you can actually get a return ticket say, from London to Johannesburg, for R319. I think hon. members will agree with me that it is an exceptionally competitive figure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Why can this not be applicable to group tours from Johannesburg to London and back&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it can be done, but our great aim is of course to attract people from abroad to South Africa. People are very eager to travel abroad, but we want to attract them to South Africa. I want to tell hon. members that if you take a group tour with not less than 20 passengers you can get a return ticket from London to Johannesburg for R275. I doubt whether you can beat these rates anywhere <span class="col_8093-8094" refersTo="page_1114"/>in the world. I have been trying to get figures for a comparison, I do not think that you can beat them. While I am talking about group tours I can also mention that from New York&#x2014;which after all is a long way away&#x2014;to Johannesburg, if you have a group of 15 passengers, the tariff is R522. This is the price of a return ticket from New York, while the price of a return ticket from Rio de Janeiro is R436. The last-mentioned tariff is a little bit higher than the rest, but it is a new service and the group tour has to be developed a great deal more. I want to suggest that those are extremely competitive rates and that when we talk of charter flights, we must keep this development in mind.</p>

<p>*1 do not want to speak much longer, and shall just have a quick look at my notes. I have dealt with Sartoc, but I still want to say something in connection with research, an aspect which was raised by the hon. member for East London City. I think that research in this industry is a very important aspect. We are improving our research service. There are quite a number of aspects of this industry which have to be studied more accurately on a continuous basis. Perhaps we will need a little more money for that.</p>

<p>As regards the recommendations made by the Riekert Report. I have already covered certain aspects. I just want to say that as regards the registration of private accommodation, which was mentioned by the hon. member, the department went much further. The department investigated all the tourist attractions and affairs. It had a look at transport, accommodation, and even entertainment, and has made surveys on a large scale. Those figures are now being processed. I hope that the results arising from this will mean a great deal to us. I can just tell the hon. member that we are working on that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In regard to the dual control of hotels, I must admit that I could not hear the hon. member too clearly. I think he had in mind something like the Hotel Board with certain functions and possibly the Liquor Board with certain functions. Of course there is a long history attached to this and one cannot simply try and change these historical structures overnight &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; that is to say if they have to be changed. What I can say is that I have the closest association and co-operation with my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Justice, under whom the Liquor Board resides and we have had many discussions on these matters. When problems crop up we get together and the impression that I have is that we are getting a much smoother functioning as we go along. I am quite sure that both of us will continue to give this very close attention. If I say that we have done this on 10 occasions during the last few months, I do not think that I am exaggerating. Therefore, I can answer that question in that sense.</p>

<p>No, it is not really a question of double staff. There are different aims involved.

<p>No, What we are trying to do is to get a much more co-ordinated approach and to streamline the inspection services.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Stellenbosch referred to the Indian market in Durban which unfortunately has burnt down. He pointed out that it was a very important tourist attraction. That is true. Especially anybody from Natal would know how true that is. I referred to this on Wednesday during the discussion of the Vote Indian Affairs, I do not want to say much more about it. I feel that everything is ready now for the establishment of temporary facilities on the old market premises; everything is <span class="col_8095-8096" refersTo="page_1115"/>there. The hon. the Minister of Finance has agreed to our making available R100 000 for the creation of temporary facilities. The Departments of Community Development and of Public Works, and everybody else are ready to help, and I really hope that the Durban City Council will now without further delay set to work to erect that building. It is said that I have agreed to any temporary facilities standing for three years only and no longer, but I am sorry to have to say here that that is not so. I never agreed to that point at all, because, if nothing further can be done about the matter within the next two or three years and we have to demolish that temporary building, we will again be without an Indian market, and that is a state of affairs which I would not like to see at all. I think that our Indian population deserves better than that. I just want to repeat that everything is ready and that we are hoping that within the next few days the erection of that building will have been started. Then the Indians will again be able to use those stands which are so important to them and which are so important for the tourist industry as well, because that market attracted thousands upon thousands of tourists annually, not only from everywhere in South Africa, but also from abroad.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Are you going to move the inner ring road&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. I may just say that the hon. member for Zululand mentioned the other day that the police had objected and that that was one of the reasons why the Durban City Council had not started on the temporary building. However, that is not so. The police have raised no objection whatsoever to a temporary building being erected. As far as the inner ring road is concerned, it is going to take up only a small corner of what we call the whole present Indian Market area. Indeed, it was the Mayor of Durban who recommended in discussions that we should use the old Indian Market site, leaving out the part to be taken up by the road. In other words, he agreed with the strong representations I made on that point. That road will take up only a small part of the whole area that is available.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia made some very constructive proposals, if I may say so. He talked about the Reynders Commissions&#x2019; recommendations for encouraging exports by means of export allowances and hoped that something might be done to use that mechanism to encourage the tourist trade and to bring tourists into the country; in other words, to encourage those people who make it their job to bring tourists into the country. I may say that that matter was raised with the Department of Commerce by my department. It is under discussion by the Department of Commerce and we are looking forward very much indeed to the outcome. We certainly feel that that is a very useful proposal and we have been busy with it for some time.</p>

<p>The other point the hon. member raised was in connection with the Tourism Advisory Committee, commonly known as T.A.C. The hon. member said that this might be a statutory body and that it should be fully representative of a whole number of bodies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>As recommended in the report.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. But we do not feel there is a great deal wrong with the structure of the department, that is to say, with the department as such, and Satour, an autonomous corporation which is the specialist body outside the country and which has to promote the bringing of tourists to South Africa. It is doing a very fine job. We have the Hotel Board which deals with the accommodation aspect and the advisory body which my predecessor formed and to which he appointed a number of people. I must say that my own view, for what it is worth, is that I do not think this should be a statutory body because we have a statutory body, namely the department. Satour is also a statutory body and so is the Hotel Board. These are the operating bodies. T.A.C. is a purely advisory body. What we can do when the <span class="col_8097-8098" refersTo="page_1116"/>time comes is to look at the composition, and if it is necessary to broaden it, we can certainly do that. I would merely like to say that T.A.C. has been showing a lot of interest in tourist problems and has put up a number of recommendations some of which we have already been able to implement; others we are discussing with a large number of departments and other interests which are concerned.</p>

<p>*This is something we must not lose sight of. It may prove easy to bring about a change, but then one should keep in mind that this may often be far-reaching in its implications. There are many other bodies and departments which must not only be consulted, but whose agreement and cooperation must be obtained before those changes can be made. We are, however, working on this matter, and will in time publish its results.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now want to come back for a moment to the remarks made by some hon. friends that we must be careful not to move too fast. I have here a rather interesting little reference. It is a Press report which appeared in an overseas newspaper. It was picked up by <i>The Star</i> at the end of last year. It is called &#x201C;Tourism Turned Sour&#x201D;. What is interesting is that they refer to Spain, because Spain is the country where in recent years tourism has really taken off, that is to say the bringing in of tourists from outside Spain. Let me just say that we must remember that Spain is right in the middle of Europe. It costs less for a German family to take their holiday in Spain, including air fare, than it does for them to stay at home. The cost of living there is low and travel is cheap, with the result that Spain is said to have had 29 million tourists from abroad last year. I believe that figure is exaggerated because they pick up these figures mainly through the returns of hotels. It is quite clear that a good deal of overlapping and double counting take place. Nevertheless, the number of tourists runs into millions. This is a report from Spain. It deals with these huge figures, and then reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Yet Spain is beginning to survey the situation rather ruefully. Largely because of tourism, accompanied by industrialization, 60% of all Spaniards in Spain now live permanently in urban areas, whereas less than ten years ago, the figure was 44%.</block>

<p>The majority then still lived in the rural areas. That position has changed overnight. The report continues:</p>

<block name="quote">High-rise blocks of apartments, huge hotels, litter and pollution are ruining stretches of her loveliest coastline. Pretty fishing villages have become concrete jungles in a few years. The Balearic Islands, among the finest of Spanish resorts, are undergoing the same horrifying process. They have had more than two million visitors already in this year. (1972). The answer surely is less dependence on tourism and more attention to internal tourism for their own people.</block>

<p>I think this is the sort of warning of which we ought to take cognizance in good time. We have not come anywhere near that position in this country. We are doing everything possible to develop our tourist industry, both from outside and in the country, but we certainly are not going to allow our great cultural and traditional heritage in this country to be ploughed under in the process. Certainly, we will not allow our wonderful natural endowments and beauty to be impaired or harmed in the process. But I think that must be very strongly stated.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I have not replied to all the points that were raised. There are a few others, but I really do not want to take up too much of your time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District spoke about skiing. This is, of course, really a sport, but I have noted what he has said and I will certainly have a chat with my hon. colleague, the Minister of Sport. We have discussed these matters in detail in the last few years. It is a very costly scheme to build a proper skirun. I had some experience of the problem when I was assisting with these matters in Lesotho a few years ago. I merely wish to say that I will follow it up again and certainly talk to the hon. Minister of Sport.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown talked about small boats and yachting harbours, and of the need to develop these assets. <span class="col_8099-8100" refersTo="page_1117"/>I agree with him. I used to own a yacht myself at one time, until I ran aground and ruined it. I would merely like to say that only in the last few weeks the Department of Industries called a meeting of a whole number of interested bodies. I was told that they had a very thorough discussion. The matter is therefore very much under discussion, and my department is one of those instances involved. I hope something can come of the discussions.</p>

<p>*Then I come to the last point. The hon. member for Pretoria District raised a very interesting point here i.e. that the farmers and farming should become closer involved with the tourist industry. We already have a kind of register of farmers who are interested and to whom we are sending certain tourists from abroad. These tourists deeply appreciate what they see there. We are therefore working on this, and we are going to develop that aspect considerably yet. I can assure the hon. member that this is something which is important to me. Also I find it wonderful that the tourists from overseas are able to get acquainted with our excellent country people, and realize what real hospitality and friendliness mean.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F; Is the hon. the Minister prepared to use the services of Mr. Steyn in Satour&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I have two more points to deal with. The hon. member for Orange Grove raised the question of a tourist guide book. Sir, we have a great number of publications coming out. We may perhaps not have an omnibus publication at the moment to cover the whole tourist trade in detail. That would be a very costly undertaking; it would have to be given out on quite a big scale. I will certainly discuss this with the department and with Satour, both of which are involved. I think the Hotel Board is also involved. Between us&#x2014;and perhaps we can even bring in the provinces and the publicity associations&#x2014;we will see what we can do. I think the time is arriving for us to consider some sort of single all-inclusive publication. We will look into the practicability of this.</p>

<p>Then I come to the last point, which was raised by the hon. member for Simonstown. The hon. member suggested that we should make use of the services of Mr. Vladimir Steyn who, he said, was one of the most experienced people in tourism in South Africa. I think he suggested specifically that we might put him on the board of Satour. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to go into this issue at this moment. As you know, Sir, there is a long history attached to this. Mr. Steyn was in the department. He is not in the department at the moment. It has not occurred to me that I should try to bring him back, either in the department or in Satour or somewhere else, and I think the hon. member for Simonstown would have to give me very compelling reasons to cause me to change my mind at this moment. But I do not want to go into that now; I will be happy to discuss it with him if he wants to pursue the matter.</p>

<p>Amendment to Revenue Vote No. 13 (Defence):</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this Vote calls for an amount of R25 million as a contribution to the Defence Special Equipment Account and comprises well over half the total amount of R42 million which we are being asked to vote this afternoon. This is a large amount, in addition to a record Defence Budget, the largest that South Africa has ever had, getting close to R500 million. Although I appreciate that the hon. the Minister of Defence is not here but is enjoying a well-earned few days&#x2019; break in Europe, I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will be able to enlighten us on the need for this additional R25 million which brings our contribution to the Defence Special Equipment Fund to over R102 million this year. Until I have heard the explanation, I will leave the matter with the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am acting on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of Defence, while he is in Europe. [Interjection.] Unfortunately there is only small game to shoot over there! Sir, there are certain matters which cannot, of course, be discussed in public. I would very much like to give the Committee the information for which the hon. member asks, but I am afraid that it would not be in the public interest to do so. The hon. member has been dealing with defence matters over a period of many years, and he will realize that there are certain matters which must be treated as confidential. I would not mind giving the information to him personally, but I do not think it would be advisable to discuss this additional amount of R25 million across the floor of the House. I hope the hon. member will be satisfied with that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the reply of the hon. the Minister of Transport, the Acting Minister of Defence, is of course quite understandable and acceptable in so far as it reflects the factual position. However, it reflects exactly the dilemma which we pointed out in the debate on the Main Vote, and that is the fact that it is not <span class="col_8105-8106" refersTo="page_1120"/>possible to discuss matters of this nature across the floor of tht House. I appreciate, and it would be irresponsible not to appreciate, that this sort of expenditure cannot be discussed openly but I believe that we cannot let this occasion pass without emphasizing the fact that unless we can create proper machinery for consultation and for co-operation between the Government and the Opposition we are not doing our job properly as Parliament by blithely voting an amount of R25 million as we do now. We are not going to object to it. We accept it. If the hon. the Minister could even have told us perhaps that this was because some equipment had come forward sooner than had been anticipated, or that new developments had taken place which required the unexpected placing of orders, it would have helped, but even then the hon. the Minister cannot give us this information because it would not be in the interests of the country. I therefore again take the opportunity to place on record the offer of this side of the House to co-operate in regard to matters of defence so that we can avoid the sort of situation which is highlighted by the Vote we are now being asked to pass.</p>

<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

<p>Amendments to Revenue Vote No. 16 (Bantu Administration and Development) and S.W.A. Vote No. 6 (Bantu Administration and Development):</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Under subhead H there is an increase of R1 200 000 for pensions and <i>ex gratia</i> assistance to needy Bantu. Could we perhaps know the reason for that&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Both this and the additional money voted, under the other Vote which the Chairman has mentioned, are for the same purpose. This arises from the announcement of the hon. the Minister of Finance in connection with the review of pensions, children&#x2019;s allowances, foster parent allowances and all such social assistance that is now being increased. It represents an amount of R1,2 million which is needed for this. The amounts are now being increased by R9 and R12.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would please give us information regarding the additional amount of R1 000 to be added under subhead N, grant-in-aid to the S.A. Bantu Trust Fund. At the same time, can he give us any information at all as to why we should vote almost R2 million more under subhead O as payments for the Governments in the Bantu areas&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The R1 000 is required for the same purpose as that to which I referred in answer to the hon. member for Pinelands. It is in respect of pension increases to the Bantu in the Eastern Caprivi.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>R1 000&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but it is only the additional amount, flowing from what the hon. the Minister of Finance announced during his Budget speech. Then, with regard to &#x201C;O&#x201D;, the supplementary amount is R1.96 million. That is in respect of the Bantu Governments in the Transkei, the Ciskei, Bophuthatswana, Lebowa, Venda, Kasamkulu, KwaZulu and Basotho-QwaQwa. It is all for the some purpose, but the hon. member will understand that in respect of old-age pensions, etc., the payments are undertaken by the Governments of the homelands concerned and the money is therefore voted under quite a different subhead.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I hope, Sir, you will allow me to revert to the first point which the hon. the Minister answered me upon, when he pointed out that under subhead H the increase of R1,2 million was in respect of pensions, <i>ex gratia</i> assistance, etc., to Bantu, and that it was largely explained by the fact that the amount of pension had been increased from R9 to R12 a month.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. You will appreciate, Sir, that the increase from R9 to R12 is appreciably greater than the <span class="col_8107-8108" refersTo="page_1121"/>increase from R15 million to R16 million in round figures. Would the hon. the Minister just give us a little more detail so that we can see how it ties up&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is in respect of pensions and <i>ex gratia</i> assistance being granted to needy Bantu under subhead H. As I have said, in his Budget Speech the hon. the Minister of Finance announced that these concessions to social pensioners and beneficiaries in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act would come into force from 1st October this year. He also indicated that these concessions are also being proposed for the non-Whites. These increases of social pensions and allowances in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act, as I have just said, respectively amount to R12 and R9 per person per year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, is the hon. the Minister trying to tell us that the total amount of R3,186 million which we are being asked to vote now is made up in payments of pensions, <i>ex gratia</i> allowances, children&#x2019;s allowances, etc., in terms of the increases announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech, or is there something else involved here&#x003F; Can the hon. the Minister tell us what the position is&#x003F; The reply which he has given seems to indicate that all four of these amounts are in respect of either increased pensions or increased allowances or in respect of subhead K for increased children&#x2019;s allowances. Is it the position that this total of R3,186 million is for social services&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<p>The amount of R1,2 million. This amount is in respect of pensions and children&#x2019;s allowances paid out by my department in the White areas. This amount is not in respect of pensions and children&#x2019;s allowances payable in the homelands.</p>

<p>The new amount is R12 in the case of pensions and R9 in the case of children&#x2019;s allowances. Under subhead H there is also provision for child care, and for this an additional amount of R24 000 is being requested. Under subhead N&#x2014;grant-in-aid to the South African Bantu Trust Fund&#x2014;an additional R1 000 is being requested. I referred to that a while ago. In addition there is also subhead O.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The Bantu Trust in turn gives it to the Caprivi authority for pension purposes. There is also an amount of R1,9 million that is intended for the Bantu Governments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister if he would please give us the reason for the increase of R200 000 in respect of financial aid to trade missions to and from the Republic. Would he also explain the new item &#x201C;Renting of warehouses by exporters for the storage of goods abroad&#x201D;&#x003F; Perhaps he could deal with those items first.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<p>Mr. Chairman, these proposals, or the majority of them, arise from the recommendations of the Reynders Commission for the promotion of exports. I am under the impression that we have already covered this field fairly well, not only during the Budget debate, but also during discussion of my Vote. The hon. member asked me two questions. In the first place <span class="col_8109-8110" refersTo="page_1122"/>he asked a question about the addition of the amount of R200 000 for trade missions. At the moment there is an amount of R55 000 in the Estimates for trade missions. It was thought fit to give additional financing to selected trade missions. Consequently the amount of R55 000 will not be enough. I may add that this provision if not only intended for trade missions from South Africa, but also for importers of South African goods from other countries. They can obtain assistance in this way in cases where such missions to South Africa are approved by our overseas trade missions.</p>

<p>Next the hon. member spoke about the additional amount of R250 000 which is necessary for the renting of warehouses. Hon. members will understand that it is essential for exporters to keep their products overseas readily available. To meet those needs it is essential to rent warehouses overseas and to maintain them over there for the storage of goods, so that they may be made available there easily. As part of our whole endeavour to promote exports, it has been decided that assistance will also be granted for the renting of warehouses overseas so that exporters can store their products there more easily and can keep them there for provision to the people who buy from them. Provision is being made for an amount of R250 000 in that connection.</p>

<p>Under Vote 20, Item G, where additional expenditure amounting to R5 350 000 is to be voted, there is an item &#x201C;Cost of electricity used for the refining of base minerals&#x201D; for which an additional amount of R2 million is required. I wonder if the hon. the Minister would be good enough to enlighten the House as to the reason why this additional amount is in fact called for.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think it is common cause with us that we should refine our minerals to a greater extent before we export them. It was felt that it would be an encouragement if we gave assistance to this refining process; in fact, I think that was one of the recommendations of the Reynders Commission. Thereby we could earn more with our refined minerals than we could otherwise do. Consequently provision is being made under this subhead for financial assistance for the use of electricity in the process of the refining of minerals. This applies specifically to minerals that are exported. Hon. members will understand that the use of electricity is a very big item in the expenditure connected with the refining of minerals. We trust that in this way we shall stimulate the refining of our minerals, particularly those that are exported.</p>

<p>No, to begin with it is being done solely to promote exports. It is not for refining in general. In other words, it is not applicable to refining for South African use. Initially, therefore, this will only be for export purposes. In the case of exports, each separate case will be dealt with on merit, but the particular rules and regulations that will apply have not yet specifically been worked out. We suspect that with this little bit of help we shall be able to achieve quite a bit for the refining process in respect of promoting our exports.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I know, but I just want to explain to you. Provision is already being made for that amount in the Budget, and it is intended for the promotion of exports, to help the exporters of products to get their products from the interior to the harbours. You will now also appreciate that there are certain manufacturers or industrialists who are situated in the harbour cities, who receive no help by way of this measure relating to railway transport as a result of the fact that they are situated in the harbour cities. Therefore it has been decided to help those industrialists, who are in the harbour cities and who could also possibly export, to also stimulate their exports, not by subsidizing them in respect of the transport of the products they manufacture, but to subsidize them in respect of the raw materials they need and which must come from the interior to their factories for the manufacturing of the products that must be exported at a later stage. The amount is now being increased for that purpose. Provision is now being made under this head for a further R1.5 million which is additional to the R22 300 000 in respect of railway tariff aid for which provision has already been made.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister, in reply to my first question, indicated that these matters had either been dealt with in the Budget or in discussions we have had on the Votes. I do not find this to be the case. I find the first and second items to be extensions of items which we have already dealt with in the House, but succeeding items for which supplementary amounts of R500 000, R250 000. R200 000, R200 000, R2 million and R1,5 million are to be voted appear to me to be new concepts to improve our exports&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Minister will please correct me if I am wrong. For example, with reference to the item he has just told us about: the original item in the Budget provided for help in respect of the export of goods fabricated in South Africa. Now there is an extension of that thinking; we are now going to help people who manufacture goods for export at the coast by giving them special railway tariffs for the transport of raw materials from the interior to the coast. The same applies in respect of all the other items. These are new concepts to help us to increase our exports of manufactured goods from South Africa. I just want to clear this with the hon. the Minister so that we have no misunderstandings. These are things that have only become apparent today. These are new facilities being given to exporters. I say this because I think it is important that the exporters should know these things. If we are going to say they are matters we have already dealt with, a lot of this new help and these new facilities will not become apparent to exporters. I would just like clarity on the general principle of these items from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that is quite correct. These items, or rather most of them, have not appeared before in the Estimates. Consequently we have not yet discussed them. All that I meant was that with the discussion of my Vote we had a detailed discussion on the recommendations of the Reynders Commission. I then mentioned that certain items already appeared in the Main Estimates, as printed. I also mentioned that additional assistance in respect of various items had been approved by the Government, and that provision would be made for certain expenditure. This is merely the implementation of what I said at the time, which is now appearing in the Supplementary Estimates.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is just one question I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. May one infer from the last item of R1,5 million that the Government has accepted the principle that since the Railways has to make sacrifices in the interests of the country the losses should be borne, not by the Railways, but by the Consolidated Revenue Fund&#x003F; This is a very important principle which is in fact being applied here, and I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister would react to my question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member ought to put this question to the Minister of Transport. The fact of the matter in this instance is that certain tariffs have been laid down by the Railways for the conveyance of specific products. If we want to stimulate the export of those products and we want to make a distinction between the same products which are being conveyed for internal consumption and those which <span class="col_8113-8114" refersTo="page_1124"/>are being conveyed to the coast for export purposes, we have to find some method or other of conveying those goods to the coast for export purposes more cheaply. That is all we are doing here. The Railways Administration does not see its way clear to making all these additional special concessions. Until recently special concessions were made by the Railways Administration, and it is in fact still the case today that certain reductions are allowed by the Railways Administration. But the Reynders Commission specifically recommended that to the extent to which the Railways Administration did not see its way clear to granting the necessary reductions in respect of export goods, the Government should make additional provision for that purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to the expenditure in respect of joint market research abroad by industrial organizations, marketing boards and similar organizations&#x2014;which amounts to R200 000 &#x2014;I want to ask in the first place whether this amount is being determined on a percentage basis. Secondly, reference is made to &#x201C;similar organizations&#x201D;, and I should like to inquire what organizations are being referred to here.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to begin with, these two items are in connection with market research. The first amount is for R200 000, and the second as well. The Reynders Commission made a recommendation in this respect as well, viz. that when market research is done abroad, 40% of the costs of such market research should be subsidized by the Government. The hon. member could imagine now that in certain cases&#x2014; and for that reason there are two items&#x2014; it is an individual enterprise doing such market research, while in other cases joint market research efforts are made by enterprises of a uniform kind. In that case provision is also being made now for a 40% subsidy in respect of such research. In this connection I want to mention the following particulars. It has to be collective market research by, <i>inter alia,</i> industrial organizations or agricultural marketing boards. It goes without saying that the amount is not unlimited, and that every application has to be considered on its own merits.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, Vote 21 calls for an additional amount of R301 000. Subhead H, &#x201C;Miscellaneous Contributions, Grants-in-Aid and Subsidies&#x201D;, makes up a third of the total. The specific item refers to an &#x201C;interest subsidy in respect of loans to export industries&#x201D; which amounts to R101 000. I wonder if the hon. the Minister would enlarge upon the need for this particular amount.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in Loan Vote J of these supplementary estimates provision is being made for a loan amount of R3 million, which will be made available to the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, Limited, to finance with that money the expansion of industries or to finance new industries specifically intended for export purposes. This R3 million has been made available for that purpose, and the amount of R101 000 to which the hon. member referred is intended to subsidize the rates of interest on those loans, so that it will be possible for these industries for export purposes to obtain such loans more cheaply. In part the loans will be made available at a lower rate of interest by the IDC, and in part it will be subsidized from this R101 000, for which provision is now being made. Mr. Kitshoff made an announcement in this connection earlier this year, to the effect that the rate of interest payable will move on a sliding scale from, for example, 8,5% to 5%, depending on what percentage of the products to be manufactured in such a factory are going to be exported. In other words, if the percentage being exported is low, the rate of interest will be high; and if the percentage being exported is high, the rate of interest will be low. That is to say, rates of interest will move on a sliding scale and will be reduced as a greater percentage of the products of a factory or of the expansion of a particular factory financed in this way is exported.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the hon. the Minister why it has <span class="col_8115-8116" refersTo="page_1125"/>been necessary to introduce as a separate item this loan to the Industrial Development Corporation of R3 million for the development of export industries. Surely this should be a natural part of the activities of the Industrial Development Corporation&#x003F; Their function is to assist established industries and to assist in the establishment of new industries, which they consider to be essential or necessary for the economic development of South Africa. This is the function of the IDC as it was originally contemplated. The aims of the corporation have expanded a little since those days, until today it covers practically everything. I am curious to know why we have to have a special item for the IDC to deal with the development of export industries. I would have thought that this was a part of its normal operations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must agree with the hon. member that one would expect the IDC to make funds available for the expansion of industries from time to time as part of its normal operations. But, in regard to this special effort which is now being made to effect special expansion for the purposes of an increase in exports, because the interest rates are low, it surely goes without saying that one must now expect more funds to be required. It is because it is expected that the IDC will require more funds for financing that provision is now being made for this additional R3 million.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the past the IDC has, in regard to border industries, always loaned capital at inexpensive rates of interest, particularly with a view to exports. Is this amount now intended for the non-border industries&#x003F; After all, an additional loan of R3 million to the IDC to promote exports in itself means nothing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this money is being made available for any industrial loan approved by the IDC. But surely it goes without saying&#x2014;it is as clear as crystal &#x2014;that, if we want to stimulate and promote our exports, we have to make money more cheaply available to industries as part of the process. Because one is making money more cheaply available, there is a greater demand for money. For that reason the IDC needs more money. It is as simple as that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister is on the wrong track here, Mr. Chairman. The amount of R101 000 in Vote No. 21 is completely understandable; he wants to lend money via the IDC, where the exporter will be able to borrow at a lower rate of interest, and to this we subscribe. But, Sir, the IDC gets globular sums from us from time to time. I think the hon. the Minister may run into trouble by segregating amounts specially for exports because under his Loan Vote he now has Head No. 6, which is specifically earmarked for the development of export industries. I do not see any reason for doing this. I think the hon. the Minister may be tying his own hands, because this sum of R3 million which is to be voted now is limited to the development of export industries. One would imagine that this presupposes that the other funds, which he already has at his disposal in the IDC, cannot be used for this purpose because you are now creating a new heading. I think the hon. the Minister may find that instead of expanding what he wants to do, by doing it this way, he is going to curtail what he wants to do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the difference is this: The usual method by means of which money is made available to the IDC by the Government is by way of share capital which the Government takes up with the IDC. This money is being made available for this specific purpose by way of a loan; in other words, not as share capital which the Government pays into the IDC, but by way of a loan, and for that reason it consequently appears as a loan to the IDC, which in its turn makes the money available to the industries, but this money is in turn repayable by the IDC.</p>

<p>Sir, here we are being asked to vote an additional amount of R4 822 million under various sub-heads. We are aware of the fact that the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated in the course of his Budget speech that some of these items would mean increases in certain pensions with effect from 1st October, 1973. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_8117-8118" refersTo="page_1126"/>Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions whether these increases are all to be effective from 1st October, 1973. I refer here to the subhead &#x201C;Child Welfare&#x201D;, R744 000, and subhead R, &#x201C;Care of the Aged and Infirm&#x201D;, R23 000. I should like to know whether the increased <i>per capita</i> subsidies in respect of child welfare are to be effective from the 1st October, 1973, or whether they will come into operation with retrospective effect from the 1st April of this year. Sir, the other point which I would like to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister is whether the means test applicable to the payment of these social pensions is to remain completely unaltered. I refer particularly to the income ceiling of R58 per month, which was imposed last year in view of the amount paid to civil pensioners and railway pensioners. I understand that an increase has been granted to both civil pensioners and railway pensioners, and I should like to know whether this income ceiling of R58 per month is to be reviewed, which would permit these higher amounts to be paid to a greater number of persons in receipt of these pensions.</p>

<p>Then under Vote No. 16, &#x201C;South-West Africa&#x201D;, provision is made under Item J, &#x201C;General Welfare Services&#x201D;, for a grant-in-aid of R85 000 to the Hardap disaster fund.

This year there is no such increase, but it is being contemplated to effect another increase in the future. Then, with regard to the Hardap Fund, Sir, you will recall that it was a case where an amount was made available by the department and another amount by the public.

<p>Last year R16,2 million was paid over to the Equalization Fund for export losses. Overseas prices of maize have risen to such an extent that we did not suffer the losses originally estimated. This year, with the determination of the maize price, the Mealie Board had a proposition of a 50 cents deferred payment on last years&#x2019; crop. This would have meant that part of the Government&#x2019;s contribution to the export loss last year would have to be used for a deferred payment, but the Government felt that this would not be the right thing to do. Part of that R16,2 million was used for a consumers&#x2019; subsidy and R10 million as an interest-free loan to the Mealie Board, in order to enable it to pay the 50 cents deferred payment to the farmers.

<p>The supplementary amount, as the hon. member has said, is R2 351 000. This represents the increase of R2 per month in the pensions of all pensioners as well as an increase of R1-50 per month for children&#x2019;s homes and foster parent allowances. Then, too, there has been a relaxation in the income ceiling. Previously it was R96; now it is R252. There we lose about R461 000. The first amount is R1 843 600 and the second R461 400. and then, too, there was another anomaly which we had to rectify. Since last year Indians have been paid R1-25 more in parent allowances than Coloureds. This year we want to rectify this by paying 50 cents more to Coloureds. This involves an amount of R46 000, and this gives one the total amount. As far as South-West Africa is concerned, it really amounts basically to the same thing. We have the foster parent allowances which are to be increased as from 1st October this year. This is really for Coloureds and Basters. As yet the Namas do not qualify for foster parent allowances. This, however, is something which will develop in the course of time. The amount required for foster parent allowances, is R2 000. Then, too, we have an amount of R50 000 made up of the increase in ordinary pensions of R2 per pensioner. In this instance the Namas receive R2-50 per pensioner because in their case there was a wide gap between their pensions and those of the Coloureds and Bantu. That gap is now being narrowed in that the Namas are receiving 50 cents more than the others. In the case of South-West Africa the total supplementary amount is R52 000.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I notice an entirely new item on the Supplementary Estimates and for which an amount of R100 000 is to be appropriated. I refer to subhead E and the item thereunder, &#x201C;Contribution towards the re-erection of the Indian Market, Durban&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister has already touched on this matter at an earlier stage this afternoon, but I wonder whether he will tell us a little more about this item. One knows that there is apparently a misunderstanding or difference of opinion between the mayor of Durban and the hon. the Minister as to precisely what was agreed upon in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s office in Cape Town. That is not something on which I can comment because I was not there, but according to a Press statement published on the 2nd June the hon. the Minister has agreed that this amount should come from the Government as a subsidy, and according to the White Paper before us, towards the re-erection of the Indian Market. So far as the White Paper is concerned, there is no mention of it being of a temporary structure, but according to the Press statement of the hon. the Minister, as he is therein reported, this money is intended to go towards the erection of a temporary structure. The hon. the Minister is reported as having said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was a matter of urgency to cooperate with the Durban City Council and the South African Indian Council to find an equitable and efficient permanent solution to this problem.</block>

<p>At first sight I would have thought, knowing that the Indian Market is, one might say, in the centre of Durban, that it would have been against Government policy to re-erect an institution of that kind on its present site. No doubt this was something which at first came to the minds of the city fathers in Durban. It appears, however, that either there was a change of policy in this regard or some circumstance which arose which constituted an exception in this case. A large sum of money is now going to be made available by the Government to re-erect an institution which was destroyed by fire and one would have thought that the institution was situated in a place where, according to Government policy, it should not have been situated. That is the <span class="col_8121-8122" refersTo="page_1128"/>first point. How is it that the hon. the Minister finds it possible to re-erect, even on a temporary basis, a market in this situation&#x003F; Secondly, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would tell the House a little more of what he has in mind in, as he says, finding an equitable and efficient permanent solution to this problem. Is it intended to explore the possibility of reerecting the Indian Market as a permanent structure on the same site or it it his intention to re-erect this as a permanent structure elsewhere&#x003F; If so, what other site, what other venue, does he have in mind&#x003F; Will the hon. the Minister tell us a little more about the intention under this subhead&#x003F;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have to amplify &#x2014;if that is the word&#x2014;my statement of the other day on this issue. What happened was that the Indian Market which had been there for 63 years and which was an extremely important institution as the hon. member will know&#x2014;an important institution not only to the Indian community since thousands of Indians were directly dependent on the Indian Market for their livelihood, but also for thousands of Whites, Bantu and other Indians who traded there &#x2014;was burnt down overnight. I expected that the Durban City Council would immediately go into the matter and that they would provide some kind of facility to tide these people over until something better could be done in the long run. When it was reported to me after two weeks that the Durban City Council&#x2019;s Policy and Finance Committee had decided not to do anything about it. I asked the Mayor to come down and see me. Great pressure was building up and not only from the side of the Indian community because many other people also got in touch with me about this matter; they wanted to know what was happening. I am still of the opinion that this is the responsibility of the Durban City Council. Here we have had the occurrence that a very important institution suddenly disappeared. It was not a charitable institution as the Durban City Council has been charging rent for the stalls they let out and some of those rentals were surprisingly high. Be that as it may, what is the policy&#x003F; This is not a change of policy at all. I immediately said to the members of the Durban City Council who came to see me that I felt we had to do something to provide temporary facilities for these people so that they could get back into trade. If I remember correctly there were 261 stallholders in the old Market. After a great deal of discussion we finally got the Durban City Council to agree to co-operate to put something there. At that point, however, we had not decided on the exact venue. At any rate, we decided that facilities should be made available. The question arose how it would be financed and where it ought to be sited. In the first place the Durban City Council said they did not think they could provide the finance for the structure that was to be erected there. When I talk of a &#x201C;structure&#x201D; I talk in terms of a temporary structure, which I shall explain. I said that I would do my best to obtain financial assistance from the Government. Then the Durban City Council came back to me and said they would rather provide the finance themselves. I said: &#x201C;Well, that is fine; let us get moving&#x201D;. But after that they came back and said they were in financial difficulties and that they would have to call on us to do something about it. It was at that stage that I officially approached my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance. We were then able to go back to the Durban City Council and tell them that we, the Government, were prepared to make available R100 000 &#x201C;without any strings attached&#x201D;&#x2014;the phrase used a few moments ago&#x2014;to provide immediately for temporary facilities to allow the Indian traders, the stallholders, to get going again. The Durban City Council made it clear to me that they did not wish to be tied for more than two years. In the first instance they said that temporary facilities should only be provided for two years. They said that they were of the opinion that it was time the Indian community took steps to provide their own Indian Market as such. Then they said they would be prepared to agree to a period of three years, but not longer. Then I said: &#x201C;What happens after three years if nothing else is available&#x003F;&#x201D; They simply said: &#x201C;That building will then have to be pulled down&#x201D;. In fact, they said that within two months of the expiry of that three year period that building would have to be pulled down. From the very start I emphatically said that I could not agree to that. I said that I could not agree to it that this temporary structure which we are aiming at as a matter of urgency&#x2014;we have made available this R100 000 for this purpose&#x2014;should be there for a fixed period. I had this difficulty: If we had not yet been able to provide what has been called the <span class="col_8123-8124" refersTo="page_1129"/>&#x201C;permanent&#x201D; solution within that time and the temporary structure was demolished, we would be back at square one and the Indians would have no market once more. Let me just say that the Durban City Council did build a wall to enable up to 50 stalls that had not been destroyed by the fire to go on trading with fresh produce such as meat, etc. That wall is in fact being used and has been used for some weeks. That required just a small alteration; it was a matter of closing up one wall to allow that section to be used again. The part I am referring to is where we are going to need at least 150, if not more stalls quickly, and that is the object of this item here. At no time could I agree to the other proposal. I mentioned this the other day because I really felt that this matter had come to a halt. I could not make out why the Durban City Council did not start to erect something. The Departments of Community Development and Public Works said they would give all the technical assistance they could; they were ready to go. The matter was raised by hon. members in this House upon which I made the statement I did. The Mayor of Durban has tended to attack me on this. He says I have changed my mind and that I agreed that this temporary structure would stand for only three years That is simply not so, and I have plenty of proof to back me up. My point is: What are we really arguing about&#x003F; Let us rather provide that structure, because it is desperately needed. There are hundreds of people living on relief at the moment and are leading a very frugal life. I know the facts. I have stressed this to the Durban City Council at every stage. I set up a committee of representatives of the Departments of Indian Affairs and Community Development, the Durban City Council and the South African Indian Council and they have met many times. The representative of my department says that he is now inclined to throw up his hands as he just cannot get the Durban City Council to start. The money is there and all the technical assistance is there. There has also been a decision on the venue for these temporary facilities because the Mayor of Durban himself came to me a while ago and said that they had discussed this matter further and agreed that the temporary stalls should go up on the old market site, which I felt was the best solution under the circumstances. Provision is being made for a ring road which will make use of a certain portion of the old site, but it is not a big part; so that is not a problem, as the Mayor himself has said. I hope very much that the Durban City Council will start with this as soon as possible. They can start tomorrow; they really can. What of the long term&#x003F; We have this committee and as soon as we can get started on the temporary structure, that committee will immediately go into action to consider the long-term solution for a proper, effective Indian market for the Indian community. They will consider what sort of structure it should be, where it should be placed and who should have stalls. I do not want to commit myself at all because of the fact that I am Minister of Indian Affairs. I have a very real interest in the well-being of these people, but with respect, it is not my responsibility, but I would not rule out the old Indian market site. On the other hand, I could not say that it will in fact be the venue. It is for this committee, consisting of all the parties concerned, to thrash out that question. I am quite sure that they will do so in a short time. Personally, I am absolutely sure that, with the co-operation we can expect, the whole question will have been thrashed out long before two years have elapsed; the whole problem of how to provide a proper market there, where to provide for it on what scale and how to finance it will all have been solved. But until we can do that, let us get on with these temporary facilities that are desperately needed; let us put them on the old market site, which the City Council has agreed to, and thereafter we will immediately tackle the problem of finding a long-term solution. As I say, I could not tell you now where the market will eventually be; all I can say is that, as I see it, it does not constitute a reversal of Government policy at all. I cannot see that point.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has indicated certain reasons for the amount of R100 000 which is before us, but I was wondering whether the hon. the Minister could give some further information in regard to the next step to be taken, particularly in regard to the design of this temporary structure. The hon. the Minister has indicated that it will be a temporary building although the item before us only mentions the &#x201C;re-erection of the Indian Market&#x201D;. What are the plans for the design of this structure and who is to undertake the planning of this structure&#x003F; I refer in particular to health regulations. <span class="col_8125-8126" refersTo="page_1130"/>As one is aware, the Indian Market is for the sale of foodstuffs and obviously many of those who have been affected by the destruction of this market have been deprived of their living. There are health regulations that have to be abided by and I was wondering whether the hon. the Minister could give us the assurance that the various health regulations will be complied with by the temporary structure which is, evidently, to be designed and erected on part of the site where the old market had stood.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the siting of a future Indian Market. The hon. the Minister has indicated that a committee will study the long-term aspects of this matter. The point that was made by my friend the hon. member for Zululand, was really to ascertain from the hon. the Minister whether he is opposed to or in favour of the re-erection of this market on the existing site. I think this is the kernel of the point which was raised as far as this particular item of R100 000 is concerned. I hope that the hon. the Minister can give this additional information in regard to the reerection of the Indian Market.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will gladly do so. The chairman of that <i>ad hoc</i> committee, Mr. Van Eyssen, who is the regional representative of the Department of Indian Affairs in Natal, has informed me more than once that the health aspect of the structure has been very carefully discussed. He has informed me that there has been complete agreement amongst the four parties. I cannot give the precise details, because I do not think it is necessary to do so, but I can give the hon. member the assurance that that has been discussed and that agreement has been reached with all the parties concerned The design of this structure has also been discussed. In this respect we are really dependent upon the Durban Corporation, but the departments of Public Works and of Community Development have offered to assist. Their representative is there and is taking part in the discussions. I am told that there are no particular problems in this regard at all. I can also say that the way in which this was discussed, the Durban Corporation would get this structure erected, while the Department of Community Development will keep an eve on the specifications and will naturally have to satisfy the governmental authorities that the proper specifications are measured up to. The whole thing has been tackled by that committee on a very constructive basis and I am impressed by the way it is being done. Those points have definitely been dealt with.</p>

<p>Yes. The last time I discussed this with my representative there, he said it might just be possible that there will be a slight saving. At any rate, it is well understood that that is the limit and the committee is satisfied that they can put up a very workable structure for that amount.</p>

<p>The second point was the question of the venue. I really do not want to compromise anybody by stating any preference I may or may not have, because I specifically asked those four bodies each to appoint a representative on that committee. We have this excellent little committee and I have asked them to look at this matter quite objectively and to go into all the aspects. There are various possibilities. One possibility must obviously be the old site. Another possibility is somewhere in the general area of what is called the Grey Street commercial area for Indians. Another possibility, which I would not rule out, is Chatsworth. So there are various possibilities, but I do not think it right that I myself should go into that. I would rather that the Durban City Council, the Indian Council and the two departments, who are very competently represented, thrash it out fully and objectively. They can then inform us what their recommendation in this regard is. That is really as far as I can take this point.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this provision has become necessary as a result of the amendment to the Building Societies Act and relates to the house-ownership scheme for public servants. To date the position has been that my department guarantees 20% of the building society loan. As a result of the amendment effected, my department may now only guarantee 10%, and the remaining 10% must be deposited with the building society. As regards the interest earned on that investment this is a matter which will be mutually agreed upon by the building society and my department.</p>

<p>Sir, I thank the hon. the Minister for his explanation. The first point which arises and which, as he has indicated, has not been settled yet, is the rate of interest which will be paid on this cash deposit with the building societies.

<p>As I have indicated, the rates of interest will only be determined, in consultation with the building societies, when the deposits are made. It will naturally have to be a long-term investment, and as a result the rates of interest will have to be calculated on the basis of that long term. I am under the impression that this will apply in respect of all new house-ownership schemes which are tackled.

I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he objected to this provision of the new Bill, because if he had objected, he would not have had to provide this cash and the guarantee of the Government would still have been accepted. I think it is quite wrong to have a situation where the guarantee of the Government of South Africa cannot be accepted, and where the Government is required to deposit actual cash with the building societies. When we come to deal with the Bill, we will raise the matter there, but here the Government is involved in that it has to provide additional funds. I am surprised that the hon. the Minister of Finance allowed it, because he now has to use the money which he takes from us and give it to the building societies when the guarantee of the Government should have been equally good.</p>

<heading>APPRECIATION OF THE RAND</heading>

<summary>(Statement)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to make a statement. I regret having to make another statement, but this is the only opportunity of coming to this House with a matter of such an urgent nature.</p>

<p>In my statement of 18th March, 1973, in which the position of the South African rand in a world of floating exchange rates was reviewed. I announced that it had been decided to maintain the existing par value of the rand in terms of gold, and that the Reserve Bank would continue to quote the same fixed buying and selling rates for U.S.A. dollars as had been in use since the dollar devaluation of February, 1973. I also pointed out, however, that should the E.E.C. currency units appreciate more as against the U.S.A. dollar than was <span class="col_8131-8132" refersTo="page_1133"/>generally expected at that time, South Africa would have to reassess its position.</p>

<p>Since then, and especially during the last two weeks, most of the currencies have appreciated against the U.S.A. dollar to such an extent that the dollar is quoted at present at a level nearly <i>5%</i> below sterling and between 4 and 6% below most other Western European currency units compared with the position on 19th March, 1973. Should South Africa continue to maintain its <i>existing</i> buying and selling rates for the U.S.A. dollar, it will thus imply that the rand has also since the middle of March, 1973, depreciated to the same extent as the dollar compared with the currencies referred to. Compared with all foreign currency units this will mean an average effective depreciation of the rand of between 2 and 3% since the middle of March.</p>

<p>Such a depreciation of the rand in present-day circumstances is not considered desirable. The balance of payments of the country is still very favourable and the gold and other foreign assets held by the Reserve Bank increased from 16th March by approximately a further R100 million and have now reached the satisfactory level of about R1 200 million. The <i>total</i> official reserves approximate today R1 350 million, which represent a record level. In this respect it is of particular significance that the price of gold on the private market has risen from about 82 dollars per fine ounce towards the middle of March, 1973, to about 120 dollars per fine ounce at present, that is by about 46%.</p>

<p>In this way South Africa&#x2019;s underlying balance of payments position has been appreciably strengthened. From the point of view of the balance of payments a depreciation of the rand is now thus neither necessary nor welcome.</p>

<p>From the point of view of containing inflation such a depreciation would also have an undesirable effect. It would, in fact, result in import prices expressed in rand rising, which would tend to accelerate the rate of increase in the consumer price index or counteract a declining tendency therein.</p>

<p>In view of the above it has been decided that the Reserve Bank will, as from tomorrow, Tuesday 5th June, 1973, quote new buying and selling rates for the U.S.A. dollar which will amount to an <i>appreciation</i> of the rand against the dollar by about 5%. The gold parity of the rand remains unchanged, however, at R29,75 per fine ounce. The aforementioned exchange rate adjustment means, therefore, that for the present the rate of exchange of the rand with the U.S.A. dollar will not be maintained within the permissible margins around the gold parity exchange rate. The International Monetary Fund has already been notified accordingly.</p>

<p>As against all foreign currencies, this step will bring about an average effective appreciation of the rand of between 2 and 3% as compared with the position on 19th March. In determining the extent of the appreciation account was taken, not only of the recent movements in the exchange rates of the U.S.A. dollar as against other currencies, but also of the disinflationary effect which this step should have.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the recommendations contained in the Report be adopted as Resolutions of this House.</block>

<p>I should like to explain this motion more fully. The recommendations of the Select Committee which we are considering at the moment, deal with the declaration of additional released areas in Natal and the eastern and northern parts of the Transvaal. The designation of the remaining land which we still owe under the quotas of 1936 and, together with that, the consolidation of Bantu areas are matters which I have tried to tackle systematically over the past few years. As early as at the beginning of the year 1971 I explained my ideas to the Cabinet, i.e. to declare the relevant <span class="col_8133-8134" refersTo="page_1134"/>released areas in all the provinces, by which means we would be able to promote consolidation and designate those areas out of which we had to obtain the amount of land which was due and which was still outstanding under the quota and had to be added to Bantu land. Even at that stage I was already planning that we would do the Ciskeian areas in 1972. We succeeded in doing that. I also planned that the rest of the areas in South Africa&#x2014;i.e. the areas in Natal, the Transvaal and the Northern Cape&#x2014;would be done in 1973. Relatively speaking, I have also succeeded in doing that, for all the reports dealing with these areas have already been submitted to Parliament and referred to the Select Committee on Bantu Affairs. This report of the Select Committee does therefore contain recommendations arising from those reports.</p>

<p>This was a gigantic task to perform. I am very grateful that up to now we have been able to work up to this stage according to the planning programme I drew up in 1971. In this regard I owe a debt of gratitude to many bodies and persons, and I should like to mention them. In the first place, I mention the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, in which certain officials, whose names I want to mention, distinguished themselves by the over-exacting work they did. In fact, this work was so over-exacting that one of them collapsed this morning and is unable to attend this debate for which he has been preparing himself for three years. I mention the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development, Mr. Van Onselen. Next I mention Mr. Pepler, who has just retired from the service of the department, Mr. van Wyk and Mr. Pienaar. There are other officials who have also been involved in the matter, but I cannot mention the names of all of them now. These are the people in my department who had to shoulder this gigantic task of making recommendations. Indeed they have performed epoch-making work. In the second place, I mention the Bantu Affairs Commission under the chairmanship of an hon. member of this House, Mr. Piet van Vuuren, and his colleagues who are also hon. members of this House, namely Messrs. G. P. van den Berg and H. J. Botha. The Bantu Affairs Commission also has another member who is not a member of this House, namely Dr. Lombard of Pretoria. In the third place, I mention the agricultural unions and the district agricultural unions in Natal and the Transvaal, with which, over a long period, we had many deliberations both in camera and in public and conducted a lengthy correspondence. All of them have co-operated with us to such an extent that we have now been able to come up with a scheme, even if they do not agree with everything on which we have decided. Then I want to mention other bodies, such as local authorities, development or planning committees, and so forth. I also want to mention individual hon. members of the House of Assembly and the Senate who were in touch with the Deputy Minister, the departmental officials and me in this regard. I want to say that members, not only on my side of the House but also on the other side of the House, spoke to me personally, to the Deputy Minister and also to others about proposals and ideas in this regard. To those hon. members, too, I express my thanks for what they were able to contribute in a constructive manner, and I express my regret at the request to which I could not accede. I want to repeat here in this House that we consulted each of the various homeland governments on these plans at various times and on various levels, and that in their case we were also able to give satisfaction in certain respects whereas in other respects we were unable to do so; after all, this is only human. Finally I want to thank the Select Committee which did this work for us. I find it a pity that some of the members of the Select Committee refused to avail themselves of the opportunity of making constructive proposals, but I want to convey my thanks to the committee as such. I can give hon. members the assurance that over a period of a number of years exhaustive, searching and lengthy deliberations took place on these proposals which are before the House today. There were more deliberations on these proposals than there had ever been on land matters in respect of the Bantu since 1936. I myself insisted that consultation had to take place on this scale, and I myself had to take part in and be present at these consultations until as recently as this morning.</p>

<p>The reasons for this large-scale declaration of released areas are mainly, stated in broad outline, of a twofold nature. Firstly, a systematic purchase has to be effected of the remainder of the land which we still owe, and at the same time we want to promote the consolidation of Bantu areas in that way. Secondly, this is being done in <span class="col_8135-8136" refersTo="page_1135"/>order that all concerned&#x2014;bodies, individuals, Bantu governments, and so forth&#x2014; may be notified as well in advance as possible of what land we propose to purchase in the years ahead for the South African Bantu Trust and therefore, in due course, for the Bantu governments as well. The ideal was of course, at its best, to obtain one single territory for every homeland. That is the ideal. We all strive after ideals, but it may not always be possible for us to attain them. The second best would then be to acquire as few scattered areas as possible in the proposals which are before us. I hope that we, having had regard to practical considerations, have accomplished this by way of these proposals which are before us.</p>

<p>There are many practical considerations to which we must have regard, and I want to mention them cursorily. I want to mention to hon. members that my department, the Government and I have to give attention to the whole country, and that this is not a matter of one single district or one single region in a province to which we must give our attention. If it had only been a matter of one single district or one single region, we would perhaps have been able to put forward far more idealistic proposals. Because this work involved the whole country in these times in which everything, but especially land, is very expensive, we must realize that, for the purposes of the proposals to be submitted to this House, we could not consider excessively expensive and idealistic plans in one single place, in one single region or province. Secondly, I want to mention that there are many Whites who will have to be uprooted from the land to which they have grown very attached, and that there will also be many Bantu, even more than in the case of the Whites, who will have to be moved from places where they have been living for a long time. What is more, and this makes it much more difficult than it will be in the case of the Whites, the Bantu will as far as possible have to be moved from the old places to the new places in their tribally orientated units. For that reason we have had to be very careful with removals. That is why we must try to avoid, where possible, the removals of these groups of people, and that is why we cannot simply split up such groups in two. It is very easy to effect a removal on paper, to draw a line and then to say that the one group are going to stay in that area and that the rest are going to be removed. If one were to do that, one could very easily cut a tribe in half, and then one would rule out the possibility of any co-operation every being obtained from them.</p>

<p>I mention to you, thirdly, that the released areas of the principal Act of 1936 only refer to the provinces, namely what is to be ceded by Whites in every province. This complicated the matter a great deal in so far as we had to take into account each of the various peoples and their homelands. The Act does not refer to the peoples and does not lay down how much land the Xhosa, the Zulu, the Venda, and so forth, are to be granted. Therefore, in these consolidation efforts and in the acquisition of land, we ourselves had to apply a criterion in terms of which we could ensure that justice was done as far as possible to each of the Bantu homelands and peoples. If we did not have to look after the peoples individually, it would perhaps have been much easier if, for instance, in a province such as the Transvaal, where there are several peoples, we could simply plump down in one direction all the land which they have to be granted. However, that would be very unfair. I mention to you, Sir, a further very important practical consideration which we must take into consideration and which did of course have an inhibiting effect, namely that unfortunately South Africa only has limited financial means as far as the implications of the acquisition of land are concerned. For that reason I could not simply decide on plans which appear to be grandiose, which are beautiful and idealistic, but which are very expensive. A case in point would have been to declare a town like Pietersburg, for instance, which in terms of municipal valuations alone is worth more than R100 million, to be a Black town. The same would of course apply to Mafeking.</p>

<p>I mention to you another last important practical consideration which we have had to take into account, namely that only a limited number of morgen of land may be added to the 1936 promise. For that reason too, in addition to the cost aspects, it was not possible simply to cede large tracts of land. For instance, certain very fine, idealistic proposals were submitted to me, proposals which looked splendid on paper, but the people concerned were in fact honest enough&#x2014;these are well-meaning people&#x2014; to warn us that their proposals involved much more land than was authorized by the 1936 Act. In such cases I can only say, <span class="col_8137-8138" refersTo="page_1136"/>&#x201C;Oh, what a pity! I cannot do that, for I may not go beyond the limits of that Act.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I should like to explain a number of specific matters in regard to these proposals. I think that these proposals ought to be very clear; they have laid on the Table of this House long enough for everybody to have been able to study them properly. I want to deal first with the specific aspects which I want to bring to your attention in respect of Natal. Up in the north, adjoining the border with Mozambique, lies the Ndumu Nature and Game Reserve. The proposal which we hope will be adopted in this House is that that Ndumu Reserve will become Bantu territory. However, the Government&#x2019;s standpoint is that this must remain a nature reserve and that it will also have to be controlled as such. We shall conduct negotiations on this matter with the relevant Bantu government when this area will come under its jurisdiction. Whether this is to be controlled by the Government itself or by others on behalf of the Government, are matters which we shall investigate then, as soon as it becomes my department&#x2019;s responsibility.</p>

<p>I mention to you a second area, which goes with the aforementioned area and which is also situated in the north, i.e. Kosi Bay and the reserve situated along the east coast in the north, which will remain Bantu territory. There, too, we shall see to the necessary conservation of nature and marine life, which we know to be a very important matter there. Thirdly, I want to mention to you the very important Umfolozi and the Hluhluwe Nature Reserves and Game Park. The Government has decided that Hluhluwe and Umfolozi plus a portion of the corridor, the area between these two reserves, should remain in the hands of the White authority, that it may therefore continue to exist as a game park and that the Natal Parks Board will have control over it. You will notice from the proposals that a small piece of land situated to the north of the Umfolozi Reserve, which, I think, used to be Bantu territory, is now being taken back. This is a small strip of land which, in essence, does not affect the Umfolozi Reserve adversely, especially not if one considers that it will in fact be possible for a large portion of the corridor, of which we are also holding back a small piece of land for the Bantu, to be transferred to the Parks Board in order that it may administer the three areas as a unit. Then I also want to mention specifically, in respect of Natal, the question of the coastal resorts of Umgababa and Turton, in regard to which I also heard personal representations made by hon. members on both sides of the House, whose names I do not want to mention now. In regard to these two coastal resorts we very honestly and sincerely feel that it would be unfair for those two narrow strips along the coast, which belong to the Zulu, to be turned into White areas, as was suggested by some people, and for the Zulu to be deprived of them. For that reason they are going to remain Bantu territory.</p>

<p>Then I also want to mention the position of Kwa Mashu. Kwa Mashu is not covered in these proposals. We announced a long time ago that it was the intention to incorporate Kwa Mashu with the KwaZulu Bantu homeland, and this is still the intention. However, it was not included here because problems had been experienced in finishing the surveys in time. In any case, this can easily be done at a later stage, which is in fact the intention.</p>

<p>In regard to the specific matters mentioned in this report I just want to refer, as far as the Transvaal is concerned, to the fact that the necessary process of expropriation is already in progress as regards the Letaba Ranch, a game reserve which was used by private persons and which we decided should also be incorporated because it is suitable for the purpose of settling Bantu. Actually, this reserve was offered to us by the owners on a previous occasion.</p>

<p>Then there is something I should like to say here in general. I am doing so with reference to inquiries that I have received. In cases where there are White areas which will now be declared released areas and will become Bantu areas, and in which prospecting operations, such as mining operations, are in progress, I want to give the assurance here that the concessionaries who have concessions there may continue with those operations even if those White areas are now becoming Bantu areas. As regards the property rights which may be held by White entrepreneurs developing those mines, these may be taken over from them in due course. However, as far as the mineral rights and the mining of minerals are concerned, we shall allow these to continue undisturbed, also in cases where these mineral rights may perhaps be held by individual White entrepreneurs themselves. We shall not interfere with such rights. In fact, we should like them to continue <span class="col_8139-8140" refersTo="page_1137"/>as they have been exercised there up to now.</p>

<p>I also want to point out in general that there may be internal adjustments among various Bantu peoples; for instance, in the Transvaal areas where one may find North Sotho, Shangaan, Venda and Swazi all living in the same areas. There will have to be border adjustments among these groups, but these are not matters which need be submitted to Parliament, and for that reason I merely mention them here for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>Since I have referred to the mineral rights, I may perhaps just say that the same will also apply in respect of forestry operations and certain forms of cultivation, such as sugar cultivation, which are in progress in certain areas and which will now be transferred to the Bantu. This is our standpoint, and we shall do everything in our power to ensure that those operations are maintained and that they will not be destroyed.</p>

<p>I just want to remind the House that if one looks at the minutes of the Select Committee, one will see that there are certain recommendations which were made by the Select Committee but which were not incorporated in this report. These recommendations are that certain areas stand over for further investigation. For instance, the Select Committee recommended that further investigations be instituted by my department in regard to certain areas in Natal, the three reserves, namely Reserve No. 1, Reserve No. 2 on the slopes of the Drakensberg mountains and also the Upper Tugela Reserve, as well as the other land connected therewith in the Makatini Flats and the small Reserve No. 13, near the Pongola River. I accept that recommendation as it stands and I am quite prepared to give effect to it, because I feel that people who may be of the opinion that they have not expressed their views on this matter clearly enough, should be afforded an opportunity of expressing their views to me now. However, it must be realized very well that all the possibilities are being kept open in regard to the land of those three reserves. They can remain as they are at the moment, they can be consolidated into a unit or all three of them can be moved depending on what we may bring to light through further investigations. In the same way the Select Committee recommended that the six farms proposed to be taken over in the Eastern Transvaal from the Sabie-Sand Private Game Reserve in exchange for the small reserve near the Blyderivier Poort, which we call the Dinkie Reserve, should stand over for further investigation pursuant to representations received by the department. I also accept that recommendation as it stands. In respect of this recommendation, too, I say that all possibilities are remaining open. It should also be realized very well that we need land for settlement purposes and that we cannot simply move the peoples involved arbitrarily, left and right. We shall have to take a very close look at these particulars.</p>

<p>In looking at these proposals, we will realize that, as I said a moment ago, the ideal of having one single area for each homeland could not be achieved in all cases. There are areas, such as in Natal and the North-Eastern Transvaal, where a Bantu homeland consists of several separate areas. This will require a practical approach to reality on the part of the Bantu as well as the Whites. Both White and Bantu will have to respect and acknowledge mutually the principle of good neighbourliness, just as we have to respect and acknowledge one another in many other ways, and will have to help one another on the basis of inter-dependence. For instance, we shall have to help them by allowing them to drive through our areas to another area of theirs, and they will have to help us by allowing us to drive through their areas to another area of ours. There will have to be agreements on matters such as telegraph, railway and electricity lines, national roads and the use of rivers in those cases where these things serve both groups. As I have said in this House before, this is a matter which does not necessarily hold major dangers for us, as is often maintained by many people, but which imposes on the White group as well as the Bantu group in question the duty of co-operating with each other and tolerating each other. In other words, to see eye to eye with each other in regard to those matters implies security for both groups.</p>

<p>I should like to take this opportunity to say to the Bantu homeland governments, with a view to the demands that have been made by so many of them, that they should please be realistic and realize what things are possible for this Government, that they should accept the large pieces of land which they are being granted and which we are now offering to them, and that they should accept that the moving of <span class="col_8141-8142" refersTo="page_1138"/>the reserves and Black spots will bring about better administration for them.</p>

<p>This Government and the White community are making major sacrifices. Hundreds of millions of rands are required for the purchase of land which will then be handed over to the Bantu governments free of charge. Compensation is required for Bantu moving away. Services are required at the new places to which they are moving. All of these are gifts made by this Government to the Bantu governments. We hope that those Bantu who will have to move, and their governments, will assist with the necessary services that will have to be provided in the places under the jurisdiction of that government, and that the additional land which they are being granted will be looked after and utilized well.</p>

<p>Sir. I am racing against the clock and I would be pleased if you would forget to watch it for a few minutes and so make it possible for me to finish. The implementation of this planning is very important, and it will make major demands on all of us, as I have said, in respect of funds, convenience and labour. It will not be possible for all the Whites whose land is situated in the new released areas to sell their land to us at the same time. There will have to be priorities. Farmers should therefore carry on and accept that their properties will in due course be purchased at valuation. It will interest everybody to know that this Government is at present giving consideration to the possibility of devising methods whereby it will be possible to effect the acquisition of all the land over a much shorter period than was the case in terms of the method followed in the past. In this regard we shall, I hope, be able to make the necessary announcements at a convenient time.</p>

<p>Sir, I ask you to be so kind as to allow me just a few more moments. I must point out that in Natal and in the Transvaal a limited number of hectares of the quota are in each case being held in reserve by us for essential purchases which may become necessary in due course, because it is after all impossible for one to foresee all the eventualities. Such purchases will of course be of a limited nature and the land will of course border on the existing Bantu areas or the released areas. For your information, Sir approximately 30 000 ha and 50 000 ha are being held in reserve in Natal and in the Transvaal, respectively. Mr. Speaker, as things have turned out, it has after all not been necessary for you to ignore the clock. I thank you.</p>
