<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 37, after &#x201C;situated&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and to the Secretary&#x201D;; in line 39, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D;; in line 40, after &#x201C;(a)&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;may&#x201D;; in line 41, after &#x201C;(b)&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;may&#x201D;; and in line 44, after &#x201C;(c)&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;shall&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Clause 4 deals with the question of patients by consent, those patients who have voluntarily submitted themselves for treatment, and provision is made here for where the superintendent is not satisfied that the patient concerned is fully aware of the conditions under which the application has been made. Sir, we have no problem with the first part of this clause. Our suggestion is to improve subsection (2), and that is the object of the first amendment. Subsection (2) says that the superintendent shall within seven days after the admission of a patient under subsection (1), forward to the magistrate of the district in which the institution in question is situated, a copy of the relevant application and a report on the condition of the patient. We <span class="col_2017-2018" refersTo="page_1022"/>on this side of the House wish to move the amendment that after the word &#x201C;situated&#x201D; the words &#x201C;and to the Secretary&#x201D; should be included, thereby implying that after seven days the superintendent will send a report to the magistrate and also that a copy of the report will go to the Secretary. We feel that where in these cases there is any element of doubt, every effort should be made to ensure that the patient receives the utmost consideration. While it is not the intention to overload the Secretary with an unnecessary number of reports of this nature, we feel that cases where patients are not aware of the terms of their applications, should be referred both to the magistrate and the Secretary.</p>

<p>As far as the second portion of the amendment is concerned&#x2014;it deals with subsection (3)&#x2014;we suggest that the magistrate of the district in question may informally visit the patient concerned, and may at any time investigate the circumstances under which the patient was admitted to the institution or is being or was detained therein. Our amendment suggests just a change of wording to make it quite clear. We think that it is essential that instead of it being permissive in so far as subparagraph (c) is concerned, i.e. that he may report his findings, the magistrate shall report his findings under paragraphs (a) and (b) to the Secretary. We feel that to have the last paragraph of the clause on a permissive basis, might not be in the best interests of the patient. That is why we submit that the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; will be in the interests of the patient.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause refers to the protection of the rights of the person, and that function is given to the court and its officials. In a case such as this one it is essential that the magistrate should be aware of the admission of the patient. That is all that is of importance here. It is not necessary that the Secretary should be informed. I should say that although we may have to contend with manpower problems and administrative red tape, the hon. member need not have the least fear that the magistrate would not know exactly what to do in a case such as this. I think that in this case, where the court is being entrusted with functions and the court has to carry out those functions, we may leave it to the magistrate to fulfil these initial functions. Under these circumstances I cannot accept the amendment which the hon. member proposed in this regard.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In so far as clause 4(3) is concerned, the hon. member must realize that this is a discretionary power that is delegated to the magistrate. He does not differ with me as far as 4(3)(a) and (b) are concerned, that the magistrate should have a discretionary power, but now he wants the magistrate to be forced. He must&#x2014;it should not be in his discretion&#x2014;inform the Secretary in a case where clause 4(3)(c) is applicable.</p>

<p>*In this respect I am returning to exactly the same thing. In this respect, too, we should not impose unnecessary administrative duties on the magistrate. Over many years it has always been my experience&#x2014;I never found any departure from this&#x2014;that magistrates are responsible people who know when they should inform the Secretary with regard to a patient of this nature. Hundreds of cases may be involved at the same time, and if the magistrate finds anything unusual in any of those cases, I am quite sure that he will report that case, as was always done in the past. There have never been cases where these powers were abused or where there was negligence. I am therefore very sorry, but I cannot accept these two amendments.</p>

<p>Amendments negatived.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;annually&#x201D; in line 49 up to and including &#x201C;years&#x201D; in line 51; and to add the following proviso at the end of paragraph (a) of subsection (1):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that every such report shall contain a report from a medical officer of some other institution or other place, who shall have examined the patient for the purpose of this report.</block>

<p>I notice that the hon. the Minister too has given notice of an amendment. My amendment calls for a report to be rendered every year instead of only annually for the first three years and thereafter in the fifth year and then every five years. The <span class="col_2019-2020" refersTo="page_1023"/>hon. Minister has gone to the extent of meeting the situation by substituting &#x201C;three years&#x201D; for &#x201C;every five years&#x201D;. A great deal of play has been made by the hon. member for Newcastle of the fact that there have been patients, albeit patients retained as President&#x2019;s patients, whom he suggested had been cured but had not been released. That is a concern which he gives voice to because he apparently is aware of occasions where this has taken place. Our concern, on the other hand, is that there should not be any &#x201C;forgotten men&#x201D;. Whilst I admit that having these reports every three years is better than having them every five years, I do think that there is no harm in having them done annually. As I have said in my Second Reading speech on this Bill, in many cases it is purely a formal report because the condition of a patient is very well known to the superintendent. On the other hand, the fact that the report is made annually is a matter of some comfort to the patient&#x2019;s family and of a certain sense of security in the minds of the public. Therefore there should not be, as has been suggested by the hon. member for Newcastle, cases where people are really &#x201C;forgotten men&#x201D;. That is one aspect of the matter. I will now refer to the other aspect.</p>

<p>I introduced this amendment because I have had discussions with psychiatrists on the subject and they feel quite strongly on this issue, despite the fact that representations have been made by the association or whatever institution psychiatrists belong to. Nevertheless, something that is in the minds of some psychiatrists on this matter is that where the superintendent does render such a report, more particularly if the hon. the Minister is going to insist on its taking place every three years, such report should contain a report from a medical officer in some other institution or place who shall then examine the patient for the purposes of such report.</p>

<p>That obviously refers to a medical officer of an institution in terms of this Bill. In other words, he merely invites a colleague from another institution or hospital, wherever it may be, to concur in his thinking on the matter. It is very possible that a superintendent who has spent many years at an institution can get stale. Very often it becomes merely a formality for him, where in his mind he has already formed a conclusion. This is not a reflection on the superintendent; it is just a matter of human nature because, after all, these are not the easiest cases in the world to deal with. Very often a second opinion may be of great value and assistance and be in the interests of the patient. Our objective here is not to be critical of the method of administration, nor is it critical of the terms of the clause; its whole purpose is to bring about an inbuilt sense of confidence and as far as possible to provide the maximum protection for the patient because, as I have said, with the new approach to mental health one wants the public to feel secure and to be reassured that no person will at any time suffer through being a forgotten case or the cause of a family making an application to a judge-in-chambers or to an open court to inquire whether the patient is still suffering from a mental illness to a degree that justifies his being certified or detained. I believe that with these two provisions&#x2014;firstly, the more frequent issuing of reports on the individual and, secondly, the inbuilt security of a second opinion&#x2014;we will have gone very far indeed in ensuring that there will not be a case, as has been suggested, of a forgotten man being certified and lost to the world.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the start let me say that we must all realize that the hon. member is referring to chronic cases of mental illness. If, instead of debating we revert to facts, the hon. member must realize that after eight years many of the chronic cases are really burnt out. These burnt-out cases, as we call them, are seen daily by the nursing personnel and at least once per month by the psychiatrists. I realize that there were perhaps State President cases which were released too soon. That is why the five year provision is there. We accepted it at the time and it has worked well all these years. I myself have mentioned the fact that we are moving on to new ground as far as the treatment of psychiatric patients and their detention are concerned. That is why I am prepared to meet the hon. member halfway. We must gradually move in this new direction. That is why I say that three years for the time being is perhaps a better way in which to move gradually into the new era.</p>

<p>As far as the medical superintendent of the specific institution where the patient has to be tested, is concerned, the hon. member talked about staleness. I have sympathy for what he said, but I do not think his argument stands up to reality and to the facts, because it is not a question of staleness here. After many years it is actually more difficult <span class="col_2021-2022" refersTo="page_1024"/>for a practitioner, a psychiatrist, from another institution to come and diagnose and decide on a patient whom he sees only for the first time. At the same time, there are safety measures built in because the boards that consider these cases are usually composed of more than one doctor; there are also psychiatrists and the other members of hospital boards. So, that need not worry the hon. member. As I have said at the start, we do not want to over-burden our people with administrative tasks. That is a very real problem that has to be considered. Therefore I shall have to leave it at that. I can meet him half-way by changing the five years to three years if he feels strongly about that. For the rest, I think it must remain as it is for the time being. As far as another doctor&#x2019;s opinion is concerned when a patient is finally to be released, I think I have already answered that request. It is something that is not conducive to good ethics either amongst the various doctors that work in State institutions or amongst private psychiatrists, who sometimes are in opposition to other psychiatrists. I think we had better leave it at that. I therefore move my amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 51, to omit &#x201C;five&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;three&#x201D;.</block>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, under the circumstances I am prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. the Minister and to withdraw mine.</p>

<p>Amendments proposed by Mr. H. Miller, with leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p>Amendment proposed by the Minister of Health agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 45:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 12, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;shall&#x201D;; and in line 14, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D;, where it occurs for the second time, and to substitute &#x201C;shall&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This clause does not deal with persons in an institution, but with persons who are detained in dwellings and who are looked after there. It is for this reason that I think we should be extra careful in these cases. Subsection (1) states:</p>

<block name="quote">Any magistrate, on receipt of any report or information that a patient of whom charge is being taken under this chapter, is being wrongly or cruelly treated or is being neglected in any manner, may visit the patient in the private dwelling where he is being detained and make such investigation and inquiry as he may deem necessary, and the magistrate may thereafter take such steps as he may consider expedient.</block>

<p>I suggest that the magistrate must go and visit the patient after a complaint has been lodged. Although this is an enabling subsection empowering the magistrate to go, I am not satisfied. A report may come in about a child who is being kept in a room with a chain around its leg. We have read that this sort of thing does happen. We cannot take a chance. The magistrate must go and see what has happened. The enabling clause here gives permission to do so but it is my contention that the magistrate who has received the report shall go and see this person who is being detained as a mentally ill patient in the private dwelling. For all we know medical attention may not have been given and this child may have been lying there for months. A report is sent in and under those circumstances I feel that the magistrate must go to the dwelling and see what is going on. If he does go, I say he must go, and he sees what is happening it is not sufficient to say that he &#x201C;may&#x201D; take steps which he deems fit. He &#x201C;must&#x201D; take steps to make sure that the report is not only fully investigated, but actually institutes action to make sure that this child is neither cruelly, wrongfully treated or being neglected.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this subsection also merely empowers the magistrate to enter such a dwelling; and it is in his discretion whether he will do so or not. This was also the case in the past. The hon. member now wants the magistrate to be compelled to investigate each case personally. Now I wish to put it to him that we must also be reasonable and appreciate the discretionary ability of the magistrate. If he feels it is necessary, he may go. If it is not necessary at all, he does not have to go. However, the magistrate has other obligations to carry out. In subsection (3) the hon. member will notice that the magistrate has to report monthly to the Secretary on the fitness of the person in charge and the dwelling <span class="col_2023-2024" refersTo="page_1025"/>where such a patient is kept. Now the hon. member wants to place that additional obligation on him of having to investigate every little complaint personally. I think one must be reasonable because magistrates have many other duties to fulfil, and because we, on account of our limited manpower, have to place too heavy a burden on these people as it is by requiring them to fulfil many of the local obligations of departments. Since the magistrate has these other obligations to fulfil, and since he is a responsible official and his integrity is usually beyond all doubt, I honestly feel that we should not place this burden upon magistrates at this stage. I feel the hon. member should appreciate why I cannot accept his amendment at this stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not satisfied with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply. I think that if there are no other people to do the investigations, the magistrates must do them. It is the magistrate&#x2019;s duty to do it, irrespective of the other work he may have to do. It is my contention that the welfare of such a person detained in a dwelling, because he is mentally ill, takes precedence. That is how I feel about it. It is my own feeling that abuses by those in charge of these people may take place. The hon. the Minister must remember that the persons who look after the mentally ill are paid for it, and we expect in return for the fees they are getting for keeping these people, that they must do the job properly. I am not satisfied that the monthly report by the magistrate will include a visit to the residence. Subsection (3) reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The magistrate shall, after inspection by himself or by a medical practitioner appointed by him for this purpose, report monthly to the Secretary whether the person in charge of such dwelling is a fit and proper person to have the care of the patient.</block>

<p>In practice, this might quite easily mean two months may elapse from the time the magistrate or his appointee goes to the dwelling until the subsequent visit. For instance, the magistrate may go on the first of the month&#x2014;so he had done his duty for that month. He may not go again until the 31st of the following month; then he has indeed gone once a month but with an interval of two months. Anything can happen to that child or adult in that period of two months. I am not going to pursue the matter further but I wonder if the hon. the Minister will not be good enough to reconsider this amendment and perhaps change it in the Other Place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member has perhaps an argument there, but, according to his printed amendment, the magistrate is left with no option even to appoint perhaps a medical practitioner to go and investigate and then report back to him. So he will agree that, seeing that there is no option contained in his amendment, it is impossible for me to accept his amendment as it stands now. But if he is prepared to let us discuss this, I might consider it now that he has produced this other argument of the magistrate perhaps delegating his power or appointing a medical practitioner to go and investigate whether there is anything wrong. In that case I think he has a point. Perhaps, in the Other Place, we may then try to amend this clause in the way he has suggested.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has consented to give this matter further consideration. I would be very happy if he could amend this clause. I would be satisfied if the magistrate would then be able to delegate that power to some other person. I would be very happy with that. The Minister has given us the assurance that he will do this, and with that assurance I shall withdraw my amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 47:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is a matter which concerns the establishment of hospital boards. In this clause the hon. the Minister has made provision for only three persons to be appointed to a hospital board. As the House well knows&#x2014;and the Minister knows this better than most of us&#x2014;these boards are going to operate in very large institutions in most cases. The work <span class="col_2025-2026" refersTo="page_1026"/>that these three board members will have to do is going to be very extensive. In addition, these three people who are going to be appointed to such a board are going to be specialists in one or other profession. It is suggested that if possible one shall be a medical practitioner and another a lawyer. Medical practitioners are, as the hon. the Minister admitted a moment ago, very busy people, and so are lawyers. They at times may be too busy to visit institutions and they may also be very busy at the time when a hospital board meeting is called. It is my contention that three people are insufficient to serve efficiently on a hospital board. When you come to think of it, Sir, they have to keep an eye on the finances of the hospital; they have to see to the buildings; they have to see to the grounds; they have to see to welfare and complaints that come from the staff and the patients; they have at least to take an active interest in the hospital and its wards.</p>

<p>Yes, there are the kitchens and all that sort of thing, but I am not going to go into detail. How is it possible for three people to do all this, especially when two of them are very busy people, one a lawyer and the other a medical practitioner? That is why I say it is necessary in most cases to have a far greater number serving efficiently on a hospital board. The Minister has been good enough to consider this point and he suggests that we say that &#x201C;up to five people&#x201D; may be appointed to a board. I would be pleased to hear from the Minister why he says &#x201C;from three to five persons&#x201D; instead of agreeing to my suggestion that we have five people on a board.</p>

<p>I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I wish to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to clause 48, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A member of the board who is not an officer or employee in the public service shall, out of moneys appropriated by Parliament, be paid such remuneration and allowances as the Minister may from time to time determine in consultation with the Minister of Finance.</block>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s amendment involves an increase in the number of members appointed to serve on a board. I am unable to accept the amendment as it would also involve an increase in expenditure, requiring the State President&#x2019;s recommendation. I must add that I can accept the amendment if it comes from the Minister, but not if it comes from the hon. member. It is therefore out of order.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to remove one misunderstanding. The members of the board have not got anything to do with the administration of the hospital. They have no jurisdiction in that regard. They only attend to the patients. There must be clarity in the hon. member&#x2019;s mind as far as the functions of the board members are concerned.</p>

<p>*But in the first place I should like to mention that these people are volunteers. Therefore provision is made for a minimum of three persons, because at the smaller institutions one is sometimes unable to obtain five persons. There must be a minimum of three persons, but we can have five persons in the case of large institutions where the arguments the hon. member raised, do apply. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 38, to omit &#x201C;in every two months&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;every month&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The intention of my amendment is to provide that visits by the hospital boards to institutions shall be carried out monthly instead of every two months. Sir, I believe it is a very important function of the members of the hospital board that they should see the patients who have been put under the care of the institution, and I believe that it would be to the advantage both of the patient and of the relatives of the patient and also a source of comfort to know that regular inspections take place and regular opportunities exist for patients to place before the hospital board any representations which they wish to make. As the clause stands now, it says that the board shall visit any institution in respect of which it has been appointed at least once every two months. We suggest that it should be once every month. Then the clause goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and shall afford every patient therein an opportunity of making in person any representations he may wish to make to the board.</block>

<p>During the Second Reading debate yesterday it was pointed out by many speakers on both sides of the House that there was an acute shortage of psychiatrists, and it was also pointed out that in some State institutions there were no psychiatrists on the staff due to this acute shortage. I feel that under those circumstances, which are not likely to be rectified in the near future because psychiatrists do not just grow on trees and it would take a long time to overcome this backlog of psychiatrists, it would be desirable for this facility to exist so that patients will know that they have this opportunity. We know, from what the hon. member for Rosettenville has said, that in the composition of the hospital boards it is considered desirable, where practicable, to have a medical man on the board, and I believe that it is important that this medical man who serves on the hospital board should have the opportunity every month, if necessary, of investigating any complaints or representations which may be forthcoming from any patient in the institution.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this, too, is an amendment which I find very difficult to accept since we are dealing here with the practical execution of an exceptionally difficult task by people who offer their services voluntarily. That is really the main idea behind this. The hon. member rightly mentioned a few things on which I agree with him. If it had been proved in the past that this provision had given rise to patients being neglected, I would have agreed with the hon. members, but under the new dispensation we believe that we shall have a better integration of doctors and patients and a more effective interaction among doctors and various patients; that the ordinary doctors will visit the patients daily and that we should not place this board, which consists of volunteers, under the obligation to meet at least once a month. As it is we ask them to meet at least once every two months. I do not want us to find ourselves in a position at some later stage where we shall not have any board members at all. I am just mentioning this. It falls within the discretion of the board to meet at intervals of less than two months, and I think we must leave it at that for the present. I do not really have anything more to say in this respect. The only thing is that I do not think that it is desirable to effect this amendment at the present time and I think that during the discussion of the next clause, on which an amendment is also to be moved, I shall indicate to the hon. member why I have come to this decision.

I thought <span class="col_2029-2030" refersTo="page_1028"/>about that last night and this morning, and I think he has something here. Seeing that the hospital board does visit the hospital every two months, we can easily include here this compulsion on them also to hold a meeting every two months, and not necessarily leave it open to them to hold meetings whenever they want to. So I think I can meet him half way there again and make it at least every two months. Then they can hold meetings in between if they consider it necessary.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when we debated this measure at the Second Reading the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport motivated this clause with the justifiable argument that fly by night travel agents had in many cases let travellers down by being unable to fulfil their commitments after having accepted the money for a booking. We argued, however, that this clause went much further than the mere protection of travellers against unscrupulous travel agents. The principle has now been accepted and we accept the principle as expounded by the hon. the Deputy Minister that such protection should be granted. In order to clarify and to limit the protection provided by clause 2 to those persons whom the hon. the Deputy Minister himself stated were the object of protection, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To insert the following subsections to follow subsection (1) of the proposed new section 2A:</block>

<block name="quote">(2) Such authority shall be granted to&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_2031-2032" refersTo="page_1029"/>(a) any company, society or organization which satisfies the commission that it intends to arrange a charter flight for the benefit of its own employees or members and their families; or</li>

<li>(b) any person, company or organization which deposits with the commission such moneys or guarantees as may be required by the commission to ensure fulfilment of all obligations offered by such person, company or organization.</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">(3) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any publication, advertisement or offer which refers to journeys originating and terminating outside the borders of the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>If accepted, as I hope it will be, this amendment will provide in principle that authority will in fact be granted to genuine organizations such as chambers of commerce or other associations which offer charter flights for the benefit of their own members. They will still have to apply. The hon. Minister made great play of the fact that all they had to do was to write a letter. Our objection was not that they had to write a letter but to what would be the answer to that letter. This amendment, subsection (a) of the proposed section 2A(1), lays down for the guidance of the commission that a company, society or organization which satisfies the commission&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;which satisfies&#x201D;&#x2014;will be a body which if it applies will normally obtain such an authority. In other words, it is a guide to the commission and it indicates in what circumstances the authority provided for in this new section 2A will be granted. However, it leaves the discretion with the commission as it is in the clause here and as adopted in principle. Subsection (b) provides that where there is any doubt the commission may again use its discretion as to an amount which it itself shall determine and which guarantees fulfilment of the obligations of a travel organization. The third proposed new subsection, the one dealt with by my hon. colleague for Kensington, deals with advertising or news stories in publications dealing with such flights in other countries, for instance the London-Venice flight which I quoted yesterday from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of March 4th, or the London-New York flights. Such flights will therefore be excluded from the prohibition of this clause&#x2014;in other words, flights originating and terminating outside the Republic. I do not want to argue this at length at this stage, but I will give the hon. the Deputy Minister the opportunity to indicate whether he is prepared to accept this amendment which in fact sets out what he said this clause intended to achieve. I hope that he will accept it.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban Point was good enough to give me a copy of his amendment a few moments ago. I have had the opportunity to study it thoroughly, but for reasons which I am going to point out it is unfortunately not possible for me to accept it. In the first place the member stated, quite rightly, that this was purely a matter of an application to the National Transport Commission and therefore a reply to a letter, and then he said very clearly that it would be within the discretion of the commission. If we were to do this, it would be mere duplication, because as the proposed section reads at present, it is entirely within the discretion of the National Transport Commission to approve such an application after receipt of the letter to which the hon. member referred, and to issue such an authority. To elaborate on that and to accept the amendment proposed by the hon. member, would simply amount to an extension of that. It would serve no purpose, no purpose whatsoever. Exactly the same goes for point (b). The hon. member stated very clearly that he left it to the discretion of the Transport Commission. In terms of the amending Bill which we have before us, the National Transport Board already has the right to make regulations for arranging and providing for these matters. They may, within their discretion, ask in the regulations for the very thing the hon. member has requested in his amendment. This is once again an instance of pure duplication, and it is totally unnecessary. It can already be done under the proposed clause.</p>

<p>As regards the first point which the hon. member made in his amendment, I want to point out that under this Bill the National Transport Commission as such has no authority in countries abroad over flights originating and terminating outside the borders of the Republic. They have absolutely no authority over such flights. <span class="col_2033-2034" refersTo="page_1030"/>Therefore that argument falls away completely. The objections raised by the hon. member for Durban Point, and those raised by the hon. member for Kensington during the Second Reading debate, fall away completely. In any case, there is no jurisdiction over those flights and nothing can therefore be done about them. I want to make it very clear that this clause contains one single principle. Up to the present the position was that a person or organization advertised a flight first, any flight, and a licence or authority for that flight was only obtained later. Now the position is just being reversed: in other words, authority must first be obtained from the National Transport Commission and subsequent to that the flight may be advertised and a licence may be obtained for undertaking that flight, etc. The only difference as a result of the position brought about by this clause, is that that procedure is inverted. Instead of advertising first and then obtaining authorization, prior authorization must from now on be obtained from the N.T.C.; subsequent to that one may advertise that such authority has been obtained, and then the flight may be undertaken. That is the only principle which is involved here. Unfortunately the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment will make absolutely no difference to the existing clause. *</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am amazed at the attitude of the hon. the Deputy Minister. He advanced reasons here for the necessity of this particular clause. But now that we are putting the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s sincerity to the test by embodying the same reasons in an amendment, he refuses to accept that amendment. In other words, after the hon. the Deputy Minister has advanced reasons for the amendment of the Act, he now refuses to accept those reasons in an amendment. Let me just deal with the last point first. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that this Bill does not apply in countries abroad. Of course it is applicable to advertisements of flights in countries abroad which appear in publications in South Africa. How can he say, therefore, that this clause does not apply outside our borders? If a newspaper here in South Africa writes about a foreign flight without having obtained the necessary authority from the commission, it contravenes the Act in terms of this clause. Then it is an offence and it may be sentenced to a fine of R1 000. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows so little about his own Bill that he stands up here and says that this clause has nothing to do with overseas flights. Indeed, it does not have anything to do with the flights as such, but it does have to do with advertisements or any newspaper articles in connection with such flights.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The issue is that, when the hon. the Deputy Minister asks for powers and tells us the reasons why he does so, and when we want to circumscribe and lay down the conditions under which that authority shall be granted, he immediately refuses to circumscribe the powers. In other words, he wants a blank cheque. What does he want a blank cheque for? Why is he not prepared to place in the Bill an indication to the commission under which circumstances, as the amendment reads, it shall grant an authority? That leaves the exercising of discretion by the commission to two issues, namely whether the organization is a genuine organization and, secondly, whether the guarantees it asks for are sufficient. In other words, it limits the discretion of the commission to two fields: the genuineness of the applicant and the extent of the guarantees. But the hon. the Minister does not want that limitation. He wants total power without any limitation upon he conditions under which the commission can accept or reject. If the commission does not like a publication, a company or a travel agent, he can simply say: &#x201C;I am not giving you permission&#x201D;. This amendment however, would limit the commission, if it were a travel agent, to laying down guarantees which are required, and if it were another organization, to being satisfied that that organization was catering only for its own members. In other words, we are trying to circumscribe the power of the commission to refuse authority. We are trying to limit it to the cases which the hon. the Minister quoted. If he refuses this then we are entitled to question the <i>bona fides</i> of his explanation for the need for this, because he is refusing exactly what he is asking for. I do not want to question the <i>bona fides</i> of the hon. the Deputy Minister; I do question whether he is perhaps being misled in that he is being advised to reject this because the motive is something else than what we have been told is the motive of this clause. If it were not so, why does the Minister refuse to limit it? If there were not some other motive, why should he refuse to circumscribe the powers of the commission? <span class="col_2035-2036" refersTo="page_1031"/>Why should he want a greater power than that for which he says this Bill is designed? The hon. the Deputy Minister has now opened up a completely different field, because we are now forced to consider what the real motives are behind this measure. The National Transport Commission is bound by law to prevent over-competition and in practice, whether we like it or not, it is the protector of the South African Railways on the ground, and of the South African Airways in the air. It must be by the very nature of its purpose in life. Its purpose in life is to protect the South African Airways as far as this Bill is concerned and to protect licensed carriers from excessive competition by other carriers. Therefore the mental approach of the commission is one of &#x201C;is this going to create competition?&#x201D; That is not the object of this clause. This clause is to protect the public from exploitation by unscrupulous agents, but in the way in which it is worded here, it is in fact not simply protecting the public, but opening the door to a decision to refuse the right to advertise a flight on the grounds that it will lead to competition rather than that it will lead to exploitation of the public. That, I suggest, is in fact the motive which the hon. the Minister is trying to hide here, because if it is not, let him stand up and tell us why on earth he is not prepared to circumscribe the conditions under which the commission must grant or refuse a certificate to advertise a flight. With all the protection in the world for the public in the form of guarantees, which we in our amendment accept are necessary, the Minister says he is not prepared to limit the commission. To say that this is simply superfluous, is not so. It is not &#x201C;oorbodig&#x201D; and it is not simply extending what is in the Bill. What is in the Bill is a blank cheque to refuse anybody permission to advertise. What is in the amendment is not duplication of that, but a limitation of that within the principle which has been accepted at the Second Reading.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet, let me raise one point which I think we should also clarify. This concerns those who will be affected by this Bill. In the English version we find that an agent is affected by this clause &#x201C;unless he is the holder of a licence under this Act authorizing such conveyance or is the authorized agent of such a holder&#x201D;. In the Afrikaans it reads:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; tensy hy die houer van &#x2019;n lisensie ingevolge hierdie Wet is wat bedoelde vervoer magtig, of die gevolmagtigde van so &#x2019;n houer is &#x2026;</block>

<p>As I understand it, &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D; is a representative, a person with the full authority of the licensee, whereas an agent is not a person with the full authority of the licensee. He is an agent authorized to act in the sale of tickets, while a &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D; is a fully authorized representative. I ask the hon. the Minister to clarify which of the two meanings, the English or the Afrikaans, will be applied here.</p>

<p>Sir, coming back to the amendment and leaving the aspect of publication aside, I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to tell us whether he has in fact any objection to the people of South Africa knowing what it costs to fly from London to New York. Because obviously, an overseas travel magazine, or our own <i>Travel and Trade</i> magazine in South Africa, when they publish an article, cannot go running to the Minister every time to get permission to publish for instance overseas fares. So they will be committing an offence. Now what is the objection to the people of South Africa knowing what overseas flights cost? Because they will not be able to know. This is an iron curtain, a curtain of censorship. Are we now to live as people live in Russia, cut off from the truth of what is happening in the outside world; almost every overseas publication dealing with travel which wants to write for the information of South Africans will first have to come to the National Transport Commission.

<p>If a person, company or organization approaches the National Transport Commission with the guarantees which he proposes in subsection (2)(b) of his amendment, guarantees in respect of obligations, deposits and moneys, does he for one moment think that the Commission will not give its approval? That is exactly what the legislation envisages, which is what the hon. the Deputy Minister said. Now why does the hon. member want to insert the obvious into the Bill with regard to certain specific bodies and persons only and not with regard to others? Once again I want to put it very clearly to the hon. member that I cannot see where in this legislation he finds all these sinister motives, for example that we allegedly wanted to prohibit people from going overseas. Why should we do that? On the contrary, we are in fact trying to make the South African public more aware of air travel. We want them to make use of the comfort and the timesaving aspect of air travel. That is why the National Transport Commission would like to encourage this. But the Commission and this Government have an obligation towards the public to protect them. If things were to happen&#x2014;as did happen in the past under this self same Department of Transport with regard to other activities&#x2014;involving people making money in a dishonest and improper manner, then it would not be the hon. member for Durban Point and the members on his side of the House who would have to endure the public&#x2019;s criticisms; then the blame would fall on the hon. the Minister and the Government. Then they would sit back and look on with pleasure. Then they would go further and try to make political capital out of the situation. Now I want to tell the hon. member this: It has been proved that the public has been misled by such advertisements in the past. People took chances which did not come off. No proper arrangements were made and people ran off with the money of others. The Minister must do something about this. What must he do? He is doing exactly what the hon. member for Durban Point has, in one way or another, been trying to say all afternoon, and that is to prescribe in the Bill what has to be done. These agents must only do what is prescribed in the Bill, before they may start advertising or before they may compromise people or take their deposits, and go to the National Transport Commission. Then they only have to say, &#x201C;This is what we want to arrange. This is our intention. These are the guarantees we offer. These guarantees enable us to give the assurance that the public&#x2019;s money which we take from them, will be protected. Grant us permission to arrange such a flight.&#x201D; Why will the National Transport Commission not do so? This is exactly what this legislation envisages.</p>

<p>No, the National Transport Commission always has a discretion. I think it is utterly impossible for us in this House to foresee all possibilities. At the moment the hon. member opposite can see only a few. That is why there are regulations in terms of which these matters may be regulated. I think the hon. member must see the matter in perspective. I think he has certain prejudices in this regard. He thinks the South African Airways wants to eliminate competition. That is not so. The South African Airways likes to have people support it, but the South African Airways also realizes the value of people being air travel conscious. Therefore they are not of the opinion which the hon. member for Durban Point ascribes to them, i.e. that they want to prevent people from flying.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as usual, the hon. member for Parow seems to have got things the wrong way around. I want to suggest to him that if he wants to widen the effect of the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Point, I am sure that that hon. member will be only too pleased to have his amendment widened. I am sure, however, that he will not get any support from the hon. the Deputy Minister. But we shall support him. He says that we are stating the obvious, and he says that the obvious does not even need stating. Why does he not take a good look at the proposed new section 2A? There is nothing obvious about that. What is obvious, if anything, is that it is an all-embracing provision that can be used in some very strange ways. Hence the reason for my hon. colleague&#x2019;s amendment. When he talks about the discretion of the <span class="col_2039-2040" refersTo="page_1033"/>National Transport Commission, I may say that we have heard from the hon. the Deputy Minister that regulations are going to be promulgated to deal with this matter. We do not know what the regulations are, and that hon. member does not know what they are. He is prepared blithely to accept whatever may be produced by way of regulations. All I can tell him is that we are not prepared to do that.</p>

<p>Sir, returning to the hon. the Deputy Minister, I wish that he would simply study clause 2 of this Bill and take away certain words that are not essential for placing one interpretation upon it. If he does that&#x2014;and I hope he will have a look at it now&#x2014;it can read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall, without the authority of the National Transport Commission, make known by any means that any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service.</block>

<p>Is that clear to him? The hon. the Deputy Minister was remarkably shy yesterday afternoon when he replied to the Second Reading debate. We had put a number of very pertinent points to him and somehow he failed to answer us. One of the things I wanted to know, and I reminded him of it right at the end, was whether the definition of an air service was confined to South Africa, or whether it applied to air services anywhere in the world. He heard the question, but he was not prepared to answer it. He could have answered it very easily; he had all the time in the world. We must ask him again: Does the definition &#x201C;Air services&#x201D; apply to air services anywhere in the world? Do not let him come with any story about the National Transport Commission only having jurisdiction over air services in South Africa or those that terminate or originate here. He knows that is nonsense because he knows that that has nothing to do with the interpretation of the new clause 2 with which I am dealing. Sir, perhaps I can help him. When he replied to the Second Reading debate yesterday, he put a few questions, loaded questions, to my colleague, the hon. member for Salt River, and he expected him to give &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D; answers. As I say, I think they were loaded questions. But in all sincerity I want to put some genuine questions to him, to which he can reply by nodding or shaking his head, about the application of the proposed new section 2A. Sir, would it be permissible in terms of the proposed new section 2A for <i>The Cape Times</i> to carry an advertisement by a non-scheduled airline operating, say, from Swaziland to Luxemburg without the authority of our National Transport Commission, i.e. without <i>The Cape Times</i> first having the authority of the National Transport Commission? That is a simple question. I wonder if he knows the answer. You see, Sir, I only have three speaking opportunities on this clause and if every time I have to ask for individual answers to these questions, I shall not be able to put all my questions. Can he tell us, just by way of a nod, whether <i>The Cape Times</i> would be able to publish an advertisement by a non-scheduled airline operating a service from Swaziland overseas without first obtaining the authority of the National Transport Commission? Can he tell us?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2041-2042" refersTo="page_1034"/>That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of holding not fewer than two sessions of Parliament annually, except in years in which general elections are held.</block>

<p>Sir, I want to make it clear at the outset that while the motion merely asks the Government to consider the advisability of holding at least two sessions of Parliament in any normal year, i.e. in years in which no elections are held, I shall argue as strongly as I can that reform in this direction is long overdue. Indeed, when one considers the scope of parliamentary activities today as compared with 20 years or 30 years ago, one might well question how we have come to the stage of governmental development at which we found ourselves without so far having examined this aspect of our parliamentary life. You see, Sir, what we have to examine is whether we as parliamentarians, and Parliament as an institution, can keep pace with modern developments and with the demands being placed upon us. For a moment, before going further, it might be fruitful for us to consider one or two things about the lives of parliamentarians under the present system of one session a year.</p>

<p>One can, certainly if one is in the Opposition, but I believe this is also the case with our colleagues on the Government side, say that our lives very much tend to become a helter-skelter in a crowded five or five and a half months of the year. We have daily group meetings, often meetings at which important aspects of legislation and policy are debated, and very often these group meetings, due to the shortage of time at our disposal, are double-dated. Consequently we find that we would very much like to be present at two group meetings, and sometimes even three, but that cannot be because they are held at the same time. We have our caucuses, not necessarily a daily occurrence, but quite often in the week, and also management meetings as well. Then we must not forget that while we are here, apart from our parliamentary duties, a considerable amount of constituency work comes our way. I need not tell hon. members of this House just how much work lands on our desks. This leads very often, when one thinks of the sitting hours of the House and the crowded schedules we very often have, even if one comes in early in the morning, to us having insufficient time to prepare for debates and very often, I believe, insufficient time really to study the Bills that come before us. I shall deal with this a little later. Then, of course, we have the avalanche of literature that is showered into our boxes every day, a lot of which we can throw away but a lot of which we have to read. We have to keep in touch with goings on in the outside world, through the newspapers, and we have to read journals and other publications that have to do with our particular interests in Parliament. This, as we all know, leaves us with little or no time for what one might refer to as outside life. We find ourselves coming to Parliament in the morning, leaving in the evening&#x2014;some evenings very late indeed&#x2014;without really having come into contact with the outside world. We find ourselves, in fact, steeped in what, I believe, is largely an artificial, highly-charged political atmosphere. One must not forget too, that apart from all this, the diligent parliamentarian&#x2014;there are diligent parliamentarians on both sides&#x2014;finds that he has to take home an immense amount of work.</p>

<p>I do not know whether this is necessarily the case; I believe it probably is, but I certainly have found that if I want to give serious attention to something, whether it be a Bill or a speech, it is something that I have to do by way of homework. One takes it home in the evening, one works perhaps late on it, perhaps in the early morning and very often over weekends as well.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman asks: &#x201C;Why not?&#x201D; I agree with him: Why not? At least for as long as everything, all of our parliamentary activity, is condensed into a comparatively short time. I shall take that thought further. I believe all this raises the question: In these circumstances, can a member of Parliament fairly be expected to render the quality of service that is required of him? I believe the answer is &#x201C;No&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I shall come back to a few of these points later, but I should like to say that in moving this motion, what I have in mind is Parliament having at least two sessions per year with the total number of sitting days substantially increased so that Parliament is, in fact, in session for most of the year. Along with that I want to suggest that if we do extend our activities more evenly through the year, we should not sit for five days a week; I think we could <span class="col_2043-2044" refersTo="page_1035"/>quite comfortably follow the example set by other Parliaments elsewhere in the world and sit on four days or in some cases only on three days. Also I believe&#x2014;and this is not a sop to hon. members who might disagree with me&#x2014;that if our work is spread more evenly over a longer period, the provisions for leave of absence could well be extended.</p>

<p>I am not unaware of the organizational and administrative problems being posed, but I shall return to them later. All I should like to say now is that these problems cannot be weighed against the problem which is of fundamental and paramount importance to us, i.e. whether Parliament is, in fact, serving the country as best it can.</p>

<p>I want to make one thing quite clear. This is a private member&#x2019;s motion in the truest sense. This means that the motion as framed and introduced by me is my own and bears no formal or informal connection with my own party, or for that matter with any other party. What I am asking is that we as parliamentarians should examine ourselves and the institution that we serve and establish whether as members of Parliament and as the institution within which we operate, we are building for ourselves the kind of legislative framework within which we can truly serve the best interests of South Africa and its peoples.</p>

<p>I know that I have the tacit, if not the overt, support of many thinking members on both sides of this House. At the same time I want to point out that it would be idle to pretend that there is unanimity among our colleagues on a matter which would, of course, impose a substantial extra burden upon their already heavily weighted lives. Before we go further, let me make one thing quite clear. In everything that I say here this afternoon, the one factor that I have taken into account least is that of the comfort of members of Parliament. I believe we are approaching cross-roads in our parliamentary life and in the parliamentary developments in South Africa, cross-roads at which we shall have to decide whether we are to continue as we are, having at best enthusiastic part-time parliamentarians who are content to come to this House for five or perhaps five and a half months a year, or legislators and public watch-dogs who insist on keeping control over all aspects of Government business for as long a period of the year as they possibly can. If we wish to retain the <i>status quo,</i> we shall be subscribing to a system which, as far as I can judge, has been found to have become outdated in the modern Western world. It is a system that was probably well suited to a largely agrarian community that constituted South Africa at the time of Union and two decades or so after Union. But I believe that retaining the <i>status quo</i> will mean that we cannot measure up to what is required from Parliament in the comparatively sophisticated and complicated world of today.</p>

<p>Apart from the natural development of our economy and the inevitable complexities, including the legislative complexities, that have flown from it, we have&#x2014;certainly in the last two decades&#x2014;seen an increasing tendency towards centralization of governmental functions in South Africa, even to the extent that the central Government today has assumed control over matters which formerly fell within the purview of the provincial administrations. Provincial finances, for example, are now largely controlled by this Parliament. Even education has fallen further and further within the ambit of the central Parliament. While we of the United Party&#x2014;and I believe also the Progressive Party&#x2014;argue for decentralization as the direction along which our constitutional development should flow, it cannot be doubted that we are much more of a unitary state today than we have ever been before, with the exception of the African homelands for which the Government has provided separate administration but which nevertheless look to the central Government for the vast bulk of their financing. Regardless of whether we continue as a strongly unitary form of government or whether we deflect our course towards federalism, it is clear to me, as I am sure it is clear to every other hon. gentleman in this House, that the guiding factor for a long time to come will be this Parliament as it is established today. It is on this basis that I wish to develop my theme.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should say at this stage that one of the things that has worried a number of our colleagues, has been the prospect that, should we spread parliamentary activities over the year, Members of Parliament will be called upon to devote the major part of the year to parliamentary work. Consequentially some of them have of course been concerned <span class="col_2045-2046" refersTo="page_1036"/>at the prospect of their not being able to devote at least half a year to their private business pursuits, whether they be farming, professional or business generally. I have tried to comfort them by pointing out that if we have two sessions of Parliament we will also have two recesses, but that does not seem to have got me very far.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not propose to devote much time to this point because I believe that being a parliamentarian is a calling and not a profession. It is far from rewarding, financially, as we all know, and in the end result it is probably far from rewarding in any other material sense. Those who choose it, however, must be prepared to enter into the spirit of it to the virtual exclusion of other factors. In other words, the form of Parliament must be placed far above the comfort of parliamentarians. Comfort and convenience alone must not be allowed to deter us from what we believe is right for our country and our people.</p>

<p>If one examines the records of the sittings of Parliament since Union in 1910, it becomes obvious that there has been very little change in the pattern of sessions. There have been fluctuations in the number of sitting days, but they have mostly ranged from about 85 to 115 in any particular year. A peak was reached in one unusual session, the Third Session of the Ninth Parliament of the Union, which had 133 sitting days between 18th January, 1946 and 14th February, 1947, but it will be seen that that was a very extended Parliament. If anything, the number of sitting days has dwindled in the last few years. Last year and in 1971 we had 90 sitting days in each year, while in the election year, 1970, both sessions of Parliament covered a total of no more than 76 days. In 1969 Parliament sat for 95 days and in 1968 it was in session for 91 days. Of course, these figures cannot be looked at in a vacuum. For any sort of comparison to be made it is essential to consider the actual business of Parliament that is being transacted year by year and the demands that are made on Parliament as an institution and upon the members themselves. Probably nothing illustrates this more graphically than the annual Budgets that are placed before Parliament. If one goes back in history a little, right back to the year 1911&#x2014;and I chose that year because by then the newly formed Union had had a chance to settle down&#x2014;one sees that the Central Budget provided for expenditure on revenue account totally &#x00A3;16,9 million. In the session in which that Budget was passed Parliament was in session for a total of 98 days. We have seen our country grow since then and we have seen our economy grow. By 1920 the Budget had risen to &#x00A3;23 million, that is expenditure on revenue account, and in that year there were 98 sitting days. By 1930 we had seen more growth and where the Budget figure was &#x00A3;30,8 million Parliament sat for 89 days. Ten years later South Africa was at war. There were two sessions of Parliament, a full one from January to May and one that started in August and proceeded into 1941 and so comparisons are very difficult to make. But coming to 1950 the Budget was already providing for expenditure on revenue account totaling &#x00A3;72,2 million and this Budget was passed in a session which lasted 105 days. Since then there has been what one might well call a dramatic transformation of the South African economy even if one makes allowances for inflationary factors and the consequent drop in the value of the rand. The 1970 Budget as presented provided for the expenditure of R1 924 million on revenue account; in fact the corrected figure was higher. In 1970, in both sessions of Parliament, as I said earlier, there were only 76 sitting days. The pattern of Government expenditure has of course become accentuated since then and in last year&#x2019;s Budget provision was made for the expenditure of R2 845 million on revenue account. Last year, let me remind hon. members, we sat for 90 days. From this one can draw the conclusion that not only has Parliament been called upon to shoulder vastly increased responsibility for spending huge sums of money, but that the actual business of budgeting has naturally become more and more complex, so complex indeed that we must now seriously doubt whether we can fulfil our important role of watchdogs over the exchequer in the same sort of time that was spent when Parliament voted a mere fraction of the money for running a comparatively simple operation of government.</p>

<p>Statistics alone do not tell the whole story. They do, however, provide useful guides to what constitutes much of the real business of Parliament. One of the important <span class="col_2047-2048" refersTo="page_1037"/>functions of Parliament is to keep a constant check on the actions of the executive and the administration which, as we know from experience, is largely the function of the parliamentary Opposition. An indication of how the function has loomed in importance in recent years is given by the fact that last year a record number of 1 306 questions were put to Ministers. The year before a record has also been set up of 1 168 questions. Here I must record that our facilities for questioning Ministers have been improved considerably by the innovation of our being able to table daily written questions to Ministers. This I think is something which has helped not only the Opposition but Parliament as an institution. The figure of 1 306 questions for the 90 sitting days of last year means that an average of 14,5 questions were asked each sitting day. As we know, the session lasted from the end of January to mid-June. Even allowing for the fact that a good number of questions related to the previous recess, it must be asked whether it is right that the vigorous day-by-day questioning of Government actions and decisions should suddenly cease because Parliament has gone into recess, and whether this whole operation should come to nought for six and perhaps six and a half months of the year.</p>

<p>This brings us to the crux of the problem, a problem that is not confined to the political party in power or that in Opposition. After all, roles are reversed, and roles might well be reversed soon. Sir, the question is whether Parliament is justified in handing over the entire control of government to the Executive, the Cabinet, for more than half of every year. Put another way, we can ask ourselves whether the country is getting its full value for its money out of Parliament as it is at present. I believe that the answer is that the country is not getting its full value, even though this does not reflect on individual parliamentarians.</p>

<p>If there is one criticism that has prevailed in the time that I have been, one might say, within the precincts of this House, either in the Press Gallery or in this Chamber, it has been the almost annual criticism that, especially towards the end of a parliamentary session, the Opposition is confronted with a welter of legislation, a circumstance which has very aptly been called &#x201C;legislation by exhaustion&#x201D;. We all know the situation. The hon. the Leader of the House is well aware of the objections that have been voiced. I think he has a fair amount of sympathy with them. I believe he always has. This habit of the Government of insisting on pushing through a considerable volume of legislation towards the end of the session&#x2014;it does not necessarily only apply to the end of the session&#x2014;gives the Opposition little time to study legislation properly and to debate it in the relaxed and matured atmosphere that should be the preserve of legislators. I need not dwell on this point; the facts are known well enough to every member of this House.</p>

<p>But I should like to go further and suggest that in the crowded schedule of a 90-day session of Parliament, in which we have a main Budget, a Railway Budget and a Post Office Budget, apart from the Part Appropriation and the Additional Appropriation Bills, far too little time is afforded for Government and Opposition members to probe proposed legislation to the depth to which it should be probed. It might well be said that the country has been the loser when legislation has been rushed through Parliament at a speed that has not really given parliamentarians time to handle it adequately.</p>

<p>Then there is also the question of whether, if Parliament had more time at its disposal, spread more evenly through the year, the Government might be prepared to refer far more legislation to Select Committees before the Second Reading stage. If this were done&#x2014;and we would need the time to do it&#x2014;I believe that only good would result; for such legislation can be tested fairly exhaustively before it is brought to the floor of this Chamber. Indeed, Sir, I would suggest that we might well then be able to afford time to have a fresh look at the whole question of Select Committees, standing Select Committees in particular. If we were able to spend more time on Select Committees, we might well find ourselves able to study such things as proposed water projects, for example. In the case of some of them, they are brought to this House and are placed on the estimates. An arbitrary figure is given, and then successive White Papers are produced which increase the cost two, three and perhaps even more fold; the Orange River project was an example of this.</p>

<p>There are problems attached to my proposal, but I do not believe that these problems are too many or too great to be overcome. What I have in mind when I ask <span class="col_2049-2050" refersTo="page_1038"/>for at least two distinct sessions of Parliament is for us to have one as a budget session and one largely legislative, although the latter could well give far more time than is afforded at present to private members&#x2019; business. As I have indicated earlier, I realize that there are problems. Some of them will be dealt with by subsequent speakers, but before we admit defeat&#x2014;and I believe we should not have to admit defeat&#x2014;let us ask ourselves one thing: Whatever problems there are, is the most important thing not to have an efficient, sound and highly effective Parliament in South Africa?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Kensington on a very interesting and well-considered speech, on which he probably spent a great deal of time. The speech at least evidences a little idealism, and who does not like a bit of idealism? I must tell him I always expected that if someone came forward with a motion about having two or more sessions of Parliament per year in South Africa, it would be someone from somewhere in the back benches, someone who had not already been involved with this Parliament for some years. I did not expect it to come from a member such as the hon. member for Yeoville, for example, or the hon. member for Durban Point or others.</p>

<p>I think older members know that Parliament has taken shape over a period of centuries, that it has taken shape in South Africa over many, many decades and that if it could still have been improved, this would at least already have been done after 60 years.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington chiefly made three points. In the first place he complained about the great deal of work, and for that I want to give him credit; a Member of Parliament has a great deal of work. I want to speak, in particular, of the more senior members. But I do not really want to say now that members in the back benches work themselves to death. In fact, I know of many members who even get an opportunity to do a bit of studying here in Parliament, and it keeps them fresh. I could give you many names. This just goes to show me that they still have time to do that. But, Sir, are we now going to become afraid of work? I should hate to know that the hon. members for Kensington and Pinelands, who each have two strong arms, work only two or three hours a day. I should hate that; it would be a tremendous waste of manpower, and good manpower, if they, as the hon. member said, only sit here for four days of the week to do a little work, and then perhaps do something else for the rest of the week. I do not think we must be afraid of work. I think Parliament should rather set an example to the rest of South Africa to show we are prepared to work, because that is what we need in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the appropriations, and showed how they were constantly increasing. That is so, without any doubt, but it does not mean that if an appropriation continually increases, criticism necessarily follows suit. If the hon. member for Kensington wanted to have a point there, he should rather have said that the Standing Orders should be changed so that he could have more of an opportunity to criticize the Budget. But I now ask the hon. member for Kensington if there is any member of the Opposition, in the modern functioning of our Parliament here, who wanted to speak further about a subject and could not find the opportunity to do so. The answer is &#x201C;No&#x201D;. No one can say that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the rules of this House are that the Opposition can speak about each Bill for as long as they like, and if there is anyone who has any complaints it is the hon. members on this side, because as soon as the U.P. stop speaking, then of course, as a result of our alternative debating, we must also stop speaking. That goes without saying. I do not think the hon. member can advance that as an argument.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of the many questions that are asked. I want to have him consider doing a little research about the number of questions asked throughout the years. He would then find out that the most questions per member per day are asked just after an election, and also just before the term of that Parliament expires. In those two periods the most questions are asked, apparently to make an impression on the electorate and I do not blame hon. members for that. This party also did so when it was in the Opposition. <span class="col_2051-2052" refersTo="page_1039"/>But that is how Parliament functions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this subject is not being broached for the first time in this House today. In fact, it is a subject that has virtually been done to death. It was raised for the first time in 1918 by the then member for Umbilo, Mr. C. P. Robinson. It was also raised in the same year by the hon. member for Boshof, the late Commandant C. A. van Niekerk. It was raised in the Senate in 1919 by Senator Ware, and it was raised in 1934, for example, by the then member for Roodepoort, Colonel C. F. Stallard. In all instances the Government said it was not prepared to relinquish the present one session per year.</p>

<p>It is actually unfair to compare out Parliament with any other parliament in the world. Because South Africa has a union system, we have less legislation to deal with annually than Britain, for example. In 1959, for example, America had a total of 1 159 644 Acts on its Statute Book. That is a colossal amount. Does the hon. member for Yeoville know that in South Africa we only have about 500 principal Acts&#x2014;I am now not speaking about the amending Acts passed each year In other words, our legislative programme is not pressing as in other countries. Many of our ordinary legislative functions rest with the provincial councils, etc., with the result that we have a relatively small number of Acts that have to be passed annually.</p>

<p>I want to acknowledge that it would have been an ideal situation if our Parliament could have sat throughout the year. That much I want to concede to the hon. member. But you must not forget that South Africa is different to any other country in the world because it constitution has embodied in it something that is unique. In terms of sections 23 and 27 of the Constitution we have provision for various capitals, the administrative capital, Pretoria, and the legislative capital, Cape Town. If we want to speak about two or more sessions per year we shall first have to do away with that arrangement and I want to give all hon. members, who speak from time to time about the shifting of Parliament, the following for their consideration: As unlikely as it is that the administrative capital in Pretoria will be shifted to Cape Town, so unlikely is it that the legislative capital of Cape Town will be shifted to Pretoria; I want to put it in even stronger terms: Just as unlikely as it is that Meintjieskop will be transferred to Cape Town, so unlikely is it that Table Mountain will be transferred to Pretoria. We can forget about that altogether because it deals with an agreement, at the commencement of Union, which we shall have to honour.</p>

<p>Sir, has the hon. member for Kensington, who is a relatively new member, ever thought of the disruption even one session per year causes as far as members, etc., are concerned, for example? The major disruption is in respect of accommodation in Cape Town for all the Members of Parliament. I see in the old reports and Minutes of the House of Assembly that as far back as 1919 the following question was put by the then member for Boshof, Commandant C. A. van Niekerk; he asked whether the Government was aware (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">that it is almost impossible for Members of Parliament to obtain proper accommodation in Cape Town for their families, whereby they are caused a great deal of inconvenience.</block>

<p>This accommodation problem has not only been in existence since yesterday or the day before yesterday, but since 1910, and it will still exist for hundreds of years in the future. At the time he also complained that Cape Town had a shortage of water. Today the city still has a shortage of water, and in that connection he asked (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">whether the Government would take these facts into consideration and take steps to change the constitution in such a way that the legislative capital is transferred to a more central, cheaper and more sanitary spot in the Union.</block>

<p>I do not know whether he had a spot like Kakamas or Pretoria in mind, but, Sir, what is most important is that he saw the problem of accommodation as a universal problem for every Member of Parliament. Sir, the present Parliament consists of 166 members of the House of Assembly and 54 Senators, a total of 220. Let us assume that each one has a wife and an average of three children. Here I want to add that there are some of the younger members who already have five children. In athletic parlance one can say they have not even warmed up properly yet. Therefore one can say that at least 1 000 people are affected, people who must obtain accommodation here for one session. Then there is the education of their children. Let us forget, for <span class="col_2053-2054" refersTo="page_1040"/>the moment, about the money involved. Their children come to schools here, in Acacia Park and in Cape Town, from 73 different schools. We know that the syallabi do not fit in; we know that when the children return they are miles behind their classmates. The hon. member probably wants a session at the end of the year as well, when those children will have to write exams. That will mean that countless numbers of those children will not pass; it cannot be otherwise.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, take the officials, for example. At present there are 270 officials that come to Parliament annually. I notice that in 1919 the then Prime Minister, replying to a question, said that it cost &#x00A3;7 700 (R15 400) to transport just the officials to Cape Town. It is impossible to determine what it costs today, but the figure of R1 million is mentioned. That is a tremendous amount. The hon. member now wants that disruption to take place twice instead of once a year. I am not even mentioning the diplomats. We already penalize them because they must maintain two ambassadorial dwellings, one in Pretoria and one in Cape Town, but their ordinary staff do not have special houses; they must creep into flats here and rent houses during the session and now the hon. member expects them to do this twice a year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what about the Press? There are many of us who are very prejudiced as far as the Press is concerned. But the Press is part of the parliamentary institution. If we do not have the Press here, we could speak until we were blue in the face, but our electorate would not know what we were saying. I think we could demonstrate more tolerance towards the Press. In the old days, when the British Parliament was formed, an ordinary member had to pay one penny for every ten lines he wrote down in Parliament. In 1771 Baldwin even had to appear before the Parliamentary Bar because he had published a few of the debates and thereby committed a breach of parliamentary privilege. Only since 1835 has the Press obtained permission to publish debates, and today we are grateful for the fact. One could say that Parliament today without the Press would be like <i>Klaas Geswind en zijn Paard</i> without the ghost. It is part and parcel of Parliament. Why then should we not consider them, because they also have those problems? Then we would, for two sessions in the year, i.e. twice a year, have that whole &#x201C;rigmarole&#x201D; of members, officials, diplomats and the Press hunting for flats and accommodation. Is it not bad enough already?</p>

<p>But let us take our Budget. The country&#x2019;s Budget is adapted to the parliamentary sessions. Our financial year ends on 31st March. Therefore the Budget Speech must be delivered at more or less a certain time of the year. I do concede that the Main Budget has already, on occasion, been delivered as early as 19th February, in 1919 for example, on 25th February in 1942, on 28th February in 1946 and in 1948, and it has already been delivered as late as 5th May, in 1922 for example, and on 30th June in 1924, after four months of that financial year had already passed. But a country&#x2019;s finances are not organized in that way. One cannot simply rope Parliament in to approve the Estimates afterwards. That does not work. How are those Estimates to be prepared? The present practice is that officials hand in their statements and Estimates in October, but the hon. member now wants a parliamentary session in October. He should not think this is an easy thing to do. Today&#x2019;s Budget is not just a simple piece of arithmetic, it is a complicated system of economic cycles prepared with due consideration for foreign trends and other complicated formulae. It is therefore not such an easy matter. Sir, how can this be done if Parliament is sitting at the time?</p>

<p>But now I want to ask the hon. member for Kensington this. Is it now at all necessary, apart from all the objections, to have two sessions of Parliament per year? What is the trend? I will readily concede that instead of the customary 100-day session we should perhaps sit for 120 days if it is necessary. Very well, let us then sit, but the trend in South Africa is rather for Parliament to sit fewer and fewer days and do more and more work. Sir, today Parliament functions a good five times better and more effectively than was the case 25 years ago. Just let me give you a few figures. In 1912 there were 104 sitting days and they only passed 30 Acts. In 1922 there were 107 sitting days and only 42 Acts were passed. In 1942 there were 70 sitting days with 47 Acts. In 1962 there were 104 sitting days with 93 Acts and last year there were 90 sitting days with 103 Acts. What does this <span class="col_2055-2056" refersTo="page_1041"/>indicate? It indicates that over the years this Parliament has been made to run more smoothly. It functions much more effectively. Its procedure has been improved. It is more streamlined. And let us pay tribute to those who deserve it. There are many bodies to whom tribute must be paid for this, but I just want to mention one name and that is the name of the present hon. Leader of the House, Mr. Ben Schoeman. His name will be deeply carved in the history of this Parliament for his contribution to the smooth running of this Parliament and its proceedings. I want to mention a few examples to show how smoothly things work today. In 1914 there was the Indemnity Act with only four clauses. General Smuts holds the record in this Parliament for the longest speech, i.e. a speech of six and a quarter hours. His speech in Hansard, when he introduced the Second Reading, runs to 55 columns, and that was in a summarized form, as Hansard was published at the time.</p>

<p>Of the Indemnity Act. But this Act, which contained four clauses, took 134 hours to get through this Parliament. That is equal to 34 sitting days, for one Act. And what is even more interesting, is that the six Opposition members took up 102 of the 134 hours. Sir, there were 40 divisions, at 23 of which less than 10 people were sitting on the one side. Now I am not even speaking of night sittings and of the guillotine that was employed in later years. I remember that when I came here we still regularly sat in the evenings. We had lovely night sittings. I should have liked to have seen the hon. member for Kensington, who now complains about so much work, after one such night sitting. It must not be thought that democracy and Parliament functioned better in those days. Just look at what happened in the Senate with the Budget, for example. In 1934 all the stages of the Appropriation Bill&#x2014;the enormous South African Budget, were dealt with in only one hour and 20 minutes. It went through the Senate like greased lightning. In 1935 it took only 40 minutes in the Senate. In 1936 it took only half an hour, only 30 minutes to pilot through the Senate the entire South African Budget in all its various stages. It was at the time, and also in my day, the custom that when Parliament adjourned that day, Ministers and members went and sat in the Senate to see that they passed the legislation immediately so that we could go home. When Senator Nichols&#x2014;I quote from Senate Hansard, 1941, col. 400&#x2014;said the following he clearly had the third chapter Virgil in mind&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When we are suddenly faced in the Senate with a galaxy of ten or eleven Ministers all sitting on the Government benches like gods on the peaks of Olympus, fuming at delay, it reduces the Senate to a state of collapse.</block>

<p>That is how it went at the time.</p>

<p>Do not think that things went more smoothly at the time than they do today. Do you know that at the time there was an arrangement in Parliament that during the discussion of the Budget one could only criticize the Government for its actions during that financial year. Today the field is open and hon. members can criticize the Government for all its actions in the distant past and even blame it for those in the future as well. The hon. member for Maitland will acknowledge that I am right in saying that today we have a much better arrangement because there is more time at the disposal of the Opposition in which to criticize the Government.</p>

<p>Let us now put it in these terms: Does parliamentary democracy require more or longer sessions in South Africa? I say it is nonsense, complete nonsense. Democracy naturally requires that every national representative should at any time be able to express himself as far as the governing party is concerned, and now I want to ask what hon. member opposite cannot also say what he has to say here during the parliamentary session on public platforms in Pretoria and Johannesburg when Parliament is in recess? They can criticize the Government. They can get on to any platform, in Naboomspruit if it comes to that, and set the world on fire if they have the necessary ability. What hon. member of the Opposition can complain that he is at present being muzzled?</p>

<p>Democracy requires one important thing we must never lose sight of, i.e. absolute separation between the three State organs: the executive, the legislative and the judicial powers. Parliament&#x2019;s basic function is to pass laws; not to rule the country in that sense, but to pass laws. There are three phenomena in the development of Parliament <span class="col_2057-2058" refersTo="page_1042"/>that have led to the fact that members today are under the impression that Parliament also has executive powers. I know that if the hon. member for Bezuidenhout follows me up he will try to put it in that way, that democracy is being encroached upon. I want to ask him this question in advance: If it is so that democracy can only be fully implemented if we have two sessions or if we were to sit throughout the year, then surely there has never been a democracy in South Africa, because since 1910 we have always had only one session per year, other than in exceptional instances and at election times. I say there are three phenomena in the development of Parliament that have led to the fact that hon. members are under the impression that Parliament also has executive powers. One is that the executive authority is composed from the party with the majority in Parliament. But it has never been the case. Never confuse the original and fundamental aim of Parliament with that of the executive authority. There must be clear dividing lines in democracy. We know that the political party, as it manifests itself in our modern Parliament, only came into being in Britain for the first time. If one goes back into that country&#x2019;s history, to the year 1679 when the &#x201C;Exclusion Bill&#x201D; was passed, one would see that politics had begun to play a role in Parliament since that time. The motion of no confidence is an institution that has only been in use since 1841.</p>

<p>There is also a second phenomenon, i.e. the fact that a Member of Parliament can criticize the executive authority about the way in which it has spent the Appropriation. That is what the hon. member for Kensington referred to. Do hon. members know that this is a special privilege; it is a privilege to be able to criticize the executive authority. It still does not mean that Parliament has the executive authority in its hands. National representation in Parliament had its origins at the time of Simon de Montfort, when he demanded that before the king taxed the people, the people should give permission for that tax to be demanded from them. This is a rule that is still summarized, for example, in section 62 of our Constitution. It is also summed up in section 60, which provides that an Act which makes revenue or money available, or which must impose tax, can only be introduced in the House of Assembly. Section 62 provides that a valid measure can only be introduced by a Minister. All these are remnants of that usage and the original object of Parliament as exclusively a legislative body. We know that the first parliament that refused to grant that money was the &#x201C;Insane Parliament&#x201D; of 1258. That Parliament was not as insane as that, but someone changed its Latin Minutes, and words that were probably &#x201C;insigne&#x201D; or &#x201C;infame&#x201D; in Latin were changed to &#x201C;insane&#x201D;. That is where that Parliament got the name of the &#x201C;Insane Parliament&#x201D;. There is a suspicion that the king himself did it. Nonetheless, it just shows hon. members that the rule that this Parliament may criticize the budget is an institution that has distant origins and that springs from the parliamentary source as it has developed through the centuries.</p>

<p>Thirdly there is the phenomenon that the members of the executive power are today also Members of Parliament. Of course, this never used to be the case either. The king&#x2019;s advisers always held discussions with those who had influence and who were loyal to the king. Only in 1662 were Bennett and Coventry for the first time appointed to the Cabinet from the Lower House. That was the first time that there was a Minister in Parliament, and that happened after Parliament had already had its long history and been given its substance. Only in 1668 did it become clear that there should be harmony between the Crown, the Ministers and the majority in Parliament. Only with the drawing up of the Standing Orders of 1833 in the British Parliament did government functions begin to gain precedence in Parliament. Of course, Ministers always have to take into account the fact of having the majority in this House of Assembly behind them. They must, of course, take into account the fact of always having the majority of the electorate behind them, but this still does not make of this body an executive state organ; not at all. It is of course a fact that when the executive power feels that it is necessary to convene Parliament, it also does so. It is its duty to do so. It was done, for example, in 1914 to discuss the question of war, and in 1919 to confirm the Treaty of Versailles. In 1939 it was done again in connection with the Second World War. If the Government refuses to convene Parliament in a period of crisis, I would be the first person to object to that, but this will only be when special sittings are required, and I believe this Government would always do so. In other words, there is no need whatsoever for the South African Parliament to sit throughout the year. This does not detract <span class="col_2059-2060" refersTo="page_1043"/>in any way from our parliamentary democracy. It has no effect on it whatsoever; in fact, if Parliament were to sit twice a year instead of its present single sitting, it would be difficult for members of this hon. House of Assembly to carry out their duties properly as far as their voters are concerned. My constituency covers more than 40 000 square miles. If my constituency were an ostrich and the hon. member for Kensington&#x2019;s constituency were a small stone, my ostrich would have followed his small stone without one&#x2019;s even seeing that it had anything in its throat; that is as far as surface area is concerned, of course. I have to travel 2 500 miles just to traverse my constituency. When must I have time to attend congresses and to carry out other functions which are all a part of the duty of a member of the House of Assembly? The position of a member of the House of Assembly would be impossible if he had to carry out those functions throughout the year. We do not all have urban constituencies.</p>

<p>That is why I say that this Parliament, as we have it today, took on its present shape for very good reasons. I want to appeal to the Government to keep to this arrangement. It is a very good arrangement and one that meets with the dignity and the worthiness of the present-day Parliament in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the course of my speech I shall deal with certain statements made by the hon. member for Middelland. As the hon. member for Kensington emphasized, this is a private members motion. Consequently it goes without saying that the standpoints we are adopting, are our own opinions. I am very pleased that the hon. member for Kensington brought this motion before the House of Assembly today. We are all to blame for the position being what it is, but I think we create far too few opportunities for ourselves as members of this Parliament, to discuss and exchange ideas on our Parliament and on the efficiency of our parliamentary system and our parliamentary working methods. In my opinion we are still to a large extent where we began in 1910. Twelve years ago we became a Republic, and after 12 years of being a Republic next to nothing has been done to give our Parliament a republican character, and to bring its working methods into line with the working methods of the great republics of the world. The motion, as it has been worded, deals with only one aspect of our parliamentary working method, namely how and when we should hold our sessions. But the reasons why I am supporting this motion, and why I should myself like to see a change in our existing system of having only one long, highly concentrated session during the first half of the year, obviously affect the system as a whole. I want to ask hon. members to note that the motion does not specifically ask for two sessions in a year; the motion asks that there should be not fewer than two sessions in the year. Actually I am in favour of this motion because I am in favour of a continuous session with regular shorter or longer recesses during the year as these may be required. In other words, I think that Parliament should convene regularly and that it should spread its sessions, according to the work available, evenly over the entire year.</p>

<p>I want to admit at once that, at first glance, most members will perhaps think that this will be inconvenient for them. I can understand that some of the members will probably say that the present system with its one session personally suits us better. There are members who will say that they are in a hurry to get back to their farms or their practices and that consequently they prefer one session as a matter of personal convenience. I am prepared to concede that, as far as I, too, am concerned, it is personally more convenient for me to have the one session and then to pack up and leave; but I think that this is after all a matter which should not be looked at from a personal point of view We should rather look at this matter from the point of view of what is in the best interests of South Africa. Members of Parliament come and go; the average parliamentary lifespan of a member of Parliament is only, as my information has it, seven years. In any case, I do not think that a person should make himself available for parliamentary service if he cannot give top priority to that parliamentary service. I want to add that the remuneration should of course make it possible for a person to give top priority to his parliamentary service, but this is a matter in regard to which it is always possible to make adjustments. The point is that the question of the working methods of Parliament should not be looked at from the point of view of the members&#x2019; personal interests but, I believe, from the point of view of what is best for South Africa in the circumstances of the modern times in which we <span class="col_2061-2062" refersTo="page_1044"/>are living and also in view of the kind of country in which we are living. In an earlier debate of this session I mentioned that we assembled on 2nd February this year, after Parliament had been on vacation for almost eight months. The previous year, 1972, we had a recess lasting months. That means that for almost two-thirds of the year, every year, there is no parliamentary supervision over the Government of the day, whichever Government is governing. We are not concerned here with the present Government as such. The situation is that there is no parliamentary supervision over the work of the Government of the day for at least two-thirds of every year. This in itself entails a great many disadvantages which should be obvious to us all. This gives rise to an excess of bureaucracy; bureaucracy in the unfavourable sense of the word. This leads to an excess of autocracy or overconfidence or self-righteousness, on the part of the Government of the day. Again I say that I am not alluding to any specific Government. We are discussing the system here. The principal objection which I actually have to the present dispensation is that for two-thirds of the year the Government of the day is completely at liberty, free of all parliamentary control, assistance or supervision. I know of no Western democratic parliament with a strong central government where anything like this happens. There are in fact cases of federal authorities where there are strong local state-governments and where the field of the government of the federal Parliament is consequently more limited. Here in our country we have a strong central form of government, however, with weak local government. I must say that I know of no single example in the Western democratic world where one has a situation in which the Government is for two-thirds of the year free of all parliamentary supervision. I really do not think that it is in the interests of any country that one should have such a situation if one is really in earnest about a parliamentary government. We as members know from experience that there are other major disadvantages associated with the position as it is. The present highly-concentrated sessions which we have, leads to overhasty legislation. Usually legislation in our country&#x2014;there are exceptions, but I am referring now to the normal position&#x2014;is prepared in secret by the Minister and his officials. It is introduced here in Parliament as a surprise to us, and then it is piloted through Parliament as quickly as possible by the Government of the day. It has happened, and it is still happening, that legislation ends up here on the Table of the House, and only a few days elapse before the Bill has to be dealt with in this House. If one takes into consideration that we have an average of approximately 100 sitting days per annum and that we pass an average of approximately 100 laws per annum here, it means that on an average we dispose of one Bill per day. The hon. member for Kensington mentioned that there were 90 sitting days last year and 108 laws&#x2014;therefore more than one Act per day was piloted through Parliament in 1972. No one can tell me that such a process could be to the advantage of any country in the world. The entire situation as it now exists is attributable to nothing but the system which we have. The present process is one of pressure cooker legislation&#x2014;that is what I call it. It is not necessarily deliberately so as a result of the actions of any Government, but simply because this is the existing system.</p>

<p>Now, I am very pleased that the hon. member for Kensington has given the country a picture of the enormous scope of the daily work of members of Parliament. We all know that the general public think that the only work associated with Parliament is to make a few speeches, and some people think we drink far more coffee than we really do. That is why Germany, when it created its new Parliament and its new democracy, appointed parliamentary liaison officers who regularly keep the public informed in various ways of the activities of their Parliament. They have a parliamentary weekly. They send out pamphlets to the people on the activities of Parliament. I read in one of the pamphlets that the German member of Parliament receives 4 000 blue books and documents on his table during the course of one session. Sir, I have not counted the number of documents, blue books, etc., we receive in our Parliament, but it is an enormous number. For that reason I really cannot imagine how a person like the hon. member for Middelland can think that if there are fewer public sitting days, less work is inevitably done. We know what the extent is of the preparatory work and study which ought to be done. There is the duty of maintaining contact with the public and public organizations. There is the wealth of correspondence, representations to the Government, open meetings, <span class="col_2063-2064" refersTo="page_1045"/>group meetings, caucus meetings and general political activities. The ordinary member, if he wants to do his work and wants to remain in contact with the public has a tremendous task before him which cannot, under the present circumstances, be properly carried out by anyone. There is no one sitting in this House who can state in all honesty that he is able to go through half of the pile of documents which end up on his table. Apart from all these activities we maintain a sitting programme of five working days plus one evening in the week. It has been my privilege to visit a number of parliaments&#x2014;I did not count how many&#x2014;in various parts of the world. I am referring to major parliaments now. I must say that nowhere did I come across anything of the nature of what we have here in South Africa. In Belgium, for example, they only sit for four days in the week&#x2014;not in order to work less, but in order to afford members of Parliament an opportunity of working more efficiently and doing more studying so that they may be better prepared for the task of a Member of Parliament. In Germany their Parliament sits for three weeks, and then they have one week off, after which they again sit for three weeks.</p>

<p>Again it is not a case of their wanting to do less work. We are not looking for less work. This motion is in fact aimed at getting more efficient work out of the members. They do this in Germany because they know that there are other, wider obligations than merely making a speech or participating in the activities in the Debating Chamber of Parliament. Sir, you must bear in mind that in most of these countries the sessions extend over the entire year, and in addition you will find that in most Western countries&#x2014;I can mention Canada and Australia as examples&#x2014;every Member of Parliament has a full-time secretary. He has full-time clerical assistance and then he still has this advantage that the activities of Parliament are better divided and spread over the year and that he has more time for study and for office work. In a country such as the United States of America, as many of us know, they have a library system&#x2014;I am referring to the Library of Congress&#x2014;in which there is a large staff of experts to assist members with research and the collation of facts. One can walk into the American Library of Congress and ask them to prepare a memorandum for you within a matter of a few days. All the facts you want you are able to obtain through the parliamentary library; and yet, in spite of these advantages, they find it necessary that their session should not be the high pressure type of session which we have here in our country. Sir, I have visited various parliaments all over the world, and I must honestly say that of all those I have seen, our Parliament works under the greatest pressure with, in comparison, the fewest facilities of any I have ever come across. For the sake of efficiency, for the sake of good legislation, it is not in the interests of the country that we continue on the present basis. Sir, this could have worked in 1910 and in subsequent years, but we must bear in mind that in those days we were for the most part an agricultural country. But today we are a highly industrialized country. Ours is a big country, geographically speaking. We are as multi-national, as diversified, as any country could possibly be; we are governing a territory like South-West Africa; we have innumerable international problems and many more that I could mention. The system of parliamentary government which we follow, is far closer to the requirements of 1910 than to the requirements of 1973. But a further major weakness of our present set-up is that members of the House of Assembly&#x2014;I am referring to those of us who are sitting here&#x2014;are not rendering and are unable to render the productive service for which they were elected in the eyes of the public and which they are able to render to the Government and to the administration of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in most European parliaments one will find, apart from the fact that most of them sit on a throughout-the-year basis with periodic recesses, that the members are assigned on a <i>pro rata</i> party basis to standing committees of Parliament, and these permanent committees are in session throughout the year. The services of the members are utilized throughout as representatives of the people. These committees are regularly engaged in investigating draft legislation and in calling for and hearing expert evidence in regard to it. Sir, in this way the member of Parliament is throughout a means of communication between the needs of the people and the task of Parliament. One finds in European parliaments that members are utilized to serve on commissions. Just think how many extra parliamentary commissions there are, while members here are not utilized for that purpose. In European countries it is also the practice that members of Parliament serve <span class="col_2065-2066" refersTo="page_1046"/>as external links for promoting the country&#x2019;s trade and foreign relations. In other words, the members are in the fullest sense of the word agents of the people whose services as members of parliament are utilized productively throughout for the entire term for which they were elected.</p>

<p>Sir, these standing and permanent committees also function when Parliament is not in session. For example, there are no fewer than 23 such permanent committees in Germany. I am mentioning only a few: Committee on Foreign Affairs, Committee on Defence, Committee on Questions of the Economy and the Middle Class, Committee on Social Policy, Committee on Science, Cultural Policy and Publicity, Committee on Election Questions, and in this way they are continually making use of the members of parliament in the service of the state. In Belgium for example they have the same system of permanent committees, and one of these for example, is called the Commission on European Affairs. They elect a parliamentary Commission on European Affairs, as we ought to have one on African Affairs, and the task of this Commission is as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The task of the Commission is to obtain all available information on the consequences and the application of the treaties concerning European co-operation; to maintain supervision over the administration thereof, and to follow the evolution of the organizations which it establishes.</block>

<p>There are numerous such examples. I am mentioning this simply to demonstrate how in other countries the services of the Member of Parliament are always at the disposal of the administration of the country. I want to emphasize that the members in other countries are being fully utilized in the service of the country. What I find important, is that in the Parliaments of most republican countries, as well as others, all legislation is first referred to a standing commission of Parliament before it comes before the open Parliament. The result is that by the time a Bill is placed before a member on his desk it is not as we have it here, where the Bill is prepared in secret and ends up as a surprise on your desk, then that Bill has gone through a process which began with a parliamentary commission of the two parties. That commission then requests the Government for an explanatory memorandum on what it is seeking to achieve with the specific Bill, and then it calls for evidence from people who will be affected by the legislation. By the time the Bill ends up in front of the ordinary member he has before him in addition to the Bill, an explanatory memorandum from the Government, and the public evidence concerning how the Bill will affect the people concerned. This is what I mean when I say that I believe that we should give our Parliament a more republican character, one which is closer to the major republican parliaments in the world. We shall have to modernize our parliamentary system if we wish to serve South Africa properly. For that reason I want to make an appeal to the Leader of the House. I am not asking him to agree immediately with the points we have raised here, but I do want to ask him not to condemn them out of hand. Is it entirely impossible for us to appoint a parliamentary committee to look into this system and to give a little consideration to our suggestions? There is no reason why we cannot appoint a parliamentary commission to see, in this twelfth year of the Republic, whether we cannot as Parliament modernize our working methods and utilize the services of members of Parliament more productively and improve our process of legislation. I am asking the hon. the Leader of the House to give positive consideration to appointing such a commission.</p>

<p>I know&#x2014;and with this I want to conclude&#x2014;that one of the principal counterarguments which is being advanced as to why it is difficult in practice to have a continuous session&#x2014;and the hon. member for Middelland mentioned this&#x2014;is the fact that we have two capitals. I know that secretly all governments&#x2014;and this also emerged from the passages which the hon. member for Middelland quoted&#x2014;would like to remain as free as possible from parliamentary control. That is quite natural. But I think governments should also take note that they are not permanent institutions and that they should also regard the matter in the light of the interests of the country rather than in the light of the convenience of the cabinet. But even with the retention of the position of two capitals, things are no longer all that difficult today. We have the use of telex; we have the convenience of rapid transportation, and I do not think it is so terribly impossible for one to be able to have a session during which the Budget is passed, and then further sessions during the course <span class="col_2067-2068" refersTo="page_1047"/>of the year during which previously published legislation is dealt with and only the necessary and relevant number of officials are brought down here for shorter or longer periods. As I have said, the use of telephones, telex and other means of communication make it far easier to have such a system today. I want to go even further. I believe that it is so important that we should introduce a more efficient system of legislation, that we should utilize the services of Members of Parliament to better effect, that we should have permanent committees as in Europe and, above all, that we should have more regular supervision by Parliament over the activities of the Government of the day, that I want to say that if we could only achieve this by changing the arrangement in regard to the capital, I think we ought to do so. I cannot see how the hon. member for Middelland can talk of an &#x201C;agreement&#x201D;, for many agreements made in 1910 no longer exist today. I think it is time we put 1910 behind us. Perhaps the time has come to hold a referendum as it was held at the time of our becoming a Republic and ask the voting public whether they still want the arrangement of three capitals instead of one. I do not want to go into what my preference would be if I had to vote for what city should be the capital, but I am convinced that if the one becomes the capital of the Republic, the other will eventually become the federal capital of the new federal republic of South Africa, whatever form this may take. But apart from this. I think the time is past when this kind of thing should stand in our way to ensuring more efficient parliamentary government than we have at the moment. All that we ought to do is to think ahead a little harder than some seem prepared to do at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I first want to reply to a few of the points raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He digressed a very long way from the motion. The motion specifically asks that there should not be fewer than two sessions a year. However, the motion has nothing to do with standing committees and so forth. That is a different subject altogether. The hon. member said in advance that I was going to condemn the motion. I am not going to condemn the motion; I am just not going to accept it.

Is there any basis for comparison between the constitutional system of South Africa and that of the United States of America? The United States of America is a federal state with a federal constitution. It is true that it has a Congress that is in session throughout the year, but I think our methods in South Africa are much more efficient even than those of the American Congress.

<p>But you cannot compare those countries with South Africa. South Africa is a small country with long distances. South Africa has two capitals; the one is the legislative and the other the administrative capital. No comparison with other countries is possible. The hon. member asks what is best for South Africa. I waited to hear all the reasons he advanced for changing the present system, for having at least two sessions a year. What are the reasons he advanced? He says that for almost two-thirds of the year there is no parliamentary supervision of the activities of the Government. What parliamentary supervision is there of the activities of the Government? Even if there were two sessions a year, lasting from 4&#x00BD; to five months, there would still be no supervision of the Government for two-thirds of the year. That is not going to be the solution to the matter; not at all, unless we sit almost throughout the year for about three or <span class="col_2069-2070" refersTo="page_1048"/>four days a week, as the hon. member for Kensington said. The hon. member spoke of Bills being tabled and of hon. members hardly having time to study them in depth because they are kept so busy. However, many of these Bills are unopposed and are supported by the Opposition. That is the reason why such a large number are placed on the Statute Book every year. When there is a controversial or important Bill, however, the Opposition usually have every opportunity and all the time they need to study that Bill in order to acquaint themselves with its contents. When there are discussions between the Whips of that side and myself I always give them every opportunity and all the time they need to do so. As far as that is concerned, there is no complaint. Just think how many Bills there are that go through Parliament unopposed. Let us just take the recent period. How many of the Bills that have already been accepted have been supported by the Opposition? So they do not need more time to study them. The hon. member speaks of all the activities that members have and says that they cannot do their work properly. The reason for that is that they are such a small Opposition. That is not our fault.</p>

<p>They talk about working, but I do not know whether there is one hon. member who does more work than I do. I probably have the largest department of all Ministers, and in addition I am Leader of the House. In spite of that I am in the House more often than the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do the work; not the secretaries. [Interjections.] That hon. member talks about the efficiency of Parliament, but we already have the most efficient Parliament. It has really been streamlined, as they say. That was done as a result of all the experience we gained over the years. We gained experience of how to make the machine operate smoothly. We did so by means of consultations and by means of committees consisting of members of both sides of the House. After they had made the recommendations we amended the Standing Rules and Orders. That was done to make the whole system function more smoothly and to make it more efficient. I do not believe that any inquiry is going to make Parliament function more efficiently than it is functioning at the moment. The hon. member said that there should be standing committees. The commission that recently reported on Nusas and others recommended that there be a standing security committee. I hope that this will be welcomed by the hon. member and that they will serve on that standing committee with the greatest enthusiasm, because this is one opportunity for him to practise what he preached this afternoon.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>That standing committee will be instituted, and, as the hon. members recommended in that report, they will have the opportunity to become members of that standing committee.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. member something about the British House of Commons: It is true that the hon. member has visited that Parliament, but he has not made a study of that parliamentary system.</p>

<p>Has the hon. member studied them?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>All their systems and how they work? But then the hon. member <span class="col_2071-2072" refersTo="page_1049"/>should know how the standing committees of the British House of Commons work. What they do there is to refer Bills, and certainly not all of them, to those standing committees consisting of members of both sides of the House. After they have dealt with it there is no committee stage again when the Bill comes before the House. This is done to avoid the committee stage. That makes parliament function much more rapidly than would have been the case if they had dealt with each Bill in committee as we do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>We lack the necessary public evidence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, we too can appoint select committees to deal with certain Bills, with the right to call for public evidence. We can in fact do this; there is nothing to prevent it. But the other reason is that we have such a small number of members that you cannot have a large number of members serving on various committees while Parliament is in session. Then Parliament itself and this House could not function. No members would be prepared to serve on those committees while Parliament was in session. These were the only reasons advanced by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as to why there should be two sessions of the House.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I listened with great interest to the hon. member for Kensington, but I am afraid that he did not convince me as to why there should be two sessions of Parliament per year. As a matter of fact, what he pleaded for and the whole tenor of his speech was that Parliament should sit throughout the year. He suggested that Parliament should sit three or four days per week. Well, I do not know what the members will do over the long weekends from Thursday to Monday. I do not think they will have sufficient parliamentary work to keep them busy and occupied during those days.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Australia is a different matter altogether. It is a federal country. The Provincial Councils of the Transvaal and Natal sit three or four days a week and they sit about six weeks a year. Surely the hon. members want more work and not less work. That is the whole tenor of the argument. They want more work and not less work. By sitting three or four days per week, they are going to have less work instead of more.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>What are you going to study? How many members do study? There is one very significant thing the hon. member for Kensington said, namely that the public can very well ask whether the country is getting its full value from Parliament. I wonder whether they would ask that question if Parliament sits three or four days per week. What will the public&#x2019;s reaction to that be? We know what their reaction is at the present time, because there are many members who do not do a full day&#x2019;s work whilst they are members of Parliament. Some of them certainly do but some do not.</p>

<p>Let me deal with the hon. member for Kensington&#x2019;s suggestion that there should be two sessions in a year. First of all, we shall have to split the present session of about four and a half months into two. It means that at the beginning of the year, you will probably have a two-month session to enable you to put the Railway Budget, the Post Office Budget and the Part Appropriation Bill through the House.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member think that circumstances have changed to such an extent that we should extend the time now?

<p>There will not be an opportunity to reply. You had better reply now across the floor of the House. In other words, what the hon. member now wants if he is logical is to increase the number of sitting days. The hon. member has the opportunity of putting as many questions as he likes on the Order Paper; there is no limit to the number at all. The rules of the House do not, of course, allow stupid or unnecessary questions. On the whole, hon. members can put as many questions as they like. The Bills that are introduced during a session should be passed during the same session. By agreement we have allotted the times for the discussion of financial measures. It takes about four and a half months to complete all the work. Now why in heaven&#x2019;s name must we extend the duration of the session? To do what? To sit and look at each other, or to allow private members&#x2019; motions?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has been on the Press Gallery for some time, but he has only been in this House for a very short time. I have been here 30 years and know how Parliament has functioned over the years; I know what is expected of Parliament, and I know how Parliament can be the most efficient. I know that the job of Parliament is to pass legislation and to pass financial measures. We give hon. members the opportunity of introducing private members&#x2019; motions, like the one the hon. member has before the House today, for a certain number of days during the session. Apart from that, hon. members have the opportunity in terms of the rules of the House of moving a motion, if allowed by the Speaker, to discuss a matter of importance. Hon. members have this opportunity but very seldom make use of it. In addition to that, hon. members have the half-hour rule, that is at the end of any sitting day to discuss any matter of importance. Again, they do not make use of that. What are we going to do if Parliament sits for another two or three months?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>You yourself know how often legislation is rushed through Parliament. What about last year?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>During the past few years no legislation has been forced through Parliament. During the past number of years the guillotine has not been applied, the closure has not been applied and we have had no night sittings. There has been such co-operation between the two sides of the House that that was quite unnecessary. Since I have been Leader of the House we have not had a night sitting, because Parliament is functioning excellently and very well; it is thus not necessary. When there is co-operation between the two sides of the House, we get through our work, but we are here to work and not to sit here and look at each other and talk nonsense. If hon. members want the times Parliament sits to be extended, it will merely be with the object of talking nonsense. It will be wasting the taxpayers&#x2019; money, because it costs a lot of money to keep Parliament in session. Let me think of a few difficulties if this should happen. The hon. member wants Parliament to sit throughout the year, with suitable recesses of a couple of weeks each in between. Now just imagine the disruption that would cause. Most hon. members, when they come down here, cannot afford to let their houses stand empty and consequently they have to let them. They would not be able to let them for the duration of a session because there would be recesses about every two months or so and they would have to go home for three or four weeks and then come back again. In addition, they would have to find accommodation every time they come down here. During the planting season in October farmers would have to be in Cape Town attending the session. Members who are in business&#x2014;and there are many members who are still in business&#x2014;would find their businesses being disrupted, because they would have to be sitting here most of the year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is like that now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but now their businesses are only disrupted for four <span class="col_2077-2078" refersTo="page_1052"/>and a half months, but what if there are sittings throughout the year? Those members who still practise their professions could not do so if they were here most of the year and only had recesses of two or three weeks at a time. My friend over here has already spoken about the disruption in the schooling of members&#x2019; children. Our party congresses usually take place in September and October, and one cannot have party congresses when Parliament sits. The main thing is that we have a parliamentary capital&#x2014;a legislative capital&#x2014;and an administrative capital. During one-half of the year the Government has to go to Pretoria. I know we can change that, but it will never be changed. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout can rest assured that it will not be changed in our lifetime. They will never move the legislative capital to Pretoria and we have to accept that as being the position for the foreseeable future. Then there are the long distances members have to travel. It is not like Great Britain, a small country where constituencies are close together and members have to travel only short distances to be able to attend the House of Commons. Even in European countries this is also the case. But our members have to travel long distances &#x2026;</p>

<p>Reasonable hours? I think hon. members have very reasonable hours. As a matter of fact, I have reduced the sitting hours for today by half an hour. They go home at half past six instead of seven o&#x2019;clock. I think they should be very thankful. I do not think members are overworked sitting in the House from a quarter past two until seven in the evening, and some evenings until half past six. I do not think that those members who have been here many years&#x2014;I am not speaking about the new members&#x2014;will have any objection to sitting the hours we do at the present time. But I am quite prepared to consider reducing the hours further still if hon. members want it, but then they will have to work harder and then we might have night sittings for a change again. Then, instead of sitting from a quarter past two until seven at night, we can sit from a quarter past two until half past five; but then we will have to sit on Saturdays too. I do not think hon. members would like that.</p>

<p>To sum up, I do not think that there is any real support for the hon. member&#x2019;s motion. First of all, I think two sessions a year would be something that would be quite unacceptable. Two sessions would mean two formal openings of Parliament. But worst of all, we would probably have two motions of no confidence and just imagine having to listen to all that nonsense we hear with the motion of no confidence from that side of the House twice a year! I mean, even contemplating that is enough to put you off this motion completely. But apart from that, I think that Parliament is <span class="col_2079-2080" refersTo="page_1053"/>working very efficiently. I think we should be very proud of Parliament and the way it is working. I want to put it to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that this is one of the most efficient Parliaments in any country in the world. I have also read what happens in the parliaments of other countries, and of all the democratic countries, this is one of the most efficient parliaments in the world. I think it is working very well, indeed. I think this is also one of the best behaved parliaments in the world, something of which we can really be proud. We know what happens in other parliaments. We have read about it. Even in the House of Commons, which is the Mother of Parliaments, the most scandalous scenes have occurred. We do not have incidents such as a Miss Develin walking up to a Minister and slapping his face. I think we should really be proud of our Parliament. I am. [Interjections.] I do not know whether that hon. member is. We have a Parliament of this caliber, because we have a good Speaker who looks after the House and keeps order. That is one of the reasons. Apart from that, frankly, I think that our members do not only accept, but are very proud of the traditions and conventions of Parliament and the way that Parliament has functioned over the years. I think that we should continue that way. I do not think that Parliament will improve or become more efficient by sitting a full year. It would rather become more inefficient. There would be more loafing and less work. So, under those circumstances I am afraid that I cannot accept the motion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have just listened with the usual keen attention to the hon. the Minister of Transport, because what he says, even if we cannot always agree with it or see the logic of it, is always blunt enough to be understood; so while we have not agreed with the hon. the Minister of Transport, we have at least understood what he has said to us. What he has said to us is that Parliament is a machine; Parliament is an efficient machine; its job is to pass legislation and to approve financial measures. Sir, if this is the concept of Parliament, if this is all Parliament is about, if this is why nations elect a parliament, then he is entirely right; then we do not need more time, we need less time. Then we do not need longer sessions or more sitting days, we need fewer sitting days, and the more efficient Parliament grows, the more our sitting time can be reduced until we sit for only a day. Sir, the point of this motion really is entirely different from that contemplated by the hon. the Minister. We grant him the efficiencies which have been introduced; we grant him that the procedures have been streamlined. What we are pleading for is something entirely different. We see Parliament as a living organism in our society. There is no question that in a modern society government has to play an increasingly active role. Government in the modern technological society has got to contemplate complexities, difficulties and problems far greater than was the case in the past. Who, Sir, can contemplate the future of South Africa over even a relatively short period without recognizing that social, economic, community, industrial and financial adjustments will have to be made because all these things are growing more complex and we will have real problems; we may have crises. We have to deal with these problems and we have to solve them. In the next quarter of a century we will have more urgent problems to solve than we will have had at any other time in our history. Sir, the solution of these problems is very largely a task of government; government obviously has a responsibility to handle these problems, but, Sir, when we talk of government, increasingly at grip with these crowding problems, we do not think of government as totally isolated from Parliament, as totally isolated from the people, as a completely separate political machine which merely does these things. We see the Executive as closely linked to Parliament, as operating in harness with Parliament, as getting advice and help from Parliament, as accepting criticism from Parliament where it is due, but at all times operating as a working democracy, with Parliament playing its full part. Sir if government is going to be engaged in this greater and more pressing and more urgent task and Parliament is not to grow with it, if Parliament is not to accompany it along the road of governing a greater technological South Africa, then Parliament gets left behind; Parliament will not be competent to be a partner to government in this great task which lies before us. I can understand what the hon. the Minister is saying to me, but I cannot accept that in looking at this problem he is looking to the future. I suspect he is looking to the past. He referred to the past 30 years of his experience. We respect the great experience which he has gained in this House and, <span class="col_2081-2082" refersTo="page_1054"/>very often, the use to which he has put it, but we are dealing here with a new problem. It was once said of the Bourbons that they forgot nothing and they learned nothing. Sir, we are talking not about what happened in the past. There are men who can come to this House and tell us what happened in the past and justify what happened in the past and use this as a basis to plot our future. The future is in some ways unpredictable but we can recognize at least the extent of the problems lying ahead of us. I believe implicitly that Parliament has a task to play in this future. Its task lies not in neglect and lagging behind the processes of modern government; its task lies in providing a kind of balance against a growing centralization, the growing strength of a central bureaucracy, a great technical bureaucracy which will grow in order to cope with those very complex problems which beset modern society. It is inevitable that there will be such a bureaucracy, but this bureaucracy must be balanced. This is why people send us to Parliament. It is perfectly easy, especially in a dictatorial state, to place at the centre of things a small government guided by a highly trained technocracy. That is one way of running a country; but we have another need as well. We believe that this technocratic approach, this over-centralization, must at least be balanced by a Parliament which brings directly into the forum of debate the views of the greatly assorted peoples who inhabit this country. This is the task of Parliament, over and beyond what the hon. the Minister has described. We agree that its duty is to pass legislation and to approve financial measures, certainly. But it has this other task as well. It brings here the voice of the people; it brings the sentiments, the balancing effect of people who come here directly from many parts of the country. I hope the Minister agrees with me, for I do believe that they provide a levelling and a balancing effect in our public life. It is not good enough to be ruled by bureaucrats, by technocrats, by civil servants, however efficient they are. I think we have very good ones but we need more than that in our system of Government. Therefore we plead that Parliament should be given more time, but not more time, as the hon. the Minister has suggested, to look at each other vacantly, with no work to do. Sir, we have work to do. We have more work&#x2014;and I speak now at the moment for the Opposition&#x2014;than we know how to do. We do not have a public service behind us. We have no assistance. We have to do the work ourselves. In a hundred days we have to deal with a hundred Bills. We read these Bills without help or guidance. We have to do it ourselves in our committees. We have to study the problems of the day. We have to study the trends of the day. We get these enormous masses of information which we must read. At the pace at which we work, within the short session of Parliament, one hundred days, it is almost impossible to cope with this work. We do it under great strain. We believe that extra time will be occupied, not with leisure as the hon. the Minister suggests, but with more time for work, more time for research, more time for reflection, more time for thought, more time for adequate preparation, more time for effective and efficient debate. Sir, this is what we want to bring to Parliament. We do not ask for a lot of idle days. We have in view that the time of Parliament should be more effectively used by better contributions. We are ready to admit that in the time available to us, within the limits of our own limitations, we cannot bring to Parliament as much as we should like to do. Sir, this is what we seek. We seek the opportunity to serve Parliament better. One of the things we do need is time.</p>

<p>As far as the Opposition is concerned, I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree that the Opposition has a vital role to play, whatever he may think of any particular Opposition at any particular time. It has a vital role to play in the parliamentary system, and the better that Opposition is and the more effectively it does its job, the better Parliament is and the better the Government is.</p>

<p>We have come to this House with this private motion. We say we believe there is not sufficient time to do our work properly. We believe the time that is available is too concentrated. It is concentrated within five months and we have to work to the point of exhaustion. We believe that if we had only as much time as is now allowed, the odd hundred days, but spread more evenly across the year, we would have more time for reflection and more time for contact with our constituencies and with all the various interests which try to speak to us and whom we have no time to speak to. Sir, we have dealt with the technical, personal and practical problems. These are very real. They are very real in the present system. In the five-month system there are problems. Whole families have to be disrupted. <span class="col_2083-2084" refersTo="page_1055"/>People have to move down. Ministries have to be split and there is no question that there is inconvenience. It could be argued, I believe effectively, that if we had a number of short sessions or, shall we say, a longer continuous session with intervals in between, it would be possible to do all these things more efficiently and with less interruption of peoples&#x2019; personal convenience and their private lives. I know, for example, that a civil servant in Pretoria&#x2014;I have been one myself&#x2014;is faced with the problem of coming to Cape Town for a parliamentary session. He has to face an absence from his family for a period of five months or so and he has to determine whether he is going to break up a stable home with schooling, with all the arrangements made for stability in that domestic set-up; whether he is going to uproot the whole lot, bring them to Cape Town, usually in unsatisfactory conditions and let his house and take the consequences. It is a most unsatisfactory system as it is. It has been greatly relieved by the modern techniques which are available: Improved telephones, improved communication services, improved transport services and now we even have a telephone which transmits documents instantaneously. These communications have improved things, but they have not improved the practical and private difficulties of the people who come down here for a very long period of time. It would be much simpler for members&#x2014;I believe most members&#x2014;for the Press, for civil servants, to come here for a short period. You can then leave your family and your children at school. If the father is away for only two months&#x2014;shall we say eight or ten weeks&#x2014;and he can return and even for the odd weekend, he can maintain the stability of his home. He can come down here, serve his few weeks and he can go back and come down here again. It is possible on a more spread-out system to maintain contact, to maintain stability and far more so than by insisting that people come down here for a whole five months, because then they either have to uproot their entire family or break with their family for half a year.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that the practical arguments are as great as claimed for the concept of having a more spread-out session. There are many advantages in spreading it out more. I believe that from the point of view of the parliamentary officers it would also be better. They face the same problem of tackling over the period of five months, an enormous pressure of business which has to be virtually completed in many respects within those five months. I believe that if they were to operate over the year and if there were gaps, intervals of six weeks or a month between each session, they would have time to summarize, to collate, to assess, to prepare so that each session could be dealt with efficiently on its own and the necessary work and research and preparation could go on and then they could prepare for the next session. I believe it would ease the strain on the parliamentary officers who are also so necessary for the efficient functioning of Parliament and therefore of government.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the Press. I entirely agree that the Press is a most necessary part of the whole system. Apart from providing the Press with what it requires which is news, possibly over a longer period and in a more digestible form if spread over a longer period, I believe that the Press and its members&#x2019; private lives would also benefit if they were able to make these arrangements on a more spread-out basis.</p>

<p>I believe, most of all, that the public, to whom we are in the last resort responsible, would have greater confidence if they could see Parliament doing its work carefully, taking its time, devoting more time to committee work, studying Bills and perhaps having less time in actual session, but working according to the modern systems of government by spending a great deal of their time in committee preparing and studying Bills. Where reform has taken place in the modern parliamentary systems, notably, for example, in a country like Sweden, or a country like Germany, or a country like Austria for that matter, one notices that far greater emphasis is placed on the committee work of Parliament. It is not necessary in their view that all members should be on display in the House of Parliament all the time. It is accepted that the bulk of the work is done in committee and that when Parliament meets, it comes here to pass the formal stages and the final stages of the Bills, but the bulk of the work, the actual close examination of the content of legislation is done by experts working in committee. This takes time; time must be allowed for this. This is why these Parliaments sit for only three days per week and not, as the hon. the Minister suggests, because they are lazy and because they like to look at each other since there is nothing else to do. They are working during those <span class="col_2085-2086" refersTo="page_1056"/>days when they are not sitting. I do not believe that once the public understand how such a system works, they would take it amiss of this Parliament if it gathered in this Assembly only three days a week.</p>

<p>I looked at some of the other countries. We find for example that Sweden which, as I say, concentrates very largely on the committee system, has a Spring session running from January to May and an Autumn session running from October to the end of the year. In Austria they also have a Spring session and an Autumn session. In other words two sessions each running about three months. In the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, although it is a federal Parliament and therefore a great deal of work is done in the States, they nevertheless sit from February to June each year and from August to November. In Canada they sit from January to June and from September to December. In the United Kingdom they theoretically sit from October to October, the whole year round, but as we know, they have various recesses. They have a recess over Christmas, they have a recess over Easter, they have a Summer recess over the months of July, August and September. However, in principle they sit all the year and they can gather to deal with legislation or with matters of public importance at any time during the whole of the 12 months.</p>

<p>We, in our Republic, have for historical reasons depended very much on the British system in the formulation of our own procedures in this House. This is a rich heritage and it has been of great advantage to us. I should like to tell this House that recently I spoke to a good number of members of Parliament in the House of Commons and they are extremely concerned about the functioning of their Parliament in the modern society. They are doubtful whether the Westminster system as it has evolved and even as it has been adapted, is fully suited to the needs of a modern society. They believe that one needs to look more closely at the working of modern government, the demands placed upon modern government and to adapt Parliament as a lively partner of government, as a living entity, with a duty and a role in government to meet the needs of a modern society.</p>

<p>I believe that we, too, need to look at this. The answers we find here will probably not be the same as those found in other countries. We have our own needs and our own characteristics, but I believe that at least we must look at it and that is what the motion asks. We are not asking anybody to commit himself to one system or another; we are not asking anybody to take sides at this stage as between one system and another. We believe, however, that the time has come to look hard at our system and perhaps to consider whether some of the axiomatically accepted ideas, the truisms, are still true. For example, the hon. the Minister said: &#x201C;Suid-Afrika is &#x2019;n klein ou landjie met lang afstande.&#x201D; Is this still true? Are we still a &#x201C;klein ou landjie&#x201D; and are the &#x201C;afstande&#x201D; still so long? These are truisms which must be re-examined. South Africa is in fact becoming a very important country in the world. It will assume an increasingly great importance to the world and its &#x201C;afstande&#x201D; are getting shorter all the time for reasons which are obvious. We need to re-examine some of these premises and wee need to re-examine our needs in the light of the demands which have been placed upon the Government in South Africa, and therefore on Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the mere fact that I have to rise at this late stage of this debate and participate in it is a sufficient indication to the hon. introducer of this motion that his motion is not a very substantial one. It has been an exceptional occasion this afternoon &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is a joke. It has been an exceptional occasion this afternoon in that we have on this basis been able to debate the optimum utilization of the time of this hon. House. If there is one point which clearly emerged, it is that all of us proceed from the standpoint that we advocate a better functioning of the House. Before I proceed I should like to refer to a few specific points made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, in regard to which I definitely cannot agree with him. But before coming to that I just want to say that I think the hon. Opposition, before they introduced this motion, should have introduced two other motions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, if it is a private member&#x2019;s motion the hon. member <span class="col_2087-2088" refersTo="page_1057"/>for Kensington ought then to have introduced two other motions before this one. We had a reasonably peaceful and quiet time, and we conducted the debate on quite a high level, but it seems to me as if one of the members is now entering this House unaware of this situation here &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>He has just come from the students.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he has probably come from the students. The hon. member for Kensington ought to have introduced two other motions before introducing this one. The first motion should have been that South Africa should have only one capital, and the second one that the South African member of Parliament should be remunerated on the same basis as the American member of Parliament or the American Senator. If they had introduced those two motions and had had them passed, we could have proceeded with this one. Once we accept the situation of our separated capitals, the whole idea of either a continuous session of Parliament or two sessions per year is entirely unpractical. It cannot be argued away, for it remains an unpractical matter. I shall return to this subsequently when I point out that when it comes to the executive authority, when it comes to the government and the administration of a country, it is definitely harmful if the political head, the State head, the administrative head of a department has to be away from this head office for such a long time.</p>

<p>There is another point as well in regard to which I respectfully differ with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. This is the fact that he said that, when we debate this matter, we should not do so with regard to our own interests, but that we should do so with regard to what is best for South Africa. I want to differ with him in this sense that I do not think he can imply or intend to imply that if one were to oppose the hon. member&#x2019;s motion he would be placing his own interests before the best interests of South Africa. I hope to be able to inform the hon. member that we will in fact be able, through streamlining our parliamentary system, to shorten the sessions instead of lengthening them, and that this will in fact be in the best interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>There are two other points in regard to which I differ with the hon. member. The first was when he said that we assembled on 2nd February after the Parliament had been &#x201C;on vacation&#x201D; for eight months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>For almost eight months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, or on vacation for almost eight months. The issue here is not the word &#x201C;almost&#x201D;, the issue is the fact that he said Parliament was &#x201C;on vacation&#x201D;. Parliament was in recess and I do not know of any member of this Parliament&#x2014;or at least on this side of the House&#x2014;who went on vacation for eight months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>However, Parliament is not functioning then.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member used the word &#x201C;vacation&#x201D; with a special intonation to that word. It implied that we were idle, and I must contradict the hon. member on that point. Parliament was not on vacation. The Ministries were working at full pitch, the public service was working and most members of the House of Assembly were carrying out one of their most important duties, viz. to liaise with their voters and to report back to them on the activities of Parliament during the previous session. The officials here in the House of Assembly as such were also busy.</p>

<p>There are two other points I should like to clear up with the hon. member. He said that there was in fact no parliamentary supervision over the Government. As I understand the development of the parliamentary system, and as we have developed it into a responsible form of government, it is not for Parliament to maintain supervision over the activities of the Government. The Government is there, assembled by the leader of the strongest party at the request of the head of State, in our case the President. This Government is responsible to Parliament for the way in which it governs the country, the way in which it spends public money, and is consequently dependent on Parliament&#x2019;s support for the Bills it wishes to pilot through Parliament. That is the function of Parliament. The hon. member for Von Brandis said he could agree with the hon. the Leader of the House that if that was <span class="col_2089-2090" refersTo="page_1058"/>what we meant by Parliament, it was all very well, but that that was not what a Parliament was. One thing we must guard against in South Africa and against which all the parliaments of the world should guard against, is Parliament developing into a mere talk shop. That is where the word Parliament comes from, viz. from the French word &#x201C;parler&#x201D;. The hon. member will know that at one stage a very unfavourable connotation was attached to the word Parliament because it was regarded as merely being a talk shop. For that reason I want to say that parliamentary supervision is not necessary. The Government of the day is responsible to Parliament for its administration of the country. This Parliament can by way of one day&#x2019;s sitting call a Government of the day to order if it should be guilty of gross or irresponsible mismanagement. The length or duration of a parliamentary session has nothing to do with the way in which a country is being governed, with the intensity, the alertness and the dedication of the Government and of the members of Parliament as such, which ultimately leads to an effective Parliament and effective national government.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said, and the hon. member for Von Brandis supported him in this, that our present system leads to an excess of bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is a situation which can develop in any democratic or undemocratic system of government. It is, once again, not the system which is responsible for bureaucracy. I want to say that the best guarantee, the best counter to bureaucracy is the wide-awake member of Parliament who does two things. The most important of these is that he should have his ear to the ground and should have contact with his voters. The second is that he should be accessible to his voters so that they can keep him informed of any deficiencies and examples of bureaucracy. The third thing he should also do is to be prepared, whenever he encounters this, to act fearlessly as representative of the people against bureaucracy. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also said&#x2014;and then I will have dealt with him&#x2014;that the system which we now have of a pressure cooker parliamentary session leads to an excess of autocracy. I want to tell him that the best counter to and guarantee against autocracy in a democratic set-up is a strong, alert Opposition. If the Opposition fails in its duty, the problem arises that the Government becomes autocratic. An Opposition ceases to fulfil its role if it does not have its finger on the pulse of national affairs. I leave it at that. I do not want to pass judgment on this Opposition this afternoon&#x2014;not because I think it is not possible to do so, but because I think it would not be in the spirit of the debate to pass judgment on them this afternoon.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say something to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He said that the Opposition is sometimes surprised at legislation which is laid upon the Table.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The entire Parliament is surprised.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Let him say that this applies to all of us if he wishes, but we on this side of the House know when a Bill comes up for discussion. Both sides of the House are informed in advance by means of their study groups of envisaged legislation. I wish to say that it has never really seemed to me as if the hon. Opposition has been surprised by legislation. They have always been able to talk and keep on talking about legislation as if they had prepared themselves for it for a year. One can point out hon. members on that side of the House who do this time and again&#x2014;and not only in respect of legislation&#x2014;they can talk indefinitely on anything. Sir, it is clear to hon. members that I do not agree with them, and I have already furnished the most important reason why this is so. Apart from the fact that I cannot agree with them, for the stated reasons, it is the duty of a government, an executive authority, not only to make laws, but to administer them, and one cannot expect it to spend all its time in Parliament. That is one of the most important reasons. For good national administration it is absolutely essential that the political head of the department, the Minister, should devote as much time as possible to his department. In our system, where he must also be a member of one of the two Houses, one cannot expect him to sit all year in Parliament and in addition see to the proper administration of the department which falls under him. But apart from that, our Ministers are probably among the most accessible Ministers in the world. Tremendous demands are being made on them. Not only is it they who have to deal with the legislation of the country; there is also the administration of <span class="col_2091-2092" refersTo="page_1059"/>that legislation. In addition to that they constantly have to make public appearances, and then they still have their own constituencies to look after. If we were in addition to expect them to have to attend continuous sessions of Parliament we would be making tremendous demands on them which would eventually be to the detriment of national government. I believe, and with this I want to conclude, that it is possible for us to make our parliamentary system, as it is at present, even more streamlined. If we give free reign to our thoughts on this matter and put our heads together we will find that we in fact have surplus time available. I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the House that we should please not have to sit on Saturday mornings. I really think that we could have the whole of Friday off, and need not sit. But what I have in mind is not that nothing should be done or that we should turn it into a long weekend. The time can be spent in fulfilling other parliamentary or caucus duties. Without taking leave on a sitting day we can go to our constituencies to do our work there. I believe that we have surplus time available. Those of us who have not been sitting in this House for very long realize, however, that time is set aside for specific subjects, such as legislative debating points and the discussion of Ministers&#x2019; Votes. Many of those specified times, as this afternoon for example, are devoted entirely to speeches for the sake of the procedure and Standing Order rules of the House. For that reason I maintain that if we are able to avoid this, we still have surplus time on hand. How many times do we not have to sit here listening to a speech which is simply being made in order to use up time.</p>

<p>But there is something else of which the Opposition can take specific note, and I am saying this in all sincerity. This is the custom of the Opposition to call for divisions. I know that this is something which the Opposition feels very strongly about. However, hours of session time are lost in respect of divisions which are useless. This is particularly the case during Committee Stages where a vote is taken on one clause after the other. I do not want to say that the Opposition may never demand a division. However, they know what the situation in the country is, and the world outside does too. I think they could very easily have their protests against a clause recorded after having demanded a division on a specific subject during the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to resume my seat. I have again succeeded in using up my time. I think we would stagnate if we were to cease thinking occasionally about how we could modernize our parliamentary system and the business here in the House in order to keep pace with the demands of the times. We must do this here in South Africa itself. Overseas people have been impressed by the wonderful way in which our Parliament functions. I do not think we need always refer to what America, Australia, France and England are doing. We have a wonderful parliamentary system which functions properly. We have with our ingenuity, from a foundation which we found in the British parliamentary system, developed this system into what it is today. I think we have every reason to be proud of it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was quite a surprising admission that came from the hon. member for Waterkloof&#x2014;surprising in that he admitted it but not surprising to us really&#x2014;when he told us that he actually got up to talk out time. Now I can see what the hon. the Leader of the House meant when he said that if more time was allowed to parliamentarians it would be wasted.</p>

<p>Briefly, there is a basic difference in approach between the two sides of the House. What the hon. the Leader of the House really indicated to us was that he views Parliament as some sort of legislative sausage factory and that the quicker you produce laws the better Parliament it is. That is not what Parliament is all about and he knows it. It might be the view of other hon. members on that side, but that hon. member knows enough about Parliament, having been here so long, to realize that Parliament is the meeting-place of the people in the first place. It is the place where matters of the moment and of public importance must be debated. And, indeed, if legislation is brought forward, it should be the place where members, particularly of the Opposition but also of the Government, must have an opportunity to examine, test and sift.</p>

<heading>REVIEW OF FINANCIAL YEAR 1972-&#x2019;73</heading>

<p>Whilst it was in the interests of the country that excessive demand arising from consumption expenditure should be curbed, the cooling-off phase in the South African economy has been more drastic and protracted than could be expected, and for the second year in succession the overall economic growth rate has fallen short of the target set by the Economic Development Programme.</p>

<p>The improvement in the national economy during 1972 was largely confined to the financial markets and the primary sectors, whilst in the secondary sector business conditions remained slack, despite the reduction of official interest rates, the abolition of the ceilings on bank credit, the relaxation of hire-purchase credit restrictions and the reduction of sales duties on certain goods.</p>

<p>The sluggish state of the economy generally was reflected in the results of working of the Railways throughout the year, and by the end of December total revenues from all services showed an increase of less than R21 million on the corresponding period of the previous financial year, in comparison with a very restrained increase of R48 million in expenditure. With reserves depleted by the deficits of the past two and the current financial years, and faced with an arbitration award entailing a considerable increase in the wage bill, the Railways could no longer afford to carry the burden of uneconomic rates and fares, and tariffs were increased with effect from 1st January, 1973.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#prospects_for_1973-&#x2019;74">

<heading>PROSPECTS FOR 1973-&#x2019;74</heading>

<p>The Reserve Bank reported recently that a number of expansionary factors which could assist in reviving the general economy during 1973 were already at work. These included higher export earnings, easier conditions in the capital and money markets, the stimulation of domestic demand through capital outlays by the public and mining sectors and through salary and wage increases in the public sector, and the expansionary fiscal and monetary concessions designed to encourage economic growth without aggravating inflation.</p>

<p>A time-lag between the initiation of these measures and an actual upturn in production and consumer spending is inevitable, but there have since been setbacks which must affect the growth rate of the economy, the most important being the devastating drought.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that the volume of agricultural production will fall by as much as 10% during 1973, and apart from the detrimental effects on the national economy as a whole, which will in time permeate to the Railways, the Administration will suffer a direct loss of railage on export maize which is estimated to yield R11 million less revenue than in 1972-&#x2019;73. In addition, harbour revenue, grain elevator earnings and railage on fertilizers, fuel oil and other farming requisites will be adversely affected.</p>

<p>A further possibility in 1973 is that recent political events in Southern Africa may influence the volume of exports.</p>

<p>The Administration&#x2019;s revenues as at present constituted do little more than cover expenditure, and it is not expected that they will show a marked improvement before the economic upswing is more evident, probably later in the year.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#current_year&#x2019;s_performance_in_retrospect">

<heading>CURRENT YEAR&#x2019;S PERFORMANCE IN RETROSPECT</heading>

<p><i>Passenger Services:</i></p>

<p>The upward trend in the total number of passenger journeys featured in previous years was again evident in the year under review, and during the period April to December. 1972, an increase of more than 5,6 million was recorded as compared with <span class="col_2095-2096" refersTo="page_1061"/>the same period of the previous year. Suburban journeys increased by 1,2% in the first class and by 1,3% in the third class. Third-class main-line journeys showed an increase of 4,8%, whilst first and second-class journeys declined by 13,3 and 14,6%, respectively.</p>

<p>Since early 1972 various aspects of all passenger train services, including the curtailment or withdrawal of uneconomic services, are being critically examined. Certain trains have already been withdrawn and more are likely to be withdrawn during the year.</p>

<p>Revenue for the year is expected to total R 105,8 million, i.e. an increase of only 5,5% over the figure for 1971 -&#x2019;72, despite the higher passenger fares in operation since the beginning of January, 1973.</p>

<p><i>Goods Services:</i></p>

<p>Although the volume of high-rated traffic decreased by 2,7% from 13,7 million tons to 13,3 million tons during the period April to December, 1973, as compared with the corresponding period during the previous year, the overall tonnage of revenue-earning traffic conveyed increased by 4,7% from 78,8 million to 82,5 million.</p>

<p>The number of head of large livestock conveyed increased from 1,8 million to 2 million, but small animals declined from 7 million to 5 million.</p>

<p>The volume of coal and coke conveyed advanced slightly to 17,8 million tons in 1972. As a result of timeous steps taken, no inland coal shortages were experienced during the past winter season.</p>

<p>Although adequate truckage was made available throughout the year, conditions in the ore export market were such that full use was not made of the capacity provided and the tonnages of manganese, chrome, iron and magnetite ores conveyed for export declined by 0,8, 14,8, 17,2 and 23,2%, respectively. Export asbestos traffic, however, increased to 268 000 tons in 1972.</p>

<p>Cement traffic showed a satisfactory increase of 13,8% during the first nine months of this financial year over that for the corresponding period of the previous year.</p>

<p>Maize conveyed for local consumption decreased slightly by approximately 25 000 tons in 1972, but export maize advanced by 96,2% to almost 2,6 million tons.</p>

<p>Due to the higher tariffs, goods revenue is now estimated at R541,l million, or R21,8 million more than the budgeted figure, and coal earnings at R61,8 million&#x2014;an increase of R2,3 million on the original estimate.</p>

<p><i>Road Transport:</i></p>

<p>During the period April to December, 1972, there was a decline of 21,1% in the number of first-class passengers patronizing the Department&#x2019;s Road Transport Services, whilst third-class passengers increased from 9,1 million to nearly 9,8 million, or by 8,2% during the same period. The total number of passengers carried advanced to 10,6 million.</p>

<p>Goods traffic advanced by 9,5%, from 2,5 million tons to 2,7 million tons whilst the number of livestock carried declined by nearly 106 000. Cream traffic declined from 5,3 million to 5 million litres.</p>

<p>As a result of the tariff increases, the loss on the Road Transport Services is estimated at less than half a million Rand, compared with R1,3 million in 1971-&#x2019;72.</p>

<p><i>Harbours:</i></p>

<p>The considerable increases in the tonnages of cargo handled during the previous two financial years were not maintained during the first nine months of 1972-&#x2019;73. During the period April to December, 1972, 38.4 million tons of cargo were landed and shipped, reflecting a decrease of 1%. Cargo shipped reflected a satisfactory increase of 11,8%, but the tonnage landed declined by 10.2%.</p>

<p>Despite higher prices of imports as a result of devaluation, the value of imports during the period April to December, 1972, amounting to R2 120.4 million, was R26,8 million less than that of the corresponding period of the previous year, whilst the value of exports increased by 28,8% to R1 574 million.</p>

<p>Tariff adjustments were also effected in respect of the various harbour services and harbour revenue for the year 1972-&#x2019;73 is now estimated at just short of R62 million, an improvement of R2 million on the figure for 1971-&#x2019;72.</p>

<p><i>Airways:</i></p>

<p>With the delivery of the last of the five Boeing 747 aircraft order by South African Airways, the introduction of a revised pattern of services on the route to the United <span class="col_2097-2098" refersTo="page_1062"/>Kingdom and Europe constituted the highlight for the airline during the year under review. These aircraft have proved particularly successful from a traffic point of view and passenger carryings between the Republic and the United Kingdom and Germany increased markedly compared with the previous year, despite direct competition with other Boeing 747 operators in a depressed market. Furthermore, the cargo-carrying capacity of the 747, which, on account of import control, could not be fully exploited up till now, should provide good potential for revenue growth in the future.</p>

<p>Although revenue growth was not up to expectations during the first five months of the current financial year, there has been a noticeable improvement since September, 1972. Cargo carryings, which were adversely affected by the relative decrease, mainly as a result of import restrictions, have improved since October, 1972, and now reflect a higher growth rate for the first nine months of the financial year as compared with the same period the previous year.</p>

<p>In view of South African Airways&#x2019; world-wide operations the devaluation of the Rand caused a sharp rise in the airline&#x2019;s costs, already aggravated by increased charges for airport and en route facilities, fuel and passenger meals, etc.</p>

<p>On the Springbok services passenger journeys increased by 26,2% and cargo ton-kilometres by 33,5%. These encouraging results, which are far above the overall market growth rate, are due to the operation of Boeing 747 aircraft.</p>

<p>The favourable growth rate on the Wallaby route was maintained and passenger traffic increased by 25,1%, whilst cargo ton-kilometres rose by 24,5%.</p>

<p>A second weekly frequency introduced between Johannesburg and Rio de Janeiro from 1st April, 1972, resulted in passenger traffic on this route increasing by 35.3%.</p>

<p>On all overseas routes passengers carried increased by almost 62 000, or 26.3%. Freight tons increased by 44%.</p>

<p>BOAC introduced a weekly service between Johannesburg and Hong Kong on a &#x201C;Joint Venture&#x201D; basis with SAA on 6th January, 1973. The present frequency is operated by BOAC aircraft, but SAa will also introduce a weekly Boeing 707 frequency as soon as certain formalities have been concluded.</p>

<p>A service between Cape Town and Buenos Aires is expected to be introduced on 2nd April this year.</p>

<p>On the domestic services passenger traffic increased by 11,4% to 1,1 million journeys and cargo ton-kilometres by 17,5% to 12,5 million.</p>

<p>Passenger traffic on the regional services showed an increase of 25,8% whilst freight ton-kilometres advanced by 37,9%.</p>

<p>From December, 1972, special night flights were introduced on a trial basis between Johannesburg and Cape Town. The extension of such facilities to other routes to ease the pressure on long-distance rail services during peak periods will be considered.</p>

<p>The revised estimate of Airways revenue, viz. R137.2 million, falls short of the budgeted figure by a quarter of a million Rand.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines:</i></p>

<p>The quantity of products conveyed through the pipelines decreased by 9,2%, from 5,8 million to 5,3 million tons during the first nine months of the current financial year, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year.</p>

<p>Despite the application of higher tariffs during the last three months of the year, pipeline revenue, at R55,1 million, is only R1,4 million higher than the original estimate, due principally to a shortfall in traffic through the crude-petroleum pipeline.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#results_of_working_for_1972-&#x2019;73">

<heading>RESULTS OF WORKING FOR 1972-&#x2019;73</heading>

<p>In total, revenue from all services is estimated at R1 141 947 000.</p>

<p>As the revised Estimates of Expenditure approved by Parliament total R1 187 044 000, the year is expected to close with a deficit of R45 097 000, which it is the intention to defray, <i>in to,</i> from the Rates Equalization Fund and the Reserve Account of the Sinking Fund.</p>

<p><i>Productivity and Efficiency Measures:</i></p>

<p>In view of the deterioration in the Department&#x2019;s financial position, the depletion of reserves, diminishing profitable traffic and excessively rising costs of labour, equipment, material and services&#x2014;over many of which, such as electricity, coal and fuel the Department has no control&#x2014;special steps had to be taken to reduce expenditure wherever possible. The sustained <span class="col_2099-2100" refersTo="page_1063"/>efforts over the past years to increase productivity were, therefore, intensified and a campaign was launched early last year to increase economy, productivity and efficiency in all fields of activity. An in-depth examination was consequently made of working methods and the level of productivity critically analysed.</p>

<p>The Department has, during recent years, been intensifying its efforts to increase productivity through the application of modern technological developments. Mechanisation of working methods, such as the use of equipment for track laying and maintenance, and improved communications, to mention but two examples, are plying an increasingly important part. Not only does it serve to alleviate the manpower shortage, but by eliminating outmoded, time-consuming manual methods, workloads are eased, productive time is increased and greater economies are effected. It will be of interest to note that despite a decrease of 2% in the number of staff in the Railway branch of the Service since March, 1972, the overall tonnage of revenue-earning goods traffic conveyed by rail has advanced by 4,7%&#x2014;in respect of low-rated traffic the increase amounted to 8,3%.</p>

<p>The manifold uses of the computer are also now being applied on an extensive scale and, apart from its primary function, the computer is proving an invaluable tool in the hands of Management both for control purposes and as an aid to quick and efficient decision-making.</p>

<p>In the campaign I have referred to, which had as a more immediate aim the bridging of the current gap between revenue and expenditure, Management took the initiative by establishing Committees for Higher Productivity and Efficiency. These committees now function on all the nine systems of the railway network and in most departments. The staff were given the opportunity to participate fully and their Staff Associations were invited to be represented on the committees.</p>

<p>The committees meet monthly, when working results are closely scrutinized in order to establish what economies can be effected. All suggestions from the staff with a view to increasing productivity and promoting efficiency, are thoroughly investigated and, if found practicable, put into effect immediately.</p>

<p>By introducing improved methods and procedures and by a greater measure of rationalization of workloads and working methods, a saving of almost R19 million has been effected since the launching of the campaign last year to the end of December, 1972.</p>

<p><i>Staff Emoluments:</i></p>

<p>Although the staff had manifested admirable restraint in their representations for increased remuneration based on the rise of cost of living since the last general increase in salaries and wages in June, 1970, a dispute was declared by one of the Staff Associations, and the Judicial Commission appointed by the State President to investigate the matter unanimously recommended a wage increase of 15%. The Administration was legally bound to implement the finding of the Commission but, by virtue of the fact that all groups of the staff were affected, the increase could not be restricted to one group only and I decided to adjust all salaries and wages of Whites as well as non-Whites, with effect from the January, 1973, paymonth. The additional expenditure arising from the increase will be of the order of R100 million per year.</p>

<p><i>Rates Review:</i></p>

<p>It had been clear from the outset that expenditure of this magnitude could be met only by a general tariff increase and to correct the imbalance between revenue and expenditure, all goods and pipeline rates, harbour charges, parcels charges, certain passenger fares and related miscellaneous charges were enhanced with effect from 1st January, 1973.</p>

<p>Because of its historic system of charging, the Railways had hitherto to contend with an inordinately large and disproportionate gap between its highest and lowest rates. This gave rise to a situation where, since the bulk of traffic conveyed by rail was charged at rates approximating, and in many cases below, the cost of conveyance, the Administration was to a major extent dependent upon a relatively small proportion of its more remunerative traffic, whether transported by rail or by pipeline, to maintain its viability.</p>

<p>The Railways&#x2019; high-rated traffic has always been peculiarly sensitive to, and usually affected by, changes in the economic climate of the country. This was underscored by the disproportionately large decrease in the revenue derived from that traffic (4,5%) as against a relatively small <span class="col_2101-2102" refersTo="page_1064"/>decrease (approximately 2,7%) in the volumes conveyed during the period ended 31st December, 1972, as compared with the previous year&#x2014;a situation aggravated by the drop in net earnings occasioned by an increase in the volume of uneconomic traffic conveyed.</p>

<p>To remedy the position and yet retain as much of its traditional high-rated goods traffic as was possible in an environment of steadily mounting costs, it was essential that the rail tariff increases, which had become inevitable, be implemented on a selective basis rather than by way of a flat horizontally-imposed surcharge. It was also necessary, unless the more elastic high-rated rail traffic was to be burdened with an inequitable share of the increased charge, that steps be taken either to eliminate or materially to modify the incidence of traffic conveyed at uneconomic rates.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#new_works_programme_and_capital_expansion">

<heading>NEW WORKS PROGRAMME AND CAPITAL EXPANSION</heading>

<p>The construction of new railway lines is progressing satisfactorily. The line from Vryheid to Empangeni is 66 per cent and that from Broodsnyersplaas to Ermelo 11 % complete. The commissioning date for the latter line is set for April, 1976, to fit in with the target date set for the completion of the rebuilding of the existing line between Ermelo and Vryheid. The line from Grov&#x00E9;put to Vogelstruisbult, on which 16% of the work has been done, is expected to be opened for traffic in August, 1974. Preliminary planning is in hand for the construction of the double line from Kensington to Bellville, the new line to serve the Table Bay Harbour extensions, and the line from Arnot Power Station to Wonderfontein.</p>

<p>Of the other new projects mentioned in last year&#x2019;s budget speech, the installation of centralized traffic control on the Wellington&#x2014;Touws River section is expected to be completed in December, 1975, whilst the first stage of the doubling of the Vooruitsig&#x2014;Newcastle and electrification of the Kroonstad&#x2014;Hamilton and Whites&#x2014;Welkom lines are expected to be completed by March, 1976. A contract has since been awarded for an aerial survey in connection with the proposed central mechanized marshalling yard for the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>Only 6% of the work on the installation of centralized traffic control and associated improvements on the Klerksdorp&#x2014;Fourteen Streams section remains to be done, whilst similar improvements on the Queenstown&#x2014;Burgersdorp section are expected to be placed in service in December this year; steady progress is being made on the Potchefstroom&#x2014;Klerksdorp section. The electrified section Hercules&#x2014;De Wildt has been opened for traffic, that between Booth and Reunion is already partly in use and the improvements between Noupoort and Springfontein were completed in August, 1972. Other improvement projects completed during the current financial year, or which are expected to be finalized by the end of 1973, include the installation of centralized traffic control on the Union&#x2014;Volksrust, Acornhoek&#x2014;Hoedspruit, and Metsi&#x2014;Acornhoek sections, remodelling of the yards at Swartkops, Donnybrook, Wolseley, De Aar and Cradock, stage 2 of the new goods layout at East London, track improvement between Pietermaritzburg and Kranskop and electrification between Duff&#x2019;s Road and Mandini.</p>

<p>In consequence of the progressive elimination of steam traction, diesel depots are currently being erected or extended at Coligny, Humewood Road, Noupoort, Swartkops, Cambridge, Bloemfontein, Franklin, Greytown, Mason&#x2019;s Mill, Wentworth, Germiston, Krugersdorp, Capital Park, Koedoespoort, Lydenburg and Nelspruit, whilst the Estimates for 1973/74 provide for diesel depots to be erected at Richards Bay and Amabele.</p>

<p>The extensions of the white-products pipeline from Alrode to serve Isando, Benoni, Pretoria West and Waltloo were completed in August, and the line from Sasolburg to Klerksdorp in December, 1972. The new 15 cm pipeline for the conveyance of aviation fuel from Sasolburg to Jan Smuts Airport was completed in January, 1973. The pipeline network now covers 1 783 route kilometres.</p>

<p>Restoration work on the eastern mole in Table Bay Harbour was completed in August, last year, and stage 1 of the harbour extensions will be completed during this month. Steady progress is being made with stage 2 which is expected to be completed in June, 1975. The facilities for the fishing industry at Mossel Bay harbour will be ready this month. In Durban harbour three new cargo sheds at Point were taken into use in September, 1972, and the new Pier No. 1 and remodelled yard at Cato Creek will become operational during <span class="col_2103-2104" refersTo="page_1065"/>this month. Stage 2 of the construction of Pier No. 2 is expected to be completed in October, 1974, and the ore stacking and loading plant at Port Elizabeth harbour in June this year.</p>

<p>At Richards Bay dredging is proceeding to schedule. Work on the construction of quay walls is due to commence towards the and of May of this year, and the first berth to be constructed are those intended for the handling of export coal. The new port will be brought into service by April, 1976, by which time three berths will be available. A fourth berth is to be commissioned by April, 1977, completing the initial stage of harbour development.</p>

<p>The freight depot at Jan Smuts Airport will be taken into use in stage from April, 1973, whilst the building for cabin services and the flight kitchen will be completed in June, 1974.</p>

<p>A development of particular significance was the completion during the past year of the Administration&#x2019;s new data-processing centre in Johannesburg, for housing, <i>inter alia,</i> three modern computers as well as an integrated data-switching system, costing about R1, 1 million and which is at present being installed. This will form the centre of a sophisticated data-telecommunications network. One of the computers will be used for the next phase of the computerized truck-control system whereunder data concerning truck and locomotive movements will be entered directly into the centrally situated computer from marhsalling yards, operating offices and locomotive depots. This will ensure country-wide, up-to-the-minute information on rolling-stock movements and thus more efficient decision-making in regard to traffic flow and control. The other two computers are being used for the other numerous computerized activities of the Administration.</p>

<p>Further applications of computers envisaged for the years ahead include an integrated stores inventory control and accounting system for both the Railways and Airways, and a system for the capture of full consignment-note data by means of the computer and the forwarding of consignment particulars by telecommunication line to destination stations. This latter system, of which the first phase is expected to be in operation by September this year, will be extended gradually during the coming five years and will bring about improved goods control, reduce the incidence of unentered traffic, and assist towards rendering a more efficient service to the public.</p>

<p>Having regard to the heavy capital programme already provided for in previous Estimates, which will take some time to complete, as well as the availability of physical resources, provision is made for a minimum of new proposals in the Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74. Those that are included, however, are considered essential for certain of the Administration&#x2019;s basic functions and relate to the provision of housing for staff, new machinery for workshops, mechanized equipment for the permanent way, cartage and road transport service equipment, and the extension of schemes already provided for in previous Estimates. The Department is also obliged to meet its commitments to ensure sustained progress of projects associated with the coal-export scheme, and to augment its motive power and rolling-stock establishment and to provide facilities for the conveyance of non-White commuters in the Pretoria complex.</p>

<p>To cater for the conveyance of the large number of non-Whites being settled in the Tswana Homeland to the north of Pretoria, the Railways and Harbours Board will shortly investigate and report with a view to constructing an electrified double line, 20 km in length, between Winternest and Mabopane at a cost of nearly R20 million. In addition to certain facilities which require to be provided between Winternest and Pretoria to allow for the large number of additional trains to be schedule, a new passenger station has to be built at Belle Ombr&#x00E9; which, together with its connecting lines taking off near Hercules, will cost about R15 million. The cost of the whole project, including coaching stock for the conveyance of passengers to and from the Mabopane area, will be of the order of R70 million. A Construction Bill will be submitted to Parliament later in the session for approval of the construction of the new line from Winternest to Mabopane and for the link line to Belle Ombr&#x00E9;.</p>

<p>I would like to inform the House that I am in full agreement with the decision to go ahead with the Sishen-Saldanha project. If Iscor&#x2019;s expectations materialize, namely to carry upwards of 15 million tons of export iron ore and a large quantity of semi-processed products over this line, it will become a most valuable asset to South Africa.</p>

<p>I had good reasons for concurring in the decision that the railway line and ore quay should be operated by Iscor. In the first place, it will be a single-purpose line carrying only Iscor&#x2019;s products and materials. If <span class="col_2105-2106" refersTo="page_1066"/>the S.A. Railways were to have been responsible for operating it, it would have had to be a public line available to all making use of it and the condition was that after redemption of the capital costs, it would have had to be handed over to the S.A. Railways without compensation, as is the case with all guaranteed lines. Iscor objected to this. Secondly, the S.A. Railways is experiencing a serious manpower shortage, particularly in the bread and butter grades, which will make it extremely difficult to man the project. Thirdly, as the S.A. Railways would have been required to operate the line at cost for at least 20 years, the Department would not derive any financial benefit from it during that period.</p>

<p>I have, however, set two conditions: Firstly, there will be no connection with any S.A.R. line, and secondly, no S.A.R. personnel may be recruited by Iscor unless they had left the service of the S.A.R. at least six months previously.</p>

<p>Should the Government of the day in the years ahead consider that it would be in the country&#x2019;s interest to effect a linking-up with S.A.R. lines in order to enable other bodies to make use of this line, or that railway lines to link up with this line would have to be constructed in order to provide in the needs of others, the operation and ownership thereof would have to be transferred to the South African Railways because the existence of two competitive railway systems, one privately owned and the other a government undertaking, could never be allowed in South Africa. I should also like to add that a privately owned single-purpose railway line and harbour are not unique. As a matter of fact, this is found in several countries where state-owned railways also exist.</p>

<p>The St. Croix scheme should not be seen as an alternative but rather as complementary to the Sishen-Saldanha project. When Port Elizabeth harbour reaches its maximum capacity, attention will have to be given to St. Croix. It is self-evident that where other exporters will not be able to utilize the Sishen-Saldanha line but have obtained oversea markets for ores in quantities that Port Elizabeth cannot handle, and also wish to use larger ships, the St. Croix or, for that matter, any other scheme, will receive the necessary consideration. Up to the present, however, the full capacity of the rail facilities to Port Elizabeth and the ore stacking and loading plant have not been utilized.</p>

<p>Having dealt with the Sishen-Saldanha and St. Croix projects, I would like to say a few words about Richards Bay, which has many advantages over Durban Bay. It is protected, has considerable room for expansion and development and can be deepened to handle vessels of up to 250 000 tons, which it would never be possible to do at Durban harbour or, for that matter, at any other existing South African port.</p>

<p>Labour requirements should present no problem as Richards Bay is situated close to a Bantu homeland. Apart from an aluminium smelter and associated industries that have already been established, two oil companies are planning to erect refineries there, which are expected to be followed up by a full range of petro-chemical industries. In addition, various other industrial concerns are seriously considering establishing themselves at Richards Bay. The framework plan for the industrial area has been finalized and the basic water supply, electricity, sewerage and road systems are in the course of completion.</p>

<p>The construction of the railway line is proceeding according to programme and will be completed simultaneously with the two berths which are to be used for coal exports from 1st April, 1976. A third berth, which is to be used partly for imports of alumina and partly for general cargo, will also be available at that date, whilst a fourth berth, intended for bulk and general cargo, is to be commissioned by April, 1977.</p>

<p>As the oil pipe-line passes relatively close to Richards Bay, a junction could be provided to make the new port a great oil discharge point.</p>

<p>The rail access now being provided passes from the Transvaal coal producing areas through the Natal coal fields and as hon. members probably know, the Transvaal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association has been given authority by the Government to export approximately 109 million tons of Transvaal coal at a rate of not more than 9 million tons a year. The Association has already signed a contract for the export to Japan through Richards Bay of 2,7 million tons of coal a year over a period of ten years as from 1st April, 1976. This line might also facilitate the export of maize. As Richards Bay will be the natural export harbour for a large portion of our maize-producing area, a grain elevator will in due course be constructed there as and when additional capacity becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The railway line and the harbour will also <span class="col_2107-2108" refersTo="page_1067"/>provide an alternative route for products to and from the Witwatersrand industrial and commercial complex.</p>

<p>Richards Bay is the greatest project embarked upon during the past 60 years and I foresee that it will, in the years to come, become a second Durban harbour. In this connection I might perhaps allay fears that the new port will be allowed to develop substantially at the expense of Durban harbour.</p>

<p>It must, however, be borne in mind that Durban harbour does not offer much more room for substantial expansion and that Richards Bay will, as a result of the considerable economic development that South Africa can expect in the future, develop into a commercial harbour of format.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the current financial year the locomotive establishment consisted of 2 296 steam, 1 290 electric and 455 diesel locomotives. Since then 63 electric and 124 diesel locomotives have been placed in service, whilst 97 steam, 9 electric and 3 diesel locomotives have been withdrawn. The present combined tractive force of locomotives in service is 3,5 per cent more than that at the end of March, 1972.</p>

<p>Of the 350 electric locomotives ordered, 95 were received up to the end of December, 1972&#x2014;delivery of the balance is expected to be completed by June, 1976&#x2014;and of the 295 diesel locomotives ordered, 156 were received up to the end of October, 1972; delivery of the balance is expected to be completed by August, 1974. In addition, there are 20 narrow-gauge diesel locomotives on order which are expected to be placed in service during the period July&#x2014;December, 1973.</p>

<p>The Estimates for 1972/73 provide for the acquisition of 100 electric locomotives in respect of the specifications are being prepared. In addition, specifications are being prepared for 100 diesel shunting locomotives while tenders have been issued for 100 main-line and 100 branch-line diesel locomotives. A further 50 class 34 diesel locomotives are included in the Estimates for 1973/74.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1972/73 financial year, there were 4 330 main-line saloons, 820 steam suburban and 3 186 electric suburban coaches in service. After the placing in service of 281 main-line and 75 electric suburban coaches and the scrapping of certain main-line and suburban stock, the establishment at the end of December, 1972, comprised 4 479 mainline, 794 steam suburban and 3 235 electric suburban coaches.</p>

<p>Of the 500 main-line and 545 electric suburban coaches on order, 84 main-line and 75 suburban coaches have already been delivered. Tenders for the supply of 125 first-class and 250 second-class main-line saloons, 120 third-class main-line saloon bodies with bunks, and 165 second-class reserved main-line saloons, were issued during September, 1972. Specifications are being prepared in respect of 125 first and second-class composite main-line saloons, 50 first and second-class reserved main-line saloons, an ultrasonic rail test car, as well as a number of guards&#x2019; and parcel vans. Further specifications engaging attention include 982 suburban coaches. The Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 provide for the acquisition of 150 third-class main-line saloon bodies with sleeping accommodation.</p>

<p>During the period April to December, 1972, the total merchandise-carrying capacity of goods wagons increased by 3,6% to 4,7 million tons. During the same period orders were placed for a further 2 700 wagons of various types, including 52 double-decker motorcar wagons. An additional 5 271 bogie wagons are provided for in the estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74.</p>

<p>The highlights of the year in so far as the provision of new rolling-stock is concerned were the introduction, towards the end of last year, of the new luxury Blue Train sets between Pretoria and Cape Town, and a double-deck train for the conveyance of motor cars between Port Elizabeth and the Reef. The enhanced international renown that the new Blue Train has already brought to the South African Railways and the country in general is undisputed proof of the success of the purpose for which this new concept in luxury rail travel was devised, whilst the efficiency of the motor-car train is ample evidence of the adaptability and viability of rail transport. It is the intention to expand this service and introduce a service between Kaalfontein and Isipingo when the motor-car trucks now on order are placed in service in 1974. The old Blue Train, repainted green and gold, and renamed &#x201C;Drakensberg&#x201D;, is now doing duty between Johannesburg and Durban.</p>

<p>In order to improve payload capacity, special combinations of road transport vehicles, consisting of a semi-trailer and a <span class="col_2109-2110" refersTo="page_1068"/>trailer, were recently placed in service for goods traffic. To match the increased carrying capacity, high-powered vehicles were also acquired for the hauling of payloads of 26 500 kg, as against the previous maximum payload of 18 000 kg. Fifty of the special combination sets have been placed in service on selected routes. A new type of vehicle combination for the transport of livestock has also been placed in service. It has a carrying capacity of from 24 to 30 large and from 130 to 150 small animals.</p>

<p>Vehicles placed in service during the current financial year include 152 passenger vehicles, two dual-purpose vehicles, 159 haulers, 101 semi-trailers and 68 trailers. The Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 provide for the acquisition of 229 vehicles of various types at a cost of R4,5 million, and a further 733 vehicles at a cost of R2 million earmarked for the cartage services.</p>

<p>Harbour equipment placed in service during the current financial year includes, <i>inter alia,</i> a new tug at Durban, two pilot boats at Durban and one each at Table Bay Harbour and the harbours at Port Elizabeth and Walvis Bay. In addition, a new dredger was provided at East London, and a barge with dredging and anchorlift apparatus and hopper at Walvis Bay. Wharf cranes placed in service include eleven 4-ton cranes at Table Bay, and four at Walvis Bay, whilst 75 fork-lift trucks and 14 other mechanical handling appliances were provided at the harbours. Equipment on order or to be ordered includes 48 wharf cranes, six tugs, two floating cranes, two dredgers, two pilot boats, 20 fork-lift trucks and two mobile cranes. Additional equipment provided for in the Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 includes one first-class oceangoing tug for Richards Bay, 44 Fork-lift trucks and four platform tractors.</p>

<heading>ACCIDENTS AND ACCIDENT PREVENTION</heading>

<p>In the operation of transportation services, the safe conveyance of passengers and freight, is of primary importance and the spate of serious train accidents during last year was, therefore, viewed with grave concern. I am pleased to say that there was a decrease in the number of accidents during the first ten months of the current financial year, but the situation is, nevertheless, being carefully watched.</p>

<p>An analysis of accidents reveals that in nearly all collisions between trains and in approximately 25 % of derailments, the human element was at fault. The departmental investigations which are conducted into accidents, without delay, have a twofold purpose, viz. to establish the cause thereof and to recommend precautionary measures. In the technical field improved equipment is continually being designed for the control of train movements. Recently, for instance, a vigilance control device has been introduced and is being installed progressively in electric and diesel locomotives. This device will cause a train to stop automatically should a driver become incapacitated or inattentive to the performance of certain essential routine actions whilst driving a locomotive. Reliable equipment and the maintenance of permanent way, rolling stock, etc., are, of course, also of cardinal importance, and research is continually undertaken in this regard.</p>

<p>By far the greatest scope for improvement, however, lies with the human element. Management has recently intensified the application of all safety measures in this direction and by means of instruction, propaganda, inspection and discipline is motivating all ranks of the staff, especially those concerned with the movement of trains, towards a still greater measure of safety-consciousness and sense of responsibility. I am glad to report that certain positive steps taken before the recent Christmas and New Year holidays, when heavy passenger traffic in particular reached peak proportions, were effective to the extent that during the ensuing month a decline in the number of accidents of no less than 26% was recorded.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#staff">

<heading>STAFF</heading>

<p>Owing to the country-wide shortage of manpower, due to the sustained state of full employment, difficulty is still being experienced in filling vacancies in certain grades. In August, 1972, there were less than 2 400 registered unemployed White males in the Republic, whilst on October, 16, 1972, the Railways had a total of nearly 11 500 vacancies mainly in certain key grades, in which vacancies by mid-December, 1972, amounted to 20%.</p>

<p>To alleviate the position in the bread and butter grades, staff in other spheres have, where possible, been trained for duty in those grades in which serious shortages are experienced and nearly 500 servants are at present rendering such auxiliary service.</p>

<p><span class="col_2111-2112" refersTo="page_1069"/>The practice of employing female staff in certain occupations traditionally filled by men is also being extended. The number of females employed in such positions increased steadily and now totals about 500. The first group of female police constables are at present undergoing training at the Railway College.</p>

<p>Where justified, the placing of non-Whites in graded positions in consultation with the Staff Associations is being continued.</p>

<p>During the year the Department continued in its efforts to improve working conditions in general and particular attention was paid to amenities such as ablution, heating, ventilation and lighting, as well as lighter and more comfortable clothing.</p>

<p>Whereas in the past the value of leave payable to a servant&#x2019;s widow on his demise was limited to a maximum period of six months, approval has been given of the payment to his dependants, or to his estate in the absence of any dependants, of the value of all leave standing to a deceased servant&#x2019;s credit.</p>

<p>The Administration, on the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Pension Matters, has approved of a scheme, which took effect from 1st October, 1972, whereby every member of the New Superannuation Fund who joined or joins the Service at an age higher than 18 years may exercise the option of antedating his pensionable service to the first day of the month following his 18th birthday. The antedating is, however, limited to a period of not more than five years and the servant is responsible for the total amount of his own contributions and the contributions that are normally paid by the Administration, together with interest.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will be glad to learn that Railway pension beneficiaries have not been forgotten. It has been decided to raise, with effect from 1st April, 1973, the minimum income level of R118 applicable to married&#x2014;single persons with dependants included&#x2014;and R59 applicable to unmarried pensioners, to R130 and R65 per month, respectively.</p>

<p>In so far as Civil pensioners are concerned, my colleague, the Minister of Finance, will deal with this matter in his Budget speech.</p>

<p>In view of the recent salary and wage increases granted to Railway staff, consideration was also given to improve the basic pensions of Railway pensioners, in order to also compensate those persons whose pension exceeds the minimum income level, for the rise in the cost of living.</p>

<p>I have consequently accepted the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Committee on Pension Matters that the annuities of all Railway pensioners be increased by 10% with effect from 1st April, 1973. Hon. Members will, no doubt, bear in mind the concession made a few years ago whereby the net annuities paid to all Railway pensioners are enhanced by 2%&#x2014;compounded annually&#x2014;for each completed year that they are on pension.</p>

<p>As far as non-Whites are concerned, the temporary allowance is being increased as follows with effect from 1st April, 1973.</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Married&#x2014;inclusive of single persons with dependants: from R20 to R22-50 per month for Coloureds and in respect of other non-Whites from R17-50 to R20 per month.</li>

<li>(b) Single, widow or widower: from R11 to R13 per month for Coloureds as well as other non-Whites.</li>

</ol>

<p>In regard to housing, new ground is being broken by the introduction, with effect from 1st April this year, of a House Ownership Scheme for Coloured staff on lines similar to the scheme in operation for White staff. Provision is accordingly being made in the Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 for an initial amount of R300 000 for this purpose.</p>

<p>At present almost 70% of the White married staff in permanent and temporary employment are enjoying assistance in respect of housing either in the form of a house purchased under the House Ownership Scheme, a property acquired under the Assisted 10% Ownership Housing Scheme or a departmental house.</p>

<p>At present 13 000 servants are participating in the House Ownership Scheme, whilst some 7 500 servants have been assisted in purchasing a house under the Assisted 10% Ownership Housing Scheme.</p>

<p>Departmental houses available to White married staff number 23 700 and the 1973-&#x2019;74 Estimates provide for a further 370 to be erected. If regard is had to the fact that accommodation for more than 4 800 unmarried White staff is available in Railway Hostels and that some 42 000 non-Whites are accommodated in compounds, line camps and other departmental dwellings, hon. members will agree that the <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1070"/>Railways has made equitable provision in respect of housing.</p>

<p>The rental for departmental houses averages R17-50 per month. The last rental adjustment was effected in October, 1953, nearly 20 years ago, and during these years salaries and wages have more than doubled. Since then maintenance expenditure, assessment rates, etc., in respect of departmental quarters amounted to more than R14 million.</p>

<p>Although an increase of 75% in rental would appear to be justified, I have decided to raise the rental for departmental housing with effect from 1st March, 1973, by only 40%; I consider this to be fair and it means that the average rental of R17-50 per month will be increased by R7. The increase is expected to yield additional revenue of almost R2 million.</p>

<debateSection name="#estimates_for_1973-&#x2019;74">

<heading>ESTIMATES FOR 1973-&#x2019;74</heading>

<p><i>Passengers:</i></p>

<p>Passenger revenue in the coming year is estimated at R116,4 million, or R10,5 million more than during the current year.</p>

<p><i>Goods:</i></p>

<p>It is estimated that goods traffic will yield approximately R652,9 million in the coming year, the improvement of R111,8 million on the current year&#x2019;s figure being due in great measure to the tariff increases.</p>

<p>Iron and manganese ore traffic, both local and for export, is expected to increase during the year, and also imports of capital goods such as machinery.</p>

<p><i>Coal</i> earnings are estimated at R72,5 million, the improvement of R10,7 million being due to increased exports and the effects of the higher tariffs.</p>

<p>The increase in <i>road transport</i> revenue (viz. R2&#x00BC; million) is also due largely to the higher tariffs.</p>

<p><i>Harbours:</i></p>

<p>It is forecast that the volume of imports will again rise in 1973, and the Bureau for Economic Research of Stellenbosch University estimates an increase of 12,5% in value. Taking into account the higher tariffs now applicable, harbour earnings are expected to rise by R11,5 million to R73,5 million.</p>

<p><i>Airways:</i></p>

<p>There has recently been an improvement in air traffic, and in addition to the revenue from the new services to the Far East and Argentine, increased earnings are expected from air freight.</p>

<p>Airways revenue for 1973-&#x2019;74 is estimated at just over R158 million, i.e. R21 million more than in 1972-&#x2019;73.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines:</i></p>

<p>The crude oil pipeline is scheduled to convey 1,2 million tons more traffic than in the current year and an increase is also expected in the case of White products as a result of the expansion of the network to include Pretoria and Klerksdorp. It is forecast that pipeline revenue for 1973-&#x2019;74 will yield R81,4 million, or R26,3 million more than the current year&#x2019;s figure.</p>

<p><i>All Services:</i></p>

<p>Total revenue from all services is, therefore, estimated at R1 311 674 000 and expenditure at R1 303 874 000, so that the year 1973-&#x2019;74 is expected to show a surplus of R7,8 million.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was pleasant to see today that the hon. the Minister still realizes that there is a Parliament in South Africa to which the Railways are to a certain degree accountable, because the way matters have developed recently, most things in the sphere of the financial administration of the Railways are taking place outside Parliament. We find that increases in salaries and rates are announced and then Parliament is expected to approve them <i>ex post facto.</i> The hon. the Minister does of course have my sympathy, for I cannot see what else he can do since he has to run the Railways and determine the financial policy of the Railways as a member of a Cabinet and within the framework of a policy responsible for the financial misgovernment of South Africa. With this stop-go, stop-start economic policy which is so characteristic of this Government, it is almost impossible for most of the businessmen in South Africa to determine their policy and to plan their business projects properly. A few years ago the hon. the Minister said he appreciated that changes in the salary structure and the rates of the Railways would have to be brought about every four years. I do not know whether he still remembers that. I fear that as a result of this Government&#x2019;s policy, that period is becoming shorter and shorter, and year after year it is in fact becoming more and more difficult to plan the Railway&#x2019;s financial administration in advance. I want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s expectations for the new financial year will be realized. At the same time I want to express the conviction that in two years&#x2019; time he will again experience problems owing to inflation and lack of control over the value of our money. It is matters of this kind which we want to discuss and for which the Minister will have to account.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that what we welcome in the proposals of the hon. the Minister, is the relief which is envisaged for the pensioners. We on this side of the House would like to express our appreciation and support for anything done to ease the lot of these people. I think the hon. the Minister deserves appreciation for the generous provision which he made for improving their lot. I always find it pleasant to be able to say something good about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget. I listened carefully and did manage to find something good, but I am afraid that there are also other matters which we want to discuss with him and which cannot be discussed in the same friendly atmosphere. To allow him some rest before having to hear these things, I move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find something very strange in the hon. member for Durban Point. Reference has already made to it in this debate. He has the ability to whip up emotions about every possible matter in this House. When this debate was adjourned, the hon. member for Durban Point had just taken part. Hon. members may now listen to the kind of statement he made. He spoke of &#x201C;Iron curtain methods&#x201D; and of &#x201C;Iron curtain&#x201D;. The concept of an iron curtain is a very unpleasant one in terms of the meaning the world assigns to it today. To go and label a measure, the objects of which I clearly explained in this House, as an &#x201C;iron curtain&#x201D; type of measure, is in my opinion very irresponsible. I think it is very unreasonable, as far as the country at large is concerned, to give that kind of label to this measure, which is a protective measure for them. The hon. member spoke of &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;. Surely there is no mention whatsoever of censorship in this legislation. It is surely very unreasonable and very irresponsible to label this measure a form of censorship. I again just want to reiterate what I said to the hon. House on a previous occasion. The procedure up to now has been to advertise, and then the National Transport Commission is applied to for a licence to introduce certain services. All they are now doing is to ensure that those who advertise in the newspapers first obtain the necessary licence authority from the National transport Commission. That is all we are doing. I simply cannot accept the fact that it is labelled an &#x201C;iron curtain&#x201D; measure <span class="col_2117-2118" refersTo="page_1072"/>and &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;. I give him credit for more responsibility than such a statement is worthy of. He speaks here of the &#x201C;banning of information&#x201D;. Can hon. members grasp what &#x201C;banning of information&#x201D; means? What is the hon. member trying to achieve with that? What is he trying to do? What is his purpose? What is his intention as far as that is concerned? I have stated very clearly that we are dealing here with the measure for the protection of the air travellin public of South Africa. We are dealing with the measure that must protect people against unscrupulous exploiters. When we do this, the hon. member says we are engaged in the &#x201C;banning of information&#x201D;. The hon. member moved amendments, and on a previous occasion I very clearly gave my reasons why those amendments are not acceptable. Either they are already contained in the Act or they contain a principle which I cannot accept. Up to now the position in this country has been that the National Transport Commission is autonomous. We do not, by means of this legislation, now want to restrict that autonomy.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I want to refer to, although it is not directly concerned with this measure before the House. Because of what was said in the House I must, however, make a correction. Hon. members on the other side included charter flights in the discussion, which is completely unfair. A great issue was made of the fact that charter flights would supposedly be so much cheaper now than scheduled services. A great fuss was made about that. I must point out to the House and to the travelling public that there is also something called group rates as far as the South African Airways is concerned. The group services of the South African Airways are cheaper than the majority of charter flights. Because what else is a charter flight? It involves a group travelling as a group and therefore subject, as such, to cheaper, group rates. But exactly the same privileges are available at the South African Airways, and since the debate has developed along those lines, I find it essential to point out that injustice, because those privileges also exist.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question? I put something to him yesterday afternoon in the debate.

Would he please answer that now?</p>

<p>No, I have not read the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard; I remember distinctly what he said. He asked whether it was an offence for <i>The Cape Times</i> to publish an advertisement for any airline, possibly the example he quoted now. Obviously it is not an offence for a newspaper to do that. We place no onus whatsoever on a newspaper. But on the other hand it would of course require the permission of the National Transport Commission to publish any advertisement for a flight which is meant to draw South African passengers. If it originates or terminates outside the borders of South Africa, we do not of course have any jurisdiction over that whatsoever. But if it does terminate within the borders of this country, or leaves from any place from within the Republic, they will obviously have to have the permission of the National Transport Commission.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It means nothing more than what I have said. It means that, if any airline flies a connection from anywhere in South Africa to any other place, whether the flight is chartered, scheduled or whatever, I accept that it is carrying passengers from South Africa. Perhaps I did not use the correct term by calling them South African passengers. I really meant passengers from South Africa. If any airline, whether it flies a chartered, a scheduled or any other service, flies passengers from inside South Africa to anywhere else, it comes under this Bill as it is now phrased. First of all, the original Act <span class="col_2119-2120" refersTo="page_1073"/>already provided for certain classes of airlines. This is merely extended by the proposed new section 2A as far as the advertisements are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister did not reply to the query which I put to him about the interpretation of the English term &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D; and the Afrikaans term &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;. Perhaps he will deal with that later. I wish to come back to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply. He has said that the objectives of this Bill have been clearly explained by himself. Yet when we accept the hon. the Deputy Minister at his word and we say that, if those are his objectives, let us limit this Bill to what he says are the objectives, he rejects the amendment we move. Therefore I must say that by his own refusal to accept the amendment, by his own rejection of that amendment, the hon. the Deputy Minister makes us reject the reasons which he gives for wanting this legislation. If this legislation is required, as he says, only to protect travellers against unscrupulous agents, our amendment makes that possible. If the hon. the Deputy Minister wants more powers, to do things other than those which he claims he wants to do and pretends he want to do&#x2014;as we must assume from his rejection of the amendment&#x2014;then we must assume that the reasons given do not cover the motive. My amendment covers every single object which the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to achieve through this measure.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy</p>

<p>Minister has not shown in one single way why the objectives he aims at cannot be achieved if he accepts my amendment. If he could show us that by accepting this amendment, he would stymie any of the objectives that he is aiming at, if he could show us that, by accepting this, he could not achieve what he is aiming at, we could debate the matter intelligently. At the moment the hon. the Deputy Minister is not debating; he is not giving us any reason at all for his rejection of the amendment other than to say that it is not necessary. Let him give this House one reason why each of the three restrictions proposed here cannot be accepted. Let him give us one reason why the acceptance of any of these limitations on the commission would prevent the achievement of the objectives at which he is aiming. Then we can talk about it. We cannot debate intelligently when there is no intelligent argument put forward from the side of the hon. the Deputy Minister. It is typical of the attitude of the Government that, when they come to the House with a measure, they say: This is what we are going to do and we are not interested in reason, logic or anything else&#x2014;&#x201C;ons is die groot baas en ons gaan dit deurforseer; ons het die stemme; ons het die mag&#x201D;.</p>

<p>*What we have here once more is one of those cases where we try to debate in a reasonable manner the merits of a case but the Minister is not prepared to debate it. He simply says: &#x201C;It is not necessary and I do not accept it.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He has not yet furnished a reason why the acceptance of this amendment is going to thwart his aims.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now let me come to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply to the hon. member for Kensington. He has not, in fact, replied to him at all. Does he not understand the question put to him? In terms of the proposed provision, would it be illegal for somebody to advertise in <i>The Cape Times</i> a flight from Swaziland to, say, Luxemburg? He says that it will not be illegal for the newspaper, that we cannot control flights outside South Africa and that only if they leave from within South Africa will they fall under the provisions of this clause. It is not so. I have here with me <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> dated 4th March in which an article appears. I say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that when this Bill is passed an offence would have been committed in terms of this article. An offence would have been committed because in terms of the provisions of the Bill it would have promoted the sale of seating accommodation. It would have encouraged people to look for the Luxavia opportunity to fly to London via Luxemburg at R395 instead of R529. It would therefore have contravened the law by promoting and drawing to the attention of the people the opportunity to fly cheaper than they can under normal fares charged by the South African Airways. By referring to London-New York and London-Venice flights it <span class="col_2121-2122" refersTo="page_1074"/>would be tantamount to promoting flights. Therefore, whether or not that flight originates in South Africa this would create an offence for any journalist, newspaper, any travel magazine or anyone other than a registered airline who put out any advertising material at all, even the advertising of an internal flight in America, an internal flight in Europe or a flight from London to the North Pole. This would be promoting flights without the permission of the commission. I do not know how to get it through to the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is not practical to limit writings in magazines, publications, leaflets and trade adverts in the way in which this seeks to do it. It is not practical and it is not realistic. He is aiming here at one group of people, namely pseudo travel agents in South Africa. In aiming at them he shoots with a scatter-gun at any sort of information coming into South Africa. Then he takes exception when I talk of the Iron Curtain and censorship. It is not what the hon. the Deputy Minister intends, but it is what he is achieving. He must not come and squeal to me when I talk of censorship or the Iron Curtain when it is his Bill which is creating that situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows or should know that this measure will in fact prevent South Africans from receiving information on the sort of flights which are available to them overseas.</p>

<p>Unless the hon. the Deputy Minister can indicate to us some reason other than that the Big Broeder wants this power and is not prepared to bend one inch on it, we cannot accept that the reasons he has given for this measure are the real reasons for which he wants it. It goes far beyond that and our amendment gives in fact the powers that he is asking for.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to the question put to me on a previous occasion by the hon. member, relating to the English translation of the word &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;, namely &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D;. It is merely a matter of phraseology, Sir. There is no single English word for &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;, to the best of my knowledge. &#x201C;Authorized representative&#x201D;, &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D;, or whatever the case may be, would be the translation of &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;. I am not a linguist, and that is the information that was made available to me. Perhaps the hon. member knows better; I do not, unfortunately, or at least, the sources available to me do not. &#x201C;Gevolmagtigde&#x201D; in Afrikaans includes an agent as well, so therefore &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D; is the exact interpretation of the term &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D; in Afrikaans. As I have said, this word in Afrikaans includes an agent, and &#x201C;gevolmagtigde agent&#x201D; would then have a double meaning; it would be repeating what was already said. &#x201C;Gevolmagtigde&#x201D; can be interpreted as &#x201C;gevolmagtigde agent&#x201D; or &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D;. It means exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to the hon. member&#x2019;s next point. The hon. member for Durban Point blames me for a lack of intelligence, but I am trying also to bridge the intelligence gap on his side. I have explained in the clearest possible terms exactly what this clause means. I did so during the Second Reading and I did so again in this Committee. I have stated the reason why the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is not acceptable to me. Let me go into this once again. The hon. member, in his amendment, states that &#x201C;such authority shall be granted &#x2026;&#x201D;. He binds the National Transport Commission. I have already explained the accepted principle and I am not prepared, by means of this legislation, to change that principle. The accepted principle is that of autonomy for the National Transport Commission. I cannot possibly use this legislation before the House at the moment to change that principle. I do not intend changing the principle because I want the National Transport Commission to judge whatever application comes before it, and to judge it purely on merit. I am not prepared to accept the amendment because it does limit the judgment of the National Transport Commission. It forces, it orders the NTC to do certain things and it takes away its discretion in that regard. I cannot accept that principle. I am trying to explain this to the hon. member. Secondly, I pointed out that what he intends in the second part of his amendment, namely his proposed subsection (2)(b), to follow subsection (1) of the proposed new section 2A, has already been incorporated in this clause itself. Thirdly&#x2014;and this also answers the hon. member for Kensington&#x2014;part three of his amendment deals with journeys originating and terminating outside the borders of the Republic, and limits the provisions of the proposed new section to the Republic of South Africa. Here he refers to publications, etc., referring to such journeys. But, Sir, that is self-evident.</p>

<p>I will come back to that. Sir, let us go back to the clause. I have tried very hard to explain it. This clause, with due respect, should be read in its entirety. It is not subdivided into separate subclauses. One should therefore read the clause as a whole&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall without the written authority of the Commission, which may be granted subject to such conditions as the Commission may deem fit&#x2014;</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I cannot see the hon. member&#x2019;s argument; that is the problem. This relates only to a single fact which I wish to state most emphatically once more. The position up to now was that anybody could publicize or advertise a flight; anybody could collect deposits from people, or even the full price of the ticket, before applying for a licence or before getting any authority whatsoever for such a flight. We are merely changing the sequence of the procedure now. Before a person is allowed to advertise or to sell tickets to the public or to collect deposits from members of the public, he has to have the authority of the NTC. After he gets their authority, he is free to advertise to the public any form of cheap air travel, provided &#x2026;</p>

He is free to do so provided he has the necessary authority, and provided again that it is a flight which terminates or originates within the borders of the country. This is merely changing the sequence. He has to go through all the procedures first. We are merely changing the sequence in this respect that he now has to have the authority of the NTC before he advertises the flight to the public. In my reply to the Second Reading debate I very clearly pointed out to the House the sort of problem that we are faced with, the sort of experiences we had in the past, and I want to emphasize again that I have a responsibility to the public of South Africa to protect them against this sort of thing; it has got to be done, and we are doing it by means of this Bill, and nothing more can or should be read into the Bill than merely this.</p>

I would be glad, Sir, if he would just look at 2A(1); he will agree with me then that my paraphrasing is fair: &#x201C;Within South Africa&#x201D;, I suggest we say, &#x201C;no person shall without the authority of the National Transport Commission make known by any means that any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service&#x201D;.

<p>I am looking for a specific application. This is what I am arguing. Now, if this is correct, and he cannot argue that it is not correct, let us first remember that an &#x201C;air service&#x201D; in the Bill is not defined as an air service within South Africa or originating within South Africa or terminating in South Africa. In other words let us come back to the example I put to him earlier. If the operator of a non-scheduled airline or air service between Swaziland and Luxemburg, or Louren&#x00E7;o Marques and Luxemburg, wants to advertise such an air service in a South African newspaper, does this not fall within the ambit of what I have put to him, that within South Africa no person shall without authority make known by any means that any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service? Of course it means that. How can he say otherwise? That is precisely what this says.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Air service&#x201D; means any service performed by means of an aircraft for reward and includes an air transport service.</block>

<p>Now, in the light of this, is this hon.

If he says this is his intention, to allow this sort of advertising, that is certainly not what the Bill says but it is what the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Point proposes. Then, why is he not prepared to accept the amendment? You see, Sir, we seem to be pushing our heads up against a stone wall. He keeps on talking past our arguments. But even as I put this to him again, he does not seem to react. I am glad the hon. the Minister of Transport is here, because this is a serious matter. It affects newspapers and publications generally and they will want to know exactly where they stand. We must insist that this hon. Deputy Minister reply to us, or if he cannot answer adequately, the hon. the Minister should come into the debate and tell us exactly what this means.

<p>Of course the principle of this Bill has been accepted in the Second Reading, but in submitting our amendments to the hon. the Deputy Minister we were trying to put into practice what he had actually said. He has said here this afternoon that it does not concern air service outside this country. Of course he talks against his own arguments because one of his big worries is the air services that operate from Louren&#x00E7;o Marques to elsewhere. It is quite clear from the Bill that this in fact affects all services, and as the hon. member for Kensington says, most publications are going to be in a most difficult position on interpretation of this particular clause.</p>

<p>We have come forward to try to assist the Minister by moving our amendment. What he wants to do is to protect the legitimate user and the person that wants to go about it the correct way. We want him to do this to assist those legitimate organizations who in the past have gone the right way about it and have organized charter flights or group flights. He wants to protect the public as far as the fly-by-nights are concerned but he does not say so in the Bill. But in our particular paragraph (b) we give him that let-out by providing for a substantial deposit and that substantial guarantees be provided. That protects the man in the street against the fly-by-nights. All the way through we have tried to assist the hon. the Minister but he now puts a measure on the Statute Book which will not work out and which will embarrass most legitimate travel agencies who have international connections. They will be placed in a most difficult position. If we as the S.A. Airways advertise in New York or anywhere else&#x2014;forgetting about our scheduled flights&#x2014;if one of our pamphlets advertises a flight within the Republic which is a non-scheduled flight or a group flight, one may get away with it in New York, but what if they retaliate and say: &#x201C;You do not allow us to do this in South Africa, so we will not allow you to advertise in our country&#x201D;? That can happen. We have had retaliations before. As was said during the Second Reading by the hon. member for Durban Point, we have gone too far in this Bill. What the hon. the Minister wants to do we are trying to put right in this amendment. Unfortunately I do not know why he does not see the light and why he does not appreciate the fact that he is going too far in this measure. We do not want to make fools of ourselves. Do not let us put measures on the Statute Book that we cannot put into operation and dare not put into operation. It is no use putting a measure on the Statute Book and the Minister having to come here next year and tell us that there has been a test case and his legal advisers say the Act has to be amended. Surely, this is the time to examine the law properly, even if we delay <span class="col_2129-2130" refersTo="page_1078"/>it, or even if the Minister decides to withdraw it at this late stage for that purpose?</p>

The whole point which the hon. the Deputy Minister is trying to make seems to be based on the fact that jurisdiction applies to flights which take place to or from South Africa. But can he still not see that that is not the point of the argument? According to this amendment the National Transport Commission is given jurisdiction over publication within South Africa of details of flights anywhere. That is exactly what it says. Does he not see that? It does not appear as though he sees it. In that case we cannot argue any further. However, I should like him to give us just one assurance, namely that it is not the intention to limit this type of advertising or any publication of details of such non-scheduled flights.

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides that &#x201C;any person who fails to comply with an order or direction of the commission shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding R1 000.&#x201D; One of the most important elements of the law generally is that it should be certain. The public should know beforehand precisely what the legislator enjoins them to do or forbids them to do. The offence, especially if it is a criminal offence, should be clearly stated so that everybody knows what that offence is&#x2014;otherwise you either have anarchy or despotism. Here we have a condition that you commit a criminal offence in respect of which you may be fined R1 000 if you do not obey and comply with an order or direction of the commission. What sort of orders and directions does the commission in fact give? The commission gives a direction when it hears applications for licences or for the renewal, alteration or transferring of licences or the exemption from any of the provisions of this Act or conditions of the licence or on behalf of any interested person requesting the commission to make any order or give any direction. In other words, these directions that it might give in respect of licences, if these are not complied with constitute an offence. Let me put it another way. What this means is that we are not stating here that X, Y and Z are offences, or that a particular behaviour constitutes an offence, but we are saying that the commission may, in its discretion in all sorts of circumstances, decide from time to time what would be an offence in terms of the law. In other words, the National Transport Commission is here entitled, upon application for licences under the Act, to declare from time to time that something is a crime, or that something can become a crime, and a fine of R1 000 is imposed. This is not just a bad law; it is also an extremely bad principle. If you do not comply with the direction or order of the commission in respect of the granting or renewal of a licence, in respect of a condition of that licence or whatever, then the National Transport Commission has the power to withdraw or refuse the renewal of that licence; it has the power to do something about it. To make it a criminal offence is ludicrous and absolutely unacceptable. That the offence should be stated <span class="col_2133-2134" refersTo="page_1080"/>clearly in the law, that it should be known to all and should then be punishable by the courts is a principle which has been well known throughout the centuries. This is so fundamental that it does not need any elucidation. As this measure stands at the moment, it is objectionable, but there may be just some aspect of this which has escaped our notice and perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister can indicate to us that what I have said is not so, and if it is not so, why it is not so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer the hon. member to section 3(l)(d) of the principal Act. For the sake of completeness I should just like to read it to the hon. member. It deals with the functions of the commission in relation to applications. Subsection (1) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be the function of the commission, subject to the provisions of this Act, and with due regard to the provisions of sections seven and nine of the Transport (Co-ordination) Act, 1948, to hear and determine any application&#x2014;</block>

<p>And now I shall read paragraph (d)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">by or on behalf of any interested party, requesting the commission to make any order or give any direction, consent or approval which it may lawfully make or give, or with respect to any matter which by this Act or any order or direction &#x2026;</block>

<p>Please note: &#x201C;any order or direction&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any order or direction of the commission is prohibited, sanctioned or required to be done.</block>

<p>The principle that the commission may give certain directions in terms of section 3(l)(d) has already been accepted, but it was an oversight in the Act that no penal provisions were included in this connection. All that is being done here is to attach, with reference to section 3(l)(d) of the principal Act, where in principle the commission already has powers of direction penal provisions to those powers of direction. The hon. member must of course remember that anything of this kind will in the nature of things come before a court and that the court has a discretion in the matter. It is not necessary for me to tell him that. This, therefore, only refers to section 3(1)(d) of the principal Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I accept that, obviously, this has to come before the court. That is not the question. The question is: What is the offence? We do not define here what the offence is. What this clause says, is that the commission can decide from time to time in its absolute discretion what are to be offences, by saying: This is to be a condition; this condition is to apply to the licence; this condition to the use of a service. It can make any direction it likes as to how the operator, who has the licence, is in fact to operate. If that condition is transgressed, an offence is committed. It is true that the offender has to go to court, but that is not the point. The offence is created by the commission.</p>

<p>I want to go a little further. The hon. the Deputy Minister has dealt with section 3 of the Act. But I would like to ask him to have a look at section 7 of the Act. Subsection (3) thereof provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the commission is of the opinion, having regard to the nature of an application or objection or the circumstances in which it is made, it has a <i>prima facie</i> little chance of success and that its making may cause needless expense to an objector or to the applicant, as the case may be, the commission may at any time during the proceedings after the lodging of an application or objection, order such applicant or objector to deposit with the commission a sum not exceeding one hundred pounds within a stated time, and in default of such deposit may refuse the application or disallow the objection.</block>

<p>If they ordered someone to pay R200 deposit, as is the normal practice, then in terms of the provisions of this clause it would lapse if they did not do so. But if that order is not complied with by the applicant, they would in fact commit an offence. The hon. the Deputy Minister cannot say that they will not be prosecuted, because they will in fact be committing an offence if this legislation is passed. It is not the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s department who will decide. Any member of the public, an objector, who is in competition, could then lay a complaint with the police that in fact he did not deposit the R200. He has therefore committed a <i>prima facie</i> offence and the police will then investigate <span class="col_2135-2136" refersTo="page_1081"/>the matter and a prosecution might take place. But most certainly it will take place in respect of the breach of a condition of a licence. Surely this is once again taking the matter much too far. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister propose that in respect of every licence that is granted, whenever the local transportation board imposes a condition in respect of that licence and that condition is broken or not complied with, does he in turn &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I know that. I am talking about road motor transportation licences. The principle is exactly the same. Is it now proposed that the breach of the conditions of a licence for road motor transportation by a local transportation board is also going to constitute a criminal offence? Surely not. As matters stand at the moment, a breach of those conditions reported to the local board or the National Transport Commission will result in that licence being suspended, withdrawn or not renewed. There is action that can be taken irrespective of the licence. But this is not a matter where the public at large is being offended against. This is a matter where there is an application for a trade licence. That is all. The National Transport Commission in its discretion says that you can have that licence upon certain conditions. Now he breaches that. It is a matter relating to that licence. It is a commercial matter. He has the licence at the discretion of this board. Now it is to become a public criminal offence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>They are only far-fetched because this is a far-reaching clause. It says that the breach of a condition is a criminal offence. What is the criminal offence going to be? There is no one that can answer that. There is no one here that can say what sort of conditions are going to be imposed in every case. The National Transport Commission itself could not tell you. The chairman of that commission could not now pass a note to the hon. the Deputy Minister and tell him, what the position would be in respect or every one, because every application is considered on its merits. Both sides are heard, the objectors and the applicants. There are circumstances which arise in every case which are different. No one can tell you what the offence is going to be. But the principle is there. Does not the hon. the Minister appreciate that it is a bad principle? There is a remedy. Why is this necessary? Why can the National Transport Commission, as it stands now, not use its power, if there is a breach of a condition imposed by it, to either nullify the licence or suspend it, or deal with the operator in some other way?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>According to your argument there would be no sanctions clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>But surely. Sir, the sanction is that because you have breached the conditions of your licence, you are no longer able to operate on that licence? That is the way to deal with it, surely? As I understand it, they have that power, but if they do not have that power, then they must have it immediately. They must have the power then to suspend the operation on that licence, because a breach of the licence would have occurred. I would have thought that once such a condition were breached, the holder of the licence would no longer be entitled to operate. That is the way to deal with it and if they do not have that power, give them the power. Do not, however, let us give the National Transport Commission the power to create an offence carrying with it a fine of R1 000, because it imposes conditions according to its own whims, entirely in its own discretion. This situation is untenable at the moment. We have not had a satisfactory explanation from the hon. the Deputy Minister yet. I hope that he will be able to give us a satisfactory explanation, otherwise we shall have to vote against this provision.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member has referred here to the whole question of the suspension and cancellation of licences. May I just say in passing that the Motor Carrier Transport Act is by no means before the House at the moment, and therefore I do not intend to reply to that in any way.</p>

<p>But the principle is the same.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend to debate the Motor Carrier Transport Act in any way. At the moment I have the Air Services Amendment Bill before me, and I am prepared to debate that principle. If the hon. member will look at section 17 of the principal Act, he will note that it deals fully with the whole question of the cancellation or suspension of licences. If he will page back to section 3(l)(d), he will have to agree with me immediately that there is no penal provision for any oversight committed in terms of that section. If, for example, one fails to act in terms of a direction given under section 3(l)(d), no penal provision is attached to such failure to act. The hon. member will readily grant me that. I shall mention to him two examples of what can happen. The commission may, for example, issue an instruction to someone to appear before them and that person may refuse to do so, in terms of this section. What remedy does the commission have? What penal measures can be applied? Nowhere is there a penal provision providing for such a case. Let us take another case. A licence may have to be returned to the commission within a certain period because it has been cancelled, and the holder of such a licence may refuse to do so. What power, in terms of section 3(1)(d), does the commission have at the moment to take action against him? What penal provision is there? The purpose of this is very clear. It is simply to attach a penal provision to a direction given by the commission with regard to section 3(1)(d). Once again not half of the spectres which have been seen by the hon. member, are present here; this is simply not the case. The intention behind this relates to section 3(l)(d) of the principal Act only.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, could the hon. the Deputy Minister explain to us again, in satisfactory terms, the reason for removing the right of an applicant to obtain a licence 12 months before the expiry of his existing licence? The only reason given in the Second Reading Debate was that this right was not used very much. But it does appear to be a privilege which people have at the moment and which cannot create insurmountable difficulties or problems for the department. Without arguing the point any further, I would be grateful to know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister could motivate the reason for taking away this right from applicants.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have carefully considered this amendment in all its aspects, and I think that I shall be able to meet the hon. member for Green Point. I am prepared to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>*The reason is as follows. We have investigated all the possibilities which might occur when an officer is discharged from the Force on account of ill health. I just want to say for the record that the procedure which is followed in connection with medical unfitness, is the following: If the district surgeon or another doctor should express the opinion that the member of the Force is medically unfit for further service, he makes out a clinical report and supplies a prognosis which is submitted to the head office. A medical board is then convened to which two doctors are appointed. The minutes of the medical board are subsequently forwarded by the Commissioner of the South African Police to the Secretary for Health to inquire whether or not he agrees with the findings and recommendation of the board. The Secretary then submits the matter to the Minister. In the light of this very thorough procedure there is no possibility of some future illness being used for the purposes of a discharge. In these circumstances we shall accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for accepting the amendment and also for his explanation. The possibility of lack of fitness during the period of his employment with a department of State is one which concerns every State employee. With the acceptance of this amendment, there need be no fear now of all the financial consequences of a premature retirement from the Force. That situation can only arise when in fact the man is found to be unfit; in other words, his services will be retained in the Force up to the very time that he is found to be unfit. I thank the Deputy Minister for accepting that amendment. It will reassure members of the Force.</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there is an interesting provision here in subparagraph (c) of the first paragraph of this clause. I refer to the provision for the storage of arms and ammunition by licensed dealers and registered gunsmiths. This raises the question which was raised when the Act was amended, when the first amnesty was granted, and that is whether or not it is not desirable for this provision to be extended not just so that licensed dealers and registered gunsmiths may in fact store arms and ammunition, but whether there should not be a repository provided by the State for arms to be stored. I want to say that the persons who are the most concerned, who are the first to be affected by the theft of fire-arms, are the police themselves. They are usually the people who are at the receiving end of the bullets that come out of those stolen weapons. It is not good enough that the Act, properly interpreted&#x2014;and the Commissioner of Police agrees with this&#x2014;does allow one to leave one&#x2019;s fire-arms with a friend for storage. Although he is in fact not the licensee, you may leave your fire-arms with him. But, Sir, that is not good enough. Your friend may leave and leave your fire-arm in his house and his house may be broken into. No doubt if you take your arm along to a gunsmith or a licensed dealer, he may agree or may not agree to keep it for you; he may or may not charge you a fee. But in our view the public should be entitled to have access to a repository provided by the State, Obviously, Sir, the police station is the proper place for it at the moment, but the police have difficulties as well in providing facilities for arms to be locked up in strong rooms; they would also have the difficulty of keeping a register of them, etc., and they have enough to do already without having to do this as well. On some occasions it depends entirely on the facilities which are available at any particular police station as to whether or not, when a man goes away on holiday, for example, he is able to leave his arms with the police for safekeeping until his return. That depends entirely on the facilities available at the police station. Sir, this is an important matter. The object of this Act <span class="col_2141-2142" refersTo="page_1084"/>is to control the licensing of arms and also to ensure that they do not get stolen or go astray. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give us some indication as to what sort of regulations he has in mind in respect of gunsmiths and whether he will give consideration to the whole question of the State providing for a repository for arms when people want to go away from home and want to leave their arms in safety.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately I do not think that the proposal by the hon. member for Durban North is completely practical. What happens at present, is that there is a proper repository at each police station for the arms of the Police, and the Police are prepared to keep the arms of individuals, of people who go on holiday, in that repository. But a general State repository would involve major expenditure and one would not know for certain how many rifles, revolvers, etc., one would have to provide for when establishing such a repository.</p>

<p>As far as this particular subsection is concerned, it is only concerned with the storage of weapons and ammunition by licensed dealers and registered gunsmiths. Previously it was not necessary to have a regulation in this regard. Under the original Act, before this amendment, the position was such that when a licence was issued, certain conditions were laid down for the storage of the fire-arm. Initially the legal draftsmen thought that it would be more practical, for the simple reason that each dealer had his own specific premises, with his own specific problems, and that it would then perhaps have been easier to attach the conditions to the licence. But after the Act had come into operation it was found that it was better to make provision for the general storage of fire-arms by way of regulation, so that one could have a general repository and could lay down conditions regarding storage. As regards the other aspect, gunsmiths, of course, have never before been subject to licensing at a fee, etc. That is now being introduced. A registration fee is now being required from gunsmiths as well. That may be found at the top of page 6 of the Bill, and consequently storage regulations are also being laid down for gunsmiths. I think the hon. member for Durban North raised an interesting point, but I do not think that it is a practicable one.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister for Transport yesterday said that we did not have to work hard in this House. He has forgotten what it is like to be in the Opposition!</p>

<p>Sir, when this debate was adjourned I had dealt with the question of our objection to this Bill based on the practicability or impracticability of clauses 2 and 5, apart from any other objections, and today I want to take that a little further. I want to look at the reality of what we are being asked to pass here today. We imposed in the original legislation&#x2014;the law as it stands today&#x2014;under section 10(1) an onus on any person who moved his residence, to notify the department of such change of address. We were agreed on that; there was no argument. We believe that when a person changes his address, there should be a legal obligation on him to notify his change of address. We were agreed on the principle that wherever it was possible to find other means of tracing changes of address they should be used. However, when the original Act was adopted we said that the onus it placed on a landlord was not realistic and not practicable. Therefore we opposed the provision. We said that landlords were being asked to do something which in practice would not work. We are now being asked to extend that. There was an option for the landlord. He could either notify or he could wait a period and verify whether notification had been given and then he had to act. A further option is now being added, the option that after 14 days he shall verify notification and within 28 days he shall notify. In other words, it is simply a change in the form of notification, which the hon. the Deputy Minister told us is based on representations made by the landlords, through their organization, and accepted by the Government. The existing system did not work&#x2014;the fact that it did not work is admitted by the Government by the suspension of this provision by the State President &#x2026;</p>

<p>It has been, yes.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it has been suspended. In other words, the hon. member who interjected and said that it has not been suspended is, as usual, talking through the back of his head. It is no wonder that he is in such trouble in his constituency for making irresponsible remarks!</p>

<p>This section of the Act has been suspended. In other words, it does not work and even the Government accepts that it does not work. They are now coming along to say that they are not only going to reapply it, but they are going to make it even more difficult to apply by instead of 45 days, limiting it to 28 days. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question when he has finished educating the hon. member who incorrectly interjected. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister how many notifications the Department of the Interior received before the suspension of this provision. Did any landlord notify changes of address or, in fact, did they have no notification in terms of this provision? The hon. the Deputy Minister cannot tell me; he does not know, and I do not blame him. One cannot expect him to know everything. However, the fact is that landlords simply did not notify. What are they now being asked to notify? The amendment in lines 24 and 25, which we are now being asked to add, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and furnish in that notice the full name and identity number of such person.</block>

<p>Those are the two particulars, and the address would obviously be the third which the landlord will have to notify. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that is going to be easy. The landlords have agreed that they would simply send along lists of their tenants. Of course, that is not going to help the hon. the Deputy Minister at all. What is the practice? The practice throughout flats&#x2019; administration in South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p>Let me interrupt myself at this point and point out that a large percentage of South Africa&#x2019;s White population today live in flats. I have tried to establish the percentage, but it must be something like 30%, or more, of the White population. In my constituency it is 100%, but of the whole of South Africa&#x2019;s White population a large percentage live in blocks of flats. When a person rents a flat, the procedure is that he or she goes along to the agent, signs a lease, pays a deposit and is given a key to the flat. On that lease is the name of the tenant who signs the lease. In 99,9% of the cases there is only a limitation as to the number of people who may occupy that flat. With a house there is not even that limitation. But the agent does not know who lives in the flat with whom. It could be Mr. and Mrs. Jones. If hon. members on the Government side have never done so yet, they should try canvassing in flat-land some time. On the board they may find the names of &#x201C;Mr. and Mrs. Jones&#x201D;. But when they get inside they will find that it is Mr. Jones and Mrs. Smith who are living together and are known as Mr. and Mrs. Jones but because of what was then Government policy, they could not afford to get married because they would have lost their pensions. You might find a Mr. Kruger and Mrs. Ponsonby-Smythe living together under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Kruger. Hon. members realize that the landlord does not know this. He signs the lease with the tenant but now he is being asked to examine the identity documents, the book of life, of the tenant and anyone else who lives in that building in order to enable him to fulfil the provision which we are being asked to add, and to furnish in that notice the full name and identity number of such persons. In the first place he is going to find some objection from some of the female tenants, because his Government has now made it so that the identity number immediately discloses the age of the tenant to start with. So every caretaker and every agent is going to be able to establish not only the marital relationship of his tenants, but their ages too. If this is not an intrusion into the privacy of South Africans, I would like to know what is. Not an official for the purposes of official duty, but a landlord, or a letting agent or a caretaker of a flat or a supervisor, will be entitled to pry into the marital status of all his tenants and to establish all their ages. I have even found that in filling in voters registration cards people are not prepared to leave their <span class="col_2145-2146" refersTo="page_1086"/>cards with the caretaker to be collected because they do not want the caretaker of their block to know these personal details where they may not in fact be married or where they do not want to let them know their ages or their personal history. That happens quite often.</p>

<p>I invite that hon. member to come to Durban and see what a block of flats looks like. I shall take him around and show him some blocks of flats. I shall show him that in many of these flats there is not a resident caretaker. They are therefore administered not by an owner, not by a company which is a body of people, but by an office in town to which they pay their rent and from which they obtain their lease in the first place. There is no personal supervision. But now we are asked to make those agents or their caretakers responsible for establishing this information. Again, what happens in practice is that modern estate agents who handle letting, work on computers; they computerize the information and if you ask for a list of the tenants of a building they can get that out by pressing a button. That is the list, I submit, which they have offered to send to the department. Is that so?</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister says that is correct. This amendment we are being asked to pass is to the effect that they can send these lists to which I refer and which contain the lists of tenants to the department. That list is quite useless in that form, because that list will not have identity numbers on it. It will only have the name of the person who signed the lease and his initials. I have worked on these lists and have tried to marry a list of tenants of a block of flats to a voters&#x2019; roll where there are only some 14 000 names to look at. You find in practice that it does not work, because you can have some four or five Mr. J. Smiths or four or five J. Bothas, or Krugers. In some constituencies &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; for instance, when you go down to the bottom end of mine you even find so many Daan van der Merwes but you have to go pretty far down Point Road to find them! These lists are not going to provide the information. What is more, in many modern blocks of flats which are not rent-controlled, the post-1966 flats, the turnover of people in those buildings can be anything up to 400% a year. Your total population can change four times per year in a block of flats. This will create a tremendous problem for the department, but it is also an impossible problem for landlords. If they are going to keep up with this continual change and are going to have to record all the tenants and notify the department thereof it may give some of the information but it will not work as envisaged. What we will then find is that the population register, like the voters&#x2019; roll, is going to become &#x201C;shambolic&#x201D;. We will find the same sort of thing as we now have on the voters&#x2019; roll, namely that four, five or six families are registered at the same address in the same flat with one bedroom. Agents and landlords are going to be notifying the moves inwards each time&#x2014;if they are doing their job. So they will notify that Mr. Jones moved in in January. At the end of February they will notify that Mr. Van der Merwe has moved in. At the end of March they will notify that Mr. Smith moved into the same flat. Now, within a year you can have four or five people that have been notified as being resident in that flat. However, unless they have been picked up elsewhere, they are still going to be registered there. So your population register becomes, like the voters&#x2019; roll, a mass <span class="col_2147-2148" refersTo="page_1087"/>of irrelevant and inaccurate information. Surely, what we are aiming at is an accurate population register one which will be effective. We are going to have to find some other way, other than this. It is so easy to pass a law&#x2014;we simply debate it; we all vote and it becomes law. We have masses of laws which do not work. I would rather see this House trying to find a method which is going to be effective, efficient and which will give correct information, instead of having something on paper which looks nice through passing a law knowing that it is not going to solve the problem.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I was coming to that. When we criticize, we usually make constructive suggestions. When the same problem was investigated by a select committee on the Electoral Act, we went into this very thoroughly. We found that there was one way in which you could rely on information, namely if you could get it from official and semi-official sources. Every person who moves into a block of flats, has to pay a deposit if he is charged directly for his electricity, or he has to pay a water deposit if each flat has its own water meter. It certainly applies to every house. If they have a telephone, they have to apply to the telephone department. So already you have three official sources which most tenants are obliged to notify when they move from point A to point B. These are official sources that must make out documents. If they make out a telephone receipt, it is easy for them to put in an extra piece of carbon to get an extra copy of that receipt which could then be sent to the department.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it might obviate certain hon. members of the Other Place getting accounts for R1 400 for briefly being absent from their flat. However, as I was saying, these are official documents which are made out. It would only mean that an extra copy would have to be made. As it is an official document, it will have on it the full address and the name. All that would have to be added, would be the identity number. You would then be able to get the information without having to disclose it to private people who have no right to that information. It would be disclosed to officials in municipal or State departments who, by the nature of their work, are used to dealing with confidential information. It would not hurt the tenants, if the person who filled in the application for a telephone happens to know that he was not married to his assumed wife. It would not harm him in his social life or in his local community. By placing the onus on people under whose control they must live month in and month out, you are interfering with their privacy in a way which can be harmful to them. Whether we like it or not, despite the laws we pass, if a caretaker of a block of flats does not like someone, he can get rid of him in one way or another and if he is shocked to find that Mr. Kruger and Mrs. Ponsonby-Smythe, who are living together as Mr. and Mrs. Kruger, are in fact not married, he could get rid of that person. Through official channels, through government sources, you could still get the same information. Therefore my suggestion is that we should rather seek the solution through all the official channels which today control every person&#x2019;s life. Radio licences, motor licences, all these things have to be renewed; they have to be recorded. These are all things which people require. One must have water and light. Many people must have a telephone. These are things they must have and therefore they must go to the specific source. That source can then supply the information easily; it is preferable to a business or private source with which the tenants are in almost daily contact. If this were done, not only could the population register be kept in some sort of order, but the voters&#x2019; roll as well. The original Act, <i>inter alia,</i> provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the person who consented to such residence shall &#x2026;</block>

<p>The proposed amendment to subsection (2) adds the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; within 14 days after the taking up of such residence, furnish the Secretary with the prescribed particulars &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now, in many cases that person who consented to such residence is not in a position to do so. It does not say &#x201C;or his agent&#x201D; or &#x201C;or her agent&#x201D;. It is the person who consented to such residence. If hon. members let their homes to come to Cape Town for <span class="col_2149-2150" refersTo="page_1088"/>the session, they have given their consent to the use of that house, but they do not handle it themselves. They are sitting here in Cape Town. It is handled by an estate agent. But we are placing the onus on the person who consented to such residence, which is in fact the owner, and not that person&#x2019;s representative. Who is the person who gives consent to somebody sentenced to imprisonment when such a person goes into prison? Is the officer commanding that prison the person who consented to his taking up residence in that prison? I give this as one of the many cases where there is not a person who consents. What about if one of these banned students moves from one house to another? If they move into a new house this cannot be notified because they cannot be quoted. Who is going to notify this? But let us take a more serious line. What about all your large institutions such as university residences, boarding schools and other large institutions? The same is going to apply there. I think we are chasing the wrong end of the stick in trying to solve the problem through this amendment. We cannot handle the existing documentation. We cannot handle the existing paper work in the department in respect of the register. And if we cannot handle what we have already, why now go and flood it with millions and millions more pieces of paper when those bits of paper are not going to give us the answer we are looking for? Until we have the population register working more or less smoothly and the basic record is there, let us not chase shares as to how we are going to alter things which are not yet there to be altered. I think we are being over-hasty and this clause should remain suspended as it is at the moment, until the department is in a position to receive this information. I suggest that we should then seek that information from official sources. We have other objections to the Bill, but I will leave that to my colleagues to deal with. I hope that perhaps I have given the hon. the Deputy Minister some food for thought in respect of this particular problem of notifying changes of address.</p>

<p>This afternoon the hon. member for Durban Point tried to put an alternative proposal to the House in connection with the notification that must take place, as he calls it, through official channels. If we turn our attention for just a moment to the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal, he himself will see how ridiculous it really is. The hon. member mentioned quite a few official channels, for example where a deposit must be paid for water and lights, telephones and so on, which means one would have to furnish the information at all these places. In other words, since according to the proposed amendment a person can be asked for his identity document by the home owner or his representative to determine whether he has given notice of his change of address, notice must now be given at three or four places. According to the hon. member&#x2019;s own argument &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, wait a moment. I shall now tell the hon. member why it will be necessary to make sure three times over, but then the hon. member contradicts himself. The hon. member specifically says he does not want other people to have these private documents for inspection. For example, a man by the name of Raw is living with a Mrs. Kruger, and that type of thing. Now he must go and give this same explanation three times over. In other words, he has three times the embarrassment. There are many blocks of flats in South Africa, and I can tell the hon. member that I shall return to the United Party members in the Christiana constituency and I shall tell them the hon. member for Durban Point regards the Christiana constituency as the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;.

We still remember how those hon. members spoke about the &#x201C;deep platteland&#x201D; last year, and then denied this again at a later stage. Sir, despite the thousands of residents and blocks of flats he spoke of, this hon. member for Durban Point does not even know that today there are hundreds of flats where one no longer pays water and electricity and that this is included in one&#x2019;s rent. In other words, one does not have to go and apply for electricity or water to be connected. There are also hundreds and thousands of people living in blocks of flats today who do not have telephones.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter whether they can get them or not, but there are people who do not have telephones. And they are not in the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;; they are in flats. The proposal about using official channels to find a solution for this matter is a smokescreen the hon. member is using, because the hon. member himself knows it is not possible in practice. Sir, in more serious vein, as far as we are concerned this is a very serious matter. I think we are all agreed that we would very much like to see a successful method found for the notification of changes of address.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. member and I did not understand each other a moment ago, but if the hon. member was speaking of subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 that are not in operation yet or have been suspended by the State President, he is correct. But I was referring to subsection (1) of section 10. Section 10(1) is in operation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Of course section 10(1) is relevant. Sir, how can hon. members now want to argue about subsections (2) and (3) without taking subsection (1) into consideration. Section 10(1) provides that a person must himself send his change of address to the department, of course. Now alternatives are being added in subsections (2) and (3).</p>

<p>We agree with that.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member may make his own speech. He does not need to glare at me like that. I say again: One cannot discuss subsections (2) and (3) in this proposed amendment without looking at subsection (1). Section 10(1) is the gist of the whole matter. The hon. member for Green Point stated this. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District must go and take a few hints from the hon. member for Green Point. Sir, perhaps Pietermaritzburg District is also in the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;; one never knows. Now the hon. member for Durban Point says we must not bring about changes to an Act that is not in operation yet. But the hon. member realizes that there are a quarter of a million Whites in South Africa who have already received their identity documents today. These provisions must come into operation some time or other. Those hon. members are always accusing us of being too late in the action we take. Now that we are too early, the hon. member is also annoyed.</p>

<p>But, Sir, let us look at the procedure we are proposing here. Throughout the world no better method can be found, for giving changes of address, than the method being proposed here. In other words, if the person himself does not report his change of address to the department, it is then the duty of the owner, whether of the house or the flat, or whatever the case may be. No better method can be found than that method of principle. Sir, there are practical problems one must take into consideration, and specifically for that reason these amendments are being proposed; that is why these alternatives are being offered to make it easier for the flat or home owner. The hon. member himself knows that the regulations prescribe what that owner must do. He must examine the person&#x2019;s identity document and satisfy himself that his change of address has been made known to the department. If that person has not informed the department of his change of address, the owner himself may do so, and after 14 days have elapsed he again gets an opportunity to do so. It is all being made as convenient as possible for the home owner. Sir, there is no other tried and tested method. Every country in the world that accepts this system of change of address, makes use of this method.</p>

</speech>

<p>Where?</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister will tell the hon. member exactly where it is done. The system is used, <i>inter alia,</i> in Switzerland; it is used in Holland and it is used in Belgium. The hon. member may go and ascertain this for himself. Sir, this is not a new principle we are now bringing before the House. We have various Acts, <i>inter alia,</i> the Hire Purchase Act, which also places such an obligation on the owner of a building. I cannot see why hon. members now actually have to bring up the whole principle of notification of change of address again when they should be speaking about the amendments that are being introduced here. Sir, I do not think it is necessary to go into the arguments of the <span class="col_2153-2154" refersTo="page_1090"/>hon. member for Durban Point any further, because the &#x201C;practical proposal&#x201D; he made is no practical proposal; it is a completely impractical and senseless proposal.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back for a moment to the hon. member for Green Point, who is now unfortunately absent. I take it he has a valid reason for not being here. I just want to refer briefly to the delegation problem, with respect to this Bill, to which the hon. member for Green Point referred. Sir, here it is a matter of the delegation of the powers which the Secretary for the Interior has. The hon. member for Green Point said scornfully that 20 years have passed and this matter has not been put right. The hon. member came and played politics here by saying that there are probably thousands of Bantu and other people who were unnecessarily prosecuted because of a document that is not even worth the paper it is written on. Sir, the basis of delegation exists in the existing Act; there is no question about that. The delegation, for which provision is made in the existing Act, is now merely being extended, in terms of this Bill, to the Director of the Bantu Reference Bureau. Let me explain the position to hon. members in these terms: The Secretary for the Interior could delegate his powers to the Director of the Bantu Reference Bureau, but in terms of this Act the Secretary had to name, individually, every person who works under the Director, and it is surely an impossible task for the Secretary for the Interior to know exactly what people there are, in the Department of Bantu Administration or under the Director, who are going to handle this matter. All that is now being done in this Bill is that it is specifically being determined that the Secretary&#x2019;s powers may also be delegated to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner, or whoever the official may be and that the latter himself, like the Secretary, has the power in his own department to delegate certain powers to certain officials.</p>

<p>Hon. members know that there are certain provisions according to which the Secretary for the Interior may delegate his powers. If a classification or a registration is made de novo, hon. members on that side know as well as I do what happens. The particulars are furnished by the person himself or by his father or mother. The hon. member for Green Point is now trying to play another political game by saying that a junior clerk can decide about the reclassification of a person. No, Sir, with all due respect that is not so. Reclassification can never be done by a junior clerk of a department. [Interjection.] The hon. member may go and read what the hon. member for Green Point said; he said it. Reclassification can only be done by the Secretary for the Interior, by the board or by the courts, and hon. members know it. Why is the hon. member for Green Point now making such a fuss about this matter? The hon. member is trying to make out here that the delegation of powers to the Director of the Bantu Reference Bureau and to officials in his department will give rise to dreadful anomalies, but what is the position? When a person comes to apply for reference documents, it is surely logical that he is applying of his own free will; he himself states that he is a Bantu and that he belongs to this or that ethnic group. What can go wrong there? If some or other irregularity takes place, it can be followed up. There is no problems in that connection. The same method is adopted in respect of the activities under the director as in the case of the activities under the Secretary for the Interior.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Green Point also tried to make out that we are being very unfair in clause 3, where we are dealing with the possession of two documents. Sir, when we read clause 3 we must also look at clause 1 and the definition of &#x201C;identity document&#x201D;, while in the past there was only a reference book in which the necessary identity information appeared, <span class="col_2155-2156" refersTo="page_1091"/>we have reached the stage where we must make an adjustment to the definition of &#x201C;identity document&#x201D; because these people are going to get citizenship certificates and because a citizenship certificate is not necessarily an identity document. That is the reason why we must now say that a reference book, and all the information contained in it, is also an identity document, which it has really been all along; its form is now merely changing slightly. I now come to clause 3. A person has an identity document that indicates that he is a Bantu or a member of a Bantu group; he obtains another identity document which he is not really entitled to. The problem of hon. members on that side is this: As the old section read, that person had to be in possession of both those documents to have committed an offence, but, Sir, that is a na&#x00EF;ve standpoint to adopt. If I want to get another identity document why would I keep the one I do not want? Surely I would desire to destroy that document: I would get rid of that document specifically because I want this other document, and that is our problem at this stage: People prefer a certain identity document and then they get rid of their real identity document; then recourse must be had to the register in order to determine what the position is. The Act provides that the person must be in possession of that document, and if he has got rid of it no action can be taken against him in terms of the old section. We shall now be able to check the particulars, and if we ascertain that certain particulars are correct and that the person is in possession of the document he was desirous of having, we can withdraw that document and issue him with another document so that he will not have two documents. The only question involved is whether he was in possession of that document or not. We should all like the person to possess only his correct identity document, but this we cannot bring about if the Act remains in its present form, and therefore it is essential for this amendment to be introduced.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>That is a very good question. Why does he want to? But that is irrelevant, Sir. The fact is that what is involved here is possession or something else. It is not a question of whether the person wants to or does not want to. That is not the question. The question of whether he wants to or not is decided when he applies for classification. There is a channel through which a person, if he has been classified and is dissatisfied with his classification, can apply for reclassification. Hon. members surely know this as well as I do. There is nothing strange or sinister in this connection. I cannot, under any circumstances, see the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2019;s proposal being acceptable to this side of the House in respect of this extremely important matter of the change of address, which has to do with our whole election system, our voters&#x2019; rolls and all related matters. In no way can we accept the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2019;s proposal in connection with official channels. I say it has no body, in contrast with the hon. member&#x2019;s anatomy. Secondly, as far as clause 3 is concerned, there is no reason why we should not also aim at the true object of the matter, i.e that a person should not have two identity documents but only one. Then there is no reason why we should run away and not also place an obligation on home owners and flat owners to bring that change of address to the attention of the department. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District will pro ably still be entering the debate this afternoon, and perhaps he can come to light with an alternative proposal that will be more acceptable than that of the hon. member for Durban Point. The hon. member for Green Point unfortunately made no proposals, but we are still waiting upon the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. Perhaps he can tell us something.</p>

<p>To give effect to what we are asked to do here, one must realize what has happened and what could happen. There is the question of reclassification and the powers of the Secretary. The Secretary has extraordinary powers in terms of this Act. He has more powers than the Minister. If hon. members have the Act in front of them, they will see that in terms of section 5(4) the Secretary has powers of reclassification which he can use. I should like to say that the Secretary and his predecessor have been exercising these powers with discretion. We welcome it that they can do that in special cases. When I am talking about the Secretary, I want to refer to the reclassification of people who are members of divided families. One finds cases where half the members of a family are classified as White and the other members are classified as Coloureds. When these cases have to be considered by the Secretary, he must use these powers and he has the discretionary power to alter such classifications.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister does not understand what I am talking about. When one deals with this Bill, one must realize what really happens if this delegated power is granted to the Secretary. When application is made for reclassification, the Secretary has to consider such application. We should not forget that in these cases we are dealing with people who have grown up under the supposition that they are living within the White group and that they themselves are Whites. Later they discover that they are not classified as members of that group. A young girl may wish to get married and she applies for her documents in order to get married. When those documents arrive, she finds that she is not qualified to enter into such marriage. These cases are referred to the Secretary for the Interior or to the Minister for his investigation.

<p>I do not know whether they ever had something to do with classification; I do not even know whether they are classified themselves. The position is that the Secretary, as was said by the hon. member for Christiana, cannot see every person who applies for classification and he is forced to delegate his powers. It was said jokingly that he could even delegate his powers down to the tea-boy. That is a very great danger. When you are dealing with a reclassification which affects a person&#x2019;s life, a person who has probably been brought up in a particular group but who has been classified as belonging to another group, you are dealing with a very important matter. The Act is so restricted that it is only the Secretary who has the power to alter a classification. We have strong objection to the Secretary being allowed to delegate his powers down to people who are not qualified.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know why hon. members are so worried about this legislation. That is the point and that is what we object to. We know that the Secretary will probably be careful about it, but the power is there and he cannot classify everybody. The delegation may go to a person who is unqualified and this may affect the whole of the person&#x2019;s life, the whole of his life hereafter. Once a person has been classified it is difficult to be re-classified as a member of another colour group. That is the point to which I object in this particular Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my noisy friends on the other side fail to see the implications of the amendment which is contained in clause 1 of this Bill. We are now being asked two things. One is to empower the Secretary to delegate authority to somebody who may redelegate that authority to a third person, possibly even to a fourth, a fifth or a sixth person. That is what we are being asked for here this afternoon, and that is the point that has been made by my hon. friend from Salt River, but that the hon. members on the other side cannot see it. Why do we object to this? We do it because we believe that the authority should remain with the Secretary, that the control of that authority should remain with him, so that at least the Secretary will know to whom he has delegated the authority to carry out certain actions, because the responsibility remains with him. The responsibility does not pass on as this authority is delegated, redelegated and re-redelegated. It is, as has been pointed out by the hon. member for Salt River, a very, very great responsibility. The future of the lives of people is dependent on this, namely, whether they are classified as White or Coloured, or whatever it may be. That is our point of objection. This whole amendment <span class="col_2161-2162" refersTo="page_1094"/>is compounded by the provisions of clause 6 of this Bill. Clause 6 makes it retrospective to 1953, that is 20 years ago. We are being asked now to justify <i>ex post facto,</i> errors which have been committed by the Government over the last 20 years. I submit that the hon. the Deputy Minister, in his introduction of the Bill, did not answer this question; he did not motivate this and he did not tell us why he wanted this made of retrospective effect for 20 years. That is the whole point. We are being asked for a blank cheque. The hon. the Deputy Minister referred to the reference bureau for the issue of identity documents to Bantu. I accept all that, but this does not only refer to those classifications, but it refers to the whole Act. It refers to all the powers the secretary has in terms of legislation, under all the sections and in particular section 5. He can delegate to someone to redelegate and redelegate. Where is it going to end? This is the whole point. The responsibility remains with the Secretary, but he does not know where it has gone. He does not know who is carrying out these powers. That is why we oppose this legislation.</p>

<p>No, it is not a case of seeing &#x201C;spoke&#x201D; at all. It is a case of watching the interests of the people of South Africa. I want to say that I do not believe that this is fair on the Secretary, because he is going to have the responsibility. What did we find with the Agliotti affair? That this authority had been delegated and redelegated to the point where the Secretary, the person concerned, did not know who had the power and in fact did not know who had signed certain documents but yet he had to carry the responsibility. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he believes this is fair on his Secretary. Is it fair on the Secretary of the Interior that he should not know who is carrying out his authority?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana made a long song and dance about clause 3 and referred to what the hon. member for Green Point had said. I want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that clause 3 is the only clause of this whole Bill that we accept. The hon. member for Green Point made that quite clear. I therefore do not know what the hon. member for Christiana was getting all excited about.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana referred to section 10(1) of the Act. I want to say here and now that section 10(1) of the Act is the only section that was accepted by us. We believe that the onus should be on the individual to notify his change of address. In fact the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that there are forty laws, regulations, byelaws and other provisions in this country requiring an individual to notify his change of address. But they have all failed and that is why the hon. the Deputy Minister has now come with a second amendment in the space of three years to try to get people to notify their changes of address.</p>

<p>Hon. members ask what suggestion I can make. I am going to refer those hon. members to the department concerned, the Department of the Interior, particularly to those who are concerned with the Book of Life. I want to say that we in South Africa have already devised the best scheme to get people to notify their changes of address and I am sure the department will confirm it to members on that side as well. That is the card which is now embodied in the Book of Life. I am sure that the hon. the Deputy Minister will confirm that the response which has been received from holders of the Book of Life, those who have sent this pre-addressed change of address card back has been phenomenal. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that instead of wasting the time of this House coming with this sort of amendment when in fact we are amending a provision of an Act which has been suspended or which has never been promulgated and which does not apply, he should be getting on and be issuing the Book of Life, because once those are all issued then, if the indications to date are to be accepted, we are going to find our difficulties regarding notification of changes of address very much alleviated and we are going to find the situation very much better than it is today. What is the position. Nobody can even apply for a Book of Life today, because the department cannot carry out the work it has now. But here the Deputy Minister is coming with an amendment which is going to create even more work for them in that department.</p>

<p>I really wanted to speak to the hon. the Deputy Minister in connection with clause <span class="col_2163-2164" refersTo="page_1095"/>4 of this particular Bill. Clause 4 amends section 19 of the Act. Section 19 raises certain presumptions. Clause 4 introduces a new presumption, namely that if a reference book under the Bantu Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents Act has been issued to any person, such person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have been notified on the date on which such reference book was so issued to him that he has been classified as a member of the ethnic group indicated in such reference book. In other words, when that Bantu receives his reference book in response to his application, it will specify the ethnic group to which he belongs. The presumption is thereby raised that he is in fact a member of that particular ethnic group and it is up to him to prove that he is not. That is all very well, but how does the responsible authority arrive at a decision with regard to the ethnic group to which one belongs? I ask that question in all seriousness: How do they arrive at the decision &#x2026;</p>

<p>It must be. How can the hon. member say that it is not pertinent to this matter? Of course it is! We are being asked to write a presumption into the law which shall be raised in every case under this Act, the presumption that a person is in fact a member of a certain ethnic group. They cannot tell me how they decide to which ethnic group he belongs. Section 5(5) of the Population Registration Act states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the application of this section and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">(d) a person shall be classified as a Bantu if his natural parents have been classified as Bantu.</block>

<p>That is fine; so far so good. However, there is no reference whatsoever to the different ethnic groups which can by proclamation be proclaimed by the State President and which have, in fact, been so proclaimed. Reading subsection (5) further, one finds that there is another group which is subdivided into subgroups, namely the Coloured people. It is specifically laid down in subsection (5)(f)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person whose natural father has been classified as a member of any ethnic or other group into which Coloured persons may be classified, shall be classified as a member of the group of which his father has been so classified as a member.</block>

<p>There is no such provision for the Bantu. I want to know how they decide to which ethnic group the Bantu man belongs, because&#x2014;and this is becoming more and more important as Government policy is carried out in this country&#x2014;certainly a Xhosa, a citizen of the Transkei, has far greater benefits than the citizen of KwaZulu has today.

<p>I shall reply to the last question of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District first. He asked what the prescribed steps are which have to be taken. Those steps are determined by means of regulations. A person must ensure that his registered address is the correct one. Those are the steps which have to be taken. A person must see to it that the address on his identity document, which the hon. member called the book of life, is the correct one. That is the obligation which is being placed on a person, which is what the hon. member is looking for. Those are the prescribed particulars.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The prescribed particulars are his name and identity number. Is the hon. member satisfied? Then I want to deal with the presumption. The hon. member had a long argument on presumptions, and on how the ethnic groupings would be made. This is a matter which is not relevant to this Bill at all. Let us see what is in fact relevant. The envisaged amendment in clause 4 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If a reference book has under the Bantu (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act, 1952 (Act No. 67 of 1952), been issued to any person, such person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have been notified &#x2026; that he has been classified as a member of the ethnic group indicated in such reference book &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now the hon. member wants to know how the ethnic grouping will take place. That has nothing whatsoever to do with this Bill. The clause refers to what has already taken place and to the ethnic groups indicated in his reference book. The issue here <span class="col_2167-2168" refersTo="page_1097"/>is not how ethnic classification takes place. As I have said it is indicated in the book and the person is aware of it or ought to be aware of it because it is given to him at his request. The person himself came forward to state to which group he belongs, and this is indicated in the reference book. Now the clause indicates that such person shall be deemed to be aware of this. That is all. He cannot subsequently state that he falls under another ethnic group. If he received his reference book with his ethnic grouping, he was aware of that. That is not unjust. What is unfair about that?</p>

<p>I could not quite make out what the tenor of the argument of the hon. member for Salt River was. I did understand that it dealt with the matter of delegation. I think another hon. member also has problems in this regard, and consequently I shall deal with that portion of the Bill immediately. What has happened here is the following: The head of the Bantu Reference Bureau distributed reference books to people who applied for a reference book. The head of the Bantu Reference Bureau and his subordinates did this. As people reached the age of 16 years they came to ask for reference books, and the reference books were issued to them. That reference book is also a document which is being used for this Population Registration Act. The Secretary has had the right to delegate since 1950. But how was it stated in the Act? I refer to the existing definition of Secretary&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; means the Secretary for the Interior and includes any person employed by the State or the holder of a post in the public service acting under a delegation from or under the control or direction of the Secretary for the Interior.</block>

<p>It is a delegation. What happens here was that the law advisors said: &#x201C;This delegation of yours should be a personal delegation. It should be your personal delegation, and as far as we were able to establish your personal delegation was given solely to the head of the Bantu Reference Burea.&#x201D; In other words, his further delegations were not made, and for that reason this provision is now being amended. In future reference books will continue to be issued in this way. Consequently it is necessary for the delegations to be made correctly. For that reason one amendment, i.e. the substitution of the words &#x201C;kragtens delegasie deur&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;in opdrag&#x201D; is being effected to the Afrikaans version only and two others to both the English and Afrikaans versions. The fully amended definition now reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; means the Secretary for the Interior and includes any person employed by the State or the holder of a post in the Public Service acting under a delegation from or under the control or direction of (a) the Secretary for the Interior; or (b) any person acting under a delegation from or under the direction of the Secretary for the Interior.</block>

<p>In other words, he is now granting the right to delegate on his behalf to the head of the Bantu Reference Bureau as well.</p>

<p>I come now to the point raised by the hon. member for Green Point. He apologized for having to leave the Chamber. In his Second Reading speech he told us that he could understand that if an error had been made it had to be rectified, but he wanted to know why we did not simply legalize all the actions of the officials. His objection was not concerned with the matter of delegation. His objection was concerned with our manner of legalizing matters. He wanted us to say that everything which had been done previously, from 1952 onwards, was now legal. There is no difference whatsoever if we were to do this as the hon. member for Green Point suggested, or if we do it as is being proposed in the Bill. I maintain that this method of ours is a far easier method, for we have to remedy the matter of delegation in any case as far as the future is concerned. Since one now has to remedy it as far as the future is concerned, one may as well remedy it in retrospect as well, in respect of the 20 years which have elapsed. So, we have now remedied this matter of delegation. That is all that this provision comprises. It comprises nothing more. When the hon. member for Salt River becomes concerned here about section 5(4), etc., it has nothing to do with this. The situation is still that the Secretary simply takes action, or someone acts directly under his delegation.</p>

<p>He has always been able to do that. The hon. member is simply conjuring up spectres now, as one of the hon. members here said.</p>

<p>Sir, my time is running out; I should also like to reply to the hon. member for Durban Point. I appreciate the attempt by the hon. member to make a constructive contribution. He mentioned certain things here which in his opinion should be applied. Sir, I do not think it is practical and I am now going to tell the hon. member why. But before I do that I want to cross swords with him in regard to one point. The hon. member said that subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 of the principal Act were being replaced by new subsections because they did not work. The hon. member knows as well as I do that those two subsections were not in operation for a very good reason. I know that the hon. member is always only too eager to make a little political capital out of matters. It is no use putting subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 into operation now for the simple reason that the identity documents have not been completed yet.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is a big difference between what the hon. member said, namely that the section would not work, and the actual position, namely that the section was not put into operation because a preliminary step had to be taken first. The section will definitely work; we believe that it will work. I want to agree with the hon. member for Durban Point that this clause is one of the most important clauses in regard to this new attempt to include people&#x2019;s names on the register. It is extremely important that people should furnish their change of address. I told the hon. member at the outset that I would welcome practical suggestions, for I have no doubt whatsoever that the Department of the Interior will definitely consider any really good suggestion, precisely because this aspect of the Act is one of the most important aspects. If we fail in this connection, then the entire system of registration of identity documents fails. Sir, hon. members know that section 10(1) is in operation. Section 10(1) provides that the person should himself, within 14 days, notify the Department of the Interior of his change of address, but we are now going a step further. We have received representations from the estate agents, and I shall come in a moment to what the hon. member for Durban Point said in regard to blocks of flats. I want to tell him that I grew up in the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;, but that in my constituency there are just as many big blocks of flats as there are in his. The estate agents approached us themselves and said: &#x201C;please, allow us, as soon as a person moves into a block of flats, to obtain the necessary information immediately and furnish it to the Secretary&#x201D;. This amendment is therefore being effected at request. Sir, let us see how it works in practice. I do not know how many people who are not married and who go under one surname are living in the constituency of the hon. member for Durban Point, but I want to tell him that it is absolutely essential for the sound operation of this Act that one should constantly be able to keep track of the movements of a person, whether he is married or not; it is absolutely essential. What happens when a person moves into a block of flats? The hon. member said that the person who consents to that can only be the owner. Sir, surely that is far from being the truth. The owner gives his consent if the agent gives his consent. The hon. member knows just as well as I that companies who appoint agents to rent their properties have no idea whatsoever of who is living in those flats, for the agent gives consent.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If that is accepted, then we will have this position: As soon as a person moves into a block of flats the owner or agent will immediately inform him: &#x201C;Sir, I am under a legal obligation to ascertain what your name and your identity number is.&#x201D; That information is then furnished to him; he simply sends it on to the Department of the Interior and the necessary entry is made in the register. The document of the person concerned is amended and returned to him. What more can you expect?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This applies to all whose particulars which have to be included in the person&#x2019;s identity document.</p>

<p><span class="col_2171-2172" refersTo="page_1099"/>Sir, I listened attentively to the suggestion made by the hon. member in regard to water, telephones and lights&#x2014;because it sounded to me like a practical suggestion&#x2014;which was that we should rather obtain this information from the departments. He has mentioned telephones, water and lights. There are many thousands of telephones which are being operated under the name of a previous subscriber. It usually takes a person one to two months before he has his previous telephone subscription cancelled and is allocated another telephone. We simply cannot do this. I do not think it is practical. Take water and lights. There one has the same position. The people have moved out of the house long ago, and only then did they cut it off. Therefore there is no absolute control. The very best control remains the person who is moving who has to inform you. Take radio licences. One licence is issued to one member of the family, but five members have radios. Those licences mean nothing in this respect. Take the university residences. I think this proves our side of the matter, that this is a very practical method. The moment a student arrives the residence warden writes his name down and this goes to the Department of the Interior and it is rectified in the identity documents. I am not wedded to this clause as such. I do not want to inform this House that this is the only method on earth whereby we are able to exercise control. I want to reiterate that any time when hon. members, inside this House or outside, go to the Department of the Interior with a better suggestion, it will be considered, for herein lies the essence of the whole matter.</p>

<p>In his Second Reading speech the hon. member for Green Point made a few statements. He discussed the position of the document, in terms of clause 3. He said that he did not think we should amend this Act as we want to do. Previously the position was that if a person has an identity document&#x2014;the Act read that if he was in possession of an identity document and was also in possession of an identity document on which the race of another person was indicated as being Bantu or otherwise&#x2014;the one document was returned. The law advisors have informed us once again that in this case a person must be in possession of both these identity documents. Now I want to give the hon. members a very practical example. What happens here is that a person receives a Bantu reference book. He throws it away for he receives a lot of advice from all his friends. He obtained the Bantu reference book from the one department. He then comes to the Department of the Interior with a lot of other things, many of which are not valid, and receives a Coloured identity card. Now he has two documents, but he throws the reference book away. It was not possible to call in that Coloured identity card in terms of section 15, for the simple reason that the interpretation of the law was that he should have been in possession of both documents. Now we are simply amending it in such a way that if he has the two documents, whether he has them in his possession or not, if they have been issued to him&#x2014;these are the words which are now being used, if they have been issued to a person&#x2014;then that person has to return the one. Then it is the one on which he is not indicated as being a Bantu. In other words, the one on which he is indicated as being a Bantu must remain in his possession.</p>
