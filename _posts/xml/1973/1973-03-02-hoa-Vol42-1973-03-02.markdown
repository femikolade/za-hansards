<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>During the Second Reading debate yesterday I asked the hon. the Minister whether there was not in fact some type of typographical error in the English version of clause 4, which amends section 10 of the principal Act. According to my interpretation there was no subsection (c) in the original Act although the amendment refers specifically in line 37 to adding subsection (c). I ask for some clarity in this respect.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I want to bring it to the hon. member&#x2019;s attention that it actually does not refer to section 10 but to section 9(l)(c) of the Act. If he reads it carefully, he will find that that is so.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can give us his assurance that he will consider amending clause 9 so as to make it quite clear that the publications which will have to be made from time to time, will appear not only in the <i>Government Gazette</i> but also in one Afrikaans and one English newspaper published or read in that magisterial area. I think it is very important that this should be done. I understand from the department that to amend this clause at the moment would be difficult, but perhaps the Minister can find ways and means of amending it in the Other Place.</p>

<p>It just means that where notices have to be published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> they should also be <span class="col_1797-1798" refersTo="page_0912"/>published in an English and an Afrikaans newspaper circulating in that area.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 13:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to refer the hon. the Minister to one aspect in regard to this clause. This is the clause which permits regulations to be made by the Minister after receiving a report from the committee. I have every confidence in the personnel of the committee but I submit that certain of the powers now being delegated by regulation might be far-reaching and could involve a great deal of expense. I refer specifically to the new subsection (3) on page 14 which says that the regulations under subsection (1)(d) may impose, in respect of a contravention thereof, financial obligations in connection with the repair or replacement of the means or equipment concerned. I do not believe there is any member of this Committee who has any objection to the provision as it stands. The point I wish to make is that regulations to be promulgated under this particular clause&#x2014;it applies also to subsequent clauses in the same Bill&#x2014;could involve industrialists and individuals in a great deal of expense. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister does not feel that it would be a safeguard to adopt a measure which applies in other pieces of legislation, i.e. that the regulations be promulgated for information in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and that a period of three months be allowed to elapse to enable interested parties to make recommendations on the basis of the proposed regulations. I feel that this may create a certain amount of delay but at the most it could not be more than six months. We have been waiting nearly eight years for some of the regulations to be promulgated, and I feel that a period of six to nine months is not excessive. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is prepared to accept this, and to investigate it, and if possible to make some provision for this in the Other Place, because as far as I am aware, there are two other clauses which deal with this specific matter in regard to the question of regulations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>This is a new provision and it empowers the Minister to make regulations concerning damage to vegetation established for the abatement of a dust nuisance or to equipment used in this connection. It is a general principle that when regulations are made a period of three months is always allowed for comment. Therefore I do not think the hon. member should have problems there. The reason why the Minister is being given the power to make regulations, and he probably agrees with me, is the present-day practice of eliminating delay. But it has become necessary to define and then to combat damage to vegetation, i.e. the cutting of grass and lucerne, etc., and even where the owner himself feels that he should remove it, he may cause a dust nuisance by doing so. I think we agree as far as that principle is concerned, but, in any case, we can consider introducing the three months&#x2019; notice if it is not specifically provided for here.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 15:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The point I want to raise in connection with clause 15 is this. The position in the present law is that if a notice is served by the appropriate officer on the owner of a vehicle which after examination is alleged to be emitting noxious fumes or gases, that person has to put the matter right but may appeal. Up to that point the amending Bill is the same but in the original Act, during the period while the appeal was being held, the person was permitted to use the vehicle. The purport of the amendment in the Bill before us is to eliminate the right of the person to use the vehicle while the appeal is being held. This point has been raised by commercial and industrial interests who feel that the provision in the original Act was a fair provision, bearing in mind also that in the case of the Bill before us the right of appeal has been reduced from 30 days, as in the original Act, to 14 days. I have no objection to that. The period for the appeal has been halved; the man now has to get a move on. He has the right to appeal within 14 days, but, the period thereafter, before the appeal is held, is not determined. It may be held up for various official reasons or administrative reasons; it is not determined; there is no fixed time in which the appeal must be held. Fourteen days is fixed for the time in which to appeal but no time is fixed for the hearing <span class="col_1799-1800" refersTo="page_0913"/>of the appeal, and during that period persons who may be involved could perhaps suffer heavy losses if indeed their vehicles are taken off the road. The only way that the present owner of such vehicle has of being able to use his vehicle, would be to carry out the terms of the order, but that is the very thing he is appealing against. He is appealing against the order of the officer concerned, and it may be that he will win his appeal. It does seem to me that there should be some flexibility in the matter and that while the appeal is being heard the person should be free to continue to use that vehicle. I do not want to move an amendment and I do not want to suggest that we vote for the retention of that particular provision, which is section 38(2) of the original Act. I want to bring this to the notice of the Minister. Perhaps he can tell us what the official attitude is. I want to say that commerce and industry are very disturbed about this provision because of the heavy financial obligations which could be laid upon some owners. Perhaps the Minister would be able to indicate whether it is possible, if not here then in the Other Place, to deal with the matter if it appears to the Minister that this is something which is just and equitable under the circumstances.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, so far we have not had any trouble in the sense that persons who perform these tasks have been unreasonable. The hon. member says that he agrees with the principle that we must try to limit these people. The hon. member has a practical problem, but I have a practical problem too. We do not want these vehicles which discharge excessive smoke to stay on the road. It is a practical principle. I may add that since we have no real control over the time lapse before an appeal is heard, he will agree with me &#x2026; In the first instance he did agree that we should shorten the period from 30 to 14 days.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is all right. Our only problem now is that the period before the appeal is heard is long. I shall look into the question of solving the hon. member&#x2019;s problem, but at the moment there is really nothing that we can do. We could do nothing under the existing Act or under the Bill to overcome that problem. The aspect which he has mentioned is something quite new, but I shall look into that. However, at the same time the hon. member must realize that even if it does entail a certain financial loss on the part of these people, we must err on the safe side because we want to protect the public&#x2014;we want to have our air clean. We might think along the lines of allowing the person, if the official concerned is satisfied, to keep his vehicle on the road for the period between the date on which the offence was committed and the date of the hearing of the appeal. Such a person will then have to consult the official concerned. We might think along those lines, to be a little more reasonable. I know that some of the industrial concerns are worried about this clause.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Minister for what he has said. If I heard him correctly, he has said that up to now they have had no difficulty about this clause. If that is so, it strengthens my argument, because the law on this subject is perfectly clear and if they have been operating under that law and they have had no difficulty &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member must remember that I said that there was not any appeal. Therefore there could not have been any objection and if there were objections, the people concerned did not appeal against the findings of the officials. That is what I am getting at.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then it is simple. For the odd case where an injustice might be done, let the hon. the Minister leave this provision in the Act. It hurts nobody because, as the hon. the Minister has just said, they are not getting appeals. However, there may be the odd appeal now and again where injustice would be done and therefore there should be some provision in the law to deal with it. It will hurt nobody. On the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own showing that would be a simple way out of the difficulty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is an increasing hazard. We must foresee certain developments. We know that during the past seven years we have not had the success which at the start we thought that we would have. Seeing that this is an increasing hazard and seeing that this provision has been included and also taking the fact into account that I am to a certain extent inclined to accept that the problems which the hon. member mentioned exist, I think that we must let it stand as it reads now. I am not prepared to change the wording at this moment. The hon. member has no worries about the decrease from 30 to 14 days.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 16:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause, too, deals with regulations, but in this instance regulations under the heading &#x201C;air pollution by fumes emitted by vehicles&#x201D;. It is not my intention to repeat the argument which I used under clause 13, but I merely wish to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that I believe here again is a case where he can give consideration to the suggestion that the regulations should be promulgated for the consideration of interested parties. I submit that the carrying out of the original section in relation to air pollution by fumes emitted by vehicles will be mainly in the hands of the local authorities and I do not believe that it would be feasible or practicable to institute regulations which many of the major local authorities might not be able to implement. It is for this reason that I appeal again to the hon. the Minister that when he considers the matter under clause 13, also to take into consideration the fact that clause 16 could be affected in the same way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Well, we may consider that too. I will consider all the instances where the hon. member expressed concern about the 90 days provision instead of the immediate enforcement of these regulations. I think we will make it a general principle that I will consider the specific problems the hon. member mentioned where we did not provide for that specifically as far as the regulations are concerned and where it is practically possible to come to terms with these people with the problems they are going to experience.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 21:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I did not want to take the discussion any further with the hon. the Minister just now when we were dealing with the previous clause. The Minister made the point that he wanted to deal even with the possibility of further pollution as a result of new developments taking place, the increase in traffic on the roads and so forth. Rather than arguing that I am in favour of a little pollution, even if it is not apparent at the moment, I am now reinforced in my desire to discuss with the Minister the provisions affecting the Railways in this clause. This is the clause which gives the Railways favourite treatment. Exactly what is the provision? We can forget the amendment. The amendment is merely to provide for certain standards which are prescribed and for an order instead of a decision in respect of noxious smoke fumes, and so on, and for these things to be dealt with in another manner. It is now being dealt with by means of an order from the local authority through the Minister. What matters is the position of the Railways. In the case of any other department, as shown in section 47 of the principal Act, the Minister for example has a colleague, Minister X in another department, where it is alleged that pollution is taking place, <span class="col_1803-1804" refersTo="page_0915"/>from smoke or what not. It may be the case for example on one of the sugar estates where they still run steam locomotives. It comes under the Department of Industries. The people concerned make a complaint to the Minister. The Minister takes it up with his colleague, Minister X, who is in charge of the Department of Industries, dealing with the noxious effluent coming from a steam locomotive on a sugar estate. This Minister pressurizes the other Minister. The people who made the complaint are the local authority. They have lodged their complaint with the proper quarter; they knew whom to go to. It is clearly set out that they have to go to the Minister of Health and ask him, on health grounds, to pressurize his colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, whose responsibility it will be to put pressure on the sugar estate to see that that nuisance is abated. The shunting engines bringing up sugar cane trucks can be dealt with but when it comes to the S.A.R. big steam locomotives standing alongside and taking transfer of the trucks to the sugar mill, then the Minister of Transport is treated differently. This Minister cannot pressurize the Minister of Transport; this is the problem and the point we want to make. It is more than a problem, because we are with the Minister when he says don&#x2019;t let us even let the little man and the possibility of future pollution pass unnoticed in this Bill. We are busy with the Bill now, and let us catch the little man who has a vehicle, a motor-car or a little truck, a &#x201C;bakkie&#x201D; which is emitting smoke. We have never had complaints in the past as far as appeals are concerned, but it might be that a man with a &#x201C;bakkie&#x201D; might want to appeal. We are not going to allow him to use the road until he has put that &#x201C;bakkie&#x201D; right. Now what about all the steam locomotives on the S.A. Railways? Why does the Minister of Transport get off lightly? I am not concerned with Mr. Ben Schoeman. I have had my difficulty with him and we are the best of friends today. He has met me in every respect and is spending R1&#x00BD; million on fixing up complaints I made here a few years ago. We are therefore great friends as I also am with anybody who agrees with me. The Minister has gone along with us and I agree with him on clause 38, that we must deal even with the possibility of pollution in future from the little &#x201C;bakkies&#x201D;. But what about the big locomotives of the S.A. Railways? Why does the Minister of Transport not get dealt with and pressurized by this Minister the same as all other Ministers in the Cabinet? There is not a clause here exempting the Prime Minister even. In regard to another matter, with which I will deal later on in the day arising out of the discussion yesterday, there are eight Cabinet Ministers involved with pollution. In reply to a question I put to the Prime Minister last year he furnished me with all the answers. This Minister who is the man dealing with the question of public health, is not concerned from whence the threat to public health comes, whether it comes from the private &#x201C;bakkie&#x201D;, whether it comes from a private company which has a steam locomotive or whether it comes from the S.A. Railways.</p>

<p>If is a threat to public health then this Minister as Minister of Health has that onerous load quite clearly on his shoulders. He must be able to pressurize the Minister of Transport in the same way as he can pressurize any one of those other seven Ministers. This is the only logical way that we believe you are really going to grapple with the root causes of the problem of pollution, particularly smoke pollution and that type of pollution which emanates from the consumption of coal by steam locomotives, and so forth. I therefore do come back to the Minister in regard to this clause and say that he must bring the Minister of Transport in under the provisions of clause 21(b) instead of putting him out not on the limb, but in a soft, easy, comfortable chair as in subsection (4). The fact of the matter is that with this provision in legislation which has now been on the Statute Book for seven years, if the Railways are to blame the local authority has had to write directly to the Minister of Transport. The Minister of Transport at the end of each year is supposed to prepare a schedule which he then submits to my friend, the Minister of Health, at the end of the year. In reply to a question yesterday the Minister said that they have never had any complaints handed to them by the Minister of Transport. This really surprises me when I think of the complaints that are voiced repeatedly in this House by the hon. member for Port Natal and others who have complained bitterly about the difficulty that arises from the emission of smoke in their constituencies in marshalling yards, and so forth, and also other complaints which I have heard repeatedly and which have been backed up by the local authorities concerned but <span class="col_1805-1806" refersTo="page_0916"/>which have led to no amelioration worthwhile talking about. The Minister of Transport is not even carrying out the provisions of the law. He is not putting those cases in a schedule and submitting them to the Minister of Health, because the Minister of Health says he has never had such a schedule. The Minister of Transport, he says, has never given him a schedule because he has never received a single complaint from any local authority in respect of a nuisance created by smoke or fume or dust from his steam locomotives. It is incredible; it can only mean one thing, namely, that the Minister of Transport is not complying even with the very small disciplines in the present law. He is becoming a law unto himself. We must come back to this all the time: The Minister of Health is going to be given our full support, and if he has to hammer big men as well as small, we are with him. One of the biggest men he must tackle&#x2014;and it may threaten his future in the political life in this country, which I am afraid I cannot help&#x2014;is Mr. Ben Schoeman, the Minister of Transport. That is the task that is facing him at the present time. He will have to give him a sedative or something of that sort beforehand so as to put him in an affable frame of mind before he tackles him, but tackle him he must if we are to convey to the public of South Africa the honest belief that the Government is sincere and honest in tackling this problem. If that is to be the case the same conditions that apply to every other Minister in the Cabinet must apply to the hon. the Minister of Transport.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">*Mr. S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; as one of the few members who originally served on the commission which drafted the Bill on atmospheric pollution which was eventually passed by this House, I can say that seven years ago the commission was under the impression that because of our geographical circumstances atmospheric pollution in South Africa was not yet of such an urgent nature as it had become in many other countries. It is a problem that is localized. I am now speaking in respect of what the hon. member said about the Railways. The fact that after seven years so little has been done in regard to the matter is further evidence of the fact that the matter is not yet so urgent and that it is of a local nature. The problem exists in ports such as Durban and Cape Town where there happen to be steamers and locomotives of the Railways as well. Now I want to point out to the hon. member that it is not so easy to tell the Railways to put an end to this practice all at once. The Railways are doing more than any other body today to combat the problem of pollution on the administrative level.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I did not suggest that; I suggested that this Minister should control the other Minister. I did not suggest that he should stop the trains from running.</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">*Mr. S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I just want to prove that the Minister is controlling himself, the Minister of Transport is launching a very intensive campaign in his own department in respect of the reduction of atmospheric pollution by the steam locomotives. The Railways employ inspectors and every year hundreds of drivers of steam locomotives are fined&#x2014;the hon. member may ask a question about this&#x2014;for not acting according to the regulations and allowing dark smoke to be emitted from the chimneys of the locomotives.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">*Mr. S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that it is a matter which will eventually right itself. The Minister of Transport has intimated that the steam locomotives in South Africa are going to disappear entirely within 15 years. So it is a problem of a temporary nature. In the meantime the department itself is controlling it to the best of its ability. When it comes to the public services the Railways have to render, we cannot step in so easily and say that they must immediately gain full control over the problem. In Cape Town, where for years you had electric buses running, you are today allowing electric buses to be replaced by hundreds of diesel buses which emit some of the most dangerous gases into the streets&#x2014;much more dangerous than the smoke emitted by the steam locomotives. Because it is a public service we have to tolerate it. For that reason we must also tolerate the power station in Cape Town, which is aggravating the problem. I want to tell the hon. member that while I fully sympathize <span class="col_1807-1808" refersTo="page_0917"/>with his point of view, and with the sense of justice that goes with it, the Minister cannot yield so easily here and treat the Railways in the same way as the ordinary man in the street.</p>

<p>Order! I just want to point out that the hon. members&#x2014;I have allowed both sides to do so&#x2014;have really been discussing the principal Act. The amendment that we have before us actually does not deal with the Railways. That is contained in the original Act. Therefore I cannot allow a discussion of that. I am sorry to &#x201C;pollute&#x201D; two very good speeches on both sides in this way, but hon. members must please confine themselves to the clause.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I said at the start, this was a measure which we have in section 47(4) of the present Act and therefore we cannot actually do anything about it now. The hon. member is pleading that I should control or pressurize the hon. Minister of Transport. It is not for the one Minister to pressurize the other; each one of us should do his own job as well as he can&#x2014;and for the rest we must co-ordinate. Provisions are made that the hon. the Minister of Transport can be called to account for any air pollution caused by the Railways, but as the hon. member for Parow has said, the Railways is a big concern and special factors do apply to them. It is a question of essential services and we must never be unreasonable in our claims against them.</p>

<p>We have the same provisions in regard to the dust control at the mine dumps. I do not want to elaborate on a measure that is not supposed to be discussed here, but I think that he hon. member&#x2019;s difficulties can be easily solved. I do not of course regard the chair that the Minister of Transport occupies as an easy chair. I must tell the hon. member that I think it is a difficult chair and I do not agree with him where he by implication is levelling an accusation at the hon. the Minister of Transport that he does not supply me with the reports that I must have each year. He must remember that the Act provides for complaints to be made by the local authority directly to the Minister, not to the officials. If we have members here who have complaints as far as pollution is concerned, and they know about that, the course for them is clear. They must bring it to the attention of the hon. the Minister and he is under a legal obligation to put all of that together in a schedule and the schedule must be tabled. Then we can discuss it here in Parliament and Parliament can pressurize the hon. the Minister. It is not for one Minister to pressurize another. At the same time I want to tell him in conclusion that this is a gradual process. We are learning from time to time and I am sure that the South African Railways are doing their utmost to aid us in combating air pollution as far as their operations are concerned. I conclude with that. The clause must stand as it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am naturally obeying your ruling and I am grateful for the little latitude that you have allowed with the hon. members who have followed me and myself. I want to come back to this Bill because I want to deal with the amendment to this clause. The hon. the Minister looks puzzled, but he must remember that he is the man who put in these amendments. What he is saving in his amendment is that the regulations are going to be the regulations which he will promulgate through the <i>Government Gazette.</i> If he will look at clause 9 of this Bill he will find that section 20, which is the one under which the notices have been given, has been amended so that the amended clause, which we have already passed, and I may just bring it to his notice, says:</p>

<block name="quote">A local authority may by order confirmed by the Minister after consultation with the committee, and promulgated &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is in the existing law and then in the place of the reference to bye-laws comes the Minister&#x2019;s insertion:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i></block>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last night I was talking about the shortages of personnel and the difficulties being experienced in filling the posts which are offered. I am also perturbed about the distribution of psychiatrists in the country today. If we look ahead and we realize what is going to happen in the very near future, I think we are going to find that in respect of the Bantu homelands particularly we are not going to have any psychiatrists going there at all, unless we can make provision for Bantu doctors to be given the facilities to enable them to become specialist psychiatrists. At the moment this is absolutely impossible in South Africa. The Natal University Medical School is not recognized as a school for specialist training. A Bantu can qualify at this school as a doctor, but there are no facilities there for him to get a specialist degree. That means that the chances of getting psychiatrists to go to the homelands are nil unless the Government opens its doors to allow the Bantu to get their training elsewhere. Where are they to get this training if not in Durban? They would have to go to the Witwatersrand University or to Stellenbosch or Cape Town to get their training there. I would urge the Minister to investigate this problem immediately so that we can overcome this difficulty that stares us in the face. If you do not do that, and if you are going to depend on the White psychiatrists to go to the Bantu homelands, then firstly it is doubtful whether you would get any to go there because of the facilities that are available there and, secondly, it is doubtful whether it would be a wise thing to take White psychiatrists from their present positions in the White areas, where there is such a shortage already, and put them into the Bantu homelands. Sir, here the hon. the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, have a problem on which they should take their decision immediately. We cannot allow this to go on any longer.</p>

<p>The other problems that face us are, in a way, almost as difficult to overcome. The training of White psychiatrists today is divided between the training that they get in provincial hospitals, in acute cases, and the training they get in the course of their visits to the mental hospitals which are run by the Government. We therefore have two types of centres at the present time that are available for teaching. The mental hospitals, as the hon. the Minister well knows, are situated far from the towns, and because of that we find that there is a lack of enthusiasm on the part of psychiatrists to go there in a part-time capacity. With the travelling that <span class="col_1811-1812" refersTo="page_0919"/>is involved and the breaking up of their own practices, it is not worth while for them to go there. It seems to me, therefore, that, particularly in acute cases, more and more mentally ill will have to be treated in the provincial hospitals, where they can not only receive treatment for mental illness but where they can at the same time get the associated treatment for other diseases that so often accompany mental ill-health. Sir, I do not know how the doctors have managed up to now to provide these services. As I said last night, it is quite amazing to me that it has been possible for them to do so. But I can see a breakdown occurring one of these days. There are too many people suffering from mental illness and too few doctors to treat them. When we talk about mental illness, I am sure that nearly all of us are forgetting the thousands of non-Whites who require treatment today. They are becoming chronic cases; they have to be kept. If these people are kept in their own homes, then it means that there must be somebody to look after them at home, and the whole home economic structure is destroyed by this. We simply have to find ways and means of getting more people to look after them in hospitals. We cannot afford not to allow any of the large Bantu hospitals to be used for the training of these people. I have said over and over again, when it comes to illness, that illness knows no bounds, and I plead with the Minister again to open the doors at Baragwanath Hospital to the Bantu for training. Because the Baragwanath Hospital happens to be associated with the Witwatersrand University, the doors of the hospital are closed to these people. They cannot get the opportunity to specialize there and, Sir, this has to be broken down immediately. If Stellenbosch University would agree&#x2014;and I urge them to do this&#x2014;to take Coloured doctors under their wing and to give them an opportunity to specialize at, say, Stikland, or even at Valkenberg, why should they not be allowed to do so? Sir, we got to break down this barrier which exists at the moment on the ground of colour. If the Minister can assure me that he has made plans already for this deficiency in our mental health teaching system to be remedied, then I will retract what I have said, but up to now I see no sign of any improvement. I can only see signs of deterioration in the present position. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who is sitting over there, knows quite well that in the very near future the Transkei is going to get the opportunity of looking after its own health services. Where are they going to get the staff from? I am not only talking about psychiatric or psychological shortages. It is not only that, but of the shortages right through the service. And it becomes accentuated when you find what is happening in this particular division of health which we are discussing.</p>

<p>I also want to say to the hon. the Minister that better provision must be made for out-patient services. I have taken out some figures. Some of them are contained in the report we received from Mr. Justice van Wyk. Out-patients&#x2019; clinical treatment has to be stimulated. In the Johannesburg General Hospital they have 22 sessions a week at the out-patients&#x2019; department, which is quite a lot, but at King Edward VII in Durban they only have two sessions a week to deal with those thousands of people. At Groote Schuur they have 22 500 out-patients treated, and again at King Edward they have 1 200, or one-twentieth. Why is that, and what is the Minister going to do to rectify the position? If our population is going to increase as it has been doing in the past few years, this possible 2 million patient estimate will multiply and we must be prepared to meet the position very rapidly.</p>

<p>Sir, with all the best intentions the Minister has come with a new Bill and I consider it a very good Bill. It has deficiencies but, as I said, we will discuss those in the Committee Stage; we have a few ideas about it. But basically it is a good Bill. However, it is going to take a tremendous number of trained people, specialist nurses, a bigger enrolment in the nursing services, to carry out the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<p>I just want to say finally that we on this side of the House will help the Minister to do the job he has undertaken in this matter. He must keep us informed. He must tell us what he would like us to help him with. I can give him the assurance that if he does that, he will get the full support of all of us on this side of the House.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Last night the hon. member for Rosettenville made very strong representations here with regard to mental health services. We appreciated the fact that he meant it so sincerely when he said that this legislation afforded us another opportunity of making a general survey of our mental health services and of whatever is associated therewith. I appreciate his attitude <span class="col_1813-1814" refersTo="page_0920"/>and the attitude of the Opposition in that they feel, along with us, that this Bill constitutes another step in the right direction in the development of our country, particularly in respect of health services. But unfortunately the hon. member for Rosettenville digressed a little from his theme by over-emphasizing too that as far as Bantu services were concerned, specialist training really ought to be the main thing. Sir, a few years ago I had the privilege of rendering health services in a neighbouring state. This neighbouring state has a population of approximately 5 million, and for that entire population of five million there is one White psychiatrist in the whole of the country, but nevertheless certain services are being rendered, and what is more, being rendered cheaply.</p>

<p>But I want to return to this legislation. If this legislation achieves nothing more than bringing us to realize anew that here we are dealing with a disease which is universal, which may affect any of us, then we have done very well and have progressed a long way. After all, everyone has the right to become ill, everyone has the right to become physically ill and similarly everyone has the right to become mentally ill. Where did we start? The Act of 1916 has been redrafted and it is fitting for us to reflect for a moment on the view taken by the general public of mental illness. I want to mention a few examples to make us see what the public&#x2019;s approach is. If I say to any one of my colleagues that he is mad, that is absolutely wrong and I am even liable to be assaulted. If I tell a person that he has taken leave of his senses, the same thing may happen to me. When a person shows some deviation from the normal mental condition and steps are taken to protect such a person and give him treatment, and it is necessary to afford protection to the people with whom such a person comes into contact, such a person is totally rejected in the public eye; it is said that he is mad. We speak in the same way about the place to which that person is sent. It is well known that if I say to one of my colleagues on either side of this House that my brother has gone to a mental institution, it is immediately thought of as something terrible. However, just as anyone of us may have a physical defect, it may happen that we may also suffer a mental defect. That is why I am pleased that this legislation is being discussed yet again. Our attitude towards mental defects must change completely.</p>

<p>This legislation affords us a fine opportunity of doing so. The legislation has been redrafted admirably, and I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his department and his legal draftsmen. In all the time that I have been in Parliament, this is the first Bill I have come across which reads like a story book. It is beautifully written and divided into clauses and chapters, and upon reading the introduction, one immediately realizes with what the Bill is concerned. There is nothing strange about this. It is concerned with the method and the procedure in connection with a person who is not healthy. There are provisions, <i>inter alia,</i> for the protection of a person who is not healthy and so on. There are provisions concerning the treatment and aftercare of such a person, etc. That is very important. This legislation brings us back to the present. As I have said, everyone regards it as something terrible when we speak of someone who shows some mental deviation. But similarly provision is also being made in this legislation for a certain procedure according to which particulars about a person&#x2019;s property, his treatment, etc., must be filled in. Now we see that this procedure, too, unfortunately amounts to a certification. If we go back in history, the Chief Whip will remember that prior to the 1948 election it was a matter of general discussion that one former hon. Minister was in possession of a certificate certifying that he was not insane. In politics that fact was exploited, because it implied that he had been in an institution for the mentally ill. Only last year during the American presidential election there was a candidate who had had some mental deviation. When it leaked out that he had been in an institution, it was all over for him. Another candidate simply had to be nominated. Today it is still a problem to protect that kind of person against the stigma which still attaches to this kind of illness and to the place to which such a person goes. This, of course, links up with the plea by the hon. member for Rosettenville that our mental health services must be community-orientated. It must form part of the community. This Bill affords us the opportunity of treating mentally ill patients in provincial hospitals and even at home. They may also be treated in clinics as out-patients. In this way we may gradually remove that stigma, because this is an illness.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville also spoke about the nursing staff and about <span class="col_1815-1816" refersTo="page_0921"/>psychiatrists. If we can have psychiatric services, mental health services, in our community and if the public can come to accept this illness as something to which anyone may fall prey, it may come about gradually that these services will draw more members of the public more readily and will attract more personnel at the same time. Not one of us would recommend nursing in a mental hospital to anyone. This is still the position. That is still our approach. If we can succeed in integrating these services with out community, I believe that we shall in fact be able to get psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatrically trained nurses capable of giving special treatment to the mentally ill.</p>

<p>Then there is another important aspect which has also been written into the legislation now, and that is the function of the psychologists. Psychologists are people who can help a person with some deviation, but not a functional deviation or illness, someone who has a disorder or who lives under tension&#x2014;as we find more and more today&#x2014;to analyse his problem and to stay on the right course. I believe that in America every millionaire, every wealthy person, appoints a personal psychologist with whom he discusses his problems once a week. In that way he retains his balance in life.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the Bill which refers to the findings of the Rumpff Report is that psychopaths are receiving proper attention. I must relate an anecdote at my own expense. Under the previous Act, I as a doctor could not simply certify someone with psychopathic tendencies, which might erupt at any time. I still remember the case clearly of a young man who was in my consulting rooms that day. I felt that this man was working up to a climax, but I just did not get the opportunity to climb in an say, &#x201C;Look, we must put this man away, because he is a danger either to other people or to himself.&#x201D; I was convinced, however, that there was something wrong with this man. Only the following day this young man, who had trouble with his girl-friend, took a dagger and stabbed himself in his heart in front of her. These are things which can happen, but fortunately provision is being made in this Bill for a doctor, when he suspects that such a person may be a danger either to himself or to someone else, to deliver that person to a police officer who may in turn deliver him to a magistrate to protect him against himself as well as to protect others.</p>

<p>We are pleased that the hon. the Minister has rewritten this Act. We appreciate the fact that we have this opportunity of bringing mental health to the attention of this House and the public once again. We must consider that mental health is a service which this department must provide to keep the public as healthy as possible, whether physically or mentally. Therefore I understand the hon. member for Rosettenville having such serious feelings about this matter. However, I also believe that if we were to debate malaria or malnutrition next week, he would be equally serious. That is as he should be.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with one short story concerning the change in our approach to mental health over the years. I still remember very clearly how we as students in psychiatry 30 years ago had to visit mental institutions. It was remarkable that when the professor was lecturing to us and explaining the lectures to us, it was an important aspect of a lecture on psychiatric patients to show and to demonstrate the so-called straitjacket to the students, because that was our approach 20 or 30 years ago, namely that when a person showed deviations, he was simply to be taken somewhere and confined. I just want to make one request to the hon. the Minister regarding my plea about our approached to mental health, and that is when&#x2014;I refer specifically to clause 24&#x2014;a magistrate has certified a person as being mentally ill, he may order such a person to be removed. The word &#x201C;removed&#x201D; is not good enough as far as I am concerned. I should like to ask the Minister whether we could not possibly say that this person should be &#x201C;transferred&#x201D;, or if we could not possibly use some other word. One does not &#x201C;remove&#x201D; a patient. One can transfer him from one place to another, but the word &#x201C;remove&#x201D; I regard as something impersonal in the sense that one removes a cupboard or a body or something material, but not a person and still less a patient. I want to conclude by congratulating the Minister and his department once again on the good and excellent way in which this Bill was presented to us.</p>

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just spoken, is a medical man and certainly knows what he is talking about. We are grateful to him for the examples he has given us with regard to mental illnesses, especially the stigma attached to them. If one thinks that, during <span class="col_1817-1818" refersTo="page_0922"/>a survey in Great Britain recently, it was found that approximately 14% of all adults suffered from one or other disability requiring psychological treatment, one realizes how prevalent it is.</p>

<p>There are two mental hospitals in Pietermaritzburg on account of which I am particularly interested in this Bill. I felt that it was high time that this Bill was introduced to consolidate the existing legislation. I am certain that the Bill will be welcomed throughout the Republic, as it is a very, very responsible move. It gives these unfortunate citizens protection both inside and outside of institutions. Probably the most alarming of all is the severe shortage of psychiatrists who are urgently required for this vital service. I refer especially to the shortage of these medicos in the Bantu areas where they should serve their own people. It would be very interesting to learn from the hon. the Minister what steps are being contemplated to train more psychiatrists of all race groups, as the matter is one of great urgency. Unfortunately I must admit that my own province, Natal, lags far behind in the field on account of lack of accommodation and of psychiatrists. I would like to refer to the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 28th February this year. The article concerned appears under the caption &#x201C;For many&#x2014;no hope&#x201D;. I quote from the article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why have the provincial authorities done so little in the provision of psyciatric services in Natal? For them to shelter behind the statement that the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Mental Disorders Act has only just been tabled in Parliament, makes scant sense according to a Durban psychiatrist. Nor does it really matter which clauses the Minister of Health accepts or rejects. What is needed is an easily available psychiatric service, not a shuffling of excuses, he said. If the report said the provinces should accept a large measure of responsibility for mental health, and if the other provinces had by their own initiative already done this, the Minister is hardly likely to turn the clock back and reverse the trend, said the psychiatrist.</block>

<block name="quote">Figures given in the report indicate how the other provinces have forged ahead. There is a marked variation in the psychiatric services provided in the various provincial general hospitals. For example, the General Hospital in Johannesburg provides 22 psychiatric outpatient sessions per week, whereas Addington Hospital in Durban has only two; Groot Schuur in Cape Town had more than 22 500 psychiatric out-patient attendances last year, and the figure for Addington ranges from about 1 000 to 2 000. The key to the matter of setting things right here lies in the provision of psychiatric beds in general hospitals, according to one Durban doctor.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Members of the small team of psychiatrists we now have in Durban&#x2014;six in number&#x2014;could then begin to get to grips with training newcomers to their specialty and ultimately building up an adequate supply,&#x201D; he said.</block>

<block name="quote">But the hospital would have to have teaching status, which implied an establishment comparable with Groote Schuur, and liaison with the Medical School of the University of Natal.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Only in this way,&#x201D; says a psychiatrist, &#x201C;will young, enthusiastic doctors move to Durban.&#x201D;</block>

<block name="quote">At present only the tip of the iceberg in psychiatry is being touched in Durban. The old, the poor, the depressed and the social misfits may, if they are lucky, be seen. Psychiatry, in fact, is a court of last resort instead of a first-line medical service which all of us might need from time to time. Shortage of psychiatrists hits many people of all ages hard.</block>

<p>That also applies to the Bantu hospitals for which the Government is responsible. Here I would like to point out that Edendale in Pietermaritzburg is quite near to the Fort Napier mental hospital. I take it that the King Edward hospital in Durban, which is near the university, could likewise be used to train psychiatrists.</p>

<p>The Bill provides for the treatment of patients as medical cases and removes that most gruesome practice of isolating mental patients in locked rooms under most degrading conditions. This type of detention is often brought to the notice of the Police when relatives hide mental afflicted members of their families to avoid the stigma from being brought to the notice of the public. In many such cases the victims could most likely have been cured under medical treatment. Here I wish to mention the report of the commission of inquiry. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1819-1820" refersTo="page_0923"/>The reasons which originally existed for not considering mentally ill persons to be suffering from an illness that can be treated and cured have disappeared and no sound reasons have been advanced for not placing the responsibility for the treatment of persons with mental illness in the hands of the staff of those institutions responsible for treating almost all other classes of illness.</block>

<p>A very welcome provision is the treatment of out-patients who are not detainees in institutions. The Police again welcome the provision that patients shall not be detained in police cells unless it is impossible to remove them immediately to institutions or places of safety. Cell accommodation is at a premium at most times and should not be used for this purpose as it would be most demoralizing to both the patients and relatives.</p>

<p>Another most pleasing proviso in the Bill is the prohibition on the signing of medical certificates by persons mentioned in clause 23. This prevents the possibility of unlawful detention of persons who are not certifiable and whom unscrupulous persons would like to put away for some ulterior motive. On the whole the Bill prevents the unlawful detention of patients, provides for medical care and the machinery for their discharge from institutions when they are entitled to their freedom.</p>

<p>I notice from the statistics in the annual reports that as far as mental health is concerned, there are many more male then female patients who are detained or treated in institutions throughout the Republic. Can the hon. the Minister give some explanation for this annual recurrence?</p>

<p>May I conclude by thanking all our superintendents, their medical staff, their personnel and nurses, both male and female, for the wonderful work they are doing in nursing these patients, a job that must be most trying at times.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City has pleaded here for better psychiatric services in Natal, and more particularly in respect of the provincial hospitals. The hon. member should really know that the provincial hospital services which are provided, are the responsibility of the United Party Provincial Council. I think that it is perhaps a favourable reflection on the Cape Provincial Administration that they have already incorporated psychiatric services to such a great extent in their provincial hospitals.</p>

<p>But the fact remains that we are living in a time when the demands of daily life on our intellectual abilities and our emotional stability are continually increasing. In short, in this time in which we are living, we must keep our wits about us in order to keep pace with the tempo of life. It is also a fact that the incidence of psychoses in developed countries and also in developing countries is considerably higher than among the more primitive peoples among whom mental defects are more common. The effectiveness of a service in respect of mental illness depends on various factors.</p>

<p>The first important factor in this respect is the availability of a sufficient number of trained, expert staff, a matter which was very strongly emphasized this morning. I should like to associate myself with that. But what is also of importance is the availability of facilities for diagnosis, care and after-care as far as mental illness is concerned. It is also necessary for us to have effective legislation to regulate affairs in connection with mental illness in this country. It is for that reason that I am particularly grateful that we have here a Bill which has not been drafted without circumspection. It is a Bill which has received very thorough consideration and in respect of which research has been done. I think this is indicative of the very high standards we in South Africa have set for ourselves in respect of all medical services.</p>

<p>In South Africa we had a commission of inquiry that drafted this legislation for us. But it is perhaps necessary to take a brief look at a few aspects of the history of mental illness in South Africa. Prior to 1910 each province had its own legislation in this regard and various and differing standards were applies. In 1909, at the time when the South Africa Act came into operation, mental health was placed under the control of the Department of the Interior, because at that time mental health was not considered to be a medical matter. As hon. members know, the provincial hospitals fell under the provinces in terms of section 85 of that Act. Now we have the position that after so many years the Van Wyk <span class="col_1821-1822" refersTo="page_0924"/>Commission has a totally new approach in this connection. They strongly advocate that mental health should again be placed under the aegis of the provincial administrations. It is interesting to know that the institutions for mental health were transferred to the Department of Health as late as 1944. As I have said, previously they fell under the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>These recommendations arose from another aspect as well, and that is the increase in knowledge which medical science has acquired in respect of mental health. For example, there has been the development of modern methods of treatment as well as the development of certain remedies, for example, the chloropromazins and the phenotiazones, which have made tremendous contributions to the treatment of mental defects. Also as a result of more effective treatment, we reached the stage where the discharge rate of patients from an institution for mental health compared very favourably with that of the general hospitals, and as a result of this, mental health services to an increasing extent fell into the scope of the normal general practice and also of the practising psychiatrist. But, Sir, mental illness could also be treated to an ever-increasing extent at out-patient clinics at the provincial hospitals, as has already been indicated. Psychiatry has also become an integral part of general medicine. Although this aspect possibly does not apply in practice in its full consequences, I think we are moving in the right direction. We cannot get away from the fact that also in normal organic conditions, the psyche plays a very important role. I should just like to refer to the fact that the Van Wyk Commission made a very specific recommendation in this connection. I refer you, Sir, to page 10 of the report, paragraph 2.9.7&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Psychiatric hospitals should not be established in isolation but should constitute integrated units of general hospitals.</block>

<block name="quote">It follows that inasmuch as the provincial administrations are responsible for general hospital services, they should also be entrusted with psychiatric hospital services.</block>

<p>Sir, we cannot comply with this overnight. It is a direction in which we are moving and we shall have to move in this direction to an ever greater extent in the future if we want to have justice done to psychiatric services in South Africa. We cannot get away from the fact that this direction will bring about better control and more effective treatment; it will eliminate overlapping; it will bring about savings in costs; it will lead to better co-ordination, and in addition to that, it will to a large extent bring about a change in approach in respect of the prejudice we have regarding mental illness, as has been mentioned here this morning.</p>

<p>There are a few principles on which this matter rests, and the first is that mental illness cannot be treated without regard being had to the patient&#x2019;s other health problems, and the second is that mental health should not be dealt with as a separate phenomenon. Sir, that also creates the need which I stated here a moment ago. Of course this also has the benefit that, should psychiatrists be integrated on the normal establishment of a general hospital, it will also have a very healthy effect on the students who must necessarily be prejudiced to a great extent because psychiatric institutions have existed as separate units up to now. This principle is very widely supported by a large variety of organizations in South Africa. I should also just like to mention, if we have regard to the fact that mental health in South Africa has already progressed a long way, in comparison with other African States, that we must not rest on our laurels, because the position in South Africa is not a completely happy one, because of these very problems I have mentioned here this morning. It is shocking to learn that at least 1% of the total population suffer from schizophrenia. One out of 10 people in South Africa seeks psychological or psychiatric help every year. Only 17% of the total number of psychiatrists in South Africa are in the service of the State. In the survey of psychiatric services provided in South Africa, we should like to pay tribute this morning to the work done by general practitioners in this connection in the past. They have made a particularly large contribution.</p>

<p>But there are also other shortcomings to which we shall have to give attention in the future, and one which this legislation is possibly not eliminating in its full consequences, is the very important aspect of after-care. At the moment quite a number of shortcomings still exist in the whole matter of after-care. There are too few posts and the readmittance rate at psychiatric <span class="col_1823-1824" refersTo="page_0925"/>institutions is too high. We still have a major shortage of workshops and facilities for labour therapy for people who are discharged from those institutions. Our voluntary organizations, that are doing such important work in South Africa, must spend virtually all their time on the maintenance of clinics while they could to a large extent be employed in helping with the aftercare of patients discharged from mental hospitals. Effective after-care has very many benefits. We must also realize that if we have effective after-care; patients may be discharged more readily and beds may be made available more readily to more acute cases. We should also have regard to the matter of higher productivity, particularly in the light of our manpower shortage in South Africa, and to the fact that when such people may be discharged sooner with proper after-care they may also take up their employment more quickly.</p>

<p>But the commission of inquiry also stressed another very important aspect in this regard. I should like to read from that report in connection with children. In other words, the commission came to the conclusion that since most psychiatric and psychological problems arose in childhood, the most effective preventive measures could be taken in childhood. I quote the following to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission wishes to emphasize very strongly that to achieve the best results, as far as mental health is concerned, more attention should ge given to the child, including the unborn child. Although some experts do not agree, others hold the view that in practically all cases, psycho-pathology is the result of experiences suffered by the child in the early formative years of its life.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) is of the opinion that the human environment is becoming degraded in so many different aspects that only a full and searching investigation by a tribunal consisting of experts will reveal the extent and imminence of the dangers facing South Africa; and</li>

<li>(b) accordingly calls upon the Government to consider the advisability of instituting such an investigation as a matter of urgency under a Minister charged with full responsibility and armed with all the powers he requires to take adequate steps to deal with such dangers.</li>

</ol>

<p>There is such a mass of material which is at hand with a very slight effort at research on the part of anybody interested, that one really wonders where one can properly start in debating a matter such as we have before us in this motion. We have to make a start somewhere and I should like, merely because it is a convenient point, to start by saying that we have had issued a report on pollution by the Department of Planning in 1972. I have the report entitled <i>Pollution</i> here and I think all members received it. I think that this is an excellent starting point and I want to say to the department through the hon. the Minister that I congratulate them. It is a small document, it is easy to handle and easy to read. It is a document for which you do not need a lot of scientific knowledge to be able to appreciate and understand. It is a document like this which can do so much to get people well informed in respect of matters on which there is a tremendous amount of confusion at the present time.</p>

<p>In addition to this document there has been issued by the Department of Planning a document which is headed <i>Besoedeling, 1971.</i> It is far more voluminous and unfortunately it is only in Afrikaans. It has been out now for some months, but we are still unable to get a translation of the document in English. Although it is headed <i>Besoedeling, 1971,</i> it was, in fact, only published in 1972. We should like to see that document in English. I myself have seen an Afrikaans copy; I have been through it. Here, in a sense, is set out much of the work and the fruits of the labour done by the various bodies, particularly the Prime Minister&#x2019;s special committee dealing with pollution and the protection of the environment.</p>

<p>I want to quote from the document entitled <i>Pollution</i> and I turn to page 1, the fifth paragraph down, where I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1825-1826" refersTo="page_0926"/>On 20 April, 1971, the Cabinet Committee passed a resolution approving the establishment of a Subsidiary Committee under the Planning Advisory Council of the Prime Minister to investigate and report on the matter.</block>

<p>That matter being really as stated in the second paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In overseas countries, in particular, emphasis is being laid on environmental conservation rather than on combating pollution.</block>

<p>Emphasis is being laid on environmental conservation. This subsidiary committee was appointed and in the pages of this report there is much reference to it and to the work it has done, first-class work. I repeat that this report is a very, very important document and a very valuable one. At page 13 of the report I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the immense wealth of useful information contained in the said report of the Subsidiary Committee &#x2026;</block>

<p>The one I have referred to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Council is of the opinion that a valuable purpose can be served by adapting the report and publishing it in a suitable form for general use.</block>

<p>I just pray for that. I do not know whether <i>Besoedeling,</i> 1971 claims to be that document.</p>

<p>The Minister says that it does not claim that and I could not believe that is was so. I do not think that this report, although it is recommended in this form in the first report that I quoted, has been put before the public in a form which is easy to handle. I believe it should be. There is an immense amount of valuable information available; there is an immense amount of confusion. So, having made those particular points, I would like to say that my resolution, in the form of the motion which I have moved today, could have been quite unnecessary if the subsidiary committee of the Planning Advisory Council of the Prime Minister as referred to in this report, had been able to get, what I would call an enforcement authority, to take hold of the recommendations which come and get down to the job of dealing with it.</p>

<p>Recently the Chambers of Commerce carried out an investigation amongst over 100 different classes of people, important firms, and so forth. They found that about 10% of the people were just not interested in pollution. Important firms and organizations were just not interested. It does not affect them yet. As the report they issued says, &#x201C;for them the red light is not yet shining&#x201D;. I wonder whether one of these days, owing to this lack of interest, based upon lack of information, a lack of perception and a failure to grasp the importance of what the world is facing, we will be able to put a tombstone over the bodies of the last surviving member of <i>homo sapiens,</i> together with all the other living creatures, having prepared it well beforehand. On that tombstone we will write &#x201C;We made plans to fight pollution&#x201D;. There they will lie in their grave.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We will write it all out beforehand. There are still plenty of <i>homo sapiens</i> walking about. Sir, this report, page 12, again points to the fact that in the field of scientific research there are no less than 380 scientific research projects being carried out in South Africa. Every one of them is dealing with some aspect of pollution in our environment. The report again comes to the point and says that only when we have adequately dealt with nuclear radiation which may cause biological damage can we consider radioactivity a form of environmental pollution which we should deal with.</p>

<p>I pointed out in another context that the picking up of empty milk bottles, old newspapers, etc., is really very important indeed. We must go ahead with it. But we have to go very much further than that. I have pointed out that the emissions from motor-cars, like smoke and fume, which can be seen, are very dangerous and should be dealt with, but the emissions which cannot be seen are perhaps even more dangerous. When we are dealing with radio-active material, which people do not understand or know about, and which they cannot see, you come to the situation depicted in a newspaper report I cut out the other day. Here I have <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 7th January 1973, with an article called <span class="col_1827-1828" refersTo="page_0927"/>&#x201C;Climax to the Horror of Thalidomide&#x2014;R40 million but it cannot buy back all those missing limbs&#x2019;&#x2019;. It is costing the people who put thalidomide on the market R40 million; it produced these unfortunate little creatures which we have to call human beings because they were born of human fathers and mothers but they were born with missing limbs and twisted bodies, little creatures, breathing, alive. But what is there about them that is human apart from the fact that they are descended from human beings? They are the product of a specific chemical element which was misused by people and it has cost that firm R40 million for one mistake. But what do we know about the effect it is going to have on our race as a race, biologically, which can produce thalidomide children in every respect but where we will not be able to identify the element which is responsible, because it may be the result of rays coming through polluted atmosphere which can change their characters. We know that it is so. We know that the pollution in our atmosphere today is changing the character of cosmic rays that are hitting our earth; we know that because we can see its effect already on some of our lower animals. Some of the literature today dealing with the effect on lower animals, the effect on them through the alteration of cosmic rays which are reaching the earth, makes most astounding reading. It is not only the air which is being polluted in that way by fumes. Here I want to say that in every aspect of our lives we are by the air we breathe, the earth we walk on, the food we eat, the means we have of travel, the clothes we wear, today exposed to pollution of some kind. Not so long ago we read in the newspapers of some unfortunate children who came into contact with certain material which killed them because that material had been in contact with a certain type of poison which had such a long-lasting effect that it actually killed the children who were associated with the particular garments which were made from that material. This is the kind of thing that is happening, but people do not know it. I felt a thrill of pride when the State President in his speech at the opening of Parliament gave the Minister of Planning a new title, namely Minister of Planning and the Environment. I felt we were making progress, because we now had a Minister and not a group of Ministers who would be the Minister of the Environment. My heart sank when the Minister of Health came along and introduced a Bill to deal with the question of pollution of the atmosphere. I then thought that this new Minister is the Minister of the Environment as long as it does not involve the air we breathe. Apart from that he is the Minister of the Environment in which we live. But I am still living in hope, because he as the Minister of the Environment has the very unsavoury task of starting to work on his colleagues until he becomes the number one man who is going to deal with the protection of the environment in all its aspects. Only then, as I am asking in my motion, will we be able to get right down and do something. We are planning, we have research projects, we are looking into this, we are investigating that, but I want to say in this regard that I was struck by a newspaper article in <i>The Cape Times&#x2014;</i>I hate quoting that paper, but I cannot help it; it is one of those things where I have to grasp the nettle sometimes&#x2014;of the 1st March, 1973. That is not very long ago. It sounds to me as if it was only yesterday.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Chief Whip is no doubt referring to the fact that I said I was prepared to grasp the nettle. Yes, I am prepared to grasp the nettle. The Chief Whip ought to know that by now. This article says: &#x201C;Six thousand flee their homes as killer gas escapes&#x201D;. What happened? A ship on its way to Australia with lethal gas in big containers found some of them were damaged in a storm, a round dozen. She puts into Auckland and they unload the gas from the 12 damaged containers and stored it for the night in the middle of Auckland. It is incredible and unbelievable that anybody who has gone further than Std. I and who is in a position of authority could permit something like that happening. Yet it happened only just the other day. The police and the local authority officials had to go out and clear all the homes round about of people because already at that stage, when they discovered what was happening, 350 people had to have treatment in hospital while 45 had become seriously ill and had to be detained&#x2014;all because of that one mistake. This gives me the peg on which I want to hang at any rate one part of the speech I am making today. As I say, how woefully short is our time to deal with these matters. In an issue of this kind, to whom do the people who first get to know of the catastrophe, go? One of the first <span class="col_1829-1830" refersTo="page_0928"/>things, in my opinion, that the Minister of Planning and the Environment should deal with, is to publicize the authorities who have to deal with the pollution of the environment. If it concerns pollution of the air and it has to go to the Minister of Health, well and good, but I do not believe it concerns the Minister of Health when you are dealing with complaints in respect of radio-active material. This is a matter which is far bigger than the scope of the Minister of Health although I may say in passing that every aspect of the pollution of the environment, whether it is pesticides in the soil or whatever it may be, affects the Minister of Health of course, for he is the man who will have to provide the hospital services to deal with the people when they reach the stage of requiring hospitalization. In the meantime the protection should come from the Minister of Planning and the Environment. Therefore I say we should know to whom the public should go. I would have found it difficult to know to whom to go under those circumstances described in the newspaper. I would have gone to the local authority. Do you realize what it meant to the local authority concerned when those 12 leaking drums of gas were stored in Auckland? They could not even send one single person to go and handle the gas. They could not attempt to do anything about it at all until such a person was clothed in proper clothing to protect him from being killed by the gas itself. Is that uniform, that type of clothing, that special equipment stored all over the place where it is easy to get at? Yet is is the kind of thing that can happen. I doubt very much whether we have a single municipality in South Africa which has the necessary kind of uniform, equipment and clothing which will permit men to go in and handle great drums of this type of chemical without endangering their own lives.</p>

<p>I am not going to elaborate on the question of oil pollution of our beaches and all that goes with it. That is a subject on its own. We could spend the whole day debating that subject because it has reached such enormous proportions. It is of such financial import to us that my mind is starting to boggle at the contemplation of the risks we are running in South Africa in this regard. May I say that the report from the Department of Planning and the Environment, headed <i>Pollution,</i> which I have referred to with approval, deals briefly with those matters. It is to the point and sets it all out very simply. I hope hon. members will spend some time in reading this report. All I want to say on the question of oil pollution is that the responsibility in this regard has been transferred from the Department of Economic Affairs to the hon. the Minister of Planning and the Environment, and also to the Department of Transport. Let me say that we on this side of the House are very pleased indeed to see that; we pleaded for it three years ago and are therefore very pleased indeed. In one of the very last letters I received from the Secretary for Industries, dated 22nd March, 1972&#x2014;only last year&#x2014;he said the following, and I believe that this is where the man finally threw his hand in:</p>

<block name="quote">The public and the Press &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is from the official letter from the Department of Industries:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; would seem to labour to a considerable degree under the mistaken belief that oil pollution can be combated effectively.</block>

<p>I think that is a pretty good start which has come from the Secretary of the Department which at the time was charged with the responsibility of combating pollution. What does he tell us? He tells us that the public and the Press seem to labour to a considerable degree under the mistaken belief that oil pollution can be combated effectively. In other words, the implication is that it cannot be combated effectively. This is the department that was in charge of it. Where do the ordinary man and woman, where does the member of Parliament go when the department says: &#x201C;You are wrong, you know; you have the wrong idea when you think that we can combat oil pollution. We cannot.&#x201D; He goes on, and I am not going to read all of it because I am short of time:</p>

<block name="quote">It may interest you to know that at the present stage the best equipped country in the world is not in the position to handle effectively oil spills of more than about 5 000 tons. This is a mere drop in the pail when one considers the size of giant oil tankers.</block>

<p>When I read this, I thought to myself that this poor chap has thrown his hand in, that he has just given it up, but it may be true <span class="col_1831-1832" refersTo="page_0929"/>and I believe it is true. I believe that in all fairness, quietly, objectively, the Secretary for Industry has put down there what is absolutely true. We are under the mistaken belief that oil spills can be dealt with. We believe that the richest and the biggest country in the world&#x2014;who would it be but the United States of America?&#x2014;could handle the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> disaster for example. He says that they cannot, as late as March last year, which is exactly a year ago, and if there have been any great steps forward then I am yet to hear of them. But I want to emphasize that we want to know to whom we can go to deal with pollution in its various forms, pollution of the air, sea, the rivers, the dams, the soil and every other aspect. We want to be able to know whether that pollution is taking place and here we need scientific guidance. That is why I ask for what is here called a tribunal. It is not a tribunal in the sense of three people; it is a tribunal in the sense of the special subsidiary committee referred to in this report which has done such good work, the subsidiary committee under the Planning Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister. That subsidiary committee can do the job. They are not all scientists, they have specialists in various disciplines and that is what we want. We want the widest possible spectrum provided for these folk, qualified, each in his own discipline, to have a look at the question and then come back to us and enunciate degrees of priority. This is the first thing South Africa has to spend money on and I emphasize that because all these things are going to cost money. Where does the money come from? Are we going to start arguing whether it is going to be Parliament, the provincial councils or the municipal councils and allow the pollution to go on raging through our atmosphere, through the sea waters which are today becoming more and more polluted, through our big dams or through our rivers? Do we allow the pollution to go on raging while we argue who is going to pay to take steps first to stop and then to redeem the position? This is where we want to know who is going to pay. We want it to be clearly set out in words of one syllable that the public shall understand. Then they know that they can take the complaint to so-and-so in regard to that kind of pollution, once they are able to recognize the pollution. They should know that the payment will follow such and such a line. Some years ago, in connection with the Water Act, we tried to get an enforcement agency. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to, in view of the statements that are made in this booklet, to tell us in his reply today&#x2014;and I am not dealing with the sea, but with our freshwater lakes, our rivers, our dams, our ponds and our fresh-water system&#x2014;who is the Minister who has charge of the research and the enforcement of our laws dealing with the pollution of those fresh waters in our country. Who is the Minister and to whom can we go if there is pollution in a river, a dam, a lake or in any of our fresh waters? To what Minister can we go with the sure knowledge, with the certainty that we are going to the right Minister who is charged with the responsibility of seeing that the law is enforced in regard to any transgressions in respect of pollution of those waters? Sir, it is vital that we should know this. We must know what the danger is and what danger is paramount. Radio-active fall-out a year ago was of little consequence in South Africa, but has it become of greater consequence? Is air pollution the most dangerous, and if so, where does this come from? From whence does it spring? Can we tackle that? Our money is going to be limited. The hon. the Minister of Health is going to have a thankless task, because he will have to go very carefully in the enforcement of the law which has now placed this power in his hands.</p>

<p>So that we may identify the pollution, may I say that I believe that there are certain practical steps to be followed, and I should like to recommend them to the hon. the Minister. The first is by legislation. Our laws are quite inadequate. Then there is research. I have pointed out that last year there were 380 research projects already under way in South Africa. Then there is education, and by this I mean education for adults, education for our children and education for people who must be specially trained to handle the enforcement of our anti-pollution laws, whatever field it may be in. It is no good hoping that we can just go into the streets and recruit people to go and enforce special laws dealing with the amelioration of the position and, if necessary, the prosecution of offenders who may be guilty of polluting our environment. Then, Sir, there is the question of the non-Whites. They need special treatment. It is no good sending into the highlands of Zululand a fellow with a M.A. or B.Sc. degree that he acquired at a university if he cannot speak their language and <span class="col_1833-1834" refersTo="page_0930"/>does not know anything about their customs. The first thing he will do is to put their backs up because of his approach in trying to get them to understand some of the dangers which affect them as much as they are affecting us. In dealing with the non-Whites, whether they are the Bantu, the Indians or the Coloured people&#x2014;and particularly do I speak on behalf of the Bantu&#x2014;I say that you have to have a psychological approach to make them willing to listen, so that they will be prepared to lend their aid, because they are part of our population here in South Africa. You cannot poison only the White population; you cannot have the environment of the White population polluted while the other folks go free; nor can we pollute their environment while we go free.</p>

<p>So, Sir, this is a vast subject, but with these few thoughts I would say to the Minister that I am glad that he now has the title of Minister of the Environment. I congratulate his department on this booklet. I ask him please to give us the other booklet referred to here, in handy booklet form, so that the public may be instructed. We want to know who is going to enforce the law and what is going to be done in regard to research, so as to show us which dangers have the top priority, so that we can grapple with those which are worst in the first instance.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened attentively to the hon. member for South Coast. In 1971 a very similar motion was introduced by the hon. member for Orange Grove, and last year a very similar motion was again introduced by the hon. member for South Coast. On both of these occasions we thought it fit not to introduce an amendment. I believe that there is no one on this side of the House who does not greatly appreciate the hon. member for South Coast and his people on the other side of the House, for the serious way in which they approach this matter. But for reasons which we shall try to give this afternoon, we have nevertheless thought it fit to move an amendment. We agree with most of the points mentioned by the hon. member, but despite that fact we have nevertheless thought it fit, for reasons we shall give, to move the following amendment this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) conscious of the dangers threatening the environment and the urgent necessity of combating the pollution thereof in its various forms; and</li>

<li>(b) mindful of the respective roles to be played in this connection by the public and the private sector,</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">welcomes the steps being taken by the Government in this regard&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that we appreciate everything said by the hon. member for South Coast, we nevertheless move this amendment because we on this side of the House should like to act somewhat more positively. Sir, there are other hon. members on this side who are going to participate in this debate and for that reason I do not intend to dwell on all aspects, but we on this side should like to express our appreciation towards the Government, for the reasons we shall mention later; thence this amendment. Sir, we have great appreciation for the work which is being done by the Committee on Environmental Conservation, which was established in 1972 and to which the hon. member for South Coast also referred. This committee is under the chairmanship of no less a person than the Secretary of this department, who, at the same time, is the Chairman of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Planning Advisory Council, as the hon. member said. We are very grateful for this committee which is constituted of representatives from all the important state and statutory bodies which are up against pollution problems. We are very grateful for the fact that we know that it is this very committee which reports directly to a Cabinet Committee, of which the hon. the Minister of Planning and the Environment is the Chairman. We therefore have the assurance that the information collected by this committee is reported directly to a Cabinet Committee, i.e. to the Government itself. Sir, this South African Committee on Environmental Conservation is of great value because information is passed to this committee by many very important and responsible bodies. The president of the C.S.I.R. is the chairman of the national work groups which perform certain tasks and subsequently supplies this committee with the necessary facts. Sir, our environmental problems cover a very wide field; they cover our soil, our water resources, the atmosphere, the sea and ultimately man himself. It goes without saying <span class="col_1835-1836" refersTo="page_0931"/>that many of these fields fall within the operational spheres of many of our departments of state and statutory bodies. We think, for example, of the Department of Planning and the Environment, the Department of Health, the Department of Water Affairs, the Department of Mines, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and statutory bodies such as the Atomic Energy Board, the Medical Research Council and the Fuel Research Board. All of these people, in one way or another, have the task of concerning themselves with the acquisition of knowledge in connection with these pollution problems to which the hon. member referred. This is the wide front on which our people are giving attention to these problems, ones we have already identified to a large extent, and finding solutions to them.</p>

<p>We want to contend ourselves by mentioning just a few examples. We want to refer to the Water Research Institute of the C.S.I.R. which is concerned with the purification and the reclamation of factory effluent. Only yesterday we had here at our office a man who is stationed at such a regional office in the Wester Cape where they see to the factory and other effluent in the Berg River and concern themselves with our sea areas, here at Strandfontein, and with various projects. In other words, we note with appreciation, and our people must note with appreciation, that we have identified the problem and are trying to do something about it. Then we have the atmospheric pollution group of the C.S.I.R. We do not want to say a great deal about that, because we know that this group, not only in the urban areas, but also where new industries are being established, is doing a gigantic job of work in this very regard. Our hearty thanks to the hon. the Minister and his department, as well as to the president of the C.S.I.R. for the visit the executives of the planning groups on both sides could pay the institute in Pretoria. I want to tell this House, and our people outside, that we were impressed by the work these people are doing, for example, with regard to the establishment of the third Iscor at Newcastle, in which case they eventually located these factors, after thorough research had been conducted, at a place where it could do the least damage, as regards atmospheric pollution, to man and his environment. In this century in which we are living we are also concerned in a division of aviation engineering. Since we have this other level of pollution, they are engaged in the question of aircraft noise at our airports. Surely we cannot let this pass unnoticed and not express our appreciation. Our Fuel Research Institute is engaged in the development of smokeless carbon, and our people must know this. Recently we saw the wonderful effect this kind of research can have on a metropolis such as London in respect of smog. There are parts of that metropolis in which smog, as we knew it there, has virtually disappeared. It is simply amazing. In other words, we concede that these problems exist but we move this amendment out of appreciation for what our people are doing about them.</p>

<p>Then we come to a totally different aspect, and that is the work done by our National Parks Board and other park boards in connection with the protection of our fauna and flora. We may have something more to say about that in a moment if time permits. Then, last but not least, time being short, we cannot but refer to what our Department of Agricultural Technical Services, under the guidance of these bodies to which we have just referred, is doing, and what they have already achieved in respect of conservation farming practices. No, Sir, we cannot allow these matters to pass unnoticed and not express our appreciation. During the visit to the C.S.I.R. last year the president joined our group at a late stage because on that day&#x2014;the hon. member also referred to it&#x2014;he had to attend a very important meeting on floating water plants, such as hyacinths in the Hartebeespoort Dam. We have identified this problem and our people are at present actively engaged in giving their attention to this kind of pollution. We have another water pollution problem in our peri-urban lakes, particularly in the region of the Witwatersrand. Another work group is essentially engaged&#x2014;I feel inclined to say engaged every day&#x2014;in dealing with that and they are doing everything in their power to find solutions. Will you allow me, Sir, to point out to this House what bodies are engaged in this? There is virtually no body which is not engaged in dealing with the problem of the pollution of inland waters. Engaged in this is the C.S.I.R. itself, the Department of Water Affairs, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, the Department of Health, the Department of Planning and the Environment, the Bureau of Standards, all the Provincial Administrations, the University of Natal, the Rand Afrikaans University, the University <span class="col_1837-1838" refersTo="page_0932"/>of the Orange Free State, the University of Port Elizabeth, the University of Potchefstroom, Rhodes University, the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Pretoria. In addition to all these bodies there is also the Water Research Commission of the Rand Water Board. What struck me on the occasion of that visit was the fact that the museums of Albany and Port Elizabeth had not been omitted. In other words, we are engaging everyone in this problem which we have identified and of which we have taken note. We have not only taken note, we are also giving it our attention.</p>

<p>There is another programme in respect of ecology. What are these people concerned with? These people are concerned on a totally different level. They are concerned with the conservation of threatened and rare animal species for posterity and therefore it is a privilege for me, as a much younger man, to convey our thanks to the hon. member for South Coast for what he has done in respect of this matter. If we think of the white rhinoceros which would almost have become extinct if it had not been for that hon. member, we must thank the hon. member most sincerely. Not only the white rhinoceros but all species of animals which are threatened with extinction are being protected in a scientific manner. Everything in our power is being done in this connection. I wonder if the hon. member will take it amiss of me if I refer to him and say that he saved the white rhinoceros because he himself can sometimes act like a white rhinoceros. Therefore we respect him and appreciate him. It was once my privilege to travel to Bremen on a ship on which there were four white rhinoceroses. The first group cost R10 000 apiece, and now they are already so numerous, the hon. member for South Coast has farmed so successfully, that they can now be bought at R5 000 apiece. In this motion we must express our thanks to all persons and bodies who have made these things possible.</p>

<p>There are also people who concern themselves with threatened and rare species of plant life. In these two respects we think of&#x2014;see the extent to which we already have co-ordination&#x2014;the Departments of Agricultural Technical Services and Forestry, the Parks Board and the Universities of Cape Town, Pretoria and Stellenbosch. Through the C.S.I.R. and by means of this programme in which they are engaged, they are giving attention to noxious plants, herbicides, insecticides and other related matters. I think we should really note with appreciation today the fact that in South Africa these problems are in the first place being identified by this department with all its related bodies and in the second place that attention is given to all the problems to find the necessary solution.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before the House adjourned for lunch, I was pointing out what had been done in this country over approximately the past 12 months with regard to all these problems which are being experienced in connection with pollution on the levels referred to, viz., the land, water resources, the atmosphere, the sea, and man himself. We tried to indicate that we are in full agreement with everything which had been said by the hon. member for South Coast. We felt however, that we wanted to avail ourselves of this opportunity to prove what had been done during the past year to cope with the problems which arose, in a meaningful and co-ordinate manner. I do not believe that I am exaggerating when I say that what has been done in respect of this matter in the past year is surely one of the most comprehensive national programmes which could ever have been launched in respect of this matter. That a great deal more could perhaps be done, we concede. With a view to the fact that we are contending here with a serious problem, we would like, by means of this amendment, to convey our sincere thanks to the Minister and all the related organizations which have given him meaningful support in the recent past and have made it possible for us to demonstrate to this House and to South Africa what has in fact been achieved. We trust that in the years ahead we shall continue to do the same.</p>

<speech by="#van_eck">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the Government side has broken with the old tradition of the past today by introducing an amendment on the question of pollution through the hon. member for Smithfield. There should not be any division of opinion in this House on matters as important as this one. The motion will in any event lapse, and we <span class="col_1839-1840" refersTo="page_0933"/>shall not have a division on it. I am therefore unable to understand the motive behind the amendment.</p>

<p>I am convinced that every hon. member in this House does believe that the standard and beauty of our environment is being impaired by modern civilization and by man. I am sure that every member in this House will agree that we must stand together and join hands in protecting our environment. I cannot believe that today, as in the past, there are still members in this House who will say that we are against progress when we plead for the combating of pollution and the protection of the environment. I cannot believe that there are still members who will say by way of interjection that we are against progress when we plead for a Ministry of Pollution, as we did in the past. Later we will not be able to grow and progress if we do not begin today with the control of pollution and the protection of the environment. There is enough evidence of serious pollution in the world around us as well as here in our own country. This excellent report, <i>Besoedeling, 1971,</i> points out that as far back as 1930 6 000 people in the Meuse Valley in Belgium were affected and took ill as a result of atmospheric pollution. Sixty of those people subsequently died. That did not have the necessary effect which one would have expected. We find that other countries in the world saw the example, i.e. 60 deaths, but that they did not take much notice of it, nor did they do much to combat similar incidents in their own countries. In this report there are two excellent examples of what still happened after that, which I wish to read to the House. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1948 42,9% of the total population of Donora in Pennsylvania were affected and the death toll was high as a result of a four-day temperature inversion which was caused by an anticyclone over a large part of the area. The unusual duration of these meteorological conditions led to abnormally high concentrations of air-polluting material, particularly in industrial regions. Donora, which is situated in a deep valley, was the area which was most seriously affected. Only when rain began to fall on the fourth day, did it clear up the smog to some extent and bring relief. Up till ten years after this occurrence the health of the inhabitants who had undergone this experience was investigated. It was then proved that the health records of many of those who had been affected during the 1948 episode, had been very unfavourable since then.</block>

<p>Their health still suffered because of it ten years after it had happened. There is also a second incident. I quote</p>

<block name="quote">In 1952 large parts of the British Isles were covered by a thick fog, coupled with a temperature inversion, for three days. During this period large numbers of people took ill in London and about 4 000 people succumbed as a result of intense atmospheric pollution.</block>

<p>That is the gravity and the extent of this matter. It is for that reason that this side of the House approaches this important matter with such seriousness. There is also the classic instance in Japan, in the small fishing community of Minamata, where the cats went mad and the people also began to die after a while. It happened in 1953 in the most southerly island in Japan, viz. Kyushu, when the cats began to pine away in the streets. They became sick and staggered around, while some died. Some fell into a coma, while others went mad. In December of that year the first people died of convulsions. Over the following eight years 43 people out of a population of about 10 000 died, while 68 people, most of them babies and children, suffered permanent impairment in an awful manner. Some of them were mentally affected, intellectually retarded, and some also sustained physical injuries. I am not even including the hundreds of people who were only temporarily affected and the others who possibly sustained pre-natal brain damage. The symptoms shown by these people were very strange indeed. First there was a loss of co-ordination, a kind of numbness of the limbs. Then there was also partial deafness and blindness. Some of them had involuntarily convulsions, some wept and screamed in an uncontrolled manner, after which they fell into a coma and died, just as the cats had died. The authorities did of course investigate the position immediately, but they could not determine the cause of this strange condition. Many thought that these people were suffering from a form of brain fever. After a few years&#x2019; search and research the cause was found, and it was found in the mud and slugde of Minamata Bay. They found that the sludge contained 2 100 parts of mercury per million, coming from the <span class="col_1841-1842" refersTo="page_0934"/>drainage sewers of a neighbouring factory. It was also found that the fishes and sea-life had been contaminated by mercury. This fishing community was to a great extent dependent for its food on the fish and sea-life which they caught. In spite of this warning in Japan and the example of the chemical and plastics industry which had caused the pollution, this still did not cause the authorities to wake up to reality and bring the importance of the matter to their attention. Barely four years later a similar tragedy was repeated in the small Japanese town of N&#x00FC;gata, where 28 people were seriously affected and five died. It takes a very long time to make governments, other authorities and the man in the street aware of the seriousness of problems of this type. In this instance the source was once again a plastics factory which polluted the sea with mercury via its sewers. These were merely the symptoms which could be measured and the people who could be counted. There are many of them who showed chronic and subclinical symptoms with effects which could not easily be detected and measured. Large numbers of children sustained permanent brain damage as result of this unpleasant experience. It is also known now that this type of poisoning can cause mutations in the cells of living organisms. These mutations can be brought about by damage to the chromosomes, which can even affect posterity, and there were also indications that a large number of deformed babies were born as a result of these disasters.</p>

<p>There are also other heavy metals which can cause poisoning of this nature, such as chrome, cadmium, selenium and lead. In Roman times lead poisoning was already a problem. The skeletons which they are now digging out in places such as Pompeii and Rome, particularly those of the richer classes, often show signs of lead poisoning. Even today the damage can be detected in the skeletons. This lead poisoning was sustained through the drinking water in their houses, in the fountains which the rich Romans so liked to have in their courtyards. They were mainly the ones who were affected by it. In order to operate these fountains, the ancient Romans laid lead piping to bring the water to their houses. Consequently large numbers of them died as a result of lead poisoning.</p>

<p>In spite of this age-old warning which has been clearly recorded in the annals of history, we find that lead poisoning is still a common occurrence today. This is found particularly in children living in old houses where a paint was used which contained lead a few years previously. It was fashionable to finish off the woodwork with white lead paint. Subsequently one finds children biting on the window-sills and taking in the lead in that way. Now and then such instances still occur. In spite of these repeated instances of lead poisoning, we find that this Government still allows the big petrol and oil companies to add tetra-ethyl lead to their petrol for no very important reason, as far as we can ascertain. The purpose behind the addition of the tetra-ethyl lead to the fuel is to reduce the engine knock. Apparently it does not affect the octane rating in any way. I myself have already seen petrol attendants affected by lead poisoning as a result of the fact that they are continually in contact with petrol fumes. There are also sub-clinical phenomena which could possibly affect these people. These are not easy to notice, and consequently I would like to ask the Government if they would not seriously investigate this matter with a view to ascertaining whether it would not be possible to forbid the addition of tetra-ethyl lead to fuel. As far as I can find out, there is no definite reason why it should be added. This is done for no reason connected with engineering nor for the manufacture of a high-octane rating. To me it seems that the only reason is to improve this knock property of petrol. The Standard Oil and Gulf Oil Companies in the United States say that if they gave up using tetra-ethyl lead it could possibly be more expensive to manufacture that fuel, but they admit that engines would in that case very probably last longer and that the wear and tear and maintenance costs of such a motor vehicle engine would be reduced. It has been determined in Britain, in places such as London, that the removal of the tetra-ethyl lead from petrol has enabled them to reduce the pollution of the air by lead by about 7%. That is still well below the danger zone and by this I do not wish to suggest that we are all very close now to the point of sustaining lead poisoning, but if the environment and the air which we breathe is gradually poisoned by lead, it means that we shall be able to tolerate so much less of those heavy metals if we should take them in from some other source. The point is that so many children play in playgrounds next to the expressways of our cities and in the little parks <span class="col_1843-1844" refersTo="page_0935"/>and lawns where this lead is slowly settling and accumulating in the form of a grey dust. Is it necessary for us to be instrumental in such an accumulation of lead in our environment? I would like to plead that this matter to be carefully investigated with a view to forbidding it.</p>

<p>Now we come to the point that there are thousands upon thousands of manufacturers, industrialists and companies, each of which is polluting the atmosphere in its own way, because of its activities, by means of its chimneys, sewers and refuse dumps. How is the Department of Planning going to investigate all those various industries? How can an inspectorate, with the limited manpower available, visit all those hundreds of industries and crawl into holes to ascertain the extent to which they are polluting the environment? Therefore I wish to suggest that the only practical way in which something like this can possibly be done, is by compelling such industries through legislation to send in, of their own accord, statements specifying the kind of pollution which their particular industry is guilty of. The engineers of such an industry are themselves aware of the kind of pollution which their chimneys cause and of the type of waste material which runs out of their sewers, because they can test it themselves and they should be obliged to fill in those forms themselves and send them to the departments which are responsible for and concerned with the matter. Such a system is already being applied in the United States. It is nothing new, and I feel that we could perhaps apply it very profitably here in South Africa as well. If such an industry should then make an incorrect return, the Minister must have the right to take that industry to court in terms of legislation. To me this seems to be one of the only practical methods for trying to cover this whole field of pollution. It will very greatly facilitate the task of the inspector. It will also facilitate to a tremendous extent the drafting of priorities and the isolation of those industries which are most guilty of polluting our environment. We on this side believe in the principle that each manufacturer should be held responsible for his own pollution and also, where possible, for combating it. Legislation requiring this return also fits in with that principle.</p>

<p>I would like to support further the motion by the hon. member for South Coast and ask for a separate ministry with its own department to combat pollution of the environment. There must be a permanent vigilance body which will be able to protect the three branches of pollution of the environment&#x2014;the air, the land and the sea. The department must have blanket powers and must be able to accost other departments if the action they take should perhaps not be positive enough. In the United States of America they have such an organization, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, with an administrator, Mr. William Doyle Ruckels-hause. President Nixon called him &#x201C;the enforcer&#x201D;. In common parlance he is known as the pollution policeman. I feel that it is essential that we in South Africa should have here a similar inspectorate which can take action in instances where there is serious pollution.</p>

<p>What is the position in South Africa today? We see that the protection of the environment has been bogged down in a number of committees, or that is how it appears to me. There is, firstly, the Department of Planning and the Environment under the hon. the Minister. Then there is a Cabinet Committee consisting of the Minister of Planning and the Environment, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Water Affairs; four Ministers are therefore serving on it in an attempt to co-ordinate matters. Then there is also the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Planning Advisory Council, which in turn has established an auxiliary committee on pollution, a committee consisting of 10 departments and eight other bodies. I just hope that they will be able to co-ordinate that complex organization of theirs properly in the future. To me it looks very much like the Tower of Babel, and we just hope that they will be able to function correctly in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although I cannot agree with the request contained in the motion moved by the hon. member for South Coast, I really think that he deserves credit for creating another opportunity to discuss this very urgent problem of pollution. We must also give the hon. member credit for his dedication in this respect. In spite of his age, he is still willing to put in much time and energy to protect what is worth while and beautiful in nature.</p>

<from><span class="col_1845-1846" refersTo="page_0936"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am coming to that aspect. If Parliament can succeed in holding out the hon. member for South Coast as an example to the general public and get more people interested, individually and collectively, I think we will really be making headway in this respect. Where the hon. member for South Coast fails, however, in his endeavours towards a wonderful ideal, is in the practicability of what he suggests. I agree with the hon. member for Smithfield and therefore heartily support his amendment, that the problem of pollution has already been identified and that the hon. the Minister concerned and his department are making headway to such an extent that it really deserves the gratitude of every person interested in this problem. We have already passed the stage where it is necessary to have a tribunal, as the hon. member for South Coast has suggested, a tribunal consisting of experts to investigate the dangers of pollution. We already have expert knowledge; we already have a Minister of the Environment, who is also the Minister of Planning, and this Minister and his department are dealing with this problem with the very able assistance of several committees, the committees and numerous experts referred to by the hon. member who has just spoken and the hon. member for Smith-field. I do not think that we here in this Assembly can regard ourselves as experts or try, as casually as we have today, to act as experts. We should really leave that to the people who are experts indeed. What we need now at this moment is to get the general public interested in supporting the efforts of the hon. the Minister and his department.</p>

<p>*In the past, when motions of this nature were discussed, the hon. member for South Coast even went as far as saying that there should be an individual Ministry with an individual Minister, who should even be sought outside Parliament, if necessary. This well-nigh puts me in mind of what the hon. member for Smithfield said this morning in affectionate reference to the hon. member for South Coast, when he spoke of him as a &#x201C;white rhinoceros&#x201D;. The idea the hon. member expressed here last year, in respect of the kind of man who must hold this office, makes me think that he wants a kind of white rhinoceros to charge people and bump them around. I believe it is a good thing we have a Minister who wants to persuade people and prevail upon them to co-operate for the sake of this big ideal. Therefore it is perhaps fitting for me to remind the hon. member for South Coast and the hon. member for Benoni, on this occasion, of the statement which the hon. the Prime Minister issued on 31st July last year when he brought about changes to the Cabinet. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because of the great importance I attach to planning, environment control and prevention of pollution, Mr. J. J. Loots will in future be able to give his full attention to these matters as Minister of Planning while retaining the responsibility for the Department of Statistics.</block>

<p>This is proof that this matter is regarded at the highes level as one of our foremost priorities. The problem we are faced with, and which we want to discuss today, not as experts, but in outline, is a world-wide problem. What bothers one is the fact that this problem is linked and closely related to the increase in the number of human beings, their progress and the creation of more pleasant possibilities of existence. Man, who has more intelligence than any living being in creation, is the creator of this particular problem. His conquest of the technological field, specifically, is aggravating this problem by the day. Therefore I say that we must make man aware that he must apply his intelligence, and not only his intelligence, but also discipline, in order to overcome this problem. Here in South Africa we are lucky, in a certain sense, in that we can learn from the adversity pollution has brought to other parts of the world, from the problems it has created, but also for solutions that have been found. Here there has already been reference to several countries, and those of us who have visited Britain are aware of all the things that have been put to work to overcome the problem. That is why I say we are lucky here in that we can learn from the problems that have cropped up elsewhere in the world, but also from successes that have been achieved, and we are also lucky in that we are at a stage of development where we can still intervene in time to ward off many of these problems. But since we are discussing this matter in the foremost assembly of the country, I think our actual task here at this level is to overcome this problem, to convince the general public of this problem as best we can and to convince them that success is eventually going to depend not only on the hon. the <span class="col_1847-1848" refersTo="page_0937"/>Minister and his department, but also on the co-operation of every member of the public. The message we can convey to the public is that everything that is worthwhile in life has a price, and progress also has a price. One of the prices is this problem of pollution. The second message we can bring the public is that the Creator in His wisdom intended that there should be order on earth, in our environment, order and balance, and if man&#x2014;the one with intelligence&#x2014;disturbs this, by whatever means, the price of that disturbance is a high one. Sir, the hon. member for Smith-field has referred here to the various forms of pollution that occur. I do not want to go into that any further. I just want to mention two, one which he perhaps did not mention. The one creating the most concern at present, as far as people are concerned, is the pollution of the oceans, the increase in tanker traffic that we are experiencing in this country in particular, because everyone must go round this southern tip; and if one sees the size of those ships, if one sees how they are being built bigger and bigger, and if one realizes that the sources of fuel for the generation of energy in the world today is still oil, to a large extent, one realizes that this transportation of oil across the oceans will only increase, and in particular here around our coasts. We are faced with the problem that we can do here what we can&#x2014;and a tremendous amount has been done here apart from the legislation that was passed the year before last&#x2014;but apart from what we can do, who controls a ship and its crew when it is way out there on the open sea, beyond the boundaries of any country, and when there is reckless conduct, and the ocean and the sea life there are polluted, and eventually also the coastlines of countries bordering on that sea? I mention this as one of the big problems which not only we, but also the world, are faced with. But, Sir, I also want to mention another problem, a form of pollution which will make it specifically difficult for the hon. the Minister to control it all in the way the hon. member for South Coast requests that it should be controlled, and that is the pollution of the human spirit throughout the world. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago a debate was conducted here in this House that arose from the pollution of the spirit of young people in this country. The hon. member for South Coast said we must prevent everything that pollutes the environment in which we live. One cannot touch spiritual pollution; one cannot point it out. But this is also part of the environment in which we must live. Therefore I want to advocate, since we are today appealing to the general public to stand together, that parents and other responsible people, the educators of our youth, must, in good time, guard against the spirit of our young people becoming polluted, otherwise we shall also have to pay a price for that.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe that with a view to the co-operation of each individual and the co-operation of communities, we shall also in future have to obtain the co-operation of schools, of service organizations, of industrial organizations, agricultural organizations and even voluntary organizations, such as the one established here last year in the Boland, i.e. the &#x201C;Association for the Protection of the Environment&#x201D;, which itself acts as a watchdog to call the attention of the relevant authorities to things that go wrong. I also believe that we should, in particular, make use of our communications media, the Press, radio and future television, to bring this extremely important problem home to our general public.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself wholeheartedly with the tribute paid by the hon. member for Stellenbosch to the hon. member for South Coast for the part which he played in presenting this motion. The motion moved by the hon. member for South Coast deals, firstly, with the human environment as it is to be found in South Africa, and, secondly, it makes an appeal to the Government to take urgent steps to transfer the fullest responsibility to a particular and separate Minister of this House so that he can fulfil his task realistically and effectively. Sir, pollution in one form or another is a centuries-old problem. The fact of the matter is that the pollution which the world is today experiencing began with Adam and Eve. I want to emphasize that pollution goes hand in hand with our population explosion. Even though this serious problem has always been with us, it has now become a problem of great consequence to our civilization. It is clearly a problem which we may no longer ignore. Let me explain at once that I am fully aware of the excellent work which has already been done by our own Department of Planning. I want to pay tribute to them for the two publications which were recently issued, namely <i>Besoedeling, 1971</i> and <i>Pollution in South Africa, 1972.</i> <span class="col_1849-1850" refersTo="page_0938"/>These two publications do much to train the spotlight on various facets of this problem, but my specific question is whether the Government has progressed far enough and rapidly enough in its attempts to tackle this matter effectively. We may well ask how much time we still have available to cope with this urgent problem before the vital factor of costs delays our intentions.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, the scene for this motion was set by the hon. Dr. Connie Mulder when he as Minister of Planning in a foreword which he wrote to a splendid exposition, completely non-political and factual, to &#x201C;Population Explosion and Pollution in Southern Africa&#x201D;. He said then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Man is populating the earth at an astounding rate. At the same time he is busy polluting the earth, his only home, at an equally astounding rate. It has finally dawned on us that if dealing with the problem of pollution is left too late, then all our economic and political achievements will be swept away like castles before the advancing tide.</block>

<p>Sir, it is a well-known fact that man is the dirtiest animal on earth, and in order to indicate the real sense of urgency which motivates the resolution before the House today, I want to refer briefly to certain observations contained in Dr. Nick van Rensburg&#x2019;s &#x201C;Population Explosion and its twin-brother Pollution&#x201D;. I wonder whether it is generally realized that if we accept our present population and growth figures, we must accept that the total population of South Africa has increased more than fourfold in the last 66 years. The total population&#x2019;s annual rate of increase between the years 1960 and 1970 was 3,4%. At that rate we shall redouble our population in the next 20 years, and should this growth be sustained the figures in a projection for South Africa are as follows: In 1990, 44 million; in 2010, 88 million; in the year 2030, 176 million; in the year 2050, 352 million; and in the year 2070, 704 million. These figures defy the imagination, but they are nevertheless realistic and are not culled from political speeches, but from statistics which are completely cold and calculated. It is figures like these which have led to the comment that there is no point in industrialized nations philosophizing about a better way of life in this world, about a better quality of life expanding nations, unless this explosion in population and the rate of pollution can be contained. We know that developing populations call for wider roads, more and more motor-cars, larger power stations and all that these mean, for faster aeroplanes and all that these mean in pollution of the atmosphere, more and more pesticides to ensure that we have larger and greater bumper crops&#x2014;all this in a world which is shrinking all the time. The implications are: More pollution, fouler air, more hideous rubbish dumps, noise which is becoming unbearable and intolerable, less pure oceans, less pure drinking water and bodies which have become polluted and poisoned with the intake of pollution.</p>

<p>It is only during the last decade that we in South Africa have realized that air pollution is, in fact, an urgent problem and today motorists approaching Johannesburg on a still winter&#x2019;s morning are conscious of what a polluted atmosphere or polluted city looks like. The Iscor works on a still morning can no longer be seen from the Union Buildings. What can be seen are never-ending smoke clouds billowing from the steelworks, blanketing almost the whole of Pretoria in thick, musty smoke. In Cape Town the thick pall of grey smoke which today hangs over our mother city is worse than anything that one will see in Europe. Can we continue to tolerate these twin towers of pollution, whether the boilers have been converted or not? Can this monstrosity be left in Cape Town, the mother city of South Africa? Port Elizabeth is not without its pollution and I quote briefly from a comment in <i>Commercial Opinion,</i> the journal of the Chamber of Commerce in which a contributor says:</p>

<block name="quote">I took my grandson to a children&#x2019;s park in Newton Park, five miles from the city centre. The muck and pollution was terrible. Corners have been used as toilets and near one fence a dead dog was lying, skin and bones, with open mouth full of flies.</block>

<p>Small wonder then that the hon. member for South Coast is today calling in his motion for a strong Minister, a pollution policeman. Yes, what we require today is a pollution policeman with powers to enforce strong laws, laws with teeth and which make provision for penalties which are both effective and realistic. We have to face up to the basic economic problem of protecting the environment. We have to realize that effective protection of the environment <span class="col_1851-1852" refersTo="page_0939"/>may limit in some way or another the growth of our material wealth. But, Sir, if we are to avoid the by-products of a rapid population growth, namely poverty, hunger, illness, ignorance, frustration and want, then we will have to plan today for a population that will number over 50 million by the year 2000. We must not leave, as a heritage to our children, a world that can be described as &#x201C;this dirty world, this ugly world&#x201D;, a world in which the assaults on our senses are borne out by pollution.</p>

<p>To bring the position just a bit nearer home. In terms of the Johannesburg city area, excluding Soweto, a further 32 similar sized cities will be required to accommodate the increased population in South Africa by the year 2000. This massing of populations in cities is the largest single cause of pollution. There is the difficulty of getting rid of garbage and waste in these cities, and it has been said that in due course man will bury himself under his own garbage. Sewage is becoming a growing source of pollution and lakes and rivers throughout the world are becoming hopelessly polluted. In order to stress the seriousness and urgency of the situation, I want to make the point that today the river Rhine is the largest open sewer in the world. I want to make the point that nothing lives any more in the river Seine South of Paris. The once flourishing sardine industry in the mouth of the river Nile has long since peted out. The city of New York dumps daily more than 200 million gallons of sewerage into the Hudson River. The Swiss Lakes of Zurich and Geneva are today biologically dead, and Lake Eirie, between the United States and Canada, is not only biologically stone-dead&#x2014;its waters are poisonous to human beings. Now, Sir, even our lakes, vleis and rivers in South Africa are becoming polluted. What is more, the sea is becoming rapidly polluted, and in our cities noise is becoming a major threat to peace and health of every inhabitant. The time has come for man to be brought to the realization that this pollution and ruination of the environment cannot go on indefinitely. The earth, after all, is finite. With the exception of a few kilograms of rock brought back from the moon, man has not yet succeeded in increasing the surface area of the earth by one square inch. There is a sense of urgency about this which is expressed today in the motion before the House. The twin evils of environmental pollution and over-population are leading to malnutrition, undernourishment and poverty. So, Sir, we have the vicious cycle of uncontrolled pollution of air, water and other sources, which is again leading to a deterioration of our cities and their degeneration into slums. This vicious circle is forcing mankind to reflect, to come to its senses and to come to the realization that the time has come when we must act.</p>

<p>It is for these reasons therefore that I support this resolution wholeheartedly and hope that the Government benches will realize that in the resolution there is nothing political. It is merely a desire to create a pollution policeman who will protest us from ourselves.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with further reference to the last statement made by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, namely that the motion introduced here by the hon. member for South Coast has no political motive, I should nevertheless like to point out that the hon. member for Benoni did in fact try in the course of his speech to bring in certain political overtones. If I do the same, namely to refer to certain political arguments about this question, I do not apologize to the Opposition for that approach.</p>

<p>We can go on for hours telling each other about the dangers of pollution and we can paint very gruesome pictures to each other of a world which will be uninhabitable by 1990, of a world population which will have to wear gas-masks. We can try to scare each other with statistics in respect of overpopulation, such as the fact that three new hearts begin to beat every second. We can keep each other occupied until late by quoting statistics of millions of fish which die daily as a result of pollution. In the last place we can also take a look at agriculture and tell ourselves that if we do not stop sending plastic material into the world immediately, we are going to lose tons of beef every day and every year.</p>

<p>But an approach such as this will bring us nowhere. I wish to suggest that the hon. member for Benoni and the hon. member for South Coast attempt to fall in with the pattern of thought of this side of the House, and that pattern is that we have identified the problem and that we are now ready for action. That side of the House has up till now given no indication that they are aware of the fact that this hon. Minister has declared war against pollution <span class="col_1853-1854" refersTo="page_0940"/>of the environment. Only yesterday we discussed legislation, to which I do not wish to refer any further, which indicates that the Government is in the process of giving local authorities the teeth to contend with this matter. Therefore I wish to say to hon. members opposite that if I do talk politics later, they must kindly reply to me. It is very clear from what was said here by the hon. member for Smithfield that the machinery which has been established by the Government is adequate to deal with the problem. It is also very clear from this report which was referred to namely the report of 2nd March, 1972, on pollution, that action will also be taken on other levels of government, namely by local authorities and provincial authorities. They will be expected to implement or improve existing legislation, and then we have in mind the field of noise and air pollution in particular. In the last instance, while we are dealing with the public sector, we must consider whether the public sector has adequate machinery to hear complaints from group interests or from people who would allegedly suffer damage in the event of pollution or of the environment being affected. Therefore I want to put it for the consideration of the Minister that the time will arrive when the need may arise for a regulating authority within the framework of his department in one or other which can see to it that certain norms are laid down for, for example, damages and that certain norms be laid down for, for example, action against certain bodies who in spite of warnings by the Minister still do the opposite.</p>

<p>I just want to refer in passing&#x2014;not in this particular connection&#x2014;to our unsightly gravel quarries, and so on. These are all things which can be rectified by negotiations. Consequently I foresee that the need will eventually arise for such an umbrella body which would be able to handle such matters. The public sector has identified its task, but can the same be said for the private sector? I want to suggest that the time has come for the hon. the Minister to give us an indication of the extent to which the private sector has an essential function to fulfil.</p>

<p>It is true that in this country growth is of the utmost importance. The problem is, however, that there is a certain cost factor attached to growth which has not yet been reflected in the income and expenditure accounts of industrialists and other companies. What I mean by that is that, if companies are concentrated to an increasing extent in certain areas, if the plans of industrialists lead to congestion, we may get traffic congestion, pollution of the atmosphere and socially maladjusted people as a result of a shortage of living space. Therefore I wish to say to the hon. members on the other side of the House, and to the hon. member for Benoni in particular&#x2014;and here the political side of the matter becomes relevant&#x2014;that, if the other side of the House is serious about the fight against pollution, it would be a cornerstone for the total attack which we are going to launch on pollution if they should decide to propagate a decentralization programme together with this side of the House, at all times, with all industrialists.</p>

<p>We do not come to know about it. We have never heard that side of the House make a case for industrialists to decentralize. Last year in June/July a world conference was held concerning the conservation of the environment. At that conference, which was arranged by the UN, we were represented by our Secretary as well as by other people from the Department of Planning and the Environment. There it was stated very clearly and unambiguously that heavy industries are the direct cause of pollution of the environment. Arising from that it was recommended that consideration be given to decentralizing to developing areas such as Africa in general, and South Africa. In the course of that conference, for example, representatives of countries which are already developed asked for provision to be made for as much as 2% to 3% in the cost programme of each industry for the protection of the environment. In other words, over and above any other reason why decentralization should take place, this side of the House also has this very important argument which we present today to that side of the House: If hon. members opposite are in earnest about this matter, they must support us by making an appeal, now&#x2014;I do not know whether there is going to be another speaker on this side&#x2014;for decentralization on a tremendous scale. Furthermore, in case it should happen that developed countries, such as some European countries and the United States of America, should decentralize to Africa and South Africa in particular, it would be fitting and proper for us to make provision <span class="col_1855-1856" refersTo="page_0941"/>in our planning even at this stage for a cost factor of 2<i>%</i> to 3% or more for the protection of our environment. We have already made progress in this connection. When an application is being considered by the Industrial Development Corporation, they conduct a detailed investigation into the process used by an industry and they also try to take account of the facets of the process which could bring about pollution of the environment. Now I feel that the time has come for us to request the hon. the Minister&#x2014;since he is handling the overall situation in respect of other departments as well&#x2014;that we should have built-in a far stronger factor when we consider this aid. Once we have reached that stage, we shall in fact be able to expect other industrialists to make provision in their expenditure in future for the social costs resulting from their industries. Then it is not inconceivable that each industry would be prepared to make a small contribution, a contribution based on its profit, to a fund which would enable us to combat pollution and to protect the environment.</p>

<p>In the time that is left I would like to refer to a last facet. We can effectively apply all the applicable statutory laws, but if we do not succeed in stimulating man&#x2019;s social conscience as regards his environment, its maintenance and protection, we shall not succeed in any campaign. Therefore I foresee&#x2014;and it was also foreseen by this conference to which I have referred&#x2014;that we shall have to develop in our system of law a set of rules regarding the private rights of the individual which are affected by pollution. There is no difference between the man who takes a pistol and shoots down a street with that pistol, or the person who drives down the street at 90 miles an hour and who does not care what he hits, and the situation where a person pollutes the environment with his industry while it does not matter to him what he affects. Therefore I foresee that in the not too distant future an individual will come forward and bring an action against an industry as a result of personal damage which he has suffered. That will be the beginning of an interesting revolution in our system of law.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that the hon. member for Bloemfontein West could make the call on this side of the House that he made this afternoon about decentralization of industries. After all, he has sat here for many years and has heard the point of view of this side of the House very often. I would like to tell him that the concept of decentralization of industries is one which is very near to the heart of hon. members on this side of the House. It is in fact a child of the father of the hon. member for Benoni who began it many, many years ago; it was his brainchild. He forgets that it took us many years to get that side of the House to understand that decentralization did not mean taking the industries to the borders of the homelands but taking them into the homelands. We are right behind the concept of decentralization of industry and I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister and to the Government to do everything they can to bring industries to the Eastern Cape and Border, because that is where we need industries to create the employment for the unemployed who are coming there and who are there today. I make that call to the Government to bring industries to our area.</p>

<p>You are right. It seems very strange to me this afternoon to be taking part in a debate on the pollution of the environment, when one of the worst and most despicable forms of pollution at the present time is the printed word. As an hon. member of this hon. House and of this hon. Opposition&#x2014;honourably led and which has always conducted itself honourably&#x2014;I still feel contaminated by the slime emanating from the sewers of the editorial offices of the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the <i>Daily Dispatch</i> of East London. The reckless irresponsibility, evasion and contempt for the truth of the editorial staff on these newspapers strengthens my argument in support of the motion of the hon. member for South Coast. He asks for one ministry and I will in the latter part of my speech indicate where the staff of this ministry should be. Perhaps this hon. Minister which the hon. <span class="col_1857-1858" refersTo="page_0942"/>member for South Coast proposes should have a member of his staff on the Press Board of South Africa to see that what is printed in our newspapers is unpolluted and true. But let us get to the actual facts of pollution.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Those are good facts but I do not think they are quite within the ambit of the motion. There are two kinds of pollution that we have to deal with in South Africa today. The one is caused through the reckless exploitation of raw material for the financial gain of mankind. The other is caused through the reckless and indiscriminate destruction of the environment through the effluent and the gases emitted from the machines and appliances invented for the profit and comfort of mankind. I wish to deal with both these forms of pollution, particularly in relation to the seashore and the destruction of our marine life within that zone. There is in this regard a need for a single Minister. One finds when one is dealing with an estuary of a tidal river that the inter-tidal zone falls under the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. When you are dealing with the marine life and the exploitation thereof in the inter-tidal zone you are dealing with the Department of Sea Fisheries which falls under the Minister of Economic Affairs. When you are dealing with this type of pollution in that same zone which is portrayed here&#x2014;if the hon. the Minister will look he will see a black smudge here of oil pollution on the beaches&#x2014;then it is the Department of Transport. This all covers the same zone and the same type of marine life. I believe that this is a cardinal example of the need and desirability for one single ministry to look after the environment. Both these forms of pollution must be controlled. We have recently had seaweed and oysters stripped off our eastern coast. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs if he were here would have to admit that. It is an incidence which I have been fighting since November 1969. When I put a question to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs on 6th June last year in this connection, he admitted that he had had 34 complaints from individuals and organizations. And when you add up the individuals and organizations in the list of 34, it must run up to close on 6 000 people. When I asked him whether he would consider the establishment of oyster reserves on the coastlines of Alexandria, Bathurst and Peddie, and whether his department would liaise directly with the Department of Ichthyology at Rhodes and the Eastern Cape and Border angling people in this connection, or whether he would make a statement on the matter, the answer to the first question was &#x201C;No&#x201D;, the second falls away, and the answer to the third one, &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Sir, I am glad to see that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Finance is here, because he will remember that he was once in charge of nature conservation in the Cape Province &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and that his department were endeavouring to do their best for the protection of this marine life, but that they could get nowhere because they were blocked by the department in which he now holds office. Sir, I am glad to see his smiling face, but I would appeal to him to do something about this reckless exploitation of our marine life. I wish to quote to this House a portion of a letter I received last year and which, I believe, the hon. the Minister also received, from Mrs. Margaret Smith of the J. L. B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology at Rhodes University in Grahamstown. Mrs. Smith is a world renowned figure on marine life, and she says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While it is true that young spats need free rock space to anchor themselves and grow, and that therefore the judicious removal of adult oysters is beneficial, the stripping of the rocks is detrimental. It has been found in America that oysters of the same genus as our common one do not easily recolonize rocks where there are no other oyster shells.</block>

<block name="quote">We shall have to harvest our sea life, but this must be done intelligently and with reasoned control.</block>

<p>In regard to our coastline, as I have said earlier, there are three departments in charge of this; if you include the Department of Nature Conservation of the Cape Province there are four departments in <span class="col_1859-1860" refersTo="page_0943"/>charge of this, and I believe that hon. members on the other side would do well to agree with the motion of the hon. member for South Coast and call for this single Ministry. Sir, according to <i>Time</i> magazine, one gallon of oil affects the oxygen content of 400 000 gallons of sea-water, and when the hon. member for South Coast talked about the maximum amount that we could deal with as 5 000 tons, how many millions upon millions of gallons of sea-water and sea-life are affected by that? But, Sir, it is no good our attempting to overcome oil pollution from the sea if we do not tackle this pollution at its source. We on this side of the House were most grateful to hear over the news that tenders have been called for certain patrol boats to patrol our coasts, because I believe that what we need here, in order to tackle that pollution at its source, is to form a coastguard in South Africa under the Minister of the Environment to go and tackle these boats that are blowing their bilges off our coast so that we can have somebody to prosecute. The legislation is there, but we cannot catch them. Let us catch them with the coastguard and prosecute them.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to raise another matter under this motion, because in thinking of a coastguard in South Africa, I also thought of the difficulty that we have in the Defence Force with the national service of certain conscientious objectors. I felt that possibly here was a way of employing these people productively in the service of the State. I contacted certain parents here in the Cape, who in turn contacted their sons in detention in Voortrekkerhoogte, and I am told by these conscientious objectors that the feeling at Voortrekkerhoogte among the detainees was that if they were sentenced by a civil court to do this type of work under a Minister of the Environment, they would accept that sentence. Sir, I am not pleading the cause of the conscientious objector, but I hate to see the wastage of manpower that comes about when people have to sit in detention barracks for 12 months. I believe it is the concern of all members of this House, and I should think that it is something that might be attended to in the near future. They could be usefully used in combating the pollution of our environment.</p>

<p>Sir, I think it was a very good thing that this House discussed this very important matter of pollution and of the environment today. I want to say at the outset, while I still have time, that I want to give the country the assurance once again that the Government is very much in earnest about the protection and the preservation of the environment and the prevention and combating of pollution. We do not intend to allow the environment in all its facets to deteriorate, or perhaps I should say deteriorate further, from its present condition. On the contrary, the Government and I as the Minister in charge are determined to improve the environment and to combat and prevent its deterioration in every field. No one should be in any doubt about this.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, may I express my appreciation to the hon. member for South Coast for bringing forward this motion, thereby allowing the House not only to receive an amendment but also to discuss this very important matter.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Sir, although I agree with most of what the hon. member for South Coast has said, there are one or two points on which we differ, and I should perhaps deal with them first. I do not suggest that they are of very great consequence, but by dealing with them I can also illustrate my approach to this important matter of the environment. The hon. member wants a full and searching investigation by a tribunal of experts into the extent and imminence of the dangers facing <span class="col_1861-1862" refersTo="page_0944"/>South Africa. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to belittle those dangers; they are there. Nor do I say that we know everything, but I do say that we know enough to be able to act. If we can combat and halt all the pollution in its various forms that we know of, with the knowledge that we have today, then we shall indeed have made wonderful progress. I also think that it is not feasible for any one commission or tribunal to investigate pollution in all its numerous forms. This is a vast subject. The environment embraces practically every aspect of our lives. We have, as part of the machinery that we have created so far, the South African Committee for the Protection of the Environment and, as has been said here, the Secretary for Planning is the chairman of this committee. Then there are 23 other members representing Government departments, semi-government institutions, the four provinces and South-West Africa and the universities, etc. Should more knowledge or information on any specific area of pollution be required, or should difficulties or obstacles be encountered in the combating thereof, then I can call on this committee to undertake further investigation, which the committee usually does by setting up a subcommittee of specialists in the particular field that is being studied. This has happened in the case of litter pollution, to name only one instance. At the very moment experts are studying this problem from all angles&#x2014;factual, legal, economic and administrative&#x2014;and when I receive their report we shall act. In the meantime we are bringing our machinery in order. Let me give a further instance to illustrate my point. We have the National Advisory Committee on Air Pollution under the chairmanship of Dr. Halliday of the C.S.I.R. I can assure the hon. members that there is no aspect or form of air pollution in South Africa which this committee is not completely knowledgeable about and which has not already been studied. We can get all the scientific advice and information from them that we want. The need only is, as the hon. member has said, to act as far as action is possible. This is the way in which we will act in regard to all forms of pollution if it becomes necessary, be it in regard to our rivers, the oceans, our agricultural soils, our landscape, parks and open spaces and the environmental problems of our cities, etc.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder whether the Minister will deal with this point. Are these committees which have been referred to, in a position that they can report to the Minister from time to time on the changing emphasis of priorities? What is of the highest priority today may be over-shadowed by something of greater importance in six months&#x2019; time because it is more dangerous. Are your committees able to deal with the question of priorities?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have no hesitation to reply in the affirmative and to assure the hon. member for South Coast that this South African Committee on the Environment which meets regularly is a committee consisting of experts in all the various fields and they can form a very sound judgment on what is the most pressing problem from time to time and what should receive priority. Therefore I say that the problem of pollution&#x2014;and it has been said by the hon. member for Stellenbosch&#x2014;has been identified in all its various forms. Any further information required can be obtained by way of the machinery we have set up through these committees. Therefore I have come to the conclusion that at this stage there is no need for another tribunal to conduct a full and wide investigation into this all-embracing subject, the environment, because no one can be an expert on everything.</p>

<p>That brings me to the second part of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, namely his request for a Minister charged with full responsibility and armed with all the powers necessary to deal with the matter. He was supported in this by the hon. members for Cape Town Gardens and Albany. Well, as the House knows, the hon. the Prime Minister has appointed me and has made me responsible for all matters concerning the environment. I say that I see myself and my department as the environmental watch-dog. I will go further and say I also see us figuratively, as the supreme commander of all the forces waging war against the dangers of pollution in South Africa.</p>

<p>No. But we shall not shirk this duty. I and my department will make every effort to make a success of this assignment. I am in the same position with regard to planning in South Africa. I am, in a sense, also the supreme commander of planning in South Africa and I have not taken out a whip yet and gone about the provinces and the State departments with it. But do you know, Sir, that we have been receiving the most wonderful co-operation during the last two years that we have handled planning. We have received praise, and we are really going places in regard to planning in South Africa. We are doing good work and there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why we should not achieve the same success here with this approach which I am at present following. Then I want to say it is not possible for one person or for one department to handle physically all matters relating to the environment. It is absolutely impossible. Otherwise you can have one Department of the environment taking over the whole of the administration of South Africa. The S.A. Railways own locomotives which pollute the air, whether they be coal or diesel. Must I for that reason now take over the S.A. Railways? But I am the watch-dog and I can speak to my colleague when any matter of pollution arises, and I have the Cabinet behind me. You must remember I have the hon. the Prime Minister behind me.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the biting. In regard to biting, we had the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens. He suggested that I must have teeth and laws with teeth. Immediately thereafter he mentioned the Iscor works in Pretoria. The Iscor works in Pretoria belch out a lot of smoke, but they were established at a time when there was only one process in the whole world to make steel and that was the Bessemer process. It is absolutely impossible to make steel in the Iscor works without smoke belching out there. It happens in most cases of pollution that the time arrives when the economic life of those furnaces expires and actually Iscor is now installing new furnaces in the light of new technology. The new process will cause much less pollution. The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens spoke immediately thereafter about the twin chimneys down at the Cape Town harbour. In that connection he referred to the power station as &#x201C;this monstrosity&#x201D;. That is the whole point: If we had had this Department of Planning and this Department of the Environment&#x2014;when the next motion is under discussion we shall talk about planning&#x2014;and if we had had this planning a long time ago, this power station would not have been located where it is at the moment; it would have been way out of town. What can I do now? Does the hon. member blame the Government for it? What can I do about it at this stage? There is a change-over from coal to diesel but there are a lot of technical difficulties which have to be overcome. The people are doing their best. This is not the Government&#x2019;s fault and it is not because I do not have teeth. You can have all the teeth in the world and it will not help you. In the same breath the hon. member also spoke about Soweto in another sense. The trouble about Soweto is a very real trouble, as hon. members will appreciate. We have perfected the smokeless stove, but all those hundreds of thousands of people&#x2014;I do not know how many&#x2014;who live in Soweto still have the old type of stove, the coal-burning stove, and they paid for those stoves. We are looking into this matter, but it is not so easy just to issue an edict that as from tomorrow everybody is obliged to use only new smokeless stoves. About a week ago we discussed the law wages these people were earning. We can try to make a plan, but at the moment the most we can say is that in all new townships these new stoves must be installed. That is the sort of thing which we do.</p>

<p>I take an interest in these things because it is my job. I am the Minister of the Environment and I can poke my nose into any issue that I wish to. I just wanted to say that. My time is limited and I must hurry along. I want to ask who must do this job. Hon. members have agreed that when it comes to oil pollution the Department of Transport is the proper authority. I think so too. They control the harbours, they have the tugs there, they have the storage facilities for the equipment and chemicals which they use and they have all the other facilities and the personnel. If hon. members want to pursue the argument to a logical conclusion, they must also say that my department must now take over <span class="col_1865-1866" refersTo="page_0946"/>the combating of oil pollution at sea, but they have not done that.</p>

<p>There is this matter about litter in South Africa. About a month ago I had a conference with the Administrators and they unanimously requested me not to have an anti-litter Bill passed by Parliament. They asked that Parliament should merely pass enabling legislation empowering the provinces to pass their own anti-litter ordinances. I agreed with them, because then the measure will come from the people themselves. You cannot force the protection of the environment, or anything for that matter, down people&#x2019;s throats. That is a point which has been made in the course of this discussion by hon. members on both sides. You must have the people of South Africa, to whatever race they belong, with you to co-operate with you and to assist you. Then you are on the way to achieving success. Sir, we are going to go about the matter in a concerted way, and when we act, we will act in Cape Town, Durban, the Transvaal&#x2014;all over South Africa.</p>

<p>I do want just to read to you&#x2014;my time is running out, but we will talk further under my Vote&#x2014;once more from this very good publication, <i>The Human Environment&#x2014;The British View,</i> issued by the Department of the Environment in Britain. They quite rightly say, with some pride, that they were the first department of the environment in the whole world. I must say they have achieved a lot of success. If hon. members will not criticize me too much, I can perhaps say that I contemplate paying a visit to the British Department of the Environment to make a real study of what they are doing there, how they have achieved their success and how they regulate the relationship between the central Government and the various people who are doing this work. In this publication they say, further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These departments retaining their own special sectional functions when the Department of the Environment was created in November, 1970, it would have been neither sensible nor possible to bring together in one department everything to do with a subject so all-embracing as the environment &#x2026;</block>

<p>But then they also say that they have brought in various Ministries&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and they now control the overwhelming bulk of national planning and pollution.</block>

<p>I repeat, &#x201C;planning and pollution&#x201D;, because these things go hand in hand. But it reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Secretary of State for the Environment, moreover, has the responsibility for co-ordinating the work done by the Government to control pollution in all departments.</block>

<p>*So this is what I really wanted to tell the hon. member for South Coast. We have created certain machinery. That machinery consists of the Cabinet, myself as the Minister of Planning, with my Cabinet committee&#x2014;it will probably not be necessary very often, but I can consult this committee&#x2014;and the South African Committee for the Protection of the Environment. Then we have the various departments and the provinces, each with a law in terms of which it operates. I think our machinery is good. We just have to expand that machinery, and someone just has to see to it that that machinery works and is utilized; and I give that assurance.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast asked me who was responsible for the question of water pollution. That is of course the Department of Water Affairs, the department which controls the inland waters of South Africa and which has to store it up and share it out to be used. That is the department which is responsible&#x2014;I cannot say: &#x201C;Look, the Department of Water Affairs has so much water in the Vaal Dam; it can give that authority so much water, but I am going to lay down the conditions on which you may use it.&#x201D; The Department of Water Affairs gives water to a factory under a permit and then it lays down the standards and provisions according to which the water has to be used, purified and reused, and when the water is returned to a public stream, the water must be of a certain standard. If there are complaints, I think we had better address these to the Department of Water Affairs. However, if anyone is unable to obtain satisfaction from the Department of Water Affairs, I am also prepared to discuss the matter with my colleague on behalf of the public and to see how far I can take it, as I have done with other cases of pollution.</p>

<p>Is the control entirely in the hands of that department?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The hon. member for Benoni dealt with the question of <span class="col_1867-1868" refersTo="page_0947"/>lead in petrol and advocated an investigation. There is nothing wrong for the investigation. It is true that England is going to introduce it. Another investigation was also conducted in England and two groups of people were taken. One group consisted of taxi drivers who continually came into contact with petrol and petrol fumes and the other group consisted of a number of housewives living in a remote region. There was no difference, as far as they could ascertain, between the lead content of these groups of people. However, we shall go into the matter. I have already replied to the hon. member for Albany. If one has an authority that controls oil at sea and oil is washed ashore, what other people can prevent this? That oil is washed ashore and marine life is affected, no matter how great a pity it is. My opinion is that this is the concern of the Division of Sea Fisheries, which is in charge of the conservation, promotion and breeding of marine life. I cannot intervene there. I have a house by the sea myself. There is a certain area where we can remove shellfish from the shore; we cannot go deeper than this and the boats from the sea cannot come closer than a certain distance either. There is an area in between where these creatures can breed. We have to be told this by experts, however, the experts being the Division of Sea Fisheries. They do not come into the picture only when oil is washed ashore and some of those shellfish or penguins are killed or polluted. They are working at it all the time. It is the work of the Department of Transport to see to it that no oil is washed ashore, or as little as possible, and in addition there are the local authorities which intervene to see what they can do to prevent and to solve a bad situation which we all deplore.</p>

<p>I do not want to belittle any contributions by hon. members on the other side, because they were all good, but I want to tell hon. members on this side that I am proud of them today because they made a positive contribution. We are not saying that we see only the death of the environment before us. Matters may be serious, but we are saying that we see life before us; we are not approaching this question of the environment in a spirit of defeatism. We are tackling it to overcome the problems and to conquer. The world has a great problem, a difficult problem, in this regard, and theoretically the world will suffer in times to come. We have drawn from the riches of the earth to a fantastic extent in our age with its new technological dispensation. Approximately one-third of the world&#x2019;s population has achieved a very high standard of living. We cannot say that the growth of the world should now slow down for that reason, because the growth of the world must continue, also to rectify what we have done wrong in the developed parts of the world. It must also continue in order to help those people, the other two-thirds of the population of the world who are living in poverty today, who are living in dirty slums, and to give them a place in the sun as well. So the growth must continue, but I want to say that all men and women, we here in Parliament, our provincial councils, our city councils, etc., must do their best in this regard. Our city councils with their officials have such a tremendously important task and I want to appeal to them today, to everyone, to anyone with authority, to ask themselves how the environment will be affected by their actions. We must all write this in capital letters for ourselves and then we must go on developing our country. We must go on growing. The ecology and the economy must make peace with each other. They must co-operate in the conservation of the environment. The ecologist and the economist must think in harmony, plan in harmony and act in harmony.</p>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I introduce my motion I want to convey my appreciation to the Government for having established this important Department of the Environment. After what we have just heard from the Minister, we foresee that this department will be of great assistance to us in South Africa in so far as the planning and the development of our environment is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, bearing in mind the fact that the average annual increase in the population of South Africa to the end of this century will be approximately one million people, which means that in South Africa a new complex of a size equal to the Cape Peninsula has to be established annually, and also bearing in mind that 80% of the production of South Africa is being <span class="col_1869-1870" refersTo="page_0948"/>produced on approximately 0,4% of the surface area of the Republic of South Africa which is situated in four metropolitan areas, I want to move in all humility this afternoon&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) notes with appreciation the comprehensive planning of all parts of the Republic that has been carried out by the State, the progress that has been made with the policy of multinational development and the sustained growth rate in all parts of the country; and</li>

<li>(2) emphasizes the importance of&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) co-ordinating planning (i) in metropolitan and potential metropolitan areas and (ii) between areas that are being developed for the individual nations in terms of the policy of multi-national development;</li>

<li>(b) planning specific regions with a view to developing each region according to its potential; and</li>

<li>(c) creating effective planning machinery for the entire country.</li></ol></li>

</ol>

<p>It is not necessary for me to point out in the motivation of my motion that South Africa today is the country with the most rapid growth rate in the entire continent of Africa. It has been possible to achieve this only because the country has for the past quarter of a century been blessed with a Government which has pursued a policy which could make something like this possible. This rapid growth rate has also brought its problems. Open spaces which 50 years ago had only to be reserved for the creation of essential services have to be purchased today at extremely high prices. I am referring to services such as by-passes, freeways and housing projects. Fifty years ago these requirements were not anticipated. Today thousands and even millions of rand are being spent on the stimulation of growth points for the sake of decentralization. Such growth points of virtually the same extent would have arisen if the need for them had been foreseen 50 years ago, but it would also have been necessary to plan for them. Today we are perceiving these things and are planning for them, but it is costing many millions of rand. This planning is being tackled dynamically, and there is great appreciation for this. I do not have time, with the time at my disposal, to go into details, but there will be other speakers who will deal with more particular cases. I just want to mention that we note with great appreciation the guide-plan committees which are almost every day working actively on various guide-plans. I want to refer here to the guide-plans in respect of Newcastle, Richards Bay, Saldanha Bay, the Cape Peninsula, Witbank and the P.W.V. complex. We are aware that this drawing up of guide-plans in which all the interested parties are involved will produce many difficulties and growth pains, but we are also aware that great progress has already been made with certain of these guide-plans and that development is taking place, of which Newcastle is a striking example. Nevertheless, we are on the right road as far as this kind of planning is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the point of multi-national development, as mentioned in this motion. Could anyone point out to me any country in the world where, in the short space of 25 years, as much has been done as we have done in South Africa to give shape to the development of the numerous peoples here at the southernmost point of Africa? I do not want to go over the entire history of the struggle since 1948, but I do want to make one request today, which is that when this Government is criticized for not having made further progress with the implementation of its policy of multi-national development there should be objective retrospective consideration of all the impediments and obstacles which have over the past 25 years been placed in the way of the National Party in the actual physical implementation of that policy.</p>

The present generation thinks it was all plain sailing, but we who were part of this process know what a satanic struggle was waged against us and is still being waged against us. The Government persevered, and today we see the results. I hope that the boundaries of the various geographic areas of these peoples will be finalized during the present session of Parliament <span class="col_1871-1872" refersTo="page_0949"/>so that we may all know the actual situation of the land left to us by our forefathers.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say that I think that we can declare with the utmost conviction in this House today that enormous progress has been made in these areas as far as the development of these peoples is concerned. We will be the first to admit that not everything has been done which ought to have been done, but if we take into consideration that it has at most been a period of a decade during which we have actually been working on the physical implementation of this, we can say that great progress has been made, but we are convinced that the foundations have been laid for sound multi-national development in South Africa in future.</p>

<p>In this motion hon. members will also observe that we emphasize the importance of control over and development of our metropolitan areas. A half century ago the Witwatersrand&#x2014;I am mentioning that example&#x2014;consisted of small towns scattered from Randfontein to Springs and Nigel. Today one is hardly able to drive from one point to the other without driving straight through a developed and built-up area. This pattern in that part of our country we also find in other parts of our country. We find it for example in the Cape Peninsula where the same pattern of development occurs. We find it in Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage where the trend of this development pattern is already in progress. We find it in East London where this pattern is taking shape in a more northerly direction towards Berlin. We see it in Durban with the development along the South and the North Coast. We see it in the Richards Bay-Empangeni area. We see it in the entire Witbank complex. We see it in the P.W.V. complex. The latter area is one which will develop from Sasolburg through Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark to the Witwatersrand and circle round to Brits. From thence it will link up with Rosslyn, through Pretoria North right into Pretoria itself, from whence it will spread out to Bronkhorstspruit and through Bapsfontein back to the Witwatersrand. This is a pattern of development which we see coming in South Africa. When we see this pattern of development in South Africa we must realize one thing, namely that problems are going to be encountered here. We are grateful that the Department of Planning and the Environment has, in co-operation with other organizations, already recognized this pattern and is giving consideration to the problems which will arise as a result of it. These great agglomerations of cities and towns have common interests. I want to ask this question: Has the time not arrived for positive and effective consideration to be given to the establishment of metropolitan councils for these various areas which are developing in this way? In a country like South Africa with its shortage of trained manpower we must do everything possible to utilize to best effect the manpower at our disposal. I am advocating the coordination of planning and services in these metropolitan areas. Co-ordinating bodies, metropolitan boards must be established which will see to the co-ordination of these areas.</p>

<p><i>Inter alia,</i> the policy of multi-national development implies political independence, but also mutual co-operation in the economic sphere among various ethnic groupings, each in its particular homeland. In addition it implies infrastructures which will form a unity in each of the areas, but which on a higher level again will form part of the greater infrastructure which serves South Africa as a whole. I want to emphasize that there should be effective co-ordination of the planning of each of these separate ethnic homelands; it has to comprise a harmonious part of the overall plan for South Africa. We cannot emphasize strongly enough that constant consultation or even compulsory consultation between the planning authorities of various ethnic homelands and the planning authorities of the group areas must take place.</p>

<p>Another point made in my motion and one which I wanted to dwell on for a few moments, is the planning of specific regions. The urbanization process in South Africa has taken the form of an over-concentration in the metropolitan areas. Eighty per cent of the production in our country takes place in four metropolitan areas situated on 0,4% of the surface area of our father-land. The bright lights of the city have <span class="col_1873-1874" refersTo="page_0950"/>blinded the eyes of the population to the opportunities which still exist in the rural areas or which could be created there. Smaller towns are no longer attractive to the ambitious young man and woman. The average age of the rural population is increasing; the number of children is decreasing and schools are closing down. My own little home town, Strydenburg, is an example of this. It is a very fine example. I can elaborate at length on this subject. We must remember that it is in the heart of White South Africa. There the Whites have to develop their own homeland to the maximum. Mr. Speaker, these towns still have to fulfil an essential function, and we want to emphasize that they must be assisted. I should like to leave this idea in your midst&#x2014;perhaps I am not being original as far as this idea is concerned; it does not matter; I merely wish to emphasize this idea again&#x2014;which is that a study should be made of these towns, together with their surrounding regions, so that each such region may be classified in order of importance into principal and subordinate towns, which will determine the development pattern of each town. Sir, we emphasize that a detailed study should be made of every region demarcated in this way around a major town in order to discover the full development possibilities of such a region and to draw up a programme of action in terms of which such a region may be systematically developed to its full potential to the advantage of the inhabitants of the country as a whole. I am convinced that the hon. the Minister and the Department of Planning and the Environment are in agreement with us as far as this matter is concerned; I know that they are favourably disposed to it. I also know that the authorities, local as well as provincial, feel just as strongly in regard to this matter. It is a fact that we cannot expect the central planning and environmental department to undertake all this planning. I see their task as that of a policy-making and co-ordinating body which has to indicate clear guidelines, within which each implementing party has to play its role. Mr. Speaker, they are situated hundreds of miles from these regions. It is physically impossible for them to undertake this planning themselves. I see the planning of these regions as the task of the people who live in the regions or areas themselves. They know what their ideals are concerning their environment, and what their regions are capable of. They must themselves plan positively and encourage action. Mr. Speaker, we are aware of the legal problems involved in establishing such planning machinery. This does not always work out well on a voluntary basis. I do not want to go into the details now, but I want to mention in all humility that it seems to me as if a new planning authority is required to act within such regions. It should consist of leading figures within that region, who will represent the urban as well as the rural areas within that region. They must make use of the expert knowledge and trained planners, who should preferably be employed by them on a full-time basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to convey this gratitude and appreciation here to the Government and in particular to the hon. the Minister and the department, and also to emphasize the importance of this important work which has to be done in the metropolitan and regional sphere.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte has submitted here to us an interesting motion but, if he will permit me to say this, also a strange one. It is one of these omnibus motions in which he sought to cover a very wide range of matters and which in my opinion should actually fall under the Department of Bantu Administration and Development rather than the Department of Planning. But, in the second place, it would appear to me as though the hon. member made an attempt here, in his motion and also in his presentation of it, to reconcile things which are in effect irreconcilable. But the third impression one gained, was that the hon. member had been startled to a certain extent. I do not know whether it was Mr. Jaap Marais and his people who had given him a fright, but I think he was actually trying here to buoy up himself.</p>

<p>Sir, just let us take a look at this motion by the hon. member as he presented it to us. In the first place, he expressed his appreciation for the comprehensive planning of all parts of the Republic. He even referred to an overall plan which he wanted for the whole of South Africa. But now I do not understand this hon. member&#x2019;s approach. When we talk about such a comprehensive plan for all parts of South Africa, surely one is from the nature of the case thinking of the Bantu homelands. Now I want to ask him what planning is at present being done in the homelands. That he definitely did not mention to us. <span class="col_1875-1876" refersTo="page_0951"/>The hon. member forgot to tell us that in terms of section 13 of the Physical Planning Act the homelands are specifically excluded from that. They cannot do planning there, for that has been specifically excluded in the Act. Now I do not understand where the hon. member is taking us. How can that fit in with his motion?</p>

<p>But, secondly, he made great play of the question of progress in the sphere of multinational development. Well, one would have expected him to have given us some indications in that regard of the progress that has in fact been made in that respect. Our impression is that the very opposite is true, for once again one is thinking of the homelands. One can prove, as far as the present homelands are concerned, that their <i>per capita</i> real income today is not much higher than it was at the beginning of this century, but one can go further and say that a large part of their national income still comes from South Africa, from the services they sell here, and that very little of it originates in the homelands themselves. In fact, the largest group that are in employment in the various homelands, are in the service of the governments which are subsidized by our present Government here. Therefore, how can one talk of the tremendous progress&#x2014;and he even mentioned the words &#x201C;enormous progress&#x201D;&#x2014;in the sphere of the economic development of these parts? The hon. member was actually boasting here of what had been done there, but as I read the situation most of the authorities on this matter in South Africa are really alarmed at the small amount of progress that has been made.</p>

<p>Now, in discussing further the concept of multi-national development and the tremendous economic progress that has taken place, according to the hon. member, I ask him what economic progress has there been for the Coloureds in their specific multi-national context. We do not know a thing about that. We know the Government is engaged in initiating a kind of growth point here at Mamre, but we do not know what percentage of the Coloured population this is going to absorb and involve. But what about the Indians? Where is their multi-nationalism? I think the Government has in this respect thrown in the towel a long time ago, and the only thing the Indians are going to get, as far as multi-nationalism is concerned, is separate residential areas.</p>

<p>Throughout his motion the hon. member referred to the large-scale growth rate throughout the country. Of course, in this respect we must clash with him again, for our view is, and all the information points to this, that over the last number of years there has been relatively little economic growth. The growth rate has been extremely low. The hon. the Minister of Finance explained this to us yesterday. He said he had to curb the growth rate; he could not stimulate it, and he motivated that. He said that, in the first place, there had been inflation and, in the second place, our foreign reserves had been too low. Sir, once again I find this a strange approach, for how does one get over the question of inflation? If one does not have growth and one has inflation at the same time then one gets what they call stagflation, which is much worse than inflation. In fact, most people point out nowadays that the best way to combat inflation is in effect to have faster growth; one must outgrow it. And inflation is, in any case, relative. There are many countries in the world with high rates of inflation, but then their growth rates are so much higher.</p>

<p>But, in the second place, they said we could not grow any faster because our foreign reserves were so low. Once again I cannot understand this. It stands to reason that if one does not grow one&#x2019;s foreign reserves will be low, for then one does not have anything to export. As far as this matter is concerned, the Government is in my opinion like a dog that wants to bite its own tail. At an ever increasing pace it is moving in circles while chasing its own tail, and I am just afraid that one of these days the Government will succeed in biting its own tail.</p>

<p>I also find this motion by the hon. member to be quite ambiguous. In the first part of the motion he speaks in the very highest terms of what the Government has already done on all these various levels, and then he says in the second part of his motion that the Government should be encouraged to do what he says they have already done. This is an ambiguity which I really do not understand. For this reason I move on behalf of this side of the House the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute: &#x201C;whilst long-term planning is conducive to ordered and sustained development, this House expresses its concern at the extent to which natural economic growth in certain areas is being <span class="col_1877-1878" refersTo="page_0952"/>hampered by the Government&#x2019;s ideological policies.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I should like to motivate this amendment. We find it so easy to talk about economic growth, but perhaps we should have clarity on why economic growth is so important for South Africa at this stage. I think one can identify a few factors. In the first place there is the particularly rapid increase in our population. There is talk that by the end of this century we shall have 50 million people in South Africa. There is also the particularly rapid increase in our labour force. In this green booklet that was published by the Department of Planning, it is indicated that from 1960 to 1970 our labour force showed an increase of 1 300 000 people. This is an increase of 3,4% per year, which is of course a particularly high one. It is higher than the 3% indicated by Liebenstein as a criterion which one may use in this regard. What this signifies, once again according to this green booklet, is that approximately 150 000 Bantu are entering the labour market every year. Opportunities for employment must be created for them. I think it goes without saying that our growth rate will have to be higher than 6% per year merely in order that opportunities for employment may be created for all the Bantu entering the labour market. In the second place, rapid economic growth in South Africa is important since foreign exchange is still being derived mainly from our gold mines, and although we are in this regard doing very well indeed at the moment, all the indications are that our gold mining industry may become exhausted within the next 20 years. The third important reason why we must have rapid economic growth, is of course our increasing expenditure on defence. We are already spending far more than R350 million per year on defence, and there is every indication that this figure will probably rise rather than drop. In the fourth place, rapid economic growth is essential for South Africa because in a pluralistic community such as our own it is easier to preserve racial harmony when there is economic progress rather than when there is economic stagnation. For this particular reason it is essential for South Africa to grow economically, for if we do not do this we shall explode ourselves politically.</p>

<p>In our own case rapid economic growth is also essential because the standard of living of such a large percentage of our population is still a relatively low one. When the Government always compares our economic growth rate with that of Britain and that of America, it is actually a comparison which is meaningless. We must compare ourselves with countries which are on a similar economic level, and economically they must of course develop at a much faster rate than do the economically mature countries.</p>

<p>If we accept that economically we must grow rapidly, I think we may state at the same time that we have the necessary ingredients at our disposal. We have sufficient capital in South Africa. Savings have already reached such a level that we can raise sufficient capital locally, and we can also attract it from outside. We have the manpower. We have virtually inexhaustible economic raw materials, and we have management which can maintain a very high standard. Under all these circumstances it ought therefore to be possible for South Africa to have very rapid economic growth, which the hon. member has now indicated is the case.</p>

<p>But now there are certain problems why we cannot grow as rapidly as ought to be the case. The hon. member immediately lay his finger on one of them. He said our manpower had to be utilized in the most effective manner. But, surely, that is precisely what is not happening at the moment. That is our argument. Our entire economic development programme is based on the fact that manpower productivity will have to shoot up by approximately 2,8% per year. After all, all of us know that this is not the case at the moment.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, of course I shall tell the hon. member. He should just listen attentively to me. In the first place, manpower productivity is directly related to education. Years ago Unesco made a study in which they found that there was a direct and positive correlation between the education index for the various countries and their gross domestic product. Sir, what is happening in the sphere of education? As far as our Whites are concerned, it is of a high standard. I accept that. But as far as the non-Whites are concerned, and <span class="col_1879-1880" refersTo="page_0953"/>especially the Bantu, surely we all know that it is absolutely inadequate.</p>

</speech>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Let me finish my argument first; then the hon. member may make his own speech. Sir, it has been established that when a worker has received high school training he is usually 40% more productive than one who has not had any high school training. Let us just take a look at the Bantu workers in South Africa. It has been determined that at the moment three out of every 1 000 Bantu who are economically active, have received high school training. The system of education is therefore inadequate, and nobody can argue that away.</p>

<p>In the second place, one must have industrial training. On every occasion on which we have yet pleaded for that and even submitted private Bills to the House, the Government voted against them, for they merely say, &#x201C;You want to open the floodgates.&#x201D; The floodgates were opened years ago already. When 80% of one&#x2019;s workers are non-Whites, how can one still talk about opening floodgates? The water has run out long ago. I shall answer the hon. member further. He wanted to know how one was to obtain more effective productivity. Once again he will find an answer in this booklet, which was prepared by Dr. Du Plessis, who I think is the deputy economic adviser to the Government. I quote from page 5, where he indicated that where there was complete mobility of labour, we could obtain a higher growth rate. He went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But owing to the existing pattern of labour utilization, the extent to which the non-White population can be integrated with the production process is still determined mainly by the growth in the White labour force.</block>

<p>What the hon. gentleman actually meant, but did not state here specifically, was that manpower productivity depended on mobility. One&#x2019;s labour force must be able to move. It must be able to move in the vertical sense. It must be possible for people to move up from the bottom in the hierarchy of jobs. But this cannot happen here, because the Government introduced job reservation. In the second place, one has this when there is mobility in the sense that workers must be able to move from the less productive sectors in the economy to the more productive sectors; in other words, they must enter into the manufacturing industry. But once again the Government curbs this, actually prohibits this, through the application of the Physical Planning Act. How can one therefore have productivity under these circumstances, when the Government&#x2019;s ideological approach diametrically opposes this? But now I also ask: Where in the world can one have high productivity if one perseveres with this system of migratory labour which we have? In those circumstances we can never have productivity.</p>

<p>I did not say a single word about decentralization. The hon. member has only woken up now. In the final instance, the reason why we cannot have increased manpower productivity, is that the Government has too large a percentage of our economically active White group in its own service. More than one-third of the Whites in South Africa who are economically active, are working for the Government and its associated services. Now I want to quote another set of statistics which I think is alarming. Only recently I read that 45 % of the Whites who are economically active and are graduates, were in the employ of the Government. Here one has a small White population that has to keep the whole economy going, and almost half of the people who have had higher university training, are not employed in industry but working for the Government.</p>

<p>No, but in the previous debate the Minister referred specifically to his role in the sphere of environmental control, and at that stage he said he was the &#x201C;supreme commander&#x201D; in that sphere. He said he was doing exactly the same as he was doing in the Department of Planning; he was also the supreme commander. Now I should just like to take up this little point with the hon. the Minister. He will perhaps recall that last year, in a previous debate, I referred to the Saldanha project and contrasted it with the St. Croix project, and at the time I asked him whether he and his department had done a feasibility study, a feasibility analysis, for this is a matter which implies long-term interests for South Africa. If he is such a &#x201C;supreme commander&#x201D;, I would have accepted now that in this case he would have set his seal on it. At the time he gave me a negative reply and said that officials in his department had in fact taken part in discussions and that he was a member of the Cabinet committee, but that this was actually a matter for the Minister of Economic Affairs and that he had to handle it. Now, surely, we all know that there is a conflict between the Department of Transport and the Department of Economic Affairs. If the Minister of Planning were such a &#x201C;supreme commander&#x201D;, one would have expected him to have asserted himself in this sphere. However, this did not happen, and I do not know where we are going.</p>

<p>My time has expired, but I should just like to summarize by saying that planning of a high standard is being done by the department. However, our argument, as contained in our amendment, is that this planning is being curbed because there is an ideological framework which was laid down by the Government and within which all this planning has to take place. Let us forget about all these other things and let us see South Africa as one economic whole, which in fact it is. Let us plan it as such. Let us see the homelands not as separate areas, but as underdeveloped economic areas, which they really are. Let us then develop them on that basis. Here the Government now has such a tremendous bonanza in the form of all the gold-mining premiums it is getting. Why does it not use some of that money for planning South Africa properly and developing it as a whole? If one views the arguments in this regard in this light, I assume that this House will be quite justified in rejecting the hon. member&#x2019;s motion and accepting our amendment.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion by the hon. member for Langlaagte is a broad and comprehensive one. Basically it concerns our entire growth pattern in this country. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, has revealed a typically U.P. mentality, a steriled mentality, towards a topic as important as this one. An extremely short time has been allocated to me, and therefore I want to leave the hon. member there.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I should like to make a few comments on point (b) of the second part of this motion, which deals with&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">planning specific regions with a view to developing each region according to its potential; &#x2026;</block>

<p>As a Boland representative in this House, I want to refer more specifically to the Boland region&#x2014;this old, traditional part of the country. I want to say that over the past few years I have on more than one occasion, both in and outside this House, been one of the Cape Cassandras who repeatedly complained about the growth pattern in the Boland and expressed my concern at the lack of a real growth momentum in this old, traditional, historic part of our country. In this process I joined others in complaining, in the first instance, about the lack of development in regard to our water potential in the Boland. We told one another that our water was running down to the sea, and that water was actually our <i>sine qua non</i> here in the Boland. We complained about over-concentration in the Cape metropolis. We produced proof indicating that this over-concentration in the Cape metropolis had reached the point where we had to give very serious attention to it. We complained about the best Boland agricultural lands situated along the Cape Town-Paarl-Wellington development line which were falling a victim to housing schemes. The <span class="col_1883-1884" refersTo="page_0955"/>Paarl-Wellington valley is a beautiful, fertile and colourful part of the world. Hon. members will probably have seen in the newspaper this morning that the three Matie lasses for the carnival all hail from this valley. We expressed concern because this beautiful Boland valley, with its select agricultural lands, is being taken up today by one housing project after the other. As Cassandras from the Boland area, we complained in this process that insufficient emphasis and development powers were being concentrated on the Cape Town-Saldanha development line, a vicinity in the Boland where some of our poorest agricultural lands are to be found. However, this afternoon I can rise here and as an inhabitant of the Boland I can testify with new excitement in my heart that I think we in the Boland are facing a totally new future. A new world is awaiting us, if we approach it correctly and actively in the future. Why do I say this? In the first instance, year before last, on 2nd September, the Minister of Water Affairs announced a Boland water plan, a plan which stands there like a network which is going to unfurl and which, basically, is going to serve this part of the world. Last week the Minister of Economic Affairs announced the Saldanha-Sishen project. This is a project which brings us face to face with a totally new future situation as regards growth momentum in the Boland. Last year, after pleas which had been made here repeatedly, the Minister of Planning announced the Government&#x2019;s plans in terms of which new growth will be created in the Darling-Mamre vicinity within the framework of the Boland&#x2019;s pattern of dual development and a double-town system. We read last week that difficulties were being experienced with the construction of a nuclear power station at Melkbos, which is going to desalinate sea water here on the Boland coast and which will bring about a new power supply in this area. I was pleased to see that, in spite of all these difficulties, this project would be proceeded with. In other words, thanks to what I have just mentioned, we are faced with a totally new approach, a new future as far as this, the oldest historic part of our country, i.e. the Boland, is concerned. In this process there are four aspects which I want to mention this afternoon and for which I think we must immediately get the Government&#x2019;s attention if we want to give to this new pattern which is going to develop, the right momentum and the right approach in the future. I want to mention these four aspects very briefly.</p>

<p>The first is that I think we shall have to take another and more penetrating look at this project at Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. Here in the Cape metropolis we are saddled with this tremendous concentration of our country&#x2019;s Brown people, especially on the Cape Flats. All the signs of over-concentration are there, and the population increase in many parts of this complex borders on the biological maximum today. Apart from this it is a fact that the latest figures have shown that the absorptive power of this metropolis from the Greater Boland complex is something in the region of 3,63% per year. In addition to that it is true that in this process on the Cape Flats we are engaged at present in ploughing under the vegetable garden supplying the Cape metropolis. Hon. members have seen what difficulties the Department of Transport has been experiencing in constructing the necessary railway line to these parts. I feel that from the point of view of planning we should take another look at what we are going to do here. Should we stimulate further the over-concentration in this complex?</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention&#x2014;this is actually bound up with the previous one&#x2014;is that on this growth line, to which I referred, i.e. the growth line from Cape Town in the direction of Saldanha, we should imaginatively stimulate new growth in the vicinity of Mamre and Darling. This is the project that was announced by the hon. the Minister last year. In passing I want to take off my hat today to the Department of Planning, for I am aware of the basic work that has been done of late so as to create here within the framework of the Boland pattern of a double-town system, a dual bias, growth momentum in this vicinity. There is the beautiful link with this part of the coast, Silverboom Strand, the seaside resort which is going to be built there and which will be the Sea Point of our Boland Brown population. There is, on the other hand, the fact that Darling was the first town where border-area benefits were granted. I can testify here today that in the recent past it was possible for us to lure four clothing factories there apart from the reaction from the private sector. In other words, in this specific vicinity we are faced with the situation where, if we want to use our planning <span class="col_1885-1886" refersTo="page_0956"/>machinery in South Africa correctly, we can create a model situation within our Boland pattern. I want to make an appeal to the hon. Minister. Is it not possible for us to create here new growth or faster growth to serve as a safety valve for the Cape metropolis?</p>

<p>The third aspect I want to mention, is concerned with the question of the siting of the fourth Iscor. The Government has announced this very colourful project in the vicinity of Saldanha. In the month ahead a decision has to be taken on where the fourth Iscor will be sited. Now I want to say that I do not expect an answer from the hon. the Minister this afternoon. He hails from the North-Western Cape, and if he does not answer me, I shall not exactly pick a quarrel with him. I just feel that I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without pleading for the sitting of the fourth Iscor here within the borders of the Boland. I shall tell hon. members why. The fact of the matter is that over the past number of years, as far as the creation of new future patterns in South Africa is concerned, many millions of rand have been invested in what I would call the wonder formula of separate territorial freedoms. A new world has been created between Black and White in this country. Many millions of rand have been poured into our border areas and into the Bantu homelands, and quite rightly too. It is true that &#x00BE;% of our country&#x2019;s Brown population are resident today in this old historic part of the Boland. Whereas we artificially started creating a process of spatial organization and made new provision, the effect was actually a meagre one. Last year we came forward with the announcement of border-area benefits for this first Boland town, namely Darling. The other town that was announced at the same time was, I think, Worcester. I think it is time that, seen against this background, a more extensive and effective investment could be made to give further momentum to this dual pattern between White and Brown here in the Boland as regards the development of the process of spatial organization. Therefore I want to make a plea to the effect that, when the fourth Iscor is going to be established, we shall not merely look to rands and cents but have regard to this basic fact here in the Boland.</p>

<p>The fourth aspect which I think should receive our attention since we are facing a new future now, is what I called in the beginning the concern at the taking up of our best agricultural lands here in the Paarl-Wellington valley. Sir, we simply cannot allow this process to continue like that.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Open your eyes and then you will see what is said there. Mr. Speaker, I said we were on the eve of a new situation with new emphasis on this growth line from the Cape metropolis which could serve as a safety valve for over-concentration here. The time has arrived for us to do something about this situation during the course of this very year, and I want to make this plea to the hon. the Minister: Is it not possible for us also to look with new eyes at the concern about this Paarl-Wellington valley, and is it not possible for us to create a safety valve here as well? I advocated this here in the past and this afternoon I want to repeat it: Here we have the second old traditional Coloured township in the Boland, namely Saron; and in numerous respects this particular vicinity lends itself even more today to what we have done in the vicinity of Mamre. The Saron and Gouda area is situated on the main transport route, the main railway line and the main power supply line to the North. It is situated in the heart of our water network here in the Boland, namely Saron. This area also has some of the poorest agricultural land here in the Boland. It has wind to counteract pollution. It has a natural link with this old traditional Coloured township, Saron. Let us take a fresh look at this particular vicinity in the light of what we have done in the Mamre-Darling vicinity. Let us grant border-area benefits to the two adjacent towns, i.e. Porterville and Turbagh, and create a new growth point here. If we do that, I think we shall be making full use of this new pattern with which we are faced here in the Boland. In view of what I mentioned to you as having happened over the past few months, we shall be creating a totally new and rounded off pattern for the future, a pattern in which a new process of spatial organization will be applied. We shall be able to look at a new world in which White and Brown can live side by side. Please note, Sir, we cannot wish away from us this large concentration of Brown people in the Boland. As far as I can see, they will be there in our generation and also in the time of the next generation and the ones after that. <span class="col_1887-1888" refersTo="page_0957"/>This is a process and a situation at which we must look with new strength and imagination.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I listened with interest to the hon. member for Moorreesburg speaking, with praise, of the proposed development of the Sishen/Saldanha Bay scheme, a subject which is obviously close to his heart, covering a group of people and an area of country in which we know he has a great interest. But, we are dealing with a motion which notes with appreciation a number of things, one of which is the progress that has been made with the policy of multi-national development, and the other is the importance of planning in order to further that multinational development. Sir, I would like to put one question to the hon. member for Moorreesburg. I want to ask him whether what I am about to say is representative of the policy of multi-national development, or whether it constitutes planning to that end. I would like to ask the hon. gentleman where the labour is to come from to build this R500 million scheme. Where is the labour going to come from, firstly, to build that scheme and, secondly&#x2014;if I could have the attention of the hon. member because I am replying to what he has just said&#x2014;where the labour is going to come from to man the big industrial development, the secondary industry, which it is envisaged will follow the building of that line. Sir, I will tell him where it will come from. Train-loads upon train-loads of workers will come from the constituency of the hon. member for Transkei&#x2014;trainloads of them, Sir, far more than we have in the Western Cape at the present time&#x2014;in order to provide the labour force for the development which the hon. member for Moorreesburg welcomes. Sir, if there is anything which is the very antithesis of what the Government stands for in its multinational development, it is just that. The whole object of the policy is not to bring train-loads of Bantu into the Western Cape, to areas where they have never been seen before; that is not the object of the policy, as I understood it. The object is to get them out, to get rid of them. This development, which I agree with the hon. gentleman is a praiseworthy planning attempt, will defeat the whole object of this motion.</p>

<p>Sir, the motion has been put forward by the hon. member for Langlaagte, a gentleman who wears two hats. His first hat is a senior member of this House, the Member of Parliament for Langlaagte; his other hat is chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission, and in that capacity he has during the last six months been extremely active. He has spent a great deal of time, in the cause of multi-nationalism, planning &#x201C;die erwe van ons vaders&#x201D;, about which I shall say a little more, in various provinces of this country, including Natal. Sir, I do not think anything can demonstrate more graphically what he has been doing than the phrase which he himself used. He said that it was necessary to go through with this planning so that we would all know &#x201C;waar die erwe van ons vaders werklik l&#x00EA;&#x201D;. I have always understood the term &#x201C;erwe van ons vaders&#x201D; to indicate that inheritance of our forebears, more particularly relating to land, which we have inherited down through the generations from our forebears. Sir, you can imagine my astonishment when I heard from the hon. gentleman that these are to be planned for us and that we are to be told the areas which our forebears have delved and dug and settled over generations and which we can now call our own. I would have thought, Sir, that we all knew those &#x201C;erwe&#x201D;; the Black man knows his &#x201C;erwe&#x201D; and the White man knows his. But, Sir, that is the whole object of the exercise. When this Government and its departments and its commissions get going, nobody knows where his own &#x201C;erwe&#x201D; are. You must remember, Sir, that in this motion we are praising the Government and expressing our appreciation of the comprehensive planning that the Government has done and the progress that it has made with the policy of multi-nationalism. I would like to say a word or two about the visit of the proposer of the motion and his commission to Natal, because the whole object of that visit was the very business of planning for the policy of multi-national development, not physical planning, Sir, not industrial planning, not agricultural planning, but purely political planning. I want to say at once, in case there are any misapprehensions, that the reception which the hon. gentleman and his colleagues received in Natal was the very opposite of what he received in certain parts of the Transvaal. He was shown courtesy and friendship and hospitality, and I may say that at that level the visit was extremely pleasant. But one must give a little serious attention to what actually took place. Before the visit a map and two lists of affected properties was issued by the department of the hon. the Minister of <span class="col_1889-1890" refersTo="page_0958"/>Bantu Administration, upon which the visit of the Bantu Affairs Commission to Natal was to take place and which was to serve as the basis for discussion. I may say that neither the map nor any of the two lists of affected properties agreed one with the other; so initially we were faced with the conundrum of which to go on. When that was finally sorted out, the commission of the hon. member for Langlaagte arrived. The very first thing he did was to disclaim all responsibility for the map which had been issued by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department at a ministerial Press conference&#x2014;that is how it was launched. But he made it clear at meeting after meeting that that map was certainly not the map of the department, it was not the map of the Minister and it certainly was not the map of the Bantu Affairs Commission. I actually made notes of this at the time the hon. member was speaking.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will say exactly what the hon. gentleman said. The hon. gentleman said it was the work of one official of the department; it did not have the stamp of authority of the department and it was merely a piece of kite-flying as a basis of discussion. That is precisely what the hon. member said at meeting after meeting at which the hon. member for South Coast and I were present. Now, Sir, you can imagine our astonishment when we were led to believe that a map involving the movements, if it were to be fulfilled, of some 300 000 to 400 000 Bantu, some 8 000 odd Whites and some 3 000 or 4 000 Asiatics and Coloureds should be launched on the public without the authority of the Government or of the commission whose job it was to inquire into it. Well, it was on that basis that we were asked to consider this. Sir, you would have thought that anyone embarking on a large scale redrawing of the boundaries of the province, would initially have done a survey in depth of the topography, of the water resources, of the human resources of all races who were to be involved, of the employment opportunities which existed and which were to be affected by the proposed changes, of the industrial potential which was available, of the agricultural and pastoral potential which was available, of the existing industrial foci present at the time, such as sugar-mills and industrial enterprises of that kind and of the infrastructure which existed, like roads, railways, telecommunication systems, power lines and bus transport, and how these things would have been affected by the proposed changes and the changes in population involved. You would have thought, Sir, that if we were to praise the Government for their planning all of this would have been done before the plan was drawn up to provide for the new political dispensation in Natal. But what did we find? Far from that having been done, here you had a plan done by one man, according to what we were told at the commission of inquiry, and the further the hearings went the clearer did it become that no investigation of any depth at all into all these relevant factors had in fact taken place. Now, let me give you an example, Sir, with reference to just two areas, of what I am saying. Let us take the Entumeni farming area, which is an intensive sugar-farming area, inland from Eshowe, and let us take Reserve No. 8 at the coast, which is a well-established Native Reserve. One of the proposals was to declare the Entumeni farming area Black and Reserve No. 8 White and to undertake a transposition of Bantu people from one area to the other. The Entumeni farming area is an area with its own sugar mill, supplied not by railway and tramline, as most mills are, but entirely by road transport. It is a marginal mill, marginal in the sense that if any of its cane supply is reduced, it goes out of action as an economic proposition. In addition, I should say it is a hilly area where in order to carry on successful, intensive sugar farming one needs high capital investment and heavy mechanical equipment such as only large-scale White farming enterprises can afford to have.</p>

<p>What did the Government&#x2019;s proposals suggest? Firstly that Bantu from a different area be introduced into that area; that is to say Bantu taken from a flat area where farming conditions are easy, where they are cheap, where the soil is light, where cheap second-hand lightweight equipment can be used to do it and where there is convenient transport to a local mill. They are to be removed from this area where conditions are ideal for small-scale peasant farming of sugar. There are very few areas in South Africa where it can be successfully done. They are to be moved to an area where that type of cheap peasant <span class="col_1891-1892" refersTo="page_0959"/>farming of sugar cannot be undertaken. That is the first point which any farmer in Zululand could have told the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. Not only that, but it is an accepted fact that in all Bantu agriculture in the sugar industry the production per acre is roughly half of that of the White areas. This means that with that given acreage of land the production of sugar for the Entumeni mill would have been substantially reduced under the Bantu system of agriculture and it would have ceased to be an economic operation because it is a marginal enterprise.</p>

<p>Further, so inadequate was the investigation that a significant percentage of the farms that supply the mill at Entumeni&#x2014;and as anyone who knows sugar will know, you are to supply a given mill under quota and in this instance, apart from quotas, there was the physical difficulty of those farms being unable to supply any other mill, because of the lack of transport facilities&#x2014;were not to go Black; they were to stay White. You would have the position under independence, which all this is aimed to bring about, that certain of the White farmers there would supply a mill in a foreign state.</p>

<p>I know you have. [Interjections.] What is the point I am trying to establish? I am trying to establish that in one small corner of a whole province&#x2014;this is repeated over and over again&#x2014;with reference to one comparatively small economic enterprise, a mill and its surrounding cane farms, there was a complete bungle because there had been no analysis in depth, there had been no survey, there had been no proper planning before this blueprint was introduced. One can go on to quote example after example of cases of this kind.</p>

<p>I can give you another case. At Empangeni, about 40 miles away from the place that I mentioned, there is a large fruit factory relying almost entirely on the canning of pineapples which it exports overseas. It is a very large enterprise. Its principal point of supply is a very large pineapple estate owned by itself, but which is situated in a different area.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman may not like it, but I propose to say it. Here you have a pineapple factory whose economic life depends upon a pineapple estate owned by itself about ten miles away. So good was the planning of the department and of the Bantu Affairs Commission before it that this enterprise was cut in half under these proposed plans. Half of it was to go to KwaZulu for Bantu peasant occupation and the other half to remain in White ownership. The result would have been, of course, that not only the agricultural side of it became uneconomic, but the factor would have had to close down as well&#x2014;entirely uneconomic! There is a second example. Let us go to further examples on the side of the Bantu. Let us come back to the same Reserve area, Reserve No. 8, which I have just mentioned and let us look at the position of the Bantu there. You have in this Reserve two types of Zulu. There is the fellow who has become westernized and runs a little cane farm for his own profit&#x2014;the same as you and I might do, but on a smaller scale. Then we have the tribalized Native living there as well, who is farming under the old tribal system with a few head of cattle, some mealies and his family and himself working either full-time or part-time on the White farms nearby. Then you have the womenfolk going daily to work, doing what we call to labour coming back to their homes at night because there are children in the kraal. Not only do you need land for the occupation of the Zulu farmer, you also require part-time occupation, which is provided by the White farmer for the womenfolk and the juveniles and without which many of those people would starve because the Reserves cannot now provide a livelihood for all the people that are required to live there. If all these people were to be moved to Ntumeni, they would virtually be entirely surrounded by Native Reserves. Only by long-distance transport could work be provided <span class="col_1893-1894" refersTo="page_0960"/>for the women and the juveniles, who can get it after a 20 minutes&#x2019; ride on somebody&#x2019;s vehicle in the area in which they are sitting at the present time.</p>

<p>Sir, I have given just two examples, which one could multiply over the whole of Natal. Here a plan was seriously put forward for the consideration of people to whom it was of intense interest, because they were affected the moment this plan was published. In many instances, if your farm fell into a proposed Black area, you could neither raise money on it nor sell it, before anything was done, merely because of the issue of a plan which was the handiwork of one member of the Minister&#x2019;s department. I know of instances where wealthy families where there had been a death, had to raise tens of thousands of rands for death duties and were financially embarrassed, since they could not raise money from a bank, because the farm happened to fall in the proposed Black areas on this map. There were serious implications involved, and I think it is an incredible state of affairs that this could have been done and proposals put forward for discussion without even the most elementary survey of what is involved. As I am reminded, this is what we are supposed to congratulate the Government on. I may say that we still do not know the final answer. The hon. the Minister or the chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission, one or other, or both, are rather like the blushing bride, a little nervous of revealing their charms apparently. But, Sir, it has to be done and it has to be done soon.</p>

<p>I must conclude. But let me try to summarize the difficulties the Government is faced with here. I do not blame entirely either the Bantu Affairs Commission or the hon. the Minister for the situation that has arisen, because their policy demands the impossible. Their policy demands the consolidation of the Bantu areas of Natal for political reasons, without regard to the basic infrastructure which exists in that province. The infrastructure&#x2014;the roads, railways and other communications&#x2014;and the economic advantages, have been built up largely by the White people in the White areas. In between the White areas are scattered a large number of Bantu areas. Those Bantu areas, in the way the province has grown over the last 150 years, are dependent in every way on the infrastructure which is in the White areas. The hon. member for Langlaagte was sent off there to do the impossible, to create a political consolidation which was at complete variance and in conflict with the physical infrastructure which already existed. So, you see, Sir, one can condemn the Government out of hand for not having done any sort of survey such as I may say the Natal Provincial Administration has already done for part of Natal, for far less involved considerations than the political re-drawing of the map. The Natal Provincial Administration has done some of these, but Zululand is the one area which the province has not yet touched in this regard. The Government has done nothing in that regard at all. We should not be praising the Government for the comprehensive planning it has done and the progress it has made in multinational development. In respect of Natal, the development began last year, 1972, for the first time. It was not anybody else who hindered the Government in the implementation of its policy in Natal. They did not even try to implement it until last year. Then, where one condemns them&#x2014;one may and should condemn them out of hand&#x2014;is that they embarked upon a largescale consolidation scheme of this kind without having done any scientific analysis of the situation beforehand at all. The result has been an immense feeling of insecurity, principally amongst the Whites, but also reaching to certain of the Bantu, many of the Coloureds and a lot of the Indians. There is furthermore the embarrassment which now attaches in respect of the whole business. I do not believe there is anything which can better support the amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow than the situation in Natal at the present time resulting from the Government embarking upon its so-called policy of consolidation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened attentively to the hon. member for Zululand. It was not my intention to take part in this discussion, but it is becoming very apparent that a great deal is being said about the Bantu and the Bantu areas. Pursuant to what was said by the hon. member for Zululand it is necessary for me now to express a few thoughts. I understand, of course, that being the leader of the United Party in Natal, the hon. member holds a responsible position. Prior to being elected he started asserting himself at the meeting held in his constituency, <span class="col_1895-1896" refersTo="page_0961"/>at his home town. I shall come back to that in a moment. But now he wants to build on that by speaking in a disparaging manner.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to say at once that I strongly object to the fact that at a public meeting of the Bantu Affairs Commission that hon. member tried to make a big fuss and referred disparagingly to the plans that had been submitted. He used the same words, &#x201C;unscientific&#x201D; and &#x201C;unplanned&#x201D;, and I now want to invite the hon. member to my office in order to show him the written report which accompanied that plan. He spoke of one official. That official was in charge. His name is mentioned, but he is not the only person who is working with that. A whole section of people are involved in that matter. I can tell the hon. member that the section of my department and that particular official also consulted the Department of Planning, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the sugar industry. They went into the matter in reasonable detail.</p>

<p>I am not aware of that, nor do I think the interpretation of the hon. member for South Coast is quite correct. We arranged for the official in charge of the section which prepared the plans, namely the planning branch of my department, to accompany the commission because he, as a senior official, was also very conversant with that matter. I think he was introduced in that capacity, but the interpretation given to it now is as though only one person was supposedly responsible for it. I do not think there is any need for us to quarrel about this matter. Let us now inform them what the position is. I was informing them by saying that there had in fact been a thorough inquiry and that various branches of the Public Service had been consulted in regard to the preparation of that plan. I have obtained in writing from the people concerned a very fine motivation for that plan. If the hon. member wants to come over to have a look at it, I can show it to him. Then he will accept that what he said here is not really the case. Then he can apologize to the official, who is a very capable official and who has rendered long service not only in the interests of the Public Service but also in the interests of the country, for the rubbish of which he delivered himself at a public meeting. He being the one who is uninformed, he has made these wild allegations without orientating himself and ascertaining precisely what the position is.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Those examples were checked again. I told him that the inquiry had not been made in detail, as he would have liked it to be. Now you can understand, Mr. Speaker, that if one submits plans in respect of which one wants to obtain the views of the whole community involved in the matter, one cannot work out all the details first. There is no point in doing that. As one has ascertained the feelings and the views of the community and of the industries that are involved, one goes further and then the final plan is prepared. The approach is to consult the public as far as possible before final plans are prepared. These final plans are now being put forward after thorough preparation and a thorough study of the problems encountered in practice. The hon. member mentioned the case of sandy soil as against the better soil of Reserve No. 8, and said that the people could not plant sugar there. We are aware of those problems. But I can tell you, Sir, that I am at the same time engaged in negotiations with the sugar industry for bringing about a large-scale revolution in the production of sugar in the Bantu areas. We have been thinking of making the mill at Entumeni an out and out Bantu mill and of pushing up its production so that it might be worth-while. We are engaged in all those things, but they are not relevant when a public inquiry is being made. It cannot be expected that we must make available a host of scientific particulars. I am outlining the background to the hon. member, and now he simply says that it happened everywhere that no investigations were made. I want to tell him that there were cases where the officials, on the strength of all their consultations and their investigations, arrived at findings with which he will not agree and with which many other people will not agree. However, that is no reason for referring disparagingly to people who did a very thorough job. With a great fuss reference is now being made to a small error on the map as compared with the name-list of farms. Large numbers of farms are involved here, and certain farms were mentioned whose boundary lines did not agree with the lines on the maps. This is in fact the case. This type of error can creep in. It was eliminated and the discussion continued. I only feel that it is very unfair to intervene at any stage in a large-scale planning which is in the process of being developed, and to say that it is wrong and unscientific. Reference was made to the question of pineapples. We know that there are industries at various places and that in the process of consolidation, for instance, a factory will have to relinquish land of the Whites who are serving it. All these are factors that must be taken into account. There are 110 factors exercising an influence when one has to plan for these removals. Now the hon. members says that we are only concerned with politics. Basically politics are important, for what is involved here is that one must draw clear lines for Whites and non-Whites in this country for their places of residence. This is being done in order to get political stability. I am telling that hon. member that if one does not have political stability, one cannot get economic stability either. According to the line of reasoning he followed here this afternoon, the existing Black spots must remain as labour reservoirs for the community surrounding them, and then all the problems will be solved. One does not solve problems that way. The approach of this side of the House is that thorough planning should be done as regards the division of land between Whites and Blacks in this country. But, no matter what criticism he may have, and we accept that criticism can be levelled, I want to tell him that this is the most meaningful effort that has ever been made in the history of this country to have a proper division of land between Whites and Blacks, and we, White South Africa and the Bantu peoples, will in the future be sincerely grateful for this effort that was made. I want to emphasize once again &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, those are proposals for the public and they are still going to be submitted to this House. I repeat that those were proposals put forward by the Department&#x2014;even if this has already been said repeatedly. However, they are still subject to inquiry. The Bantu Affairs Commission under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Langlaagte went out to investigate the position and listen to public representations. In the light of these representations they drafted a report to the Minister, and from that report which they drafted, along with the department&#x2019;s report, we shall submit proposals to this House. This House will refer them to a Select Committee. On that committee the hon. members serving on it will also be able to make their respective contributions. Instead of letting off steam in public against the department and its officials, that hon. member is, I hope, going to get the opportunity to make a positive contribution with all his scientific approaches so as to help us to find a meaningful solution to these problems. In any case, this is the procedure, and while I am speaking I want to express my appreciation to the Bantu Affairs Commission, to its members and especially to its chairman, for the work they have been doing in this regard in conjunction with officials of the department over the past year. I have already said that this is the most meaningful task that has ever been undertaken in this country in this regard. We had the co-operation of several branches of the Public Service, and we hope and trust that a very important decision will flow from it, a decision which will determine the relationships between Black and White in this country in the future. As far as these matters are concerned, I want to say in general that we do not only see the Bantu as people who have to sell their labour to the Whites and whose places of residence must be such that they are useful and within easy reach. These things will in fact play a role, a major role, because the Whites in this country are the persons with the spirit of enterprise giving the stimulus to development, and so forth. If we want to have permanent peace and peaceful coexistence in this country, it must also be possible for those Bantu to develop to the level of being employers in this country. This is the approach and reason why these various areas in Natal and elsewhere in the country must be consolidated to form meaningful units. I can tell hon. members that it would have been much better if we had undertaken that task 20 to 30 years ago and had obtained proper borders and had brought these people together. That would have been easier. There has been large-scale development in the meantime and large numbers of people are involved, but I can tell hon. members that this side of the House, the Government, is not going to recoil from the magnitude of this task. We are going to undertake that task and we are dealing with it at the moment, as the Bantu Affairs Commission has already indicated. In spite of problems we are going to undertake this task which will help to bring about better distribution and better planning. In this matter the Minister of Planning and his department will, as far as planning is concerned, be in a position to say that there are permanent lines and that it will be possible to plan development along those lines. As far as the homelands themselves are concerned, we are engaged in large-scale physical planning. That is one major reason why we want consolidation. There will be final lines and one will be able to see how one should plan. We cannot leave Natal, which gives the impression of a patchwork quilt today, in the condition in which it is. That hon. member will agree with me. When one has 205 pieces of land for one people, then one has to contend with an impossible position. How is one going to handle that in terms of those hon. members&#x2019; approach to a federation? What part will be urban Bantu and what part will not? They simply do not have the faintest notion of how they will handle the matter. The basic planning in which we are engaged, is meaningful and important. I do not think those hon. members who are now referring to it in a disparaging manner, have really made a meaningful contribution. I therefore want to express the hope that they will be more constructive from <span class="col_1901-1902" refersTo="page_0964"/>now on. Whether they are going to do this or not, I want to give them the assurance that we are proceeding with it. It is basically important that these things be done in the interests of everybody who is involved in the matter.</p>

<speech by="#van_eck">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the second part of the motion as printed, but I want to state right at the outset that I cannot support the first part of the motion. I should therefore like to support the amendment as moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow. There are few people who would agree that there has been comprehensive planning of all parts of the Republic as is being suggested in this motion. This is simply not the case, not is it consistent with the facts. There are still many regions and districts in the Republic of South Africa where there has been no overall planning yet, and for which no guide plans have been drawn up. I think of the extensive areas in the Northern Cape, parts of the South Western Transvaal, the districts of Herbert, Barly West, Mafeking, Lichtenburg, etc. Consequently. I cannot help feeling that this motion is an extreme one and that it was moved in an effort to advertise the little work the Government has done. Perhaps some progress was made with the policy of multi-nationality and multi-national development in the past. At present there is not even a policy for the Indians. We cannot get a definite answer to what this Government is going to do with the Coloureds. There is little development for the various peoples in large areas of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Let us take the planning for the Indians on the East Rand as an example. Here our experience conforms to that of the hon. member for Zululand. The National Party Government has been trying since 1949 to remove the Indians who are living in dire conditions in Germiston and to resettle them on the East Rand. According to the policy of this Government the Benoni area has been proclaimed as the only area for the settlement of Indians on the entire East Rand. In Germiston at present there are about 30 people living in one house. At present there are still about 347 Indian families in the Asiatic Bazaar, of which 99 are owners of dwellings, while 248 families are sub-lessees. This gives an average of approximately 3,5 families per house. These particulars are based on figures I obtained from the Director of Non-White Affairs in Germiston. It is clear that it is absolutely imperative that these people should be removed to an environment in which better conditions prevail. We cannot tolerate such a situation. Benoni is only too willing to accept, to help and to accommodate these Indians, provided we also receive the necessary assistance from the Department of Planning. The problem in the present critical situation is that the Department of Planning and the Group Areas Boards cannot give a definite answer to the question of where those Indians should be resettled. In the whole of Benoni there are at present not more than about 53 flats available in which to settle this large number of families. There are large areas situated outside the municipal area of Benoni. They are situated in the municipal area of Brakpan, but according to what we have ascertained the National Party of Brakpan refuses to relinquish any part of their municipal area for the establishment of Indians. The Indian area in Benoni itself, namely Action-ville, is surrounded by industries, mining areas, etc. There is simply no room for further expansion, except for a few sites with clay sub-strata where very extensive foundations will have to be laid when houses and other buildings are erected there. If we had only been able to persuade the National Party of Brakpan, the Department of Planning and the other organizations, that problem could have been solved a long time ago. They are confined in the straitjacket of their own ideologies and the limitations of their own policy. The result is that they simply cannot accept the challenge of the future. They cannot solve the problems of the country. Consequently slim conditions of the worst kind are developing before our very eyes.</p>

<p>In the Benoni area, which has to be the future Indian area for the East Rand, we need space in which to resettle the Indians from Bakerton and those from Nigel and the other peri-urban areas. We must also make provision for the future increase, which will mean a twofold one over the next 25 years. If we do not decide soon those areas will become built-up as a result of new residential extensions. It is really becoming imperative that we do something about the conditions there. I should like to request the hon. the Minister to give his attention to this problem as soon as possible. The Indians of Actonville also live next to an adjoining area by the name of <span class="col_1903-1904" refersTo="page_0965"/>Wattville, where a large number of Bantu have at present been settled. The idea was that the Government would remove these Bantu from Wattville and take them to Daveyton so that the Bantu could all be together there, and in that way create more room for the resettlement of Indians. But, Mr. Speaker, you yourself will appreciate that Indians are not eager to occupy the houses only recently made available to them by Bantu. We also know that those Bantu would not really like having to go all the way out to Daveyton to travel daily from there by train, at a far higher cost, to their present places of work to which they are at present able to walk. The other problem which will arise as a result of that is the following one: The Indians are to a large extent dependent upon those Bantu because they trade with them. As a result of this trading with the Bantu in the neighbouring Bantu township of Wattville, this Indian community is completely self-sufficient and in no way a burden to the State. If these Bantu now have to be removed, a task which I should not like to undertake and which the officials there would not like to undertake either, I can assure you, Sir, that that Indian community will become dependent on the State. They will simply be unable to maintain themselves.</p>

<p>We see similar planning in other parts of South Africa where Bantu have been removed from certain areas where they were previously living. One could almost say that they are banished to areas such as Sada and Dimbaza and Bathlaros in the Kalahari where they lose their animals, where there are no work opportunities, and if one visits those areas one sees women and large numbers of children there without the head of the household, without the husband who has to maintain discipline. He is working as a migrant labourer somewhere on the Witwatersrand. He only comes home annually to beget another child. He comes home to spend a few weeks there and then returns. We have found on the Witwatersrand that it frequently happens that this migrant labourer not only keeps a concubine in Johannesburg, but that he also spends his total income on her, and consequently one finds that his own family, his wife in the homeland, starves, and as a result the taxpayer of South Africa has to subsidize those people. Sir, does this look like proper economic planning? It is perhaps ideological planning in terms of the policy of the Nationalist Party, but it is not planning in the interests of the growth and progress of South Africa.</p>

I do not want to say much about that, except to just ask him what the United Party&#x2019;s policy actually is in respect of the Indians and the Coloureds. If I understand their policy correctly, in this respect they have, too, already taken over Government policy. If I am to judge from the drawings, in which they present graphically how they see the political scheme of things for the future, they are giving the Coloureds not only one legislative assembly, but two.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as the positions of the Coloureds and the Indians are concerned, the policy of this Government was already summed up here last year in a debate about the Coloureds, which I myself introduced, when we advocated that in future full-fledged&#x2014;and I underline the world &#x201C;full-fledged&#x201D;&#x2014;towns and cities should be planned for the Coloureds. Because we know that we must share this country with these minority groups, we also believe consequently that the Coloureds can only come into their own if they are ordered in a community in such a way that they have not only a residential area, but a full-fledged town and city in which they can live their lives to the full. If the United Party wants to make a good contribution to the future happiness of Indians and Coloureds in South Africa, they could also just take over fully this part of the National Party&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>Sir, I think the motion, which the hon. member for Langlaagte moved, has come at a very fitting moment. The Department <span class="col_1905-1906" refersTo="page_0966"/>of Planning was established on 5th August, 1964. In August of this year this department will be about nine years old. This department has now had the opportunity, over a period of almost a decade, to show the direction in which it is moving and what role it can play in the body politic in South Africa.</p>

<p>But it is also important, for a second reason, to look at the role of the Department of Planning at this stage. In its policy of multi-national development, the National Party has, at this stage, almost brought what were formerly depressed areas, and which were called Bantu homelands in the course of time, to the point where we can think of national states for the various Bantu ethnic groups in South Africa. We shall have to give fresh thought in future to how we must plan South Africa to ensure that the relationship between these Bantu states and White South Africa can best be arranged and regulated. There is also a third reason why I think we must take a fresh look at the role of this department; it has started to become clear that what I mentioned here at the beginning of last year, bloc formation in the world, is something that will take shape at a much more rapid pace in the future. On that occasion I pointed out that Europe is now becoming unified and that Britain and its partners have now also entered the European Common Market, so that we virtually get a united Europe; that in such a situation a country like Japan, with its powerful industrial machine, will now have to find a market in the world for its products, and that it is consequently not difficult to predict that in time a big economic bloc will also come into being in the East. Two days after I expressed that idea here, an article appeared in the Cape afternoon paper in which attention was drawn to the steps Japan has taken, and intends to take, in the regulation of its relations with Red China. A while later an article again appeared in the same afternoon paper in which there was an exposition of the appeals made by Soviet Russia to Japan, in particular, to make a big contribution to the development of Siberia. I believe that these are but the first signs of the establishment Of what will eventually be one of the biggest power blocs in world history, i.e. that in the East a great economic bloc will come into being. It will inevitably have to come because Japan is excluded, to a greater extent, from the market in America and to a large extent from the market in Europe, and it will consequently have to try to create a bloc in the East where it can sell its products.</p>

<p>The question is now what the position is of South Africa, in particular, we who are more dependent upon imports and exports than virtually any other developed country in the world. Therefore I think that the Department of Planning, in particular, must help South Africa to develop in such a way that it can play the proper role in the establishment and the development of a bloc, too, in our part of this continent. I have already mentioned that South Africa, virtually more than any other developed country in the world, is dependent on imports and exports. If one looks at the percentages that go to make up imports and exports, as against the total national product, and one compares this with other countries, one gets a picture in which it is about 8% for the United States&#x2014;i.e. the percentage of its imports and exports in relation to its national product&#x2014;and in the case of Great Britain, which is preeminently a trading country, it is about 28%. In the case of South Africa, however, it is about 40%. This underlines the fact that South Africa is, in particular, a country that must take note of its export and import position. We must consequently ensure that our country develops in such a way that specifically because of this factor, which affects its future more than that of any other country, it will develop to the utmost and that its economy will never suffer any damage. Today I just briefly want to underline the two tasks which the Department of Planning carries out in this country, as I see it. The first is to let South Africa develop in such a way that it can play its proper role on this sub-continent. The second task is to ensure that South Africa, as a national entity, develops in such a way that its resources are utilized to the utmost and that we also have balanced development throughout South Africa. As far as the first role is concerned, i.e. that South Africa must be planned in such a way that it can play the best possible role on this sub-continent, I want to point out that before one can think further along these lines, one must see what the South Africa of the future is going to look like. If we were to look at what is happening on the west and east coasts, we would see that as far as both Angola and Mo&#x00E7;ambique are concerned, virtually all their development is centered on large cities at the coast. In the north of Angola one <span class="col_1907-1908" refersTo="page_0967"/>gets Cabinda, where fairly rich oil wells have been discovered, and to the south one gets Luanda, Benguela, Lobito and Mo&#x00E7;amedes. If one looks at the east coast one gets, from the south of Mo&#x00E7;ambique to the north, Louren&#x00E7;o Marques, Beira and now also Nacala. One finds, therefore, that the chief development in these neighbouring states of ours is not in the interior, but along the coast. It now becomes clear to one that if South Africa wants to play its proper role in southern Africa, its trade routes, as far as future trade is concerned, must not be in the form of long railway lines that run across national borders that can be closed with five minutes&#x2019; notice, that they must not be in the form of long railway lines that are subject to sabotage, that they must not incorporate an expensive process of transport by rail from South Africa to the north, but that they should pre-eminently take the form of ocean transport, of coastal navigation. I therefore think that if the Department of Planning wants to draw up a guide plan of how the South Africa of tomorrow should look, it will have to regard South Africa&#x2019;s role in southern Africa and ensure that this over-concentration in the P.W.V. area is avoided, that more balanced development should come about and that the pattern, which has now been created with the development of Richard&#x2019;s Bay in Natal, and also with the newly announced development in the Western Cape, i.e. that at Saldanha Bay, shall become the pattern of the future. I therefore want to make an appeal to the effect that the Department of Planning, in its view of a guideplan for the country as a whole, should bear in mind the fact that we shall only be able to play our role to the full if our export industries of the future are established in cities at the coast.</p>

<p>In this connection I also want to point out that the total production of the manufacturing sector in South Africa was R2 100 million in 1967. In that year the exports of the manufacturing sector amounted to R690 million. In that year the manufacturing sector exported about one-third of what it produced. It is now estimated by the Industrial Development Corporation that our total national product at the end of this century will be about R58 000 million, and that the contribution of the manufacturing sector ought then to be R21 000 million. If the 1967 pattern continues at the end of this century, it would mean that the manufacturing sector will have to export goods to the value of about R6 000 or R7 000 million per year to countries abroad. This means that an enormous part of our total production will have to be destined for export. It goes without saying, as far as I am concerned, that these export goods can only be competitive on the world market, not only in southern Africa, but throughout the world, if we ensure that our future export industries are concentrated in what I should like to call coastal cities. I therefore think we can be grateful for the fact that the Government has decided that this Saldanha project must now be tackled. It is a project that will perhaps only bear its first fruit four years from now, but because it will be tackled now it will, in fact, be able to do its share in time, as it grows, to ensure that there is sufficient room for the establishment of industries in places situated at the coast.</p>

<p>I do not want to elaborate on this subject any further, except just to point out that one of the biggest projects in which South Africa can co-operate, for the good of this whole sub-continent, is the tourist industry. It is one of the industries where no other country can play the role that South Africa plays, specifically because South Africa is a part of this area. I believe that in the years to come tourism can become one of the foremost spheres of cooperation, in particular between South Africa and our neighbouring states, because in this sphere we do not compete but cooperate with them so that this area as a whole can play a bigger role in world tourism. If we see this pattern of development in South Africa, i.e. that in our case, as in the case of Angola and Mo&#x00E7;ambique, large cities develop all along our coasts, we shall be able to create something that can become virtually unique in the world, i.e. a tremendous, new tourist route that stretches from one side of Africa, virtually from the equator, virtually to the equator on the other side of Africa. It would reach from Luanda on the west coast to Nacala on the east coast. I believe that this could become one of the big attractions of the future in world tourism arid that we can make a big contribution towards bringing this about if we ensure that development in South Africa takes place according to this pattern.</p>

<p>There is also another reason why I think we must try to have industries develop at the coast. We live in a warm region, in a warm, dry country, a country in which one would find it difficult, even with the development <span class="col_1909-1910" refersTo="page_0968"/>of the Orange River area, to imagine large industrial complexes in the interior, because I believe one can only obtain high productivity if people feel very happy in the area they are living in. In the first place they must not be subject to extremes of climate, and in the second place they must, as far as their families are concerned, live in the best possible conditions. I therefore believe that it is in the interests of South Africa and its industrial development that we must ensure as far as possible that our industrial development in the future will take place at the coast.</p>

<p>In this connection I should like to endorse what has already been said this afternoon by the hon. member for Moorreesburg when he advocated that the fourth Iscor be erected at Saldanha or in the Boland. We have this large concentration of Coloureds in the Cape Peninsula and the Boland, and we must consider what their future is going to be. At this stage the total Coloured population of the Cape is just under two million, but within 28 years from now their numbers, in the Cape Province alone, will be 4,5 million, and if the demographic position remains the same as it is today, there will be one-third of that 4,5 million living in the Cape Peninsula alone, i.e. 1,5 million. I do not believe this will happen, because I believe no government will allow this to become the future pattern here. I therefore think it is imperative that another large growth point be created that should not only remain an export harbour for ore, but should be a new, big city of the future. To initiate this development, we must ensure that every possible industry that can be placed there at this stage, is in fact localized there, and that is why I consider it to be essential, in spite of the claims that other areas may perhaps have, that we do not overlook this overwhelming factor, i.e. that we must find a refuge for the Coloureds of the Western Cape who will largely be living in the Boland area in future.</p>

<p>I briefly want to say a bit more about the Department of Planning itself. I have already mentioned the role it must play in determining our role in Southern Africa. I believe that in the first place this department was not established for that purpose, it was established to ensure that balanced development will take place in our own country. As things have developed in the past 8&#x00BD; years, we already have a reasonably clear picture of what this department will be like. We have taken note of the results they have already achieved in the studies of various regions that have been completed from time to time, and the guide-plans that have already been drawn up for certain areas. I think, however, that we must see the role of this department in a much wider sense. Unfortunately South Africa&#x2019;s pattern of development has thus far been such that all development has virtually taken place in only three areas. About 50% of the manufacturing sector has been concentrated in the P.W.V. area and a further 30% in the Durban and Cape Town areas, so that these three areas take care of about 80% of the production of secondary industries in South Africa. I believe it is our duty, as members of the present generation, to ensure that this development is decentralized to a much greater extent in the future. I want to link up with an idea that has already been expressed by other members, i.e. that we should not see every small spot in South Africa as a new growth point. In that way we shall never serve any one of these areas. We must rather ensure that there is first centralization before there is further decentralization. The task of the various regional development associations must therefore not be to agitate for every small town to be given border area benefits, etc. All of them can surely not hope to draw secondary industries. Their task should much rather be to ensure that, besides the few selected growth points, supplementary development takes place in their own areas.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we all agree with the hon. member for Vasco that there must be development in the country and that there has in fact been a certain measure of development. We, however, say that development has not been sufficient and that under this Government&#x2019;s ideological policy development cannot take place properly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg referred to the development at Saldanha. I want to confirm what the hon. member for Zululand has said, namely that the establishment of that scheme is going to mean the establishment of yet another big Black city alongside Saldanha Bay. In any event, the Blacks are going to be brought in to help in the development of the scheme and to build it up. The establishment of this <span class="col_1911-1912" refersTo="page_0969"/>big scheme there is, in fact, therefore contrary to the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister apparently this morning said that he was the supreme commander over all the other departments in so far as the planning of this country is concerned. He reminds me of General Wavell. When General Wavell was removed from the Middle East to the Far East during the last war after Japan came in, there was confusion in the Far East. General Wavell wrote back to Mr. Churchill and said: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t mind holding the baby, but why give me twins?&#x201D; This is what is happening to this poor Minister. He has not only got the baby, he has got twins, because in his planning he cannot intervene or interfere in the Bantu areas. I am surprised that the hon. member for Langlaagte should have introduced this motion. He is the very one who should know that we cannot possibly appreciate the comprehensive planning of this Government. He in his capacity as chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission knows that the planning has not been anything but comprehensive, especially in so far as the Bantu areas are concerned. Now, what progress has been made in regard to multi-national development? This year the hon. the Prime Minister appointed a socio-economic commission to help him plan the future of the Coloureds. This Government has been in power for 25 years. Only now, after 25 years, when they reach a stalemate do they appoint a commission to help them. What happened earlier on when Dr. Verwoerd was still alive? He realized that he had no plan. He realized that the Nationalist Government had no multi-national development plan. So he appointed a socio-economic commission to help him, the Tomlinson Commission. What I have here is the abridged form of their report; the full report consists of many volumes. One of the main recommendations of this commission was that the Whites must be allowed to play their part in the development of the reserves. I do not have time to read all the relevant references, but I have them all here. Another recommendation was that the Government should spend at least R208 million in ten years. This report was tabled in 1956, but Dr. Verwoerd rejected the main recommendatons of that commission. Had Dr. Verwoerd accepted the commission&#x2019;s recommendations, we might have seen some development in the Bantu areas. But he rejected the recommendations of his own commission, because they did not fit into his ideological plan. Had they carried out the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission, the Whites would have been in the Transkei and the other reserves long ago helping to develop. Dr. Verwoerd said the money recommended to be spent by the commission was far too much and was not necessary. He did not even establish the development corporation the commission suggested. What do we find now? Individuals have to come in to help the Government. Mr. Rupert is now starting a bank to help develop the Bantu areas. They have gone completely back on Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy. Now the Whites are being asked to go into the reserves. One only has to go into the Transkei and see the development which is taking place now. But it is too late. This development has taken place in the last two to three years and there is certainly some development now with the arrival of the Whites. White enterprise is now allowed to help them. To see how contrary to Government policy this development now taking place is, one has only to read what Mr. Prinsloo, a senior official, said in 1955: &#x201C;All expansion of industry and other European interests in the Transkei has now stopped, and there is no hope that permission would be granted by the Department of Native Affairs for extensions.&#x201D; This is what Mr. C. W. Prinsloo, chief information officer of the department said. He went on: &#x201C;Umtata and other European settlements should be regarded as temporary European townships which would in time be taken over by the Natives as they progress in their development and become able to manage their own affairs. The department is not in favour and will not permit any further development of European interests in these townships.&#x201D; You must go to Umtata now and see what is happening there. The Minister himself is buying up land for White occupation, for building blocks of flats, because they have to bring in White entrepreneurs to help them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vasco referred to tourism and he appealed for further planning in tourism. I agree with everything he has said, but one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country is being neglected and is not allowed to be developed for tourists. I am talking about the Transkei, the coast of the Transkei. Hotels are not allowed to be built to attract tourists. I have appealed before for this area to be <span class="col_1913-1914" refersTo="page_0970"/>developed. It is the biggest tourist attraction we have, but because of the Government&#x2019;s ideological policy nothing can be done. Dr. Verwoerd wished to rely on the peasants&#x2019; subsistence economy to provide for the development of a country with millions of people, and he failed. Mr. Blaar Coetzee, when he was Deputy Minister, tried to bolster up the morale of his people by saying what development was taking place. He made a speech in 1966, and hon. members will remember that he staked his whole political future on the fact that the Blacks would eventually go back to the Black areas. Well, we know what has happened to his future! In 1966, that means 12 years after the Tomlinson Commission had been appointed, he said: &#x201C;The Bantu Investment Corporation was established only about five years ago and the Xhosa Development Corporation only last year.&#x201D; The Tomlinson Commission recommended the formation of these corporations in 1956; so five years were wasted. He also referred to the humble beginning of industry in the Transkei which was taking place, but too much time had been wasted. I do not have time to go through the rest of his speech, but we see now seven years later, that he was talking absolute nonsense about what development he hoped would take place in the reserves and that the Africans in the townships would be taken back to the reserves. I do not blame this Minister, and I do not blame the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development for what is happening, because they have been left with the baby. The fault was made by Dr. Verwoerd when he laid down his policy in terms of his ideology. That is when the mistake was made and now they are trying to catch up. They cannot hope to catch up and give sufficient jobs for the natural increase in the reserves. Take the Transkei, the best developed of all the reserves. There is no hope of catching up with the natural increase in the population, so how can they possibly hope to establish enough work for those in the White townships who have to go back to the reserves? There is unemployment in the Transkei. You only have to read the discussions in their Assembly how they complain about the conditions under which their men have to work in the White areas, the conditions of recruiting, the migrant labour&#x2014;they are all up in arms. One only has to read the discussions in their Parliament to see that pages and pages of their Hansard are filled with that. Although the conditions are so unsatisfactory they have to leave the Transkei because there is no work for them in the reserve. As I have said, the most progress has been made in the Transkei. But what is the reaction of the Transkeian leaders themselves? We know that Chief Kaiser Matanzima supported the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. He was the first of the African leaders to support it and he played ball with the Government all along. He was critical of the other Opposition parties and did what the Government wanted him to do. But what is his reaction now? This is what he said on 29th January this year: &#x201C;Those of us who have co-operated with the Government in finding a solution, are showing signs of despondency because of the insincerity of the White man in carrying out the policies to their logical conclusions. We shall therefore not be accused of being double-faced if we launch a consistent attack on the Republic Government and accuse them of policies which will forever deprive the Black man of his means of livelihood on his own land.&#x201D; That is the complaint of an African leader who was sympathetic to the Government&#x2019;s policy. We find that other African leaders are taking the same line, they are becoming more and more critical. Chief Gatsha Buthelezi sees no future for Zululand if he is only granted the area the Government proposes to give him when Zululand is consolidated. One of the problems we have in our development is that we are wasting our main asset, namely the supply of labour which we have all round us. We are wasting it because we are not training our labour properly. We do not have sufficient trade schools to make these men skilled. If we had more skilled men we could have more development and more progress. I accuse this Government of neglecting the Africans living in the urban areas. There are no trade schools for them; they have to battle to get any kind of education. There should be technical colleges for these people. I heard the figures given by this Minister of Immigration this morning. The immigration figures are in fact dropping. We had fewer immigrants last year than we had the year before last and even fewer this year. That means that we have to find the extra labour here and the labour has to be trained. But this Government&#x2019;s planning does not provide for that. Unfortunately my time is up and my indictment against <span class="col_1915-1916" refersTo="page_0971"/>this Government is that it is not doing proper planning for the future of this country.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Minister said officials of my department were consulted.</p>

<p>*I should like to reply to the hon. members for Hillbrow and Benoni if there is sufficient time, for they raised specific matters. But first I should just like to react to the matters raised by the hon. member for Moorreesburg. I think that they are of importance to us.</p>

<p>In the first place the hon. member discussed Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. The position there is that this matter has a long history. Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain did not spring up overnight like a mushroom. In the &#x2019;sixties and perhaps even before that, serious consideration was being given to the development of proper beach facilities for the Coloureds. Something exceptionally good was found for them in the entire Strandfontein area. In that time already it was clear that the residential expansion for the Coloureds in the Cape Flats would have to link up with that fine and large piece of coastal area which the Coloureds received on the Strand side of Muizenberg, i.e. the Strandfontein area. Therefore I do not think it was wrong to think in that direction. There was the pressing need for Coloured housing on the Cape Flats. I can only tell the hon. member that when the matter was brought before me for the first time the Divisional Council had a housing shortage in regard to 19 000 families, which it in fact had on its hands and had to find houses for. The Cape Town City Council had 13 000 Coloureds on its hands, who were living on the Cape Flats and whom it had to find houses for. This gave a total of 32 000 houses which were urgently required two years ago for the Coloureds on the Cape Flats. These were for people who were living in squatters&#x2019; conditions, or were living in overcrowded conditions. We were receiving complaints from many people and from many quarters. We then proclaimed this area. It is not a rich agricultural area. There was fine silica sand on one part of it, and this we reserved. The rest we then proclaimed for development. I do not think we could at this stage intervene and draw a line through the housing planning for Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. That would be impossible. At that stage, and even up to <span class="col_1917-1918" refersTo="page_0972"/>the beginning of this year we thought, in fact, that it would take us at least four to five years to establish the first housing in Mamre. We cannot allow the backlog which existed to continue or become worse, for it is constantly becoming worse. Consequently I think the hon. member will simply have to accept that the development of Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain will continue. Last year or the year before last I said that I would proclaim no further Coloured group areas here, except for rounding off purposes. I shall abide by that statement. Consequently Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain is the last major development area for Coloureds for residential purposes on the Cape Flats.</p>

<p>We come then to Saron, which the hon. member also mentioned. I want to say that I think he has a good case there. I should very much like in my time, if it is in any way possible, to do something to alleviate the pressure which exists on the Paarl / Wellington area. I do not know to what extent Stellenbosch is included in this. This would really be something to which we could look back with pride if we were able to accomplish something like this at the right time. The most I want to say today is that I have taken thorough cognizance of his suggestion. We shall give a little thought to this matter.</p>

<p>As far as Mamre is concerned, do you know that we have proclaimed more than 7 000 hectares in the Mamre area. Two farms have already been bought up there. The divisional council has begun, on a basis of all possible speed, to establish facilities for Coloureds there at Silverboom Strand. By means of an overseer whom they appointed there over the holiday period they made a survey there and found that over the principal holidays there were up to 2 500 Coloured visitors on one day. Without doubt we are going to establish a very fine beach development for the Coloureds there and during this year, 1973, the facilities there are going to be expanded on a very large scale.</p>

<p>I should like to mention that, after certain important transactions were disposed of yesterday, I am able to state today that the Cape Divisional Council has agreed to develop the industrial area adjoining the Coloured group area of Mamre with Government loan funds which it will receive from our Department of Planning. From that loan which we will grant to the Divisional Council, from the amount of R200 000 which we approved the other evening, it will purchase land from Cape Town. It will also cover the development costs as far as possible out of that amount. Next year we will probably request supplementary amounts for the Council. The Divisional Council will deal with the coordination of the project through a committee which it has appointed and on which the Divisional Council, the Department of Planning and the Environment, the Department of Community Development, the Province and the Decentralization Board will serve. This committee will maintain supervision over the industrial area which the Cape Divisional Council will purchase and develop with all possible speed. In any case, the Divisional Council is now proceeding with all possible speed with the development of that industrial area and the provision of the necessary services. I should like to convey my gratitude and appreciation to the chairman and the members of the Cape Divisional Council and their staff for their fine co-operation, for the spirit of goodwill which we at all times experienced from them during the negotiations.</p>

<p>I then come to the fourth point which the hon. member mentioned. The hon. member for Vasco also mentioned this. Both hon. members mentioned the fourth Iscor which has then to be established at Saldanha.</p>

<p>No, but the hon. members mentioned this. I should very much like to say that it is incorrect to speak of a fourth Iscor. There is no such thing, and it is not in the picture at all yet; in fact, it is possible that for quite a number of years no consideration will be given to a fourth Iscor. However, it is not for me to discuss this; it falls under my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Economic <span class="col_1919-1920" refersTo="page_0973"/>Affairs. All that is relevant at the moment in regard to this entire project is the semi-processing of iron ore, and I take it that that is what hon. members were discussing. The aim of the process is to manufacture cast iron or bar steel (<i>knuppelstaal).</i> I do not know precisely what one calls it. That is all that is relevant at the moment. In this connection I just want to point out that it must be clearly understood that the Northern Cape also has a claim and we cannot now from Parliament, from Iscor or from anywhere else for that matter, create the impression that a decision has in any respect been taken already. In fact, we have not even discussed it or thrashed it out; there have only been ideas that it must come, and even if it were true that it is included in the scheme in principle, that is as far as the matter has gone at present. I should just like to make this clear.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Benoni today&#x2014;and I do not want to quarrel with him for we run into one another here in the Lobby&#x2014;that I feel very much like taking him to task. The week before last that hon. member came to see me in my office with a deputation from the town councils of Benoni and Germiston, and they sat down around a table to discuss this matter with me. He then came to make certain requests to me and today he stood up here and condemned me. I am still considering the representations which they addressed to me and now he comes here this afternoon and made a political issue of these matters. What does he expect me to do now? Must I be so politically humble now as to say to him: &#x201C;Please, Mr. Van Eck, you asked me for something and then you took me roundly to task; in spite of that I shall still give you everything you asked for?&#x201D; I think it was very wrong of the hon. member to make a political issue of this matter. If he had wanted to discuss the general principle of the regional settlement of Indians on the East Rand under my Vote, he would have had a point, but he came here and discussed Benoni, he discussed Actonville and that area which is in such and such a condition. Since I told him the other day that other town councils on the East Rand have also been to see me and that they had also wanted to discuss this matter with me, and that I would give my best attention to this matter, I now feel that the hon. member could just as well have waited with this matter. Since I have now expressed my disappointment in him my duty to the country probably requires me to forgive him and to take the entire matter under consideration now on its merits. However, I hope that he will not again make such a mistake.</p>

<p>Then I also want to set the hon. member for Hillbrow straight about something. He wanted me to enter the Saldanha/St. Croix dispute; he wanted me to say to the hon. the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Economic Affairs: &#x201C;Hold on, fellows, I shall decide what has to be done here.&#x201D;</p>

Surely this was not relevant here. The hon. member wanted me to make an economic evaluation of the two projects and to decide, but surely it is the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision. The investigation of the various aspects, problems and whatever else is connected with that, was the work of my hon. colleagues, the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Economic Affairs. Of course I gave my opinion at the Cabinet meeting. My officials played a part in this and I stated my standpoint from my point of view, namely that of the Department of Planning.</p>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned on Friday, I was quoting from the report of the Van Wyk Commission to indicate certain standpoints of the commission, particularly with regard to the importance of preventive measures as far as children were concerned. It is especially important in the sense that psychiatrists in general, and only with a few exceptions, agree that the origin of mental illness can virtually always be traced back to an incident in a patient&#x2019;s childhood. Therefore, although it mainly is or seems to be a social problem, it is nevertheless necessary for us in the discussion of this Bill to pay attention to this extremely important matter. The Bill before this House makes no attempt to prescribe any arrangement with regard to preventive measures, and I presume that attention will be given to this matter at a high level or at another level on another occasion. To me, however, this is mainly an educational problem. In the first place it is an educational problem concerning children, particularly with regard to special education.</p>

<p>But there is also another aspect concerning education which is extremely important with regard to this matter, and that is the education of parents. Although the hereditary aspects of mental illness are extremely important, one must have regard to the fact that children suffering from mental defects, can benefit a great deal from effective, special education.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This afternoon I should like to make a special appeal to all parents in regard to this important matter. I want to put it this way: Never ever give your children more attention when they are ill&#x2014;within reasonable limits&#x2014;because by so doing you are teaching a child to make one of the most vicious mental adjustments, which is probably foremost in the aetiology of mental disorder. They learn to get love and affection through illness, and that is the crux of the whole matter.</p>

<p>*Finally there is the question of hospital boards. I had the privilege to serve as chairman of such a hospital board for several years. This afternoon I should like to bring a matter to the attention of this House, seeing that we are discussing this Bill, which flows from the practical problems in connection with the handling of mental illness. It concerns the question of State President&#x2019;s patients, as embodied in chapter IV of this Bill. This afternoon I want to make the allegation that there are many State President&#x2019;s patients in institutions in South Africa who are being detained there although they have completely recovered from their mental illness. The main reason for this is that no proper facilities for after-care, which would make it possible to look after these people, are often not available. But there is also another important aspect and that is the question of the humane considerations of the hospital board. I think there are many patients in that category who are not recommended for release in terms of clauses 29 or 33 chapter IV, because if such a patient were to be released, he could be prosecuted again for his original crime, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General. I think this is a matter to which we shall have to take another look in the future. Perhaps it does not belong under this Bill, but while we are discussing this important matter, I think we should just take cognizance of it.</p>

<p>Seen as a whole, however, this Bill has been prepared very well. It rests on thorough research and it is based on certain sound grounds and principles. But most important, the old tried and tested principles which were embodied in the original Act, have been retained and are embodied in this legislation we have before us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has been very interesting to listen to what the hon. member who has just sat down has had to say about the Bill. Obviously he is concerned with certain aspects of the Bill <span class="col_1923-1924" refersTo="page_0975"/>to which he thinks the Minister should give his attention. He feels that perhaps there are certain improvements which can be made in so far as the protection of the patient is concerned. I think it indicates immediately that whilst we all agree that this Bill is well-founded and that its framework is sound, it will nevertheless be the vehicle which is to turn this framework into a living, operative vehicle for dealing with mental illness that will be the cardinal factor in the success of the Bill as it has now been presented to us. There is no doubt that the report of the Van Wyk Commission, which followed on a previous commission of inquiry, namely the Rumpff Commission, indicates the importance of this whole matter to the public health of the country and, more particularly, to the interests and the protection of the citizens. I must agree with the hon. the Minister that the report of the Van Wyk Commission is not only an excellent report, but that it has many fascinating features. I should like to say that one of the important improvements that I see in the Bill, despite the fact that in the main it follows the Act of 1916, which has now been on the Statute Book for more than 50 years, is that the whole approach to mental health has now changed. We no longer talk of mental disorders; we no longer talk of idiots or imbeciles or mental defects. We now talk about people who are mentally ill. Sir, this is an important advance in the thinking of our community and, more particularly, in the thinking of the medical profession. One is now able to remove&#x2014;and I think that is the whole objective here&#x2014;the stigma which attaches to a person being dubbed a mental defective or a mentally disordered individual. It enables us to deal with people, who are in any way mentally affected, as if they were suffering from any other form of illness. Patients, both young and old, can therefore go with confidence to their medical practitioners, unfold their problems and seek advice. I think this is a very important advance in the whole concept of mental illness. With this new approach to the subject of mental illness, I believe that this Bill will give teeth to the old framework which provides for the machinery to do certain things. It is vital, Sir, that the confidence of the public should be sought in dealing with the mentally ill. We know that in the past there have been people who have kept mentally ill children at home, away from the public, away from their own families even, cooped up almost like the old man in the story of the man in the iron mask whom nobody ever saw. We have had cases where children have been chained to bed-posts and have been locked up in bedrooms over years because the parents have been afraid that a stigma might attach to the family because of the mental illness of the child. But with the development of psychiatric knowledge and the advance in medicine, there will obviously be an entirely new approach to the subject, and that is something for which we are very grateful.</p>

<p>I would like to go further and deal also with one other aspect to which the hon. member who has just sat down made some passing reference, and that is the extraordinary agreement between the views of the Van Wyk Commission and those of the Schumann Commission, both of whom regarded hospitalization, as presently administered by the provinces, as a very important feature in this new approach to mental illness. Both stress the importance of ensuring, as far as possible, that the mentally sick person is not divorced from the community; that he is not dealt with in complete isolation. I accept, Sir, that the policy of the Government is that the provincial hospitals should deal with the acute cases of mental illness. I am also aware of the fact that the definition of &#x201C;institution&#x201D; includes provincial hospitals. This indicates immediately that provincial hospitals will now be used also in cases of mental illness. There are of course, numbers of cases where people who are mentally ill need not be completely isolated. It is generally felt by medical practitioners today that mental illness should not be completely divorced from other illnesses or other infections of the body; that it should not be dealt with <i>in vacuo.</i> That is why many medical practitioners feel that people who are mentally ill, except in severe cases of mental disturbance, can be dealt with in provincial hospitals. But as I am not pleading for that at the moment; I am merely drawing the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that perhaps we will in due course, with the new approach to mental illness, permit the provincial hospitals to play an even bigger part than they have played hitherto in the treatment of these cases. I may say that it has also been pointed out to me by a psychiatrist that in many cases where people consult a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist feels that the patient could quite easily be <span class="col_1925-1926" refersTo="page_0976"/>treated in a nursing home. Clause 2 of the Bill states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person who suffers from or is alleged to suffer from mental illness shall by reason of such illness be received or detained at any place otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</block>

<p>Clause 62 then provides for penalties for failure to comply with the provisions of the Act. In view of these provisions, it is possible that some medical men may have some misgivings as to how they should treat a patient who need not necessarily be put into an institution but could be treated in a nursing home. This would apply, for example, to a person who is mentally depressed. I should like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s view is with regard to this particular aspect.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I would like to go further and deal with the place in the community of the clinical psychologist and the psychiatric social worker. I do not think that in the past we have placed sufficient emphasis on the value of the services of these two particular categories of assistants in the treatment of the mentally ill. It has been pointed out that we are woefully short of psychiatrists. I do not think the hon. the Minister will gainsay the fact that psychiatry has advanced to such an extent in the field of mental illness that we should do everything in our power to encourage and to motivate medical practitioners to graduate in the field of psychiatry. With only 128 psychiatrists in South Africa, the commission itself points out that we compare favourably with the rest of Africa, but that we are woefully short of psychiatrists in comparison with the well-developed countries of the world. I think the Minister will agree that something should be done to encourage more people to qualify as psychiatrists. I feel, too, that the Minister and his officials should do everything in their power to encourage the training of people as clinical psychologists. I know that at our universities today there are many young students who are very interested in this type of work and who are graduating as clinical psychologists. I know that in the United States this is a well advanced profession. In dealing with shortages of staff, the Van Wyk Commission also deals specifically with these two categories, i.e. the clinical psychologists and the psychiatric social workers. I am sure that with the necessary encouragement from the Government a great deal can be done in this field, not only for the patient who is mentally ill, but also in the field of after-care, which I feel is a very important aspect of mental health, once the treatment of the patient has been completed.</p>

<p>Sir, before I leave this subject, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to have a look at the definition of the word &#x201C;patient&#x201D;. A patient is described in the definition as meaning a person who is mentally ill to such a degree that it is necessary that he be detained, supervised, controlled and treated. I notice that in some quarters it is believed that the patient must be detained, supervised, controlled or treated, but the definition says &#x201C;and treated&#x201D;. In other words, unless the person concerned requires treatment, he does not fall under this Act as a person who is mentally ill. I would like the hon. the Minister to clarify that a little more fully.</p>

<p>Then, whilst I do feel that there has been a big advance in the provision of better accommodation for the housing of the mentally ill who are being treated in institutions&#x2014;State and private institutions and provincial hospitals&#x2014;I feel that greater stress must be laid today on the inadequacy of accommodation in the country. I am almost sure the hon. the Minister is well aware of this but I do feel that in a country like South Africa where we have advanced so tremendously in the field of science, and where our name in the medical world ranks very high indeed, we can set a new pace with regard to the adequacy of accommodation for the mentally ill. I think its importance lies in the fact that we will be able to encourage the disclosure of cases more easily, and that we will be able to get on top of the problem without any fear on the part of the patient. I strongly recommend that the hon. the Minister gives some thought to this particular aspect.</p>

<p>In 20 years, according to figures we have received from the Commissioner for Mental Hygiene, the number of known patients in the country increased by nearly 50%, from 17 500 to 25 500. I believe the figure is now nearly 27 000 but one wonders, if one really begins to discover all the cases in all sections and national groups in this country, whether the figure will not virtually double itself and whether we will not find ourselves with nearly 50 000 cases in the country. It has been pointed out by the hon. member for Rosettenville how <span class="col_1927-1928" refersTo="page_0977"/>vital it is and how important it is that when we find ourselves in that position, there will not be a lack of properly trained and properly equipped persons who can give treatment and deal with these cases satisfactorily.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other aspects which I think are very important. One is the question that the hon. the Minister raised under clause 13, with regard to the possibility of a loss of confidence in so far as the medical officer is concerned, when the medical officer may find himself obliged, if he finds that a person is mentally ill to such an extent that he should be treated, to lay a report before the magistrate if he finds that this person is dangerous to others. Some psychiatrists are under the impression that this may lead to a breach of the ethics and I wonder whether in the regulations something cannot be done about this particular aspect. Quite often there are weekend cases, that come to the day hospitals where the psychiatrists is available, of people who have consumed too much liquor and beat up their wives and in a sense become potentially dangerous to others. The danger is mainly to the family circle, where some form of treatment may to a certain extent allay the acuteness of the condition of the patient. There the psychiatrist finds himself in the position that if he believes that that person can be dangerous to others and &#x201C;others&#x201D; may include even the immediate members of the family, he would be in an awkward position in that if he reports the case to the magistrate, patients will no longer come and consult the day hospitals or the out-patient clinics for treatment. That is a matter which should be taken note of.</p>

<p>I would now like to exchange a few thoughts with the hon. the Minister in regard to certain amendments we on this side of the House would like to move to this Bill, amendments which we regard as important for the protection of the patient. The hon. the Minister may recall that the hon. member who spoke before me, the hon. member for Newcastle, dealt with one or two aspects which he said were important for the protection of the patient. I should just like to run through these amendments very quickly so that the hon. the Minister can be aware of what we intend to do. In clause 4(2) we find that the superintendent shall within seven days after the admission of a patient forward to the magistrate of the district a copy of the relevant application and a report on the condition of the patient. That is where a patient submits himself voluntarily for attention in an institution. I should like to suggest that when that report is made to the magistrate, the report should also be made to the Secretary so that officially the matter is before the department which, after all, is in charge of mental health.</p>

<p>Subsection (3) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A magistrate of the district in question may&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) informally visit the patient concerned;</li>

<li>(b) at any time investigate the circumstances &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>We should like to have paragraph (c) amended to read&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(c) but he shall report his findings &#x2026; to the Secretary.</li>

</ol>

<p>The subsection, as it reads at the moment, gives him a permissive right to do so, but we believe that the magistrate shall be obliged, should he visit the patient and go into the circumstances, to send his report to the Secretary. We do not want to leave it as a permissive right.</p>

<p>A problem occurs in the mind of certain medical officers in connection with clause 25, which deals with a patient who is detained in an institution and who has been fully certified. The clause provides that a report has to be transmitted from time to time to the secretary. In terms of the clause the report shall be transmitted annually for the first three years, thereafter in the 5th year and then every five years. We feel that this report should be submitted annually. Although this is an exact replica of the provision in the 1916 Act we are of the opinion, as has been pointed out to me by someone, that one would not like to find forgotten men or women in the country. If it were an annual report, it could even in some cases be merely a formal report since the conditions would not have changed radically, but it would at least give confidence to the public and to the family of the patient that that patient has been seen annually. We shall deal with this aspect further in the course of the Committee Stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_1929-1930" refersTo="page_0978"/>I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to another important aspect and that is the factor which the hon. member for Newcastle mentioned in regard to hospital boards. We believe that a board of three members is inadequate. That is also the figure used in the 1916 Act. We suggest that it should be five. We think the qualifications for instance of at least two, namely a medical officer and a legal man, should be retained, but we think there should be at least five members on the board because of other incidents that happen far more often in one&#x2019;s very much busier life today than in 1916. This will warrant a slightly larger number of people on the board. Further, instead of the board just meeting when it is necessary, it would be better if they met not only when necessary, but at least once a month so that the board can be in full touch with what is taking place in the hospital.</p>

<p>There is another very important aspect to which I think the hon. the Minister should give a certain amount to thought. I refer to clause 53, which deals with the question of the board&#x2019;s action as regards the release of patients. The clause provides that the board may by resolution, after proper inquiry, conditionally or unconditionally release a patient who has been detained. The clause further provides that if the report of the superintendent is contrary to the board&#x2019;s decision, no action can be taken unless the decision of the board is unanimous. Thereafter it says that if there has been a decision which has been in conflict with the board&#x2019;s decision, the reasons therefore shall be supplied to the Minister, but in the meantime the action has already been taken. Our wish is that if this decision be taken, but there is a conflict with the superintendent, no action shall be taken until the reasons have been submitted to the hon. the Minister for his decision and that his decision shall be final. Otherwise you can land yourself in all sorts of difficulties because if the board takes action that is in conflict with the superintendent&#x2019;s point of view and thereafter reasons are submitted, it may already be too late and one may not know what has happened to the patient. In any case it may not be a good thing for the community that there should be action of this nature without the fullest support of the Minister, especially where there is conflict with the superintendent. That clashes furthermore with clause 54, which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board shall have no authority over the superintendent &#x2026;</block>

<p>Therefore it becomes all the more important that it be dealt with from that point of view. That, amongst others are some of the amendments which we wish to move in regard to this Bill. Apart from that, we find that the Bill is acceptable, as I have already said.</p>

<p>In closing, the point I would particularly like to stress is that if we can continue to administer this legislation in the light of the new approach to the whole field of psychiatry, in a manner which will provide greater confidence for the community, and if we make use of the machinery in a more operative manner, a manner which is more in sympathy with the circumstances in our country today, I think we will have made a very great advance in the field of mental health, and I would like to wish the hon. the Minister and his department every success in the administration of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker, my colleague from Jeppes, has indicated that it is the intention of the United Party to support this Bill, but I still believe it is only right that we should highlight needs and any shortcomings which we notice, and if possible suggest improvements when we believe them to be necessary in the interest of mental health. It is quite apparent from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remarks and from the debate that there are no fundamental changes in this Bill which do not meet with the support of most of the interested parties.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister in his Second Reading speech, if I remember correctly, said that 32 copies of the Bill had been circulated to interested parties. By way of interjection, I mentioned the term &#x201C;scientologists&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister did not react particularly to that remark, but I would like to ask him if he could indicate in reply whether the body to which he referred, which noted opposition and criticism of the Bill was in fact the Church of Scientology. I feel that this gives the House an opportunity to assess the actual importance, the merits of the criticism which may have been delivered against this Bill. I believe that we must accept that the Bill will not effect an overnight change in the position in so far as mental health in this country is concerned. I think one can base that statement on the examination of reports of the Commissioner for Mental Health in <span class="col_1931-1932" refersTo="page_0979"/>previous years. I would like to refer briefly to the report for 1968-&#x2019;69. It was stated in this report that there were 31 500 outpatients who were requiring some form of treatment. It also said, and this I think is rather depressing, that nearly half the medical and nursing posts were vacant or were filled by temporary personnel. Then the report emphasized the effect of mental illness on the manpower issue. The report claimed that the vast majority of patients were craftsmen, production workers and labourers, or people without gainful occupation. This particular reference concluded with this important remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mental disease is thus not only a formidable cause of human suffering, but it aggravates the current manpower shortage.</block>

<p>The 1969 report of the Commission on Mental Health is, I believe, more encouraging because it indicated that there had been an increase in admissions, which clearly showed, it said, that the prejudice against mental hospitals had been largely overcome. It put down as one of the main reasons for the break down in prejudice, the high standard of treatment offered and the improved facilities that had been provided. However, it made two noteworthy remarks. Firstly, it emphasized that there was limited accommodation available in institutions for mental defectives and, secondly, also drew attention to what it considered &#x201C;the urgent need for increased facilities for care and treatment of geriatric, psychiatric patients&#x201D;. In conclusion this report stated, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The importance of a need for psychiatric service that is fully integrated with other medical services remains the ideal and cannot be over-emphasized.</block>

<p>I think the phrase &#x201C;integrated with other medical services&#x201D; deserves close consideration because this remark came from the Commissioner for Mental Health. I appreciate that this post no longer exists, but at the time he was representative of this particular field as an adjunct of the Department of Health.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the remarks recorded in the Van Wyk Commission&#x2019;s report and I would like, too, to record my appreciation for the comprehensive nature of this particular report. It says something which I think is rather significant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In their evidence the Department of Health did not concede that the commission should consider the desirability of transferring State psychiatric institutions to the provinces.</block>

<p>The Van Wyk Commission&#x2019;s report went further and quoted from the Rumpff Commission&#x2019;s report. It referred to what the Rumpff Commission had said about a memorandum from the Transvaal provincial hospitals which in effect stated that the three-tier division of health services tends to hamper the control of psychiatric illnesses and services due, mainly, to the duplication of services, the reduction in the efficiency of those services and, thirdly, to increased costs. The Commissioner for Mental Health is also quoted as having suggested in evidence to the Rumpff Commission a re-organization of control of mental hospitals. Reference is made to the fragmentation between hospitals run privately and those run by the central Government. Psychiatrist in mental hospitals were drawn away to the general hospitals because conditions of work and employment in general were more attractive in the general hospitals. He claimed too that this had the effect of leading to a deterioration of treatment of difficult cases due to a shortage of psychiatrists.</p>

<p>My colleague, the hon. member for Jeppes, has already referred to the definition of an institution, which states quite clearly that an institution is a State psychiatric hospital or a provincial hospital, or half-way houses, etc. So, it seems that this Bill provides a means to overcome unnecessary overlapping and to provide the best possible service and to make maximum use of our resources. When it comes to our resources, particularly in regard to the number of psychiatrists in South Africa, this has already been referred to but I wish to make a further point. The Van Wyk Commission&#x2019;s report gives the number of psychiatrists in 1970 as 125. From a breakdown it is quite clear that 110 of these psychiatrists are practising or operating in the seven main cities or areas in South Africa: Johannesburg, Cape Town and its suburbs, Pretoria, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Port Elizabeth and Bloemfontein. The balance are there to serve virtually the vast area of the rest of the Republic. The report also indicated that there were State hospitals at which there were no psychiatrists. It mentioned specifically that at Mafeking, the State hospital at Port <span class="col_1933-1934" refersTo="page_0980"/>Alfred, the Umgeni Hospital in Natal and Witrand at Potchefstroom. It also disclosed a further very significant and disturbing fact, namely that in the whole of South-West Africa there was only one psychiatrist situated in Windhoek. This is an unhealthy position in the field of mental health.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with the question of expenditure, because this matter was also dealt with in the annexure to the Van Wyk Commission&#x2019;s report. A summary was published of the capital and loan funds expended on mental hospital buildings in the 20 years from 1948 to 1968. It is interesting to note that in the four years from 1948 to 1952 there was no expenditure whatsoever on the building of mental institutions. Thereafter I calculate that the total expenditure from loan account on hospital buildings, etc., amounted to R6 872 000. I think most members in this Chamber will agree with me that that amount represents a fraction only of the cost of building a general hospital today. R6 872 000 was spent in providing the basic facilities for mental health over a period of 20 years and if one wants to work it out in expenditure per year &#x2026;</p>

<p>I just wish to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that he is off to a bad start through no fault of his own. This amount was spent to cater for 31 000 psychiatric patients, over 20 000 of whom are non-Whites. It is gratifying to know by those of us who were fortunate enough to visit the Mission hospitals during the recess through the kindness of the Department of Health, that the Government has realized this and at Thaba Moopho has created in a matter of six months by private building enterprise accommodation for 1 000 patients.</p>

<p>I will not deal with all the various clauses of the Bill because I think my colleague for Jeppes has done so adequately and has given the hon. the Minister a very good idea of our requests, which I trust he will consider sympathetically. In conclusion I want to say that I believe the Bill provides a groundwork for the provision of a sound mental health service. If this hon. Minister can influence the Minister of Finance to provide from Revenue and Loan Account sufficient funds, the Minister of National Education to provide through the universities, under his control a sufficient flow of psychiatrists of all races and the Minister of the Interior can see to it that the personnel required to carry out the terms of this Bill in the interest of mental health are provided with adequate salaries, then I say that a new milestone will have been reached in the sphere of mental health in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the outset I want to thank hon. members on the opposite side, especially the member for Rosettenville, for accepting the broad principles of this Bill. I think it is a new start, and. I am glad that we can start with the acceptance of these principles by both sides. Actually, these principles are really old; we have only adapted them to the present conditions. I took due cognizance of the various matters and problems raised by members. I am not unaware of many of the problems, I can assure them, although I have had this portfolio for only about five or six months.</p>

<p>The scarcity of psychiatrists is something which perturbs me just as much as it does hon. members on the other side. We have a backlog in accommodation. I think we are all agreed on that. We all agree that we should do our utmost to try to see what can be done about this backlog. There is the question of finance, accommodation, personnel, etc. All these various problems or bottlenecks which increasingly confronted us during the years, have been mentioned by hon. members.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville mentioned something about Valkenberg. By way of example, I just want to tell him that at Valkenberg we are at present considering improvements. The institution is being given priority attention by us and by the Department of Public Works. Some old, obsolete parts of buildings are being replaced. Some parts will be renovated, for which special capital funds have been provided.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Berea also mentioned the shortage of accommodation. The training of psychiatrists was mentioned by the hon. member for Rosettenville, as well as by some other members opposite. I want to clarify the position for them. The academic training of psychiatrists is not a function of the Department of Health; at the moment it is the function of the university and of the provinces. The introduction <span class="col_1935-1936" refersTo="page_0981"/>of such training will always depend upon demand as well as on the material available. I am sorry to say that as yet we might have the material available, but it has not come to the fore. We do not find them. However, I am unaware of any obstacle in the way of the Natal Provincial Administration to see that they have proper training facilities for Bantu psychiatrists. There is nothing really placed in their way as far as I know, but the Department of Health would gladly assist any provincial administration who comes to us with a good case and where we can be of assistance to help them in training psychiatrists, because it is a very important matter with us. So, if the hon. member wants to make representations, I suggest that it could possibly be of much help to direct his representations to the Natal Provincial Administration, although I take cognizance of what he has said here, and I am not going to forget about it. I am aware that general hospitals are at present treating some cases of mental deviations, although not the certified types. But lately there has been a Cabinet decision on what we are going to do with psychiatric cases. As the member may probably recollect, last year my predecessor issued a Press statement to the effect that all services are going to be taken over by the Department of Health, including all psychiatrists. I have looked very carefully into the matter, and the Cabinet decided some weeks ago there will have to be a slight change in this approach. We really want to integrate the provinces, the universities and the Department of Health. We want the personnel, the academic persons, the professors, all these people to be concerned with all psychiatric cases, not just cases in the general hospitals. The Cabinet has therefore decided upon a new approach, and although it does not differ a great deal from the old position, hon. members will gather that we are going to approach these matters in a new way. I am speaking of the treatment of psychiatric cases and also the overall approach to the problem of people mentally disordered or defective, or even with a deviationist trend.</p>

<p>*The previous recommendations in the White Paper which were accepted by the Cabinet, were as follows: Mental patients remain the full responsibility of the Department of Health, but provision will also be made for acute mental patients in general hospitals. Secondly, all full-time and part-time psychiatrists employed by State institutions and general hospitals shall be on the establishment of the Department of Health, but in general hospitals they shall be seconded to the authority of the hospital in question. At training hospitals the principle of joint appointments by the university concerned and the State&#x2014;we have this in Pretoria&#x2014;whether on a fulltime or part-time basis, already applies where circumstances require it. But we have experienced problems in the application of this principle. One cannot simply take over the provinces&#x2019; psychiatrists indiscriminately. There is perhaps an element of autocracy in this as well. I felt that we should seek co-operation where we are able to find this. After talks with the administrators I arrived at the following decision, and the Cabinet accepted it like this: For the present part-time psychiatrists who are at present on the establishment of provincial administrations will not be taken over. They will be able to appoint their own part-time psychiatrists. Instead of all full-time psychiatrists merely being appointed to the establishment of the Department of Health and then being seconded, they will be appointed to a joint establishment of the Department of Health, the provincial administrations and the universities. This means that the provincial administrations and the universities will have an equal say in the appointment, and so, too, in any subsequent dismissal. On the basis of the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision the financial responsibility for these posts is in fact still entrusted to the Department of Health.</p>

<p>&#x2020;From that hon. members will gather that I am really moving towards a better integration of services, because the old concept of mental hospitals was that they should be isolated places where people lived apart, and that is why previously the psychiatric and mental patients were under the Department of the Interior. We do not want that isolation, that gulf, to become bigger. We want these people to be integrated in an overall service, because nowadays we have modem concepts for the treating of psychiatric patients. One should have all the academic know-how and knowledge applied to neurotic and psychotic patients, and to all the other abnormal cases which we have so frequently, including patients suffering from schizophrenia and the other more serious diseases, even psychopaths and State President cases. I had discussions recently with the administrators and they subscribed to this approach. I <span class="col_1937-1938" refersTo="page_0982"/>think that from now on we can really look forward to better co-operation with the provinces. That in turn will mean not only that we will have a better psychiatric service, but also that as far as personnel and the academic training of psychiatrists is concerned, we will have much better cooperation between the Department of Health, academic institutions and the provinces. From that I think hon. members should realize that we are really on to a quite new approach, a new footing, as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I have now tried to explain this matter as well as I was able. I tried to indicate in what direction we were moving as far as this matter is concerned. Quite a number of other problems were raised. I know that there are deficiencies in the treatment of psychiatric patients and that as far as community services for psychiatric patients are concerned, and not necessarily patients who are mentally disordered but patients who are perhaps mentally deficient or mentally ill, they should not merely be treated in hospitals and then left. We must have after-care services, and these after-care services are becoming extremely important. For that reason I am pleased that some hon. members returned frequently to the question of out-patient services. These services have recently undergone tremendous expansion. I have taken cognizance of the fact that matters are not at all satisfactory in Natal, but it will be possible to solve this problem if we are able to achieve better co-operation among the various levels of government, namely the local authorities, the provinces, the universities and the Government departments.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brentwood raised a few interesting points. I was particularly impressed by his fine exposition and also by his view that one should regard any psychological deviation in a person in the same light as one regards a disease of the body, which may be cured with the surgeon&#x2019;s scalpel. If this view is held it removes the stigma from psychological deviation. Quite a number of members pointed out that it is important that we should remove the stigma which attaches to a person who has been treated in an institution or by a psychiatrist. That is something of the past. Just as we today have chemical substances which can keep a person, as far as his mental state is concerned, normal for 20 to 30 years and can make him productive in society, while we did not have this in the past, so we have on the other hand, in the field more of physical medicine, treated diabetes for example with insulin and other new substances, and no stigma attached to such a person. We also have the treatment of heart diseases with digitalis and other medicines, and no stigma attaches to this. I therefore think that we are moving away from the stigma which previously attached to mental diseases, and I think that the integration of the general hospitals with these other hospitals will also contribute to lessening that stigma gradually and removing it altogether. I am pleased the hon. member mentioned this point in particular, for it seemed to me it meets with general approval that we are emphasizing this in our discussion here.</p>

<p>The availability of psychologists is of course an important matter, for these people will have a greater part to play in future, since we have to utilize our manpower to the best of our ability. Unfortunately we have very few psychologists and social workers with psychiatric training; in fact, there are only a few available as yet.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brentwood pointed out a language problem to me. He feels that the word which we use here, &#x201C;removal&#x201D; of a patient from one place to another, should be replaced with the word &#x201C;transfer&#x201D;. My department and the legal experts will look into this and see what we can do in this connection.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I also listened with attention to what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City said about mental disease and the problem that confronts him in his constituency where he has two mental hospitals, in Pietermaritzburg. Like all psychiatric services, these two mental hospitals pose a problem at the moment, but in any case I am glad that the hon. member is so interested in these cases because I think he will be able to help us in the formulation of our future policy as regards the treatment of psychiatric cases in Natal.</p>

<p>*Sir, I did not see what appeared in the <i>Natal Mercury;</i> of course I cannot read all the newspapers and I therefore do not know what appeared there in regard to those psychiatric patients. I have already remarked that the services there are not all they should be.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Newcastle gave a very interesting chronological account of the history of psychiatry. He <span class="col_1939-1940" refersTo="page_0983"/>pointed out that a person who in the distant past became mentally ill was regarded as a leper who was simply isolated, and for whom there was no treatment. These people were simply pushed aside and forgotten, as is indicated in this report. The interesting suggestion was made here that the period of five years should be reduced and that a report should not be made only every five years but more frequently. To tell the truth, I myself made a note of this. This is proof of how the public regarded these people and even of how the families of these people suffered as a result of these confusions and the stigma which the public attached in the past to this kind of disease, frequently even thinking it was hereditary, which is in many cases not true. I think the hon. member raised a few very interesting points in regard to deficiencies in our after-care services. I think this is something which is improving at a tremendous rate. I was particularly please that he emphasized the necessity for us, as far as our children are concerned, to remember that in child psychology and in our approach to child psychiatry, we cannot place enough emphasis on the development of the child in its very earliest years, and on how sensitive the child is at that stage. In our child clinics this is of course a matter which is receiving a great deal of attention today. Sir, I do not think there is much more to say, except this.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Jeppes mentioned quite a few clauses in the Bill that they would like to see changed. I think we might be <i>ad idem</i> in respect to some of those clauses but I will have to have a look at that. I am not sure, having had only a short space of time to look at it, whether I agree with him fully, but there are merits in some of the things he suggested and I think we can have a look at that. I can assure him that it is so that as far as the provincial hospitals are concerned, they will definitely play a bigger part in future in psychiatric services. There is no doubt about that. We have come to this new agreement, and &#x201C;hulle sal hulle kant bring van nou af&#x201D;, as we say in the North-Western Cape.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea again mentioned the fact that the other day he made an interjection about scientology. Now, the scientology report is being studied at the moment. I therefore do not want to say anything about it now, but actually it was not necessary for me to tell him at that time that I had the scientology movement in mind because we had this newspaper proof of what these people are doing. They are really trying to raise a public outcry against this law, as they call it, although it is not a law at the moment; it is still a Bill. In any case, the way these people go about things here gives ample reason for me to mention it in Parliament that we do not think this is the right way to approach the matter. If they had any doubts there was ample time for them to approach the department. But now they begin like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africans in all walks of life and of all political persuasions are horrified by the implications of the proposed new Mental Health Act drawn up by the former Minister &#x2026; It gives any policeman the power to arrest any person he considers apparently mentally ill and allows compulsory treatment as well as compulsory detention.</block>

<p>I just want to say this, that if these people just had the elementary intellectual capacity or fairness to go and read the old Act they would have seen that these same provisions have been in the old Act for many years. Why they did not do that, I do not know. I think it is grossly unfair now to come and say that this new Bill contains these provisions whilst they should have known that these provisions were already contained in the old Act for years. I will leave it at that.</p>

<p>*Sir, I think I have replied to most of the hon. members. I am very pleased about this approach and the balanced discussion we had. I am amazed that hon. members seemed to have gone through the Bill quite thoroughly and studied it carefully, for it is quite a bulky Bill. I am very grateful for their contributions.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p><span class="col_1941-1942" refersTo="page_0984"/>The nine properties in the division of Oudtshoorn, which the proposed legislation is about, are at present owned and cultivated or are being claimed, as far as can be determined, by about 40 persons. The claims of some are for portions of more than one of the properties. According to the deeds office registers, title deeds were issued to the original owners in respect of those farms in the previous century, between the years 1820 and 1841. The problem is, however, that the majority of the present claimants do not have title deeds to the land or undivided shares in the land which they are claiming. This unhealthy state of affairs largely arose as a result of the fact that ancestral heirs did not take transfer from the estates of their testators, and as a result of further bequests, sales and exchanges, a situation developed in which only a few could succeed in obtaining transfer of undivided shares of the lands concerned.</p>

<p>The farms Roodewal, Uitdrift, Napiers Gift, Douw Steynskraal and the remainder of Nieuwe Drift, which are situated in the Schoemanshoek Valley to the north of Oudtshoorn, are at present occupied by 26 persons. They claim they are the only owners and have, in fact, divided up the land, had it surveyed and they possess approved maps. The large portion of these lands is along the Grobbelaars River, and is very valuable arable land with perennial water. Certain portions of the lands are very mountainous and can only be used for grazing. Some of the occupiers do have registered titles to a defined share or shares in one or more of the properties. Those who are not registered owners, base their claim on hereditary succession or purchases, exchanges or agreements that have been concluded, throughout the years, between various claimants.</p>

<p>The other four farms, i.e. Olyfkraal, Oorsprong van Kana, Uitvlug and De Stefanis Kloof are also mountainous and are largely used as grazing land. These farms are also owned by several persons in undivided shares, some of whom have registered titles of such undivided shares and others who do not. Because the farms are mountainous, there are only a few who utilize the land. Segmentation is not envisaged in respect of these four farms, but the persons who do not have titles are very anxious to obtain them in respect of their undivided shares.</p>

<p>Several attempts have already been made over the years by the heirs and other claimants to obtain transfer of the land, and considerable cost has been incurred in investigation and research in trying to make out a case for the Supreme Court. No progress is being made.</p>

<p>As will be grasped, there are considerable disadvantages involved in an owner not having the title deed to his land. Not only does it considerably hamper the sale of the land, but it prevents the person who has claim to it from negotiating a mortgage loan or obtaining State assistance in connection with, <i>inter alia,</i> the erection of soil conservation or water works. In addition there are water problems that could only be solved if an irrigation board were to be established, and there are insurmountable problems involved in this as long as there is still some uncertainty about the claimants&#x2019; rights of possession. The situation is deteriorating progressively as a result of the increase in the number of persons entitled to shares in the land, and to prevent the problem from becoming even more complicated, at the request of the claimants, it has been decided by the authorities to establish machinery, by way of hybrid legislation, that can be used to put the matter to rights.</p>

<p>The Bill now before you therefore has, as its purpose, to make provision for a Land Division Committee consisting of three members with the power to determine which persons are entitled to registration as owners in undivided shares in, or defined portions of, the land in question and to allocate and transfer such undivided shares or defined portions to the thus determined persons after they have paid their <i>pro rata</i> share of the relevant expenses in connection with the undertaking.</p>

<p>The first task of the Land Division Committee will be to determine who the persons are who are entitled to a share in specific properties, and to what share in those properties each person is entitled. The interests of minors must be borne in mind by the committee even though such a minor does not apply according to provisions. Transfer to a cessionary will be subject to existing rights&#x2014;for example a mortgage bond or usufruct or <i>fidei-commissum.</i> Provision is also made for the recording of objections to any application for allocation and transfer of land or an undivided share in it from a specific alleged claimant. An applicant will be able to ask the committee to reconsider a specific allocation <span class="col_1943-1944" refersTo="page_0985"/>if he is not satisfied with the initial findings of the committee, and special provision is being made for the hearing of evidence. The final ruling of the committee will, however, be conclusive and for the purposes of transfer to the cessionaries, the committee will be regarded as being the owner.</p>

<p>All the expenses the committee shall incur in connection with the allocation and transfer of the land will be paid from funds voted by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, but in fact on a recoverable basis. In other words, each claimant will have to pay his rightful share of the costs incurred to the said department for payment into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Transfer will not take place before the costs have been paid or satisfactory arrangements for their payment have been made, and for this reason provision is also made for the committee to sell a share or defined portion which it has allocated if the person, to which it has allocated it, neglects to pay his <i>pro rata</i> share of the costs. The balance, after subtraction of the costs, will then be paid to the owner.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the private rights involved here, the Bill was dealt with as a hybrid measure. In other words, the intention of introducing the Bill was made known in advance by means of the <i>Government Gazette</i> and local newspapers. In terested parties, whose names and addresses could be obtained, were also notified of the Bill by registered post. The Bill as such was lodged at the magistrate&#x2019;s office, Oudtshoorn, the Divisional Council, Oudtshoorn, and the Cape Provincial Secretary for perusal. In conclusion it can just be mentioned again that the main object of the legislation is to establish machinery to identify the cessionaries and to give them transfer of their rightful claim. All claimants will, therefore, eventually have the opportunity of proving their alleged claims.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of this side of the House we want to notify the hon. the Minister that we shall not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. The simple reason is that we are dealing here with a situation which began to develop for the first time more than a century ago. Because the subdivision of this land is apparently causing many problems to the present owners or those who have an undivided share in it, we feel that the hon. the Minister is quite correct in coming along with this legislation, so that the position can be put right. If I am not mistaken, we had similar legislation a year or so ago in connection with certain land in the division of George. In that case more or less the same steps were taken. Provision was also made there, <i>inter alia,</i> for a Land Division Committee. I hope the hon. the Minister can tell us in his reply how things have worked out thus far in that case; our information is that things are apparently going well so far and that the hon. gentleman is in a position to give the real share to each farmer or to whoever wants to take possession of it.</p>

<p>However, there is one point about which some members on this side of the House, myself not least, are concerned. Although more than 10 000 ha of land are involved, and as the hon. the Minister mentioned to us about 40 owners as well, I think it is of importance for the hon. gentleman to ensure that when that land is subdivided it will not be subdivided into so-called uneconomic units. I can understand, and I think the whole House can understand, that when a farmer cannot obtain a title deed it affects his credit-worthiness. It is difficult to raise a mortgage bond and it is also difficult to obtain credit on an overdraft unless one can at least offer certain security. Therefore it is essential for these people to know exactly what their property is, because the moment they know what their property is they can farm much more beneficially, in my opinion. Therefore we on this side of the House are not opposed to the passing of the Second Reading of this Bill. I also think that the establishment of a Land Division Committee, which consists of a judge, or a magistrate and other members, is a good thing because those people are perhaps pre-eminently suited to judge whether justice will be done to every applicant. I think that in this case it is a good principle that is being accepted, i.e. that since such land is at stake, and since future ownership of that land is at stake, the investigation will be carried out by such a committee consisting of people who firstly know local conditions and secondly people who will also ensure that justice is done to the rightful claim of an owner of someone who has a share, because people may have a legal claim which arose as far back as a hundred years or more ago, and this is not something that can be judged by any official. In this case, since this is being done by a magistrate or a judge, I think the first step should <span class="col_1945-1946" refersTo="page_0986"/>surely be to see that justice will be done to such applicants. In other words, our only proviso is that the hon. gentleman will ensure that in spite of the fact that it is grazing land, it will not be divided up into uneconomic units.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>An uneconomic unit is determined by the norms which the Minister and his department apply at this stage. He knows exactly what that land is and in what part of the country it is situated. Everyone knows that that area is tremendously mountainous and that it can therefore be used for hardly anything except grazing land. Therefore we ask that the hon. the Minister should, in fact, bear this well in mind when it comes to the subdivision of that land.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, because this Bill most closely affects a portion of my constituency, I welcome the opportunity to say a few words. From the nature of the case I shall not be able to reply to the points which the hon. member for Newton Park put forward. The hon. the Minister will do so. I can, however, give the hon. member the assurance that in the Oudtshoorn constituency all units are economic ones and that things are going very well there as far as we are concerned.</p>

<p>The area this Bill deals with is described in the schedule and has already been explained by the hon. the Minister, i.e. the lovely and fertile valley between Oudtshoorn and the very well-known Cango Caves. It is today called Schoemanshoek. It is called Schoemanshoek and indeed there are many Schoemans living there, but there is no connection between this place and its inhabitants and the present Minister of Agriculture. The people who live in this fertile valley have had a very big problem throughout the years, i.e. that they could not obtain registered title deeds for their properties. I do not want hon. members to be under the impression that these people simply took the first and best opportunity and ran to the Minister to put their affairs in order. On the contrary; throughout the years these people have made many attempts to solve this question, these efforts have also entailed great expense for these owners, but to date they have been unsuccessful in all these efforts, in spite of the expense. Therefore I should today, on behalf of those people, express my heart-felt thanks to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and his department. I want to thank them very much for the kindness with which they approached this matter, for their kind assistance and, in particular, for their willingness to undertake this big task. I am assured of the fact that a great deal of work has already been done and that a great deal more work will have to be done by the department in the future. Therefore our heart-felt appreciation. I should like to mention that a full year has not yet passed since we had the first interview with the hon. the Minister, who was then still Deputy Minister. Since then there has been only briskness and thoroughness on his part. Since our Government departments are sometimes criticized, I want to take this opportunity of expressing our thanks for the absolutely brisk service that has been furnished. I also believe that the passing of this Bill and the conclusion of the matter by the proposed Land Division Committee will not only iron out problems and solve the conflict these people are faced with, but I am also certain, as the hon. member for Newton Park said too, that this will open new doors for these people and that new development will inevitably take place. I have confidence in the fact that the owners will make use of the opportunity, not only in their own interests, but also in the interests of the constituency and in the general interest of the whole of South Africa. Therefore we are deeply grateful for this Bill and I should like to give the measure my full support.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to inform the hon. member for Newton Park that we are glad to see that he is concerned about uneconomic units. Where there is, in fact, an uneconomic unit, we cannot do anything but let the subdivision go through. If one has a title deed one qualifies for consolidation and assistance from the Department of Agricultural Credit. However, this will not result in further uneconomic units being created. Our survey of this specific area indicates that these are all independent farmers who have already made a success of the land on which they are farming because the irrigation portion of the land is very fertile. As far as the mountainous areas are concerned, they are going to obtain title deeds, but undivided shares in the four mountainous parts. The hon. <span class="col_1947-1948" refersTo="page_0987"/>member knows how far we have progressed as far as George is concerned. It was difficult to get the committee formed, because there is payment involved, and the payment was too little. We eventually got the right persons, <i>inter alia,</i> an ex-magistrate, the committee is in its stride and things are going well in the George area. We feel things will go equally well in the Schoemanshoek area.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Oudtshoorn did his best to expedite the matter and I also thank him for this thanks. He says the people there in Schoemanshoek are no relations of mine. I am very sorry, because there are well-bred people living there.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The principle object of this Bill is the protection of the national air carrier and foreign air carriers serving South Africa in terms of air agreements against the actions of pseudo travel agencies. Such actions are creating a difficult problem in the form of advertisements in newspapers or of another kind, to the effect that cheap flights can be provided.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly the case that the public is sometimes being duped in this way and is, in fact, suffering losses. I refer to recent Press reports of unfortunate victims who were greatly embarrassed in this way. It has been found that certain unscrupulous persons and agencies are exploiting the public to such an extent that flight tickets are being sold to them in respect of dubious or even imaginary air transportation. These actions are especially detrimental to scheduled air transportation services, and strong representations in this connection have been addressed to my department.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that it is not the intention to compel all travel agencies to acquire written authorization from the National Transport Commission, but this measure is aimed at placing a prohibition on unauthorized travel agencies in terms of which they will have to obtain permission from the National Transport Commission. A similar statutory provision is contained in section 9(5) of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, 1930, viz. that no person may without written authorization make known generally that he or any other person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person or goods by means of a motor vehicle, unless he is the holder of a certificate of exemption in terms of the said Act, which authorizes such conveyance, or is the authorized agent of such holder. If the envisaged prohibition is applied systematically it will be possible to nip this kind of practice and resultant exploitation in the bud.</p>

<p>In addition a penal provision for any contravention of the proposed prohibition is being inserted.</p>

<p>The drawing up of this Bill has afforded an opportunity to devote attention to other matters in the principle Act which require amendments as a result of changing circumstances, so as to facilitate their application. The amendments in question relating to decimalization are self-explanatory, and I need not elaborate on them. Such amendments are contained in clauses 1, 6, 7 and 12.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the remaining clauses point by point.</p>

<p>The envisaged amendment in clause 1 is aimed at extending the power of exclusion from the provision that an aircraft may not be used for providing an air service without a licence, to or in respect of visiting aircraft of states which are not contracting states, i.e. to the Chicago Convention. In terms of this the provision in question may also be made applicable to certain neighbouring African States.</p>

<p>Provision is being made in clause 3 for a penal provision in the case of failure on the part of a person to comply with an order or direction of the National Transport Commission. In terms of section 3(1)(d) of the principle Act the Commission is empowered to issue such order or direction, but no penal provision in respect of such failure is at present contained in the principle Act.</p>

<p>Clause 4 provides that the nature of the particulars which have to be furnished in regard to applications for licences shall be prescribed by regulation. In this manner <span class="col_1949-1950" refersTo="page_0988"/>the application of the principle Act and the regulations made in terms of it will definitely be facilitated.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 5 the nature of the particulars of applications which have to be published shall be prescribed by regulation. Here, too, the application of the principle Act and the regulations will definitely be facilitated.</p>

<p>The envisaged amendment in clause 8, in terms of which further particulars which licences have to furnish may be prescribed by regulation, will facilitate the issuing and examination of licences.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 9 the existing provision that the National Transport Commission shall communicate to the applicant its decision on an application for renewal not later than 12 months prior to the date of submission of such an application, provided the application is submitted not less than 18 months prior to expiry, is being deleted. It was found that applicants never availed themselves of this privilege. For the sake of uniformity, i.e. publication of particulars of renewal and arrangements for the hearing of such applications, only a single provision that an application for renewal shall be submitted not later than 12 months prior to the date of expiration of the licence is required. The proposed deletion of the said provision will consequently be conducive to better administration and will in fact, according to representations made to my department, be preferred by the private sector.</p>

<p>In clause 10 provision is being made for the payment of application and licence fees which are prescribed by regulation. At present no fees are payable upon application, and the present fees which are prescribed in respect of the various types of licences are purely nominal. In view of the fact that licences remain in force for a number of years, as for example in the case of a scheduled air transportation service in respect of which an amount of R10-50 is payable for their particular licence, the revision and supplementation of such fees is completely justified. Considerable time and work is given to the recording, publication and hearing of applications as well as to the issuing and examining of licences. With the necessary Treasury approval it will be possible to prescribed realistic application, licence and other fees. However, I want to give the assurance that the proposed revised fees will not be excessively high.</p>

<p>In clause 11 provision is being made on the one hand for notification of the National Transport Commission by the holder of a licence of a provisional order for the sequestration of the estate of the holder, or, where the holder is a company, for the winding-up of the company or of a judicial management order, and on the other hand for a provision that a licence shall automatically lapse upon the issue of a final order for a sequestration or winding-up.</p>

<p>It has been found that there is sometimes a tremendous time-lapse between such provisional order and the final order for sequestration or winding-up of the estate of the holder of a licence, with the result that the National Transport Commission in the meantime is not acquainted with the situation of the licence holder concerned. In such circumstances a matter is obscured by an application for transfer of the licence of the holder to another person or an application by the holder for an extension of his licence, obviously with a view to preventing the consequences of sequestration or winding-up.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 13 provision is being made for the making of regulations with regard to (a) the manner in which a request for authorization in terms of the proposed section 2A shall be addressed to the National Transport Commission; and (b) extended authorization to charge fees in respect of applications, the issuing of licences, copies of applications for licences, and the reasons of the National Transport Commission for the refusal, variation, cancellation or suspension of licences.</p>

<p>In terms of modern usage and as has also been done in the Aviation Act, 1962, provision is being made in clause 14 for any reference in the Afrikaans text of the principle Act to a &#x201C;vliegtuig&#x201D; and to &#x201C;vliegtuie&#x201D; to be construed as a reference to &#x201C;lugvaartuig&#x201D; and &#x201C;lugvaartuie&#x201D; respectively.</p>

<p>Clause 15 makes provision for a short title and date of commencement.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if hon. members desire any further information, I shall of course be glad to furnish it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, taken at face value, and as motivated by the hon. the Deputy Minister this afternoon, this is an innocent measure with which we all agree in principle. No one is going to dispute the fact that there are people who <span class="col_1951-1952" refersTo="page_0989"/>have been taken for a ride in the figurative rather than in the literal sense by pseudo travel agencies. Thinking they have purchased a ride on an aeroplane, they find that it is another kind of ride for which they have been taken. We agree that this is an evil which should be stopped, but as usual the Government comes along and takes a sledge-hammer to kill a gnat. The provision in this Bill which deals with this issue goes far beyond what the hon. the Deputy Minister said was the purpose. Surely it is a simple matter to protect people against exploitation by pseudo travel agents. As has been done in other instances, this can be done by asking for guarantees in the licensing of such agencies. It is quite simple; there can be either a cash guarantee or a bank guarantee which would cover losses sustained by any person using such an agency. But what the Minister has done in this Bill is to prohibit any person or any organization whatsoever from advertising any type of special flight. Take for example the Durban Chamber of Commerce, which at least twice a year organizes flights overseas in connection with trade missions, exhibitions, and so on. There is also the Natal Clothing Institute which does this. In fact, I received a circular only today from them regarding a planned flight to the International Textile Machinery Exhibition in Cologne. In the case of my own business I have taken some trouble to get all the details required to arrange a flight to take customers to an international exhibition.</p>

<p>This Bill means that any organization which wants to arrange such a charter flight may no longer circularize even its own members in its own domestic newsletter and say: &#x201C;Look, we are considering a flight to go to such and such a place or for such and such an exhibition. We want to know who is interested.&#x201D; They would first have to go to the commission before they could even find out if they had enough members interested in such a charter flight.</p>

<p>This would also affect any society. I think it is the 1820 Settlers who are arranging a Christmas flight. They have advertised it in their magazine. So one can go on. All sorts of organizations from time to time want to assist their members with charter flights at lower rates.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, those were the farmers.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I am told that those were the farmers. I have had reports on the law society visit as well.</p>

<p>This is a serious matter because behind this is the principle that this provision will make it possible to deny to South Africans the privilege of low-cost overseas flights. This measure comes at a time when only in this weekend&#x2019;s Press there were reports of the slashing of air fees by international carriers. I find, for instance, that on the London to New York run, it is now possible to get schedule-operated services for R90 return. At this rate, the fare between Johannesburg and London, for an equivalent distance, would be less than R200, whereas the cheapest scheduled flight today is R529. But there is one organization which will be banned under this, which at the moment is offering a flight at R395 instead of R529. There are other legitimate agencies which have offered similar, and sometimes even cheaper, flights. But, Sir, artificially the members of the pool flying to Jan Smuts today have a monopoly and are therefore making no apparent attempt to reduce the cost of South African flights. So while the rest of the world is benefiting, our people in South Africa who want to fly are forced to pay proportionately much higher fares than are available elsewhere. I read, for instance, that it is possible today to fly from London to Venice by scheduled flight for R100-odd; and on the non-scheduled flight, for R83, you can get a return ticket from London to Venice plus hotel accommodation with a private bathroom for 11 days, plus transport from hotel to airport, etc., all meals and tips, and a nanny to look after the children, whereas the equivalent distance in South Africa costs R94.</p>

<p>Sir, I give these as examples of the sort of flight that is not available to South African travellers and which is even less likely to be available in terms of clause 2 of the Bill before us, because quite obviously this Bill has a far wider motive than merely protection against pseudo-agencies. You could give people protection against them without barring all advertising of seats available in any form by any organization <span class="col_1953-1954" refersTo="page_0990"/>or person. This is, of course, quite a different thing from the provision in the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, which is designed to stop pirate taxis and hitch clubs, where people are given lifts for reward and so on. Here you are dealing with aircraft which in the first place cannot fly unless they have landing rights and unless they conform to the safety specifications, and in most cases they are South African Airways charters in any case. The Durban Chamber of Commerce, to mention an example, charters a South African Boeing; that is the usual practice; so the safety feature does not come into it. The aircraft is the standard aircraft which is licensed; the landing is controlled and the Minister can prevent any unsafe or undesirable flight from taking place. But, Sir, he is not trying to do that because he has all those powers. What he wants to do in this measure is to prevent anybody from advertising any cheap flight. He says this is not going to apply to all of them, but only to the unauthorized agents. But that is not what the Bill says; that is what the Deputy Minister says. The Bill says: &#x201C;No person shall without the written authority of the commission&#x201D;, which may be granted subject to certain conditions, advertise &#x201C;unless he is the holder of a licence under this Act&#x201D; or the &#x201C;authorized agent of such a holder&#x201D;. Therefore it is not just a question of being authorized. You must have a licence under the Act to convey people or be the agent of such a licensed airline. So it is not just authorized agencies; it is only the agencies of authorized airlines who will be exempt. Anyone else would fall under the provisions of this Bill. Any organization such as I have mentioned or any club or society wanting to arrange a trip for its members or any legitimate licensed travel agency, if they were not the agent of a licensed airline, would be prohibited. In other words, this would include the normal travel agents who today take bookings. Unless they are specifically the agent of a licensed airline they will fall under those proposed provisions. No agency could go to S.A. Airways and say they want to charter a Boeing 747 to take 300 people to the continent for such and such a period. They could not do it because they would be prohibited by this measure. They could not even inquire of their members as to whether there was sufficient interest to go to all the trouble of making an application to be licensed and to advertise.</p>

<p>Therefore we look beyond mere prevention and protection against pseudo agencies and we say we will give the hon. the Minister our full support if he will withdraw this clause as it stands and substitute a clause which would merely protect the public against fly-by-night pseudo agencies. That could be done quite easily by means of a guarantee required to be lodged, a guarantee which would cover any losses which might be incurred by the public and which would then be refunded to the public. That would give you full protection for the public but it would not interfere with the right of South African citizens to enjoy what people in other countries are able to enjoy. And it is not as though South African Airways are struggling to find passengers. We naturally on this side of the House&#x2014;and let me put it on record very clearly&#x2014;would support any measure to protect our own national carrier. We realize that our first responsibility and our first duty is to South African Airways and we would support, and do support, measures to protect our own carrier. But this is not the case here. This is not designed to protect S.A. Airways. In fact, S.A. Airways is usually the charter agency used by many of these organizations, and our own airlines are having to go so far as to hire aircraft from another firm on the basis, as I understand it from one report, of one a week. The old Trek Airways, Luxavia as they now are, run a weekly flight for S.A. Airways because S.A. Airways cannot handle all the traffic offering to it. So they themselves are chartering to handle their surplus capacity. Therefore this is not a measure to protect our airlines; it is a measure to prevent our South African citizens from benefiting from cheaper flights. We are doing it; our own airline is doing it in South Africa. There are now the new night flights from Cape Town to Johannesburg for R66 instead of R94. It shows that cheaper fares can be offered because I am quite sure S.A. Airways would not be offering that sort of fare if they were losing money on it. It is now R66 instead of R94. So they are able to run cheaper flights. There is the package tour which is now being offered, which offers accommodation thrown in for less than the normal flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town. So it is possible, but because there is a pool which has a complete monopoly and which works as an entity, that pool is able artificially to withhold from our own citizens the sort of airfare which enables the citizens of other countries of the world to <span class="col_1955-1956" refersTo="page_0991"/>travel more and more by air, particularly young people who cannot afford to pay R539 or R620-odd in season for a 45-day concession. They cannot afford to pay that sort of money, but they can afford to pay R200 or R300 to fly overseas. What young person has not set his or her heart on an overseas trip as early as he or she can? It is one of the things young people dream about, to get overseas and see something of the rest of the world. We are opposed to a measure which is going to make it more difficult for them, unless we can be satisfied that this is essential in the interests of safety, or in the interests of the protection of the public. We believe there is a much simpler way in which that protection can be given, as I have already outlined.</p>

<p>As far as the other provisions are concerned, we accept clause 1. We have no objection to that. It is technical and administrative. We do have some doubt about the proposed amendment brought about by clause 9. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that this was a provision which was not used. I should like him to give us the assurance that it is not used at all, or is it merely that it is not used very often? This gives a carrier an opportunity to plan his affairs a year in advance. He does not have to wait until the last minute before he knows whether his licence is going to be renewed. To me it seems a simple privilege which cannot cause a lot of difficulty, which cannot create a lot of administrative work and unless we can have some better explanation, we are also opposed to that clause.</p>

<p>The majority of the other clauses again follow a pattern which we find to an increasing extent in Government legislation. At the moment the Act lays down specifically the various conditions&#x2014;I do not want to deal with them all; we could perhaps deal with them in Committee&#x2014;the particulars which must be stated in an application, the particulars which must be published in order to advertise the application received, the particulars which must appear on the licence, and the fees which must be paid. These particulars are all laid down by law, there for any person concerned or affected to see. These are now all to be prescribed; they are all to be left to the whim of the Minister to prescribe as he will&#x2014;what form the application shall take, what particulars shall be supplied, what he shall advertise, what he shall not advertise, what fees will be payable. In other words, it is the old concept: I am the Government; it is not Parliament that will determine these things; I am going to prescribe as I want to prescribe without reference to Parliament. These are not serious things which can affect the freedom of people or anything like that, but they affect the livelihood of people. There must be some better reason than that it is easier to prescribe, for removing what is now in the law. The law lays down quite clearly what an applicant must do. So, an applicant knows in advance what is required. A person who has been applying year after year and has been receiving a licence, does it in terms of this Act. Now, suddenly, the Minister could come with all sorts of conditions at his whim. Although we shall not oppose it, because obviously a certain amount of flexibility is necessary, I want to highlight simply the fact that this is a growing tendency in legislation to use the law itself less and less and regulations more and more, in providing for how that law will be carried out. For instance, the hon. the Deputy Minister has said he gives an assurance that the fees will not be excessive. Can he not tell us now what the increases are going to be so that Parliament will know, because those increases are going to affect the cost of the carrier and that again affects the fares which the passenger must pay. We are being asked to give to the hon. the Minister power to increase the fees at his own whim without any idea of what effect that could have on the cost to the person who has to pay in the end, who will be John Citizen, the passenger. The uncertainty is not necessary, even though we give the hon. the Minister the power to prescribe. Why does he not tell us what he has in mind, and what sort of fees he is going to charge, so that we can see immediately what the picture is going to be like? These, as I say, are not matters of principle. The principle to which we object is the provision which will bar the advertising of any organized flight, whether it be a charter by a group, by a society, by a travel agent or by an individual, advertising without the written authority of the commission. The hon. the Minister will, I am afraid, not satisfy us with an assurance that the commission will be reasonable and that it will not refuse such requests. The commission is an organization designed to run to very strict rules. Its whole approach is one of restricting to ensure that there is not excessive competition; in fact, one of the provisions is being changed in the Bill, <span class="col_1957-1958" refersTo="page_0992"/>the provision that one of the things which will be taken into account is undue competition, protection of the public and undue competition by too many certificates. In other words, the concept, the thinking of the commission must necessarily be restrictive. Our approach is: Do not restrict the opportunity for people to fly, more than is required by safety and by the financial stability of our own airline. Otherwise, where they are not affected, rather expand the opportunity to travel, give the people a chance to get out and see the world at the cheapest possible price, and not the approach that opportunity must be limited, prescribed and narrowed down by the decision of a commission from whom there is no appeal.</p>

<p>Therefore we will be obliged to oppose this Bill because it conflicts with our idea of placing flying within easier reach of the South African citizen, instead of making it more difficult for him. Therefore we shall vote against this measure.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we can really say today that the hon. member for Durban Point is seeing spectres, spectres in very innocent legislation, legislation which is primarily aimed only at guaranteeing the safety and security of our public. He has now been raising very strong objections to clause 2, in which regulations are made in connection with the issuing of a permit, objections to the effect that these people will ostensibly no longer be able to advertise. The position is simply that if those people meet the reasonable requirements that will be set by the commission, they will in fact be able to advertise. The first thing which any responsible firm will do, will be to ensure that it meets those minimum requirements. Once it has done that, it can advertise. I really cannot see why the Opposition should object to that. The hon. member sees his way clear to dispose of this matter by way of a guarantee. It is not so easy to control this kind of malpractice. We must have proper regulations and conditions must be imposed on for any such travel agency in order to ensure that the advertisement they place is not misleading. We are living in a time of tremendous expansion in the air-service industry and we have a strong organization in the South African Airways. They have to compete with other forms of transport. They also have to compete with other airways. Therefore they have concluded an agreement with IATA, the international organization, and the pool agreement is of great value to the South African Airways. It makes very severe demands on all the various airlines making use of the routes to South Africa. It is essential that there should be strict control over these people.</p>

<p>The South African Airways must also guarantee a regular service. It is much easier and cheaper to make just one journey without retaining all the necessary personnel in the various countries. Therefore it is a prerequisite for the South African Airways that they guarantee a regular air service. They must render the service at competitive prices. We have seen how air services have systematically expanded over the years. In 1971 there were 1 551 678 air journeys; in 1972 this expanded to 1 670 515, which is an increase of 7,6%. We see that the Springbok Airline has today increase its scheduled services from 17 to 18 per week: 10 to London, one to Vienna, one to Zurich, two to Athens, three to Frankfurt and one to Brussels. Then we also have the Wallaby Service to Australia, which is now being increased to four return services per week. In addition we have the jet service to North and South America. I say therefore that we are really rendering a service to the public. The South African Airways also makes use of chartered flights. On the average almost two chartered flights per week are undertaken, specifically to render a service to groups of people who wish to undertake tours such as those to which the hon. member for Durban Point referred. In this way 94 tours were undertaken by the South African Airways last year. However, these air journeys are also subject to the IATA. They cannot determine tariffs just any way they please. That strict code of service is maintained. A short while ago we saw in the Little Budget that the South African Airways had been fined because some of those strict rules had been infringed. I think that it is right that if standards are laid down, those who infringe them should be <span class="col_1959-1960" refersTo="page_0993"/>fined, because in this way we guarantee a good service to the public.</p>

<p>I want to say again that this legislation is being introduced to put a stop to exploitation of the public, because when such exploitation takes place, it prejudices the regular air service. Therefore our regular air service must also be protected. The object is not to prosecute certain companies. The Bill seeks to effect a measure of control and to protect the public. It is very simple for any travel agency or any agent of a travel agency to comply with those requirements. The other clauses of the Bill are to a large extent aimed at facilitating the application of the principal Act. I can therefore see no reason why this Bill should not be passed by the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Humansdorp has, I think, let the cat out of the bag when he said that one of the reasons for this legislation was to guarantee our local airline and other members of IATA and to protect them against competitive fares. That is what the hon. gentleman said. I think here we are coming to the very heart of this legislation, namely the new section 2A being inserted by clause 2 of the Bill. He believes that we are seeing ghosts that do not exist. I wonder if that hon. gentleman has bothered even to read clause 2 of this Bill properly. In fact, I was doubting when I listened to the hon. the Deputy Minister introducing the Bill whether he too had read clause 2 of the Bill. If he had, I am quite sure that he would have come to some of the conclusions we have come to about the actual implications of the clause. We all know he is new in his post and one would have expected him to be perhaps rather more thorough than usual when he comes with legislation. One expects that of any new broom. Coming back for a moment to the hon. member for Humansdorp, he said, apart from the slip he made about protecting the local airline against other airlines, unscheduled ones, that might offer more competitive fares, that the purpose of this clause is to guarantee safety and to protect the public. He said that this is a simple matter and that all that the people concerned have to do is to comply with the reasonable requirements of the National Transport Commission. Is it as simple as that? If he wants to protect the public, where are such provisions in the Bill? All they have provided for is that people must apply to the National Transport Commission for licences. How can he then argue that protection is being afforded by the Bill? He is simply passing it over to the National Transport Commission and that, I suggest, is highly inadequate. I want to suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he cannot possibly go ahead with this legislation in its present form. The new proposed section 2A(1) provides that &#x201C;no person shall without the written authority of the commission&#x201D;, that is the National Transport Commission, &#x201C;which may be granted subject to such conditions as the commission may deem fit (a) make known by any means that he or any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service &#x2026; unless he is the holder of a licence under this Act &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;Air service&#x201D; in the original Act means any service performed by means of an aircraft for reward and includes air transport service. We shall see immediately that there is no attempt to restrict the meaning of &#x201C;air service&#x201D; here to the Republic or South-West Africa or to flights originating or terminating in the Republic or South-West Africa. I think I am correct in saying this. In other words, we are now deliberately making the proposed new section 2A apply to all air services, other than scheduled national services and our domestic ones, anywhere in the world. The hon. the Deputy Minister smiles, but is that the position? It certainly would seem to be. When we look at legislation like this, we must obviously try to determine not only what the aim of the legislation is&#x2014;here we were helped immeasurably by the hon. member for Humansdorp&#x2014;but also how widely the net is being cast. It was when I tried to do that that I began to have serious doubts about how carefully the hon. the Deputy Minister had studied the Bill. You see, Sir, if one just gives this question a little thought, one sees that the net of this Bill&#x2014;more precisely the ambit of the proposed new section 2A&#x2014;is cast very widely indeed, to prevent any publicity of any sort being given to non-scheduled air services unless the National Transport Commission gives prior approval. Once again I want to come back to this point that nowhere is this restricted. This applies to non-scheduled services anywhere. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister would indicate whether that is so. It certainly seems to be the clear meaning of the Bill. He does not seem to <span class="col_1961-1962" refersTo="page_0994"/>respond. I wonder if he knows whether this is the position.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, he is being most unhelpful, because this is a very important point that we have to clear up. It is something, in fact, that he should have mentioned when he introduced this Bill. He should have dealt with the scope of the application of the Bill. Not only does the proposed new section 2A apply to promoters&#x2014;it is obviously aimed at promoters, that is travel agents, or air service companies who wish to advertise or promote cheap air travel&#x2014;but it applies to anybody who makes known by any means that any other person is willing to undertake unscheduled air services. Ah, the Deputy Minister nods at that. Now, in the first place, I want to put it to him that this in fact prohibits any publicity of any nature to do with unscheduled air services anywhere in the world, unless a permit is first obtained from the National Transport Commission. I wonder if he would nod to that too. This seems to be perfectly clear to me.</p>

<p>It is all very well for the hon. member for Humansdorp to say that everything should be left to the National Transport Commission, that they are the wise people who will make all the wise decisions. I think we are entitled to know what sort of criteria the National Transport Commission in any event would want to apply in this vast new field. You see, Sir, we are not at all satisfied that the National Transport Commission really judges all applications before it as, say, an independent court would judge, or even perhaps an independent body with only the interests of our own national carrier at heart. One has to look at one or two recent examples. One example, of course, was the application that was made to the National Transport Commission to fly certain mining machinery to Zambia after the closure of the border between Rhodesia and Zambia. This application was turned down. As far as I know, the reason given was that there already was a freight service in existence. But that obviously was a highly inadequate reason; because, as we see now, South African goods are being taken to Botswana and flown from Lobatsi to Zambia in a special service undertaken by an airline from Alaska. It seems as though the reason given by the National Transport Commission, or what we believe to be the reason anyway, was rather specious. In other words, it seems, too, that there was in fact merit in the application that was originally filed and refused.</p>

<p>What this new section 2A does in effect is to allow the National Transport Commission to decide whether it should even be made known to the South African public that cheap, non-scheduled air services exist anywhere in the world. It can decide whether our South African public should even be allowed to know about it. The practical difficulties presented by this new provision seem to me to be insurmountable. One asks immediately: What about newspapers and periodicals that publish reports, or perhaps advertisements or articles, about cheap non-scheduled services? These are often mentioned in newspapers, perhaps by way of agency reports from elsewhere in the world. They might be written by specialist air correspondents. They might originate from anywhere or be written locally. Some of them, of course, are treated as straightforward items of news. Some are debated by the specialist, the air correspondent. And, of course, some are featured in foreign newspapers and magazines. To start with overseas or foreign publications, what will the position be if at the Central News Agency, should this Bill become law, an overseas journal carries an article or an advertisement about a cheap, unscheduled air service, and the CNA, who will then be the publishers, have not gone to the National Transport Commission to get a permit? The hon. the Deputy Minister laughs, but this is not so funny, especially when you consider that the person who publishes or who makes this known stands to pay a fine of R1 000 on first conviction, and R2 000 for subsequent convictions. It is not so funny then. It seems to me as though, unless one goes through all the rigmarole of getting a permit well in advance, one could find oneself in trouble, and I do not think one can expect the National Transport Commission to give immediate, on-the-spot replies to what probably would be dozens of applications by newspapers for permits.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have not read it wrongly; I suggest you read it again. It seems to me that unless a South African journalist were to go through the process of getting a permit, he would not be able to report on developments in the world of travel outside. If he did not get his permit, he too would face a fine of R1 000 for his first conviction. In effect, what this legislation does is to place unscheduled air services in more or less the same position as far as the Press of South Africa is concerned, as lotteries. In the case of lotteries, of course, there can be no publication at all. There is virtually a total prohibition on publication. In the case of this Bill provision is certainly made for application to publish details, but it means that one has to apply for a licence first, which I suggest creates an intolerable situation. If the hon. member for Bellville is entering this debate, perhaps he could tell us quite early on whether he sees in this amendment, read with the original Act, any provision for exemptions from this requirement. I should like him to be very specific about this. There is certainly provision for exemption, but as far as I can see, exemptions are not provided for in the case of anybody who wants, for example, to publish an article on an unscheduled air service.</p>

<p>Sir, I suggest that this Bill is far too wide in its application. I suggest that even hon. members on that side of the House should reject it and say to the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Take it away and see if you cannot come back next time with something rather better.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not perfectly clear to me whether the hon. members of the Opposition who have taken part in this debate are concerned about the fact that we can no longer avail ourselves now of the so-called chartered flights of unscheduled companies, because part of their argument was in fact that as a result of the implementation of clause 2 of the Bill, it would not be possible to enlist chartered flights by unscheduled companies in South Africa in the future. I must concede that it is my impression that it is precisely that kind of chartered flight by unscheduled companies&#x2014;in other words, those who are not members of IATA or do not belong to the so-called contracting states&#x2014;which we wish to restrict, because they are, if one may use this term, &#x201C;fly-by-nights&#x201D; in a certain sense of the word. It is this kind of flight which has often left travellers in the lurch in the past and which has left people at places from which they could only return with great difficulty. If hon. members are pleading for these unscheduled flights which, for example, operate from outside our borders to Europe and back, then I say to them that I cannot go along with them. They do have other criticism which I think are well-founded, but I shall deal with them later. What must be done&#x2014;and they fully realize this&#x2014;is that in terms of this legislation chartered flights must be arranged within a framework of the scheduled flights from South Africa. After all, it is common knowledge that while an ordinary aeroplane ticket costs one between R600 and R700, one can travel to Europe in a group in an ordinary S.A.A. chartered aircraft, and that a ticket will then, sometimes, cost one about R400. I see no reason why this particular legislation should restrict this kind of undertaking. All that has to happen is that, for example, the law society want to arrange such a flight, they must go to the NTC beforehand and request permission for arranging their flight. Or, if the wine farmers want to undertake such a journey, it simply means a letter to the NTC. The NTC considers it, and in my humble opinion the NTC will easily grant this permission to approved bodies to arrange the <span class="col_1965-1966" refersTo="page_0996"/>necessary chartered flights. To my mind there is therefore no problem as far as this is concerned. All that is being done here is that the NTC acts as a kind of sieve which can keep people who do not have any substance away from this kind of undertaking. If the hon. member has a group of honourable people from Natal, such as the garments workers&#x2019; group to which he referred, then I believe that there will be no problem in obtaining the necessary permission from the NTC for the purpose of his flight. Honourable people, people of substance, people who are worth something, will find it easy to obtain this permission, but the intention is in fact to keep away those people who are exploiting the public. I think hon. members must accept that in this respect a certain guarantee to the general public is being built into this legislation in a certain way. I agree with this principle, because it is after all a principle which is already contained in other legislation of our country. May I refer hon. members in this connection to the legislation concerned, namely the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, No. 39 of 1930. A similar principle is contained in section 9(5) of that Act. I shall quote it to hon. members&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall, without the written authority of the appropriate local board, granted subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, make known generally whether by means of a notice published in a newspaper or in any other manner, that he or any other person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person or goods by means of a motor vehicle, unless he is the holder of a motor carrier certificate or an exemption which authorizes such conveyance or is the authorized agent of such holder.</block>

<p>Hon. members can therefore see that the principle which is introduced in this Act, is precisely the same principle as that which obtains in that Act, and therefore it is not foreign to our legislation in South Africa.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Kensington and his problem with the CNA, which supposedly has a book or magazine from overseas on its shelves, in which there is an advertisement of an overseas journey which does not originate here and which is undertaken by airlines which do not operate to South Africa. Sir, I do not think that the hon. member has a problem in this connection. He has misread the Act. If he looks at the Act, he will see that the proposed new section 2A provides the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall without the written authority of the commission, which may be granted subject to such conditions as the commission may deem fit&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) make known by any means that he or any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>That is the first point&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(b) sell &#x2026; any seating accommodation for the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>Such a notice in an overseas magazine does not offer seating tickets.</p>

<p>We shall come to that later on. My interpretation of this is that it is not as wide as that; that the point here is the active sale of tickets and active promotion here in this country of the flight in question, and therefore that it does not include a general discussion or comments or anything of that kind. I cannot see that the CNA, which by chance has this magazine on its shelves, has anything to do with the active promotion of these flights. After all, they did not put the magazine there on purpose in order to promote this particular flight; it is only by chance that it was included in that magazine. I feel that hon. members are going too far in thinking that this kind of comment and this kind of general notice, which does not actively promote a specific flight locally, is also included here.</p>

<p>The hon. member should read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by any means that he or any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service &#x2026;</block>

<p>He may not make it known that he is prepared to undertake the conveyance. The hon. member may well take another look at the Bill and then we can argue about it again later on.</p>

<p>However, I want to agree to some extent with the hon. member for Kensington about one matter, and that is that nowhere in the Act do we find any description or an exposition of the conditions subject to which the National Transport Commission will grant this approval for advertisements. At present that is entirely within discretion of the National Transport Commission. My feeling is that the general public, which is concerned with this matter, or people who wish to undertake such flights, or the travel agents who wish to advertise such flights, should at least find a certain amount of guidance somewhere. Therefore I want to make this appeal to the hon. the Minister, namely that when this legislation is implemented, he will give a certain guideline to the general public in the regulations which will be published in terms of this legislation, as to the circumstances which will guide the National Transport Commission in approving an application or advertisement in terms of this clause. I think that this is a very reasonable request, because if, for example, I want to form a new travel group among my colleagues here, I would at least like to know what the conditions are under which the National Transport Commission would give favourable consideration to my application. I think that the criticism expressed by the hon. member for Kensignton is possibly something at which one can look again. I should say that it could be rectified very well and easily by way of a regulation published simultaneously with the promulgation of the Act.</p>

<p>I also want to say that hon. members are correct in the sense that this Bill affects almost all of the existing travel agencies which are operating in the country at present. I am grateful to have heard from the hon. the Minister that it was not his intention that travel agencies should be affected in this way. But it is my interpretation of the Bill that after the commencement of the Act all of them will in fact have to obtain the necessary permission from the National Transport Commission for advertising their journeys in terms of this legislation. I therefore take it that the approval which will be granted to existing travel agencies will virtually be an automatic act. I take it that it will be easy for all existing groups that have already rendered service to the public in this regard and have been accepted in society to obtain their registration or approval in terms of this clause.</p>

<p>But may I point out further that if it were the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to restrict certain groups, so that they may not advertise journeys for which they have not been specifically licensed, then this legislation does not go far enough. If you read the clause concerned, Sir, you will see that in the second half this is stated: &#x201C;unless he is the holder of a licence under this Act authorizing such conveyance or is the authorized agent of such a holder&#x201D;. Now, the authorized agent of such a holder, once he is an authorized agent, or once he is the holder of a licence, is subject to no restriction on the kind of advertisement which he may place; and these people, in my humble opinion, may therefore still advertise this kind of unscheduled flight which starts outside our boundaries, in spite of the intention of this clause. It is my criticism that this clause possibly does not go far enough in this respect. I should be glad if the hon. Minister would have another look at that with his legal advisers.</p>

<p>May I just return for a moment to this question of automatic registration or the automatic approval which will have to be granted to existing travel agencies in terms of this Bill. May I point out that this Act will come into effect on a specific date and that the moment it comes into effect these travel agencies will be committing an offence if on the next day they should place an advertisement and promote a journey. One wants to assume that no prosecution will take place in such a case, but technically this could nevertheless be an offence. It is my feeling that there should be a kind of proviso in this legislation in terms of which these travel agencies will have a period of grace within which the necessary application may be submitted in order to request the general consent which must be given to them. I feel that this is <span class="col_1969-1970" refersTo="page_0998"/>necessary for the good order of matters in this connection.</p>

<p>Apart from this clause there is nothing further in this legislation which is contentious, and I feel that through polishing and reviewing this clause to a certain extent it will be possible to reach the goal which we want to reach, namely to restrict flights which encroach unnecessarily on the recognized flights and which unnecessarily create problems for our people, and also to restrict travel agencies which appear and disappear overnight.</p>

<p>In conclusion, however, may I point out another aspect which will be the result of this legislation. I refer to the fact that in future no travel agency may be formed in this country unless such a group or undertaking has first obtained the approval of the National Transport Commission. It is well-known how travel agencies are formed. They begin to work, they begin to sell tickets, but of course they are not allowed to take any commission before they are licensed by IATA. IATA does not license them before they have reached a certain annual turnover. That usually means that in order to establish such an undertaking, one must invest about R30 000. These are loses which accumulate over a period of two to four years before IATA grants the necessary authorization. I take it that once such an undertaking has obtained the approval of IATA, the National Transport Commission will also recognize it as a substantial travel agency. I think therefore that it will then obtain the necessary permission. Until that stage, however, the travel agency must operate without the protection of IATA, and it must therefore, before it can start its business or even before it can announce its invention to operate as a travel agency, it must first obtain the necessary permission from the National Transport Commission I should say that on the one hand this is a good thing, because it will restrict many of these <i>quasi</i>-travel agencies, these people who just want to exploit, but on the other hand it is still a violation of the freedom of an individual to carry on whatever business he pleases. I just mention this in conclusion.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the more we deal with this legislation the more difficult it becomes to understand. The hon. member for Bellville delivered with a long plea and, as the English says, &#x201C;created confusion worse confounded&#x201D;. He first made a few remarks about what the hon. member for Kensington had to say and then he agreed with him. When he had finished agreeing with the hon. member, he turned to the hon. the Deputy Minister and suggested about 20 improvements to be effected in this Bill. [Interjections.] That is precisely what we are doing. There is no such thing as a licensed carrier who may carry if he does not have a travel agency which sells seats for him. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows this as well as I do. He cannot do so and therefore this legislation is aimed at the travel agencies themselves in the first place. The hon. member for Bellville said, however, that travel agencies would no longer be able to register in the future. Surely that is utter nonsense. Of course they will be able to register, subject to the condition that the seats they sell belong to a carrier who is licensed with the National Transport Commission. I am amazed at the hon. the Deputy Minister. What this is concerned with is largely travel agencies, which as a rule, when there are unscheduled charter flights, sell to touring groups or to touring parties. They cannot guarantee at that stage that the flight will be fully booked.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Humansdorp thinks that this legislation deals with the safety and security of the air passenger, and that is of course nonsence. No aircraft may leave the ground unless it has an airworthy certificate. When we still chartered Constellation and D.C. 4 aircraft to the world&#x2019;s charter companies, it was a profitable thing to do, and those objections did not exist. Obviously those aircraft were, of course, all airworthy. All chartered aircraft which come here, from Luxembourg, from England or from Italy, are all airworthy aircraft. If an aircraft breaks down at a certain airport and cannot take its passengers any further, that is also something which applies to a scheduled air service. How often has it not happened in recent times that an aircraft has broken down at Nairobi or some such place? This has even happened to our own services. Then the passengers are stranded there under the most difficult circumstances. Whether it is a chartered aircraft or a scheduled aircraft, has nothing to do with the matter as such. Those aircraft which are chartered aircraft, must all have airworthy certificates before they may leave the ground. Therefore there is no argument with regard to the safety and the security of the passengers. <span class="col_1971-1972" refersTo="page_0999"/>This obviously has to do with travel agencies. Hon. members know that the hon. Deputy Minister who introduced the Bill and I were co-directors of a travel agency prior to his promotion. He knows that we sold groups tours and that often we could not execute them because we could not complete the group. Then, as an honourable agency, one had to refund the money. Even now one often sees advertisements for tours. <i>Rapport</i> advertised no fewer than four tours organized by agencies. Can the hon. the Minister tell us now whether they will all meet with success or not, and whether this is an honest operation or not, and whether it is an honest travel agency which uses them for its own ends, or not. He knows the situation from within as well as I do. He knows that the company to which I refer has a share in Trek aircraft which fly the world over on charter flights at lower tariffs than those of scheduled airlines.</p>

<p>I find it strange that this legislation can obviously not be applied to chartered aircraft which fly here from other countries and which, without any advertising&#x2014;because after this legislation has been passed, no one will do this&#x2014;will take the people on board here and fly them away from here. Then we have the situation that chartered flights by the dozens will be possible from other countries. After all it does not help to say that we shall refuse them landing rights, if we should perhaps want to go that far. After all you cannot refuse them landing rights because they will simply land in one of South Africa&#x2019;s neighbouring States, and that will have the same effect. They will then, in other words, be in a position to advertise in the various countries from which they depart and they do it as much as they like. It will not be possible to advertise the flights of the chartered aircraft which must depart from this country if they are not licensed. It will be even less possible for the travel agencies to do this. I repeat that, after all, no chartered flights can operate without travel agencies. Then, surely, the travel agencies are the culprits in the first instance because they have to sell the tickets. In other words, this is aimed to a great extent at the travel agencies, for if the travel agencies are unable to advertise and give publicity to them, there will be no chartered flights. There can be no chartered flights and how will people then be aware of them? in other words, this measure is aimed primarily at the travel agencies. Travel agencies and companies which have not been licensed by the Transport Commission are not allowed to advertise their flights. If there is another company which is licensed and offers chartered flights from this country, it is allowed to advertise and there is nothing to stop it. The whole situation as it has now been defined there, remains a farce to us. I want to agree with the hon. member for Durban Point who said that the hon. the Minister must alter it by not giving the Transport Commission the sole say in the matter, for how does one know when a chartered flight and a company which offers it such a reliable firm that it may be licensed? Is it only certain reliable firms which can give a guarantee which are to be licensed? How must they be licensed? What standards, what criterions are there to indicate whether they should be licensed or not? There are chartered flights to all corners of the globe. The hon. member for Humansdorp has just indicated how many depart from this country. If one can travel to another country for half the price, of course one will do it. That applies particularly to young people and students. Often these are also used by groups, whether it is a group of wine farmers or horse farmers or what have you. They take chartered flights to all points of the compass. Recently a group of them went to the East on a chartered flight. If an agency charges R800 or R1 000 for a ticket its flight will not be fully booked, but if it is able to supply the same facilities and use the same reliable aircraft and only charge R550 or R600, people will gladly accept such an offer. The flight is organized by the South African agencies or the other agencies which charter aircraft from other companies, from the Lichtenburg group or wherever they are able to obtain an aircraft. We have made a thorough study of this Bill and I am sorry, but if it remains as it is, we cannot give it our approval. Then we shall have to oppose it. I think that the hon. the Minister will himself discover, in the course of this debate or perhaps at a later stage, that it would perhaps be better if he amended clause 2.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I see that the Government speakers have dried up. Listening to the arguments raised by hon. members on the other side on this Bill, it has become quite evident to me that they have not read the Bill for <span class="col_1973-1974" refersTo="page_1000"/>otherwise they would not have used the arguments they did. First of all we heard from our friend, the hon. member for Humansdorp, and then from the hon. member for Bellville. Looking at measures like the Bill in front of us, we are confronted with the anomaly that the Department of Transport is trying to make regulations or laws to apply to the Railways Air Services. They are the ones who are looking for the passengers, not the Department of Transport. Arguments have been raised that the fact that in terms of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act transport certificates have to be used to protect the Railways, is a parallel to what is happening here. However, that is not the case. The position is that, as far as the certificates for the carrying of passengers or users on the roads are concerned, this is an internal matter. There again that has not proved, the best way either; it has not worked out as planned. Instead of protecting the Railways, we find it becoming a protection for the licensed users. So do not let us use that particular argument.</p>

<p>The Department of Transport, in trying to protect the Airways, is not helping anybody. We must remember that it is the right of the air traveller to select the best service to suit his pocket in view of the competition that exists today. I cannot understand why the South African Airways, who must have induced the Minister of Transport to come forward with this Bill, is frightened of competition. These Bills which we introduce such as the present one are becoming a bit of a joke because we are a very small country. What is the effect going to be on international airways? Our planes are flying all over the world. They are flying charter services all over the world. What is going to happen is that the international airways operators will say: &#x201C;It is the South African Airways organization that will not give us any freedom as far as the charter business in South Africa is concerned.&#x201D; They are going to want to know whether they are being victimized. We cannot localize this matter, it is an international matter. The hon. the Minister is not after local transport with this Bill; he is after the international passenger carrier. After all, they have complete control as far as internal passenger flights are concerned. There is no competition; South African Airways have a complete monopoly. Business is always built up on sound competition and I cannot understand why we are running away from it. All over the world new airlines are coming into being; more aircraft are being built; faster aircraft are being built. What is more, to make an airline pay you have to keep those aircraft in the air. The South African Airways will be faced with this competition of keeping aircraft in the air and will have to look for more business. How are they going to do it? Are they going to do it by means of this restrictive practice of making everybody apply for a licence if they wish to arrange a tour? As was pointed out quite rightly by the hon. member for Kensington, this particular clause goes very far, very much further than many people think. I do not know whether hon. members, for instance, the hon. member for Bellville, have really read it because it does apply as far as advertising is concerned. Quite often one picks up a magazine like <i>Time</i> in which one reads of tours organized to this country all over the place. They are not organized by scheduled airlines, but are collective tours organized by various types of airways all over the world to make them attractive to passengers.</p>

<p>Let us take the example of the present service which has been inaugurated to Hong Kong and the Far East. Originally it was organized by SATS flights, but today it has become a scheduled flight of South African Airways and BOAC. That is how these tours and these airlines are built up. The South African Airways should not be frightened of competition. It should be their ambition to keep their aircraft in the air. By passing a Bill containing a provision such as the proposed new section 2A we are going to restrict our airways. I am fairly certain it is going to have its effect overseas, because they will say: &#x201C;Here is an airline that is restricting us.&#x201D; It has happened before where we have had difficulties with landing rights, etc. As far as safety is concerned, the position has been outlined here. We know that today whether unscheduled or scheduled, or whether on charter or not, airlines and aircraft are in very good shape, otherwise they would not be allowed to take off or land at the airports, whether they be French, Belgian, German or any other lines. I therefore think that argument falls away. As far as protecting the public against themselves is concerned, I also think there should be some protection. I am fairly certain that most first-class agencies are licensed. What the Minister should do is to make sure not that the airlines or the scheduled flights are licensed, but that <span class="col_1975-1976" refersTo="page_1001"/>the agents are licensed. There are a lot of agents that are not licensed and they may be the fly-by-nights, the fellow that takes the money and disappears. The aircraft or the safety of the aircraft is not involved. I would like to support my colleagues on this side. We do not like clause 2 and I am going to prevail upon the hon. the Deputy Minister who has introduced this Bill, which is his first measure, to take it home tonight, to think about it and to amend or withdraw this particular clause.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban Point started by saying that I am using a sledge-hammer to kill a gnat. May I ask him: What do you use to make a shadow minister resign? Do you use a sledge-hammer or something similar? I have been blamed by hon. members on the other side of never having read the Bill, but it is obvious to me now that if that accusation were true, I am not the only one who did not read the Bill. The hon. member for Salt River, for example, is another one who did not read the Bill.</p>

<p>Let me indicate to members what sort of problems we are faced with, what we have in mind and against whom this is aimed. I just want to quote from a few newspaper clippings.</p>

<p>*The first is from <i>Rapport</i> of 19th November, 1972, from a report entitled &#x201C;Complainers had to turn back at her shop&#x201D; (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Police are looking for a young blonde girl with a very expensive sports car &#x2026; The detectives want to talk to her urgently because complaints have been lodged against the travel bureau &#x2026; A man tugged at the door in a rage yesterday: &#x201C;I want my documents, if I have to break into the place,&#x201D; he shouted. The agency of the Vaal Travel Bureau in the foyer of the hotel is also closed &#x2026;</block>

<p>I deliberately do not mention the name of the hotel. A lady came to lodge a complaint with the Police. The report goes on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In her statement to the police she said that she and her husband had booked a trip to London and Italy for themselves and their child through the Vaal Travel Bureau a year ago. Six months ago they paid a deposit of R151. A few weeks ago they paid the rest of the fare by means of a cheque for R1 000.</block>

<p>Sir, to cut a long story short&#x2014;the doors of this travel bureau were closed, there were quite a number of tickets inside the office, but this lady had simply disappeared and people had lost their money. Here is another example. <i>The Star</i> of 7th December, 1972, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fly now and pay twice. Mr. E. Farnworth, a director of 747 Travel Consultants (Pty.) Ltd., a firm now advertising return fares to Europe at R380, told Star Line the refund of money due to customers would depend on what profits the company made.</block>

<p>Then <i>The Star</i> goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sugar and spice have sprinkled the conversations we have had with Mr. D. Whall, the other director of the company, but in spite of promises to &#x201C;tinkle you about the boodle, sweetie&#x201D;, we had no success with getting refunds.</block>

<p>I am going to read you some more examples, Sir, of letters received in connection with this matter. <i>The Star</i> of 7th December, 1972, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Left in the lurch. Were it not for the help of relatives Mr. and Mrs. &#x2026; of Berea would have been stranded in London; 747 Travel had assured them a return ticket would be waiting for them in London, but it was not there. &#x201C;The flight from Johannesburg to London via Nairobi went smoothly. From London we went to Scotland and phoned the 747 Travel&#x2019;s London agents from there. As there seemed to be more difficulty, we made a special trip down to London. The agents in Oxford Street said they knew of us, but as the money had not yet come from Johannesburg for our return tickets to Nairobi, they could not give these to us. My husband and I were forced to buy our own tickets, which came to &#x00A3;120.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Here is another example of a person from Randburg who paid 747 Travel Consultants in Loveday Street R425 for a return flight to London via Nairobi. The agent was supposed to meet him at Nairobi. Sir, I can go on quoting numerous examples from <span class="col_1977-1978" refersTo="page_1002"/>the newspapers of travel agencies which take deposits, which go further and buy tickets, and which do a great deal of damage to people. Now I ask hon. members at once: Do they not think that I have a duty to that sector of the public that has been horribly misled in this way by means of advertisements, articles in the newspapers and all kinds of sweet-sounding publications, to put an end to this kind of practice?</p>

What else are we to do than to prevent these people from selling tickets to the public, to prevent them from advertising that they are going to do something of the kind, and to restrict them completely and destroy them at the earliest possible opportunity? Sir, this is the primary object of the particular clause to which hon. members on the other side object.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London City says that he would make them pay a licence fee of R30 000. That is his affair. He is a rich man. We know his history. I am not going to argue with him about the amount. I am concerned with the principle here.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I must give the hon. member for Durban Point full points. He succeeds in getting emotional about all sorts of things, even this innocent little Bill of mine. Sir, I distinctly heard him say no less than four times: &#x201C;We are denying to South Africans the privilege of low-cost flights.&#x201D; The hon. member nods; he agrees. He said that over and over again. When he realized that he was not making the necessary impression upon the House, he went even further and, said, &#x201C;We are even denying young people the privilege of cheap flights.&#x201D; But, Sir, this has nothing whatever to do with the Bill. The Bill before the House at the moment will not in any way stop people from having cheap flights to London or anywhere else. Sir, what is the position? The hon. member mentioned quite a number of chartered flights being organized by, amongst others, the Law Society, for example. But nothing forbids those members or their travel agents from applying for the written authority of the commission. There is nothing whatever to prevent them from doing so, because they would charter aircraft from the South African Airways, and any South African Airways aircraft is already excluded from the provisions of those two subsections, as the hon. member will see if he reads this section further. Only the agent who advertises, or who takes a deposit in an improper way, will find himself in difficulties under this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, I am sure that it is not unreasonable. I am sure that that is not prohibiting cheap flying; I am sure that that is not barring them from chartering an aircraft either from the South African Airways or any of its pool partners or any other licensed charter company to fly them anywhere abroad. The only objection of the hon. <span class="col_1979-1980" refersTo="page_1003"/>member in this instance is that it is too much trouble for an organization like the Chamber of Commerce to write a letter to the secretary of the National Transport Commission to ask for permission; because what is required, Sir? All that is required is written authority for advertising such a flight. I can see no objection whatsoever to that. Once the regulations are promulgated they will make it very clear to whoever is interested what conditions would have to be complied with in order to obtain this authority. Hon. members opposite have asked what sort of regulations we will have in this regard. Sir, I think the answer came very clearly from the hon. member for Bellville, who said that this law would only come into operation once the regulations have been published. This measure and the regulations will be published at the same time, and those regulations will leave nobody in any doubt whatsoever; it will make the position perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Kensington accuses me of not having read the Bill. He says, amongst other things, that machinery that was supposed to be flown to Zambia was stopped by the NTC. In any case, I cannot see what that has to do with the Bill, but let me deal with the position since he raised this matter. We have certain pool partners undertaking a specific service from Johannesburg to Zambia. Would he have preferred to have taken all that traffic away from our existing pool partners and to have given it to another charter company&#x2014;to do exactly what is happening now? Would he have approved of that sort of thing? If we took all this traffic away from our existing pool partner and gave it to a fly-by-night charter company coming from Alaska or Iceland, would he approve of that?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course they can handle it. What would prevent them from handling all the traffic? They have large aircraft flying from Johannesburg to Zambia; they have a regular service. What would prevent them from handling the traffic? They have never complained to us that they could not handle the traffic. They never even indicated that they could not do it. But I am not going to pursue the point any further. It is a very delicate matter and I do not think I should pursue it any further.</p>

<p>Hon. members made a great point about charter flights. Should we accept the principle, are they in favour of the principle, of using more and more charter flights to the detriment of S.A. Airways and our pool partners? I do not claim for a moment that this is the purpose of the Bill. Not at all. But are they in favour of the principle that more and more charter flights should be allowed from South Africa in competition with our pool partners and S.A. Airways?</p>

<p>For goodness sake, if the hon. member would allow me to continue my argument perhaps he will get a little more knowledge about the subject. Sir, we have a limited number of passengers flying from Johannesburg to abroad and from abroad back to South Africa. We have a number of pool partners and S.A. Airways undertaking that service. They are at the moment flying a certain number of passengers.

<p>The hon. member for Bellville and the hon. member for Humansdorp on my side of the House have replied to quite a number of these arguments. Therefore I shall not try to reply to those arguments again. I just want to emphasize one of the most important arguments advanced by the hon. member for Bellville. The objection was raised by the other side of the House that it would not be clear what kind of licences or what kind of authority should be requested, or what would be required. Mr. Speaker, it is stated very clearly elsewhere in the Bill that regulations will be made which will lay down the requirements to be met by the applicant for that authority. I think the hon. member for Bellville advanced a very important argument when he said that when these regulations are published, it will be crystal-clear what the requirements will be for this authority in terms of clause 2(a).</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City walked into exactly the same trap as the other hon. members. He advanced exactly the same kind of argument here. He goes a little further and says that regulations will be made and that the criterion will have to be made clear, if I understand the hon. member correctly. The same argument of the hon. member for Bellville which I have just quoted, holds good for him as well. That objection, his problem, is answered by that argument of the hon. member for Bellville.</p>

<p>Now I just want to come to a few of the other points made by hon. members.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Kensington made certain statements here which I find rather ridiculous, particularly one of them, that the Central News Agency will now be compelled to get the necessary authority if they have on their shelves any publication from overseas advertising some or other chartered flight from South Africa or in the neighbourhood of South Africa. But that is utter nonsense, is it not? How on earth can he make that deduction from the Bill before the House?</p>

<heading>POLICE ADMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary><i>(Second Reading</i>)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as is obvious from the long title, the proposed amendments are concerned exclusively with administrative and domestic matters. In short, the amendments refer to the following:</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<p>In the definition of &#x201C;member of the Force&#x201D; in the English text, the words &#x201C;noncommissioned officer&#x201D; were omitted by mistake. This matter is now being rectified.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<p>A new section 3A is being inserted in order to legalize established administrative procedure. In terms of the present provision all discharges of commissioned officers, including those on account of ill-health, shall first be submitted to the State President. This results in an unnecessary burden being imposed on the State President and the intention is that discharge on account of medical unfitness, shall in future be approved by the Commissioner, with the right of appeal to the Minister. If the proposed amendment should be accepted, it would legalize an administrative procedure <span class="col_1987-1988" refersTo="page_1007"/>which has already been followed for many years.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<p>A new subsection is being inserted which authorizes the Commissioner of Police to publish or cause to be published any sketch or photograph of a person if it is necessary in the performance of any functions of the police as prescribed by law. The publication of photographs of prisoners, without prior permission of the Commissioner of Prisons, is prohibited at present. This procedure is time-consuming and restricts the investigations of the police unnecessarily. Although escapees from detention are still prisoners under the Prisons Act, they are in point of fact being sought by the police for a new offence, viz. escaping. Such escapees are usually dangerous criminals and are often armed. It is in the public interest that the public should be alerted immediately. An additional problem being experienced by the police, is the publication of photographs of people who are not necessarily criminals, but who are important witnesses or who are missing.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<p>In section 9 of the principal Act, the jurisdiction of commissioned officers who preside at disciplinary hearings, is being extended to the imposition of a maximum fine of R30 instead of R10. The latter amount was fixed as long ago as 1912, and with regard to the present salaries it is inadequate to maintain proper discipline.</p>

<p>Clause 5 contains only the short title.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister has correctly stated that this is an administrative Bill, but it introduces some interesting new dimensions, if I may say so, with regard to staff control. First of all, I want to deal with clause 2 of the Bill which inserts a new section 3A in the principal Act. In this new section it is stated that an inquiry will be undertaken to determine whether a member of the Force is unfit to remain in the Force on account of ill-health &#x201C;or will probably become unfit to remain in the Force&#x201D;. I want to emphasize the words &#x201C;or will probably become unfit&#x201D;. As I have said, this is introducing a new dimension which is quite interesting, because I think it will revolutionize medical science if we are now able to have an investigation or an inquiry which will be able to say whether a person may become unfit for his duties in the Force. I want to emphasize this point. I think this expression is highly undesirable, because when is this to be determined, at what stage? Is it soon, or in the foreseeable future, or eventually or inevitably, that a person will become unfit? One must remind oneself that all of us inevitably through the passage of time will become unfit to perform certain duties, whatever our occupations may be. I do believe it is undesirable to legislate in this way. Whilst we appreciate that these inquiries are necessary, I do want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to give consideration to accepting an amendment which we will move at a later stage, namely to delete this indefinite aspect that a person &#x201C;will probably become unfit to remain in the Force&#x201D;. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give consideration to that, and I merely want to mention at this stage that we will move such an amendment in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>There is another aspect on which I merely wish to comment, namely that with the experience we have that things are becoming more and more expensive, I see that now in the Police Force the wages of sin are to be increased to a maximum of 200% above the fine which is at present leviable. I believe it should be accepted in the light of the other aspects of the cost of living today. We support the Bill at the Second Reading and will move that amendment in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of this side of the House I should like to support this Bill and mention a few other aspects to supplement the matters mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I want to emphasize that this Bill contributes to making the work of the police more streamlined. In regard to the dismissal of a commissioned officer for reasons of health, the discretion is now being given to the Commissioner of Police. He is the person who more than any other knows what is in the interests of this excellent organization in our country and who also knows what is in the interests of that police officer. The hon. member for Green Point has a problem in regard to the working of the new section 3A. I think this is a matter which, should it be necessary, could be discussed in the Committee Stage. As far as I am concerned, I have no problems in that connection, because the whole <span class="col_1989-1990" refersTo="page_1008"/>matter is within the discretion of the Commissioner and moreover, there is in addition a right of appeal to the Minister, which the police officer did not have previously.</p>

<p>It is also interesting and significant in this Bill, that the Commissioner may, not only in cases referred to in section 5 of the Police Act, but also in cases where a member of the Force acts in the performance of a duty determined by the Commissioner&#x2014;in other words at his own discretion&#x2014;and in the interests of South Africa, cause these photographs to be published. I also appreciate it that the jurisdiction of these so-called disciplinary courts has been somewhat extended. At a first glance it may perhaps appear that it is unfair that an officer should try an ordinary policeman serving at the same police station, but I can testify from experience that these examinations take place with the greatest circumspection, fairness and justice and that they are done very thoroughly. Apart from that, there is an automatic review by the Divisional Commissioner, as well as a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Police. Concerning these disciplinary courts I want to point out that it is known law that if a person commits perjury before any of these courts, he is guilty of a crime. But if he should act in such a manner as to be guilty of contempt of this court, he cannot be found guilty of contempt of court. He can in fact be found guilty of committing a deed which is detrimental to the good order and discipline of the Force, but not of contempt of court. I want to refer the hon. the Deputy Minister to the case of the State <i>vs</i>. Motlobo (1969/3, South African Law Reports). Perhaps it would be preferable if the hon. the Deputy Minister would take a look at this case and give this disciplinary court greater dignity and also place it in the position where, if a person should commit a deed which would under normal circumstances be regarded as contempt of court, that person would in that case as well be guilty of contempt of court. Sir, with these words I gladly give my support to this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Brakpan for his interesting exposition on the position of contempt of court in regard to disciplinary hearings. We shall definitely give this matter our attention.</p>

<p>&#x2020;With regard to the hon. member for Green Point&#x2019;s query about the phrase in the clause reading &#x201C;he is unfit or will probably become unfit to remain in the Force&#x201D;, I wish to say this clearly contemplates the possibility of the contraction of an incurable disease which deteriorates in time. In cases like that, the Commissioner must have the right to be able in certain circumstances to declare him unfit and then to get him out of the Force. But of course, there is this right of appeal to the Minister at all times. So I feel that I would not be able to accept an amendment on the lines indicated by the hon. member.</p>

<heading>ARMS AND AMMUNITION AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(<i>Second Reading</i>)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members are aware, the Arms and Ammunition Act of 1937 was repealed in its entirety by Act No. 75 of 1969. The main reasons for the new Act were to ensure proper control of arms and licences by, <i>inter alia,</i> making the Commissioner of the South African Police, instead of all the magistrates&#x2019; offices all over the country, responsible for the issuing of licences. In this way the issuing of licences as well as particulars of arms are centralized. The new Act is being administered by the Department of Police, and in order to enable the said department to make the necessary preparations for take-over from the Department of Justice, this could only come into operation on 1st February, 1972. During the past year the police have consequently, as one could expect, experienced certain less important problems in connection with the practical application of the statutory provisions which in some cases have also inconvenienced the public, and dealers in arms and ammunition gunsmiths. In the Bill which is under consideration now, an attempt is made to solve these problems.</p>

<p>Because the consideration of applications for new licences is in the hands of one central body, it obviously takes a long time before the applicant can receive his licence. This period of waiting is increased <span class="col_1991-1992" refersTo="page_1009"/>as a result of the fact that particulars of fire-arm licences have to be entered in identity documents by the Department of the Interior in terms of regulations made under the Population Registration Act of 1950 (Act No. 30 of 1950).</p>

<p>Everything possible is being done to expedite this procedure, but in view of the foregoing it will never be possible to issue a licence immediately. As the procedures improve and the backlog is made up, this should eventually not take longer than approximately 10 days.</p>

<p>However, provision has to be made for really pressing and urgent cases. The only logical solution is a temporary authorization which may be issued free of charge and for which provision is now being made in clause 2. The amendment in clause 1 is also connected with this matter.</p>

<p>The period for which such a temporary authorization shall be valid, will be prescribed by regulation&#x2014;clause 7(a). The proposed temporary authorization will to a considerable extent contribute to facilitating matters for dealers and especially for enthusiastic marksmen.</p>

<p>Hon. members are also aware of the fact that in order to bring about effective control, a relicensing of all arms must take place. In section 4(1) of the Act a period of 12 months is laid down during which this relicensing was to have taken place. Since relicensing was commenced on 1st February, 1972, this task has appeared to be a far greater one than was expected. Amongst other things, unavoidable delays occurred in the Population Registration Office. These problems were gradually ironed out, and up to 31st December, 1972, 239 244 licences had already been issued.</p>

<p>It is expected that it will take another six months, approximately, to complete the relicensing. Provision is now being made in clause 3 for extending the prescribed period to 18 months, the Minister having the power to extend it further should this appear to be necessary.</p>

<p>In clause 4 provision is being made for an identification number to be stamped or engraved on the fire-arm in question should the Commissioner require this to be done. This provision is necessary since it has come to light in the course of the relicensing of fire-arms that there are numerous fire-arms bearing the same number.</p>

<p>Clause 5 amends section 19 so as to authorize the issuing of a trading licence for dealing in ammunition only, i.e. not in fire-arms as well. This amendment is being effected at he request of numerous dealers, especially in the rural areas, who have no demand for fire-arms but in fact for ammunition.</p>

<p>Section 19(7) of the Act has become redundant and is being deleted because all dealers&#x2019; licences have already been issued in terms of the 1969 Act by now.</p>

<p>Clause 6 links up with clause 5 and extends the existing provisions in respect of a licence for dealing in ammunition only.</p>

<p>In clause 7 the Minister&#x2019;s powers are extended so that he may make regulations in respect of&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the form of the authorization referred to in clause 2, and the period of validity of such authorization;</li>

<li>(b) the payment by gunsmiths of an annual registration fee which will be determined by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance. This amendment is being effected at the request of <i>bona fide</i> gunsmiths themselves, who are of the opinion that the payment of a registration fee will prevent amateurs and dabblers, who do not have sufficient knowledge, from posing as gunsmiths;</li>

<li>(c) the storage of arms and ammunition. Such a provision existed in the repealed Act. This was unfortunately omitted in the new Act, with the result that a condition concerning safe storage now has to be attached to every licence.</li>

</ol>

<p>In clause 8, which contains the short title, it is provided that the proposed Amendment Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on 1st February, 1973. This is necessary with a view to extending the period for relicensing for which provision is now being made in clause 3.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister in justifying this measure has made it quite clear that there seems to have been a lack of foresight in the introduction of certain procedures for licensing fire-arms, either lack of foresight in determining the procedure or some breakdown in the procedure laid down for this particular purpose. The first circumstance <span class="col_1993-1994" refersTo="page_1010"/>which is causing a considerable amount of difficulty&#x2014;and I have had matters drawn to my attention by hon. members of this House&#x2014;is the fact that magistrates or senior police officers, since the passing of the Act, are unable to issue registration certificates to the various persons who call to have a fire-arm registered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>It is the magistrate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The Deputy Minister has provided in clause 2 of this Bill that the commissioner may in his discretion issue certain licences. If this is to be effective it must be a power which must be extended or delegated to magistrates throughout the country to handle the situation, otherwise one wonders what is to happen to a man in Bedford or Cathcart or Tzaneen who wishes to have a fire-arm licensed. It is impossible to go to the central registry because that is cluttered up at the present time; so where is he to go to have his fire-arm licensed? I believe it is desirable and essential that these fire-arms should be licensed, although there is now an extension of the amnesty for another six months, but they should be registered or there should be some certificate showing that a person is entitled to have a fire-arm in his possession. I trust that in the provisions of this particular clause the intention is to see that these are made available and can be issued at least by magistrates throughout the country.</p>

<p>Then we come to the second provision in this clause and that is the extension of the amnesty. Sir, one is getting a little tired of this particular provision being extended. Let me remind you what the position is. Originally this Act, the registration of firearms at the central registry, was to have come into operation on 1st February. 1972, but it was found that it was quite impossible to undertake this work. It is being undertaken by the Department of Police in conjunction with the Department of the Interior. I have personally been to see the mass of work that has to be done in the central registry. I do not think it was foreseen what was involved in getting the firearms registry linked with identity registration in the central office in Pretoria. We have already had one amendment extending the amnesty period for registration to the end of January, 1973, and now we are to have by this Bill another extension of six months, which shows us how uncertain the hon. the Deputy Minister is as to whether that is going to be effective, because he has now given himself another way out by providing that the Minister may extend this period again. He can extend the period of 18 months if he so finds it necessary. I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that unless something is done in regard to the correlation of the work between his department and the Department of the Interior in this registry office, he will need that power to extend this period even further to get these registrations finalized. I believe there is something which is clogging up the works as far as this aspect of identity documents is concerned. While I am on this subject, which is part of the identity documents, these fire-arm licences, one wonders to what extent applications are going forward to the central registry to be processed and computerized, which in themselves are not complete and then have to go back to this Deputy Minister&#x2019;s department&#x2014;I should say from his one hand to his other hand, because he is Deputy Minister of both Police and the Interior&#x2014;and to the Department of Police to be clarified before they go back again to the Department of the Interior to be computerized and to be placed on record. I think this is a matter which needs investigation. I myself, as I say, when visiting this department saw what seemed to be droves of members of the Police Force in all sections of the building attending to the issue of these fire-arm licences. One wonders whether it cannot be looked into to see that when these documents come in, for processing and the computerization starts in the Department of the Interior, at least the documents are correct and they can go through the computer and be put into the book of life.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister has referred to other amendments which are contained in this Bill. I believe that these are desirable and as such we will support them. That is in regard to the division of the business of dealing in fire-arms and ammunition. In other words, it will now be possible for a merchant to deal in fire-arms or ammunition and not necessarily in both fire-arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>The next point I want to come to is how it was possible, what has happened, in regard to this extraordinary omission from the Act, as it now stands, in connection with the question of the storage of arms and ammunition by licensed dealers and <span class="col_1995-1996" refersTo="page_1011"/>registered gunsmiths. Have there been no means whatsoever of controlling this storage over all this period of time that the Act has been in operation? It seems to me a most extraordinary position if registered gunsmiths and licensed dealers have been able to do what they pleased in so far as the storing and caring of these weapons are concerned in the country.</p>

<p>But we shall support the Bill. We feel it is a necessary one. We do hope that we shall find that the hon. the Deputy Minister and the department have so cleared up the backlog in registration of fire-arms that it will not be necessary for the Minister to use these permissive powers to extend this amnesty period for any longer than the period which is now provided for in the Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Green Point sounds concerned about the delays that occur and about the procedure that has to be followed for obtaining a fire-arm licence. My experience has been that those people who have already obtained their fire-arms licences, experienced no practical problems in obtaining them. In regard to the delay and the extension of time that has now been granted, my argument is that it is more important that we make sure that this arms register will be absolutely correct in every respect rather than to complete it in a hurry. The hon. member has made no mention of any facts which he has in his possession and which indicates that the delay is really attributable to negligence on the part of any person or can in any way be ascribed to ineffective action taken by the departments concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>But the delay exists.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>This is a tremendously comprehensive and important task which the State has undertaken, and instead of criticism I think they much rather deserve praise for it.</p>

<p>This Bill contains provisions in respect of several aspects which, basically, can be divided into two parts. The one part contains provisions aimed at improving the service already being rendered to the public. These are the provisions aimed at granting more time for obtaining licences, the temporary authorization which now enables a person to take possession of a fire-arm which he purchases, even before his licence is issued, and the question in regard to ammunition, which will result in ammunition becoming more readily available to members of the public because there will probably be more applications now for licences to deal in ammunition only.</p>

<p>The second part of the Bill involves obligations. I should like to say a few special words about the obligation involved in expecting, under specific circumstances, an owner of a fire-arm to have a serial number stamped or engraved on the firearm in question at the request of the Commissioner. In 1969, when the principal Act, which is now being amended, was before this House, the necessity for the control of arms was explained by, <i>inter alia,</i> the Minister. According to col. 4876 of Hansard, Vol. 26, he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the times in which we are living other factors have also arisen, factors which make the strict control of arms and ammunition an even more urgent necessity. What we particularly have in mind here, is the terrorist threat and infiltration across our borders and the changed pattern of crime in which more and more use is being made of fire-arms in cases such as robbery and the various manslaughter cases.</block>

<p>These facts are still present and the effective control of arms is an absolute necessity. In the first place, the effective control of arms is aimed at ensuring that only qualified persons may acquire a fire-arm, but, in the second place, it is aimed at ensuring that, when such a qualified person has acquired a fire-arm, he will exercise proper possession and will, in his possession of that fire-arm, act in a responsible manner in the spirit of the Act, namely that a fire-arm carries with it a responsibility for its owner. This amendment, which provides that a separate serial number must be stamped or engraved on a fire-arm in cases where there may possibly be confusing numbers, underlines afresh the responsibility of the fire-arm owner, namely that he must exercise possession of his firearm in a responsible manner. This can also be of decisive importance in criminal investigations for enabling one to determine beyond any doubt who the owner of a particular fire-arm is, because by tracing the fire-arm back to its registered owner it is definitely possible to determine in many <span class="col_1997-1998" refersTo="page_1012"/>cases by whom the crime was committed. Even if it should turn out not to be the owner himself, it may be a person from his immediate circle who could have had access to that fire-arm. I want to express the hope that the introduction of this Bill and especially the provision relating to the responsibility of the fire-arm owner, namely to exercise possession of his fire-arm in a responsible manner, will impress hon. members of the public and make them realize that in handling such fire-arms they should exercise the greatest care to ensure that such fire-arms will only remain in the authorized possession of persons who are really qualified under the Act to possess such fire-arms.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I merely rise to reply to the questions put by the hon. member for Green Point. He asked me whether it would not still be possible for the magistrates to issue licences under delegation. The idea is actually that the whole matter of the issuing of licences should go over to the police, and if there is any delegation it will be to the relevant district commandants, divisional commissioners, and so forth. The issuing of licences is being taken away from the Department of Justice and taken over by the police. This is being done in order that there may be a total and continuous check. Hon. members will recall that even under the old set-up it was necessary, before the magistrate issued a licence, to obtain first a report from the police. That is now being eliminated completely. There are just as many police offices as there are magistrates&#x2019; offices, and now the work is only done once.</p>

<p>We shall give the hon. member one in any case. The other question was why there had been delay and why a request was now being made for a period of six months and, later, with the approval of the Minister, for a further extension of time. As the hon. member knows&#x2014;he paid a personal visit to the place where the population register is being kept in Pretoria&#x2014;large-scale organization is in progress at the moment. As far as the police are concerned, we did our best to enter as soon as possible the particulars relating to the registration of a fire-arm in the book of life of the person concerned, but on the whole the issuing of the book of life has been delayed. They were given additional work to do, such as the general registration of voters. The result was that the police just could not finish their task. This was just not possible because not enough books of life had been issued. We are tied down by that&#x2014;we cannot go any faster than the rate at which the book of life is issued by the population registration office. That is why it is necessary at this stage to ask for an additional six months or, if that period is not sufficient, for the Minister to be able to extend this period further by way of exercising his discretion. It is, as the hon. member for Vereeniging said, absolutely essential that all the correct data should in fact be entered in this book.</p>

<p>If I understood the hon. member correctly, he also asked why it was necessary to make at this stage a regulation prescribing the conditions of storage. Am I correct?</p>

<p>In other words, the hon. member was under the impression that there had been a lacuna in the previous Act in that regard. I want to tell the hon. member that the legal draftsmen were of the opinion that, because there were so many possibilities as regards dealers in arms and ammunition and their premises, it would be better to make the conditions of storage a condition of the licence; in other words, that, when the licence is issued, the storage condition which is now being introduced in the regulation, be entered on the licence. But we have found that it is actually more of a bother on the licence and that it is better, after all, to regulate this matter by regulations. That is why this amendment is now being introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill as introduced, deals with certain amendments to the Population Registration Act, 1950.</p>

<p>The Bill does not contain any contentious provisions. The Bill is designed to facilitate certain procedures in the administration of the Act. It deals with four aspects of an administrative nature. The first of these aspects deals with the interpretation of the word &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D;, that is the Secretary for the Interior, in the Population Registration Act and his powers of delegation there under. It is known that Bantu are taken on register in the Bantu Reference Bureau and that the register so compiled in fact forms part of the population register of the Republic. To enable the head of the Bantu Reference Bureau and his personnel to compile the register in respect of Bantu, it has been necessary for the Secretary of the Interior to delegate his powers under the Population Registration Act to the said head of the Bantu Reference Bureau. The law advisers pointed out that it is not sufficient to delegate the powers under the Population Registration Act to the head of the Bantu Reference Bureau only. It was pointed out that the head of the Bantu Reference Bureau does not himself include the name of every Bantu person in the register but that this work is carried out by his officials. There is doubt whether this procedure is in order because the officials concerned do not work &#x201C;under the control and direction of the Secretary for the Interior&#x201D;, to use the words of the Act, but under the direction of the head of the Bantu Reference Bureau.</p>

<p>By clause 1(b) of the Bill it is proposed to amend the definition of &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; in section 1 of the Population Registration Act, to include any person employed by the State or the holder of a post in the public service acting under a delegation from or under the control or direction of any person, such as the head of the Bantu Reference Bureau, who in turn acts under a delegation from the Secretary for the Interior. Since the Bantu Reference Bureau commenced its activities on 2nd July, 1953, the proposed amendment of the expression &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; in section 1 of the Act is made of retrospective effect from this date by clause 6(2) of the Bill.</p>

<p>The second aspect of the Bill deals with the notification of change of residence and postal address as provided for in section 10 of the Population Registration Act. Section 10(1) of the Act provides that every person whose name is included in the Population Register shall within 14 days after any permanent change has taken place in his ordinary place of residence or postal address, notify the Secretary for the Interior of that change of residential or postal address. Subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 of the Act provide at present that the person who consents to such residence being taken up on any premises over which he has control, shall after the expiry of 14 days after such residence has been taken up, ascertain whether the new resident on his premises has advised the Secretary for the Interior of his change of residential address. If it is found that the new resident did not notify the Secretary for the Interior of his change of residential address then the person in control of such premises must advise the Secretary for the Interior of the change in the address of the new resident within 45 days from the date on which the new resident took up residence in his new address. These provisions contained in section 10 of the Act are measures of control to ensure that the Secretary for the Interior will be notified of changes of address. Thus hotel proprietors and managers and lessors of premises must check up on their lodgers and lessees whether they have given notice of their change of address.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Association of Chambers of Commerce in South Africa and of the Institute of Estate Agents of South Africa submitted representations to the department in regard to these provisions. They feel that the provisions will be difficult to apply in practice, and that the members of their associations should not be called upon to stand in for <span class="col_2001-2002" refersTo="page_1014"/>defaulting citizens who do not carry out the obligations under the laws of the country. They, however, pointed out that their members would prefer to give notification of all persons taking up permanent residence in premises controlled by them. By the proposed amendment of section 10 (2) of the Act as embodied in clause 2 of the Bill, it is provided that persons in control of premises may as an alternative advise the Secretary for the Interior of the prescribed particulars of all new residents on their premises within 14 days from the date on which such new residents took up residence on such premises. On receipt of this information it will still be possible for the Secretary for the Interior to check whether the new residents concerned have given notice of their change of address, and if it is found that they have not done so, the Secretary for the Interior will be able to institute the necessary inquiries. This amendment has, therefore, in fact been asked for by the organizations mentioned and effective control of changes of address by persons included in the population register will still be maintained.</p>

<p>Because it would place an unnecessary burden on for instance a private home owner who allows his adult daughter, an aunt, or friend to live with him permanently, or an employer who allows his employees to live on his premises like so many farm employees do, the present provisions of section 2 are maintained, namely that new residents may be asked whether they have given notice of their change of address. If such a home owner or employer finds that the new residents on his premises have given notice of their change of address, they need do no more. It is only when they find that this has not been done that they have to inform the Secretary for the Interior of the names and addresses of the new residents. This they must do within 28 days from the date on which the new residents took up residence on their premises. He need also not complete any forms, but merely has to write a letter to the Secretary for the Interior, giving the required details about the new residents, i.e. names and identity numbers. Because it is mainly private home owners and employers, such as farmers, who will follow the existing procedure, it is no longer necessary to allow the persons in control of premises 45 days as presently provided for in section 10(3) of the Act, in which to check up whether their new residents have notified their change of address to the Secretary for the Interior. This period is consequently shortened to 28 days. This is also done to keep track of those persons who frequently, sometimes monthly, change their residential address.</p>

<p>Clause 5 of the Bill contains similar amending provisions as regards the notification of change of address by persons residing or taking up residence in South-West Africa. By this clause it is sought to amend section 7 of the Identity Documents in South-West Africa Act, 1970, which is identical with section 10 of the Population Registration Act, 1950, in a similar way as the said section 10. In passing, I wish to add that the provisions of section 10 of the Population Registration Act and section 7 of the Identity Documents in South-West Africa Act have been suspended by the State President for an undetermined period. This was done so as not to place unnecessary burdens on landlords in the interim period and while only a small percentage of the population is registered in the new population Register.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, the third aspect to the Bill I wish to deal with, concerns the seizure of identity documents which people have no right to possess.</p>

<p>Section 15(2)(a) of the Population Registration Act, 1950, provides that whenever it comes to the notice of a Bantu Affairs Commissioner or the Secretary for the Interior that any person is in possession of an identity document, such as a reference book, on which such person&#x2019;s race is reflected as &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; and if he is also in possession of another identity document on which his race is reflected as, for example, a Cape Coloured person, the identity document on which the race of the person in question is not reflected as Bantu may be seized forthwith. The law advisers pointed out that such a person had to be in physical possession of both identity documents before the document on which his race is not reflected as Bantu may be seized. It happens that Bantu who possess reference books subsequently gain illegal possession of identity documents describing them as Cape Coloureds, for example. Either they are no longer in possession of their reference books because they were destroyed or they are hidden away, and consequently the identity documents they are not entitled to have in their possession cannot be seized. In view of this it is proposed in clause 3 that section 15(2)(a) of <span class="col_2003-2004" refersTo="page_1015"/>the Population Registration Act be amended in such a way that, when seizing an identity document in cases where two identity documents have been issued to a person, it will no longer be necessary for such a person to be in physical possession of both documents before the identity document to which he is not entitled may be seized.</p>

<p>The last aspect of the Bill I wish to deal with, concerns notification to a person of his classification as Bantu, and the measure of doubt which has arisen in that respect. Clause 4 proposes the insertion of a new subsection in section 19 of the Population Registration Act, 1950. This new subsection seeks to establish beyond all doubt that a person to whom a reference book has been issued be deemed to have been classified as a Bantu and also be deemed to have become aware of his classification on the date upon which such reference book was issued to him. It is not the practice when reference books are issued to inform the person concerned of his classification by means of a separate document, and the indication of his classification in his reference book is deemed to be sufficient proof of his classification as a Bantu and of his classification having been made known to him. Attention has been drawn to the fact that it is doubtful whether the ordinary Bantu male realizes that the issuing of a reference book to him serves to inform him of his classification as a Bantu in terms of the Population Registration Act. Some Bantu are now trying, on the basis of this doubt, to raise objections to their classification which has been in force for many years. This may result in the question of their classification now having to be reopened. In this respect I just want to explain that up to 31st January, 1972, the identity cards of Bantu on which their classification was indicated were inserted in their reference books. With effect from 1st February, 1972, identity cards were no longer inserted in the reference books of Bantu but their personal particulars were inserted in their reference books in the place of identity cards. This is essential in order to comply with the proviso contained in section 13 of the Population Registration Act, in terms of which no identity documents are issued to a person to whom a certificate of citizenship has been issued in terms of the Bantu Homeland Citizenship Act, 1970. The position is, therefore, that the Bantu were not given any indication of their classification as Bantu when their reference books were issued to them because their identity cards were inserted in their reference books until a short time ago while at present particulars of the Bantu ethnic groups to which they belong are inserted in their reference books. In order to eliminate the doubt which exists in this matter and which people are now trying to exploit, the proposed new subsection to be inserted in section 19 is drafted in such a way that a person to whom a reference book has been issued is regarded as having been classified as a member of the ethnic group indicated in his reference book and that he is regarded as having been informed of his classification at the date on which the reference book was issued to him. In terms of clause 6(2) the proposed new subsection 19(1D) is being made with retrospective effect to 22nd June, 1956, that is, with effect from the date in terms of which a prescribed period for the submission of objections to classifications was laid down.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said at the beginning of my speech that the Bill before this House was not a contentious one, and is intended to improve and facilitate the administration of the Population Registration Act. It is therefore hoped that both sides of this House will see their way clear to giving this Bill their support.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, may I rise immediately to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister of the Interior that he is not going to be as fortunate as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police. We intend opposing this Bill. We do not intend to support what he calls a purely administrative Bill. Sir, this Bill goes far beyond a purely administrative measure. I propose to deal with the arguments of the hon. the Deputy Minister and with the various clauses of the Bill.</p>

<p>The first point that I want to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister is in regard to the identity documents which will be issued to Bantu and which will be regarded as identity documents under this new definition for the purposes of this Act, i.e. the reference book which is to be issued to a Bantu under the Bantu Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents Act of 1952. The hon. the Deputy Minister has stated that the Bantu register is proceeding apace. It forms part of the register under the control of the Department of the Interior. Powers are being delegated to the official in charge of the Bantu register and he himself has authorized other persons to act under him in the issue of these Bantu <span class="col_2005-2006" refersTo="page_1016"/>identity documents. Sir, under the law as it now stands the Bantu identity documents may well be issued to a person who also receives an identity document as a Coloured person, but before any action can be taken under section 15 of the Act as it stands now, that Bantu person must be found to be in possession of both his Bantu reference book and in possession of identity documents as a Coloured person. What the hon. the Deputy Minister is doing in what he calls a purely administrative measure is to continue to give this delegated authority to the officer in charge of the Bantu register and to make the mere issue of the Bantu reference book a sufficient justification for the withdrawal of any Coloured reference book issued to that Bantu individual. Sir, first of all, how are these Bantu reference books issued? Are they issued only on application, or are they issued in some other manner by the Bantu Affairs Department on whatever information is contained and collated in the Bantu register? Because if a Bantu reference book is issued, it is issued either because application has been made by the Bantu concerned, the application has been accepted and this has gone to the Bantu register, or the Bantu reference book is issued because the information concerning that person is taken up in the register and he is in fact a Bantu.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, let us look at the other side of the coin. If that man is in possession of a Coloured identity card, then he has that Coloured identity document only because he has applied for it and he has been found by the Department of the Interior to be entitled to an identity document as a Coloured person. Sir, the amendment here is far-reaching if we read clause 1 with clause 3 of the Bill before us. What can happen now is this: The Bantu register is compared with the Interior register, and the Secretary for the Interior can take out from that register in his department any identity documents referring to a man who also has a Bantu reference book, whether that Bantu is in possession of his reference book or not. It can be done purely as an administrative act, and this man can be told, &#x201C;This book must be returned because you have been issued with a Bantu reference book.&#x201D; This is going to lead to an awful lot of confusion and a great deal of hardship as far as Bantu people are concerned. It seems to me that the provisions as they are now were sufficiently strict to prevent any person masquerading as a Bantu and a Coloured at the same time. But at least he had to be shown to be in possession of both these documents, and not that one had been administratively issued to him, and on that his other documents would be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Others who will speak on this matter will deal more fully with this, but that brings me to the second point, and that is this extraordinary amendment to the definition of &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; with retrospective effect over 20 years to 1953. It is a most extraordinary thing in this House that we should find now that apparently the Department of Bantu Administration or somebody has been acting for 20 years without legal authority for acting in the way they have been acting. One wonders how many Bantu have had their Coloured books withdrawn because they were supposed to be in possession of Bantu books which were illegal and were not worth the paper they were written on, and how many people have been prosecuted for perhaps not returning, under various laws, their Bantu reference books, when in fact those Bantu reference books were not of any value and were not worth the paper they were written on, as I have said. Now we are asked to approve this amendment. Again I ask: Why this amendment? Why must it be extended in the form that it is, that it is now to be the Secretary for the Interior or any person acting under a delegation from or under the direction of the Secretary for the Interior? In other words, included here is a person to whom the Secretary has delegated authority, a person who acts under the Secretary or under the direction of the Secretary or the person to whom authority has been delegated, or another person who has delegated authority and he himself gives directions to other people down to the office boys; they are all now regarded as being part of the Secretary for the Interior for purposes of the Population Registration Act. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister has lost sight of a very important matter, and that is that the powers and the responsibilities of the Secretary for the Interior in terms of the Population Registration Act are in the hands of the Secretary for the Interior and his interpretation, and I know that he is bound by the laws of the country, but how he himself comes to a conclusion can have far-reaching effects on families and on generations to come. I refer particularly to section 5(4)(c) of the Act, that is to the power to correct mistakes. Sir, that is one aspect, but what about the initial stages of <span class="col_2007-2008" refersTo="page_1017"/>an initial classification? Now the Minister wishes us to give this power virtually to any clerk operating in that department to whom these documents are submitted, to decide on the classification of an individual. If the Minister has this problem in regard to the work that has been done in regard to the Bantu reference books over the last 20 years, it is quite a simple matter to regularize what has been done by a simple clause saying that those books are not deemed to be invalid, and then to provide for some delegation for the future. But why must the whole machinery of race classification be brought under this because something has gone wrong in regard to the authority in the Bantu reference book section?</p>

<p>What is the difference &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let me try to explain what I am getting at. The hon. the Deputy Minister has made out a case to us that there is need to validate the actions done in connection with the Bantu register, and that is that persons have been acting as though they had authority to do what they did, under delegation, and that books have been issued which in fact have turned out to be of no legal value whatsoever because they were not signed by a properly authorized person. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister says that we must say that the action of any person acting under a delegation from the person to whom originally the power was delegated, or acting under the direction of that person, should be validated back to 1953. He has made out a case for the Bantu register, but this is an amendment to the Population Registration. Act.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister need only read Act No. 30 of 1950 to see the vast number of important and heavy responsibilities which are placed upon the Secretary for the Interior. This amendment as it now is means that the Secretary himself need not apply his mind to the discharge of those responsibilities in exercising those powers. That is why I suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this is something which has been done before in legislation, that one validates back to an original date such actions as have been done by persons who believed that they had authority to act. But this is continuing. This is a provision now that has to stand in the Population Registration Act for the future, not only for Bantu purposes, but for the classification of Whites, Coloureds and the other groups which we have defined in the definition of the identity document. I should like to stress the point I am trying to make. If one looks at section 5(4) of the principal Act one reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If at any time it appears to the Secretary that the classification of a person in terms of subsection (1) (other than a classification in accordance with a decision of a board) is incorrect, he may, after having given notice to that person and, if he is a minor, also to his guardian, specifying in which respect the classification is incorrect, alter the classification of that person in the register after affording such person and such guardian (if any) an opportunity of being heard.</block>

<p>Let us assume that there are reclassifications which are desired by certain persons. They know that there is in the department this wide delegation of powers. Everybody in the Department of the Interior acts under the direction of the Secretary, every employee in the department is acting under the direction of the Secretary as head of the department. A junior clerk may say to a person who wishes to have a reclassification that he is in a position to bring about such a reclassification. The junior clerk then changes the classification from one classification to another. This reclassification cannot be disputed because it is an administrative act done by a person who is now to be authorized in terms of this Bill to do so. The hon. the Deputy Minister must agree with me that every official in the Department of the Interior works legally under the direction of the Secretary for the Interior. I believe that this is an unnecessary amendment and certainly one which we cannot support.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 2, which amends section 10 of the principal Act. This, again, is rather like doing some shadow-boxing at the moment, because section 10 has not yet come into force. It is still not to come into force until some time to be determined in the future. Before it comes into force, we have now decided to amend what will happen when it does come into force some time in the future. The hon. the Deputy Minister will recall that when section 10 originally came before Parliament, we on this side of the House opposed it strenuously. The section comprises three subsections. The first subsection is not being <span class="col_2009-2010" refersTo="page_1018"/>amended at this stage, but in order to get the full picture, I want to point out that it throws the onus upon the individual himself to notify the department of any change of address. This is provided by section 10(1). Subsections (2) and (3), as they originally came before Parliament, throw the burden onto the landlord, the flat-owner, etc. We opposed it and as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, the Chambers of Commerce have opposed it. The Association of Estate Agents have opposed it. He then says that they have said that this will be all right because this is in a new form. They have no option; the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out that the provisions of the Act are there. What he is trying to do is to facilitate in some way an obligation which we believe is an intolerable obligation in so far as property owners and their lessors are concerned. This matter was argued and debated fully in this House on a previous occasion. We then made our position clear and we cannot depart from that position. The question of registration and of keeping the authorities informed of changes of address is an obligation on the individual citizen himself and not on somebody else who happens to let him a property or give him a roof over his head. The trouble is that there has never been an attempt to force citizens to discharge their obligations particularly in regard to the electoral laws in this country. That is why our voters&#x2019; rolls get into such a mess. Nobody realizes that Parliament is serious when it says that a man shall do this, shall notify a change of address. The hon. the Deputy Minister is smiling. He is frightened to prosecute somebody if he does not register because he might lose his vote. The position is, however, that Parliament has seriously enacted that an individual must notify the department of a change of his address. There are other similar provisions in our laws in regard to the Receiver of Revenue, the Post Office, etc., which place an obligation on individuals to do certain things. People do those things because they know that that is for their convenience. As far as this provision is concerned it is just ignored. I believe it is wrong to try to shift that responsibility from the individual citizen and pass it over to somebody else to discharge it on his behalf. I believe it is quite impractical. The hon. the Deputy Minister has referred to it and the amendment refers to it that he shall furnish the Secretary with prescribed particulars. What are these prescribed particulars? Have they been prescribed yet? One wants to know what the hon. the Deputy Minister has in mind. If it is that he must supply the identity number of the person concerned, you might as well not amend this Act but leave it as it is because he still has to go to the individual and say: &#x201C;Please produce your identity document; I want to see what your number is.&#x201D; I do not know what these prescribed particulars are. If, on the other hand, the hon. the Minister merely expects the landlord to send a list saying: &#x201C;Mr. Tom Jones has come into flat 2 and Mr. Bill Smith has gone out,&#x201D; it will be all right, but how does that help anybody, how is that going to help the Department of the Interior? How is it going to help the Department of the Interior to trace that particular individual? I believe this is wrong and we shall oppose the imposition of this obligation. I believe it is wrong to continue with an obligation of this sort. Fortunately, and thank goodness as I have said, this is a section of the principal Act which is in suspended animation at the moment. One does not know when it is going to be applied, but I trust that the hon. the Deputy Minister will in due course take the necessary steps to have these subsections (2) and (3) deleted from section 10 of the Act. The obligation of complying with what is required of the person as a citizen of a country is an important matter. I believe that if this population register is going to be effective, the individuals must know that they have an obligation to discharge themselves, as individuals, to notify a change of address to the central register and if they have to be chased and if it is subsequently found that they have not done so, that they will be up for some penalty or other. I believe it must be done, otherwise we can scrap this register entirely right from the commencement up to the end and forget about it. All the electoral rolls for future elections in South Africa are to be based on this register. Hon. members are aware of it that the department is now able through this register, through this expansive and elaborate equipment, to be able to provide virtually at the press of a button a great deal of information on persons in various electoral divisions. All these millions of rand will have been spent for nothing unless that register is kept up to date. One only has to look again at what is happening when information comes into that <span class="col_2011-2012" refersTo="page_1019"/>office at the present time, information which is incomplete, to realize how useless the information can be that comes from the source other than the individual himself. At the present moment if an application comes in for an identity document there may be one or two omissions from that form, but it takes weeks and months to trace up that form from the individual himself. How much more is going to be involved in trying to collate a return from a landlord with the record in the register itself? One is aware of the difficulties involved in obtaining full details. A lot of people will say: Why must I give you my name? My father or my husband has signed the lease; we are the tenants; so what has it got to do with you whether the lady living with me is my wife or my girl-friend? What is then to happen? A landlord has to approach Mr. X, the tenant of the flat, and say: &#x201C;Could I have the full names of your wife?&#x201D; The tenant looks a little uncomfortable and replies: &#x201C;I am not prepared to give you the full names of the lady who lives with me in this flat, nor am I prepared to say whether she is my wife, my cousin, my sister or any other relation of mine.&#x201D; This then becomes absolutely worthless.</p>

<p>There are aspects I want to mention with regard to the application of the provisions of this Bill to South-West Africa. Again, as the main Population Registration Act does not apply to South-West Africa, it is really extraordinary that we must sit here and legislate in respect of matters which are ancillary to the existence of a register. As hon. members are aware, our population registration provisions, the definitions, and so on, which apply in the Republic do not apply in South-West Africa. I do not know why we are being asked to look at these provisions in respect of the pass laws as applying to South-West Africa, while the Act itself does not apply to South-West Africa.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to limit myself to a discussion of the provisions of clause 2 and the similar clause which wants to apply it to South-West Africa. In passing I would like to mention that the hon. member for Green Point is really unnecessarily anxious, oppressed and afraid. Apparently he is looking for all kinds of sinister intentions behind the introduction of this Bill. Firstly, he was afraid as far as the question of delegation is concerned. He maintained that this is such a very drastic provision, but the Act, as it stands, already covers all instances of delegation to officials who work in the Department of the Interior. This delegation, which is now being introduced, does not refer, therefore, to officials who have already been engaged in the implementation of the Population Registration Act. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated, it only refers to the one branch, i.e. those who have not worked in the Department of the Interior. Secondly, the hon. member is worried about the presumption created in respect of the holder of a reference book, but that is still only a presumption that is being created. It can be refuted. It is also a completely valid presumption which may be created to the effect that if a person is supplied with a reference book, he will know from its contents he is now classified as a member of the race group mentioned in that reference book. It only places the onus on him to prove that this is not so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to confine myself in particular to the remarks which the hon. member made regarding clause 2 in the Bill, namely the question of notice of change of address by the owner, too, of the dwelling in which someone takes up residence, over and above the notice which the person himself who has changed his address is bound to give. To start with I want to say that this provision does not differ materially from the provision which it seeks to amend. The principle still remains the same, namely that a home-owner has performed his duty if he determines from the person, who has taken up residence permanently, that he himself has given notice of his change of address. That was so under the section which is now to <span class="col_2013-2014" refersTo="page_1020"/>be amended, and the amendment which is now being recommended here does not change that principle. All that the home-owner need ask the dutiful newcomer to his house is &#x201C;Have you given notice?&#x201D; and if he gets the answer &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, his duty has been done and he need do nothing further. If he were to get a non-dutiful newcomer in his house this clause places the onus on him to give notice. I wish to ask the opposite of what the hon. member for Green Point asked, i.e. whether this clause, as it stands here&#x2014;and I ask this with the utmost respect because the hon. the Deputy Minister said he regards this Bill as non-contentious&#x2014;is not going to have as little force with regard to action against home-owners as the old section. But the problem is still the same, i.e. that the home-owner need only ask and accept the answer he then receives. If, after six months, an inquiry is made he is under a tremendous onus of proof to prove whether he met his obligations under the Act. I want to ask for the consideration of the hon. the Deputy Minister, whether he does not want to give attention to the possibility of removing all doubt as far as the provision is concerned by in fact placing an obligation on the home-owner, besides the obligation which already rests on the person himself who has moved, to give notice anyway to the effect that the person has moved in with him and now resides there permanently.</p>

<p>In one breath the hon. member for Green Point underlined the importance of this population register and referred to the fact that this population register would ultimately be relied upon with regard to elections. But on the other hand he does not want an effective measure that ensures that the population register will be as near to being perfectly correct as possible. It is not such a new principle to place an obligation upon someone to give notice to the State of something that happens to someone else. We have that same principle in our hire-purchase legislation, i.e. that someone must give notice to the hire-purchase seller if someone moves in with him if he wishes to escape from certain provisions of the Act. It is a <i>contradiction in terminis</i> of the hon. member for Green Point to underline the tremendous importance of this population register in one breath, and in the following breath to say that the home-owner cannot accept this minor obligation. It is no problem for the big letting agents to institute a simple procedure to provide that when the agreement of tenancy is signed, a notice should also be signed simultaneously by the new tenant. That notice can then simply be posted by the letting agent of big estate agencies and the task of the home-owner and the person taking up residence is completed because it has been done for him. It is a minor administrative task which our estate agents and attorneys&#x2019; offices can take upon themselves to make their contribution.</p>

<p>The population register is also of great importance for other reasons. It is extremely important in respect of the question of arms, which we dealt with here a moment ago. It is important for the tracing of the next of kin of someone who has perhaps died in a car accident and who only has his identity document with him. If he had not given notice of his change of address, we would have struggled to trace him. I can go further and quote reams of examples why it is of vital importance for the Republic of South Africa, if we are to take well-ordered action, plan properly and take effective State action, that we have such a population register. And the hon. member endorses this. But now the hon. member wants to have a minor measure, which we are requesting, removed completely from the Statute Book. No, Sir, I very respectfully want to ask that this measure be made more effective, either by simply placing an obligation on the home-owner as well and forgetting about the question of optional inquiry, or alternatively by further qualifying the optional inquiry, i.e. that the home-owner, after he has in fact made an inquiry, as the section reads now, can go further and demand written proof from the new tenant to the effect that he has told him he has in fact reported. If he has to put pen to paper to say he has done something he has not in fact done, the newcomer will not easily tell a lie.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Green Point is unnecessarily concerned by the obligation on home-owners because it is not such a heavy obligation. With proper organization it can be converted into a service to the country, a service I am sure all home-owners will be willing to render.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Vereeniging objects to our seeing what he calls, &#x201C;sinister intentions&#x201D; behind this Bill. We do not see any sinister intentions; we see total chaos and impracticability in the application of the proposals which are included in clause 2. Hon. <span class="col_2015-2016" refersTo="page_1021"/>members get excited when I say &#x201C;total chaos&#x201D;. I do not know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister was Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde, but in the last Bill before us he asked and obtained from the House, permission to postpone a measure because the paperwork could not be handled by his department. Now Mr. Hyde comes along, ten minutes later, and says: &#x201C;Now I want to add to the records a few million bits of paper which will come pouring in because now he must have a paper from all residents or, if he does not get it from them, from the owner or landlord. At the moment he cannot handle applications from only those who are looking for weapon licences. He has appealed to the public&#x2014;and the Government has appealed to them not to apply for the book of life. He admits that it is impossible to handle the volume of work. And I am not blaming the department. My information is that the volume of work that has come in and the mistakes made by applicants in the applications make it a physical impossibility to handle it all. Now what is going to happen, I ask, to the bit of paper that comes in from the landlord of the tree house in the Caprivi Zipfel, saying that somebody has moved from this tree-top to that tree-top, when it reaches the department? But let us take a block of flats in Cape Town. Somebody moves from one block to another. Sir, the department has not yet dealt with that person&#x2019;s application for the book of life. It now gets a notification that he has moved from block So-and-so to block So-and-so. But it has nothing to which to tie that. The department now has to find out first whether it has already computerized the existence of that person in the book of life; because unless that person&#x2019;s name has gone into the computer, you cannot change what is not there. You cannot change an address if that address is not already on the tape. And then hon. members laugh when I say there will be total chaos. Of course there will be chaos if you are feeding in information to correct a register which does not yet exist. Therefore we are not seeing spooks. We are not seeing sinister motives. We see that this measure which we are being asked to support, is impractical. It cannot be applied until the basic machinery is ready to receive information.</p>

<p>Then we come to our objection as to who is being asked to supply the information.</p>
