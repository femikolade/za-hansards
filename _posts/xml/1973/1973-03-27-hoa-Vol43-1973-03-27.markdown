<heading>ABATTOIR COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate yesterday we indicated to the hon. the Deputy Minister that we would today move certain amendments to this Bill, in particular, certain amendments to this clause. The reasons that were given for these amendments were that we were not prepared to grant the Government the power to allow the Abattoir Commission to expropriate land from a private individual and then to pass that land over to another private individual for commercial purposes. We know that we have the Expropriation Act which allows the Government, local authorities and certain statutory bodies to expropriate when it is in the public interest. But we do not believe that the powers which are being asked for in this particular clause should be granted to any statutory body such as the Abattoir Commission. Following upon that debate, I now move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 13 and 14, to omit &#x201C;any other person&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a local authority or a person referred to in section 30, or an exporter or wholesale distributor of meat,&#x201D;; in line 17, to omit &#x201C;, sale, distribution&#x201D;; in line 19, after &#x201C;abattoir,&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;for export or wholesale distribution&#x201D;; in lines 20 and 21, to omit &#x201C;or such person&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;, local authority or such person, exporter or wholesale distributor,&#x201D;; in line 35, to omit &#x201C;other person&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;person other than an exporter or wholesale distributor of meat&#x201D;; to add the following new paragraph at the end of subsection (3) of the proposed new section 31A:</block>

<block name="quote">(3) (b) If the commission expropriates land in terms of this section for the purposes of the export or wholesale distribution of meat, that land shall remain the property of the commission and shall be leased by public tender to any person desiring to establish an industry connected with the export or wholesale distribution of meat of animals slaughtered at the abattoir concerned.</block>

<p>; and in line 44, to omit &#x201C;other person&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;person other than an exporter or wholesale distributor of meat&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The whole object of this amendment is in fact &#x2026; May I have the attention of the <span class="col_3455-3456" refersTo="page_0281"/>hon. the Minister of Agriculture for a minute&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>If they will stop making a noise, Sir, I will speak responsibly with the hon. Minister, who, I know, has the courtesy to deal courteously with us on this side. Yesterday the hon. member for Green Point pleaded with the other side to accept that land so expropriated, when it is in the interests of an abattoir or if it is necessary for the continued existence or for the establishment of an abattoir, should not be handed over to an individual or a company in freehold. He asked that if such land was to be handed over, it should be handed over in leasehold, and that it should be done on tender only.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to quote from Hansard what was said by the hon. member for Green Point at that time; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe in the interests of the industry continuing to function. Let me give the Minister one other instance.</block>

<p>The Minister of Agriculture interjected to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think you have convinced me already.</block>

<p>Whereupon the hon. member for Green Point indicated that he would not press his argument any further but that he would leave the matter in the hands of the hon. the Minister. I hope the hon. the Minister has considered this amendment and that he or his Deputy, who is handling the Bill, will indicate this afternoon that they intend to accept the amendment which I have moved.</p>

<p>I feel that I must, however, motivate this particular amendment and explain it for the benefit of this Committee. The first part of the amendment, the amendment in lines 13 and 14, is designed to limit the persons on behalf of whom the Abattoir Commission may expropriate. As the clause stands at the moment, the commission may expropriate for its own benefit or for the benefit of any other person. We wish to amend that to read &#x201C;for the benefit of itself or a local authority or a person referred to in section 30&#x201D;. Sir, a person referred to in section 30 is a person who has received a certificate from the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to the effect that he may establish an abattoir&#x2014; a person who has permission to establish an abattoir&#x2014;and as far as the establishment of an abattoir by such a person is concerned, I wish to repeat, we have no objection to it at all. We wish, however, to limit this to those persons who are involved as exporters or as wholesale distributors of meat. Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister, when he introduced this measure, made it quite clear that these were the sort of persons he wishes to help. He made it clear that he did not anticipate the assumption of very wide powers under this particular clause, but I submit that as the clause is printed now it does give extremely wide powers, which I do not believe the hon. the Deputy Minister wants, because when he introduced this measure he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Vanwe&#x00EB; die aard van die slag- en distribusiebedryf is dit wenslik dat die slagplaas en bedrywe wat daarmee in verband staan&#x2014;byvoorbeeld fasiliteite van die groothandel&#x2014;op aangrensende persele gevestig moet word. Grond vir di&#x00E9; doel is nie altyd geredelik beskikbaar nie. Dit word derhalwe voorgestel dat die kommissie met bykomstige magte beklee word om grond vir genoemde doeleindes te onteien en aan die betrokke instansies beskikbaar te stel.</block>

<p>Sir, this is what we are trying to achieve in terms of the amendment which I have now moved; we are trying to carry out the wishes of the hon. the Deputy Minister himself. The amendment, incidentally, in lines 20 and 21, is merely consequential upon this one particular amendment, so I will pass on to the amendment in line 19, namely after &#x201C;abattoir&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;for export or wholesale distribution&#x201D;, where once <span class="col_3457-3458" refersTo="page_0282"/>again we are now endeavouring to limit the reasons why or the purposes for which land may be expropriated; in other words, to limit it to land which is &#x201C;required for the handling, treatment, storage, packing, cooling, freezing or processing of meat or products of animals slaughtered at any abattoir for export or for wholesale distribution&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, in subclause 3 of the proposed new section 31A it is provided that if the commission expropriates land on behalf of any other person, this land can be transferred in freehold into the name of that particular person, and in fact the Registrar of Deeds is authorized to transfer such land into the name of such person. We feel that such a transfer of land, if it is for the benefit of the local authority or of the commission or of the person who owns the abattoir, should be allowed, and therefore we wish, by this amendment, to hand over such land to the commission, the local authority concerned or the person who has been authorized to establish an abattoir. The amendment in line 44 is also merely consequential upon this amendment, but, Sir, the most important part of this whole amendment is the proposed new section 31A(3)(b), which I feel should be read so that the members of this Committee will know what it is all about. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the commission expropriates land in terms of this section for the purposes of the export or wholesale distribution of meat, that land shall remain the property of the commission and shall be leased by public tender to any person desiring to establish an industry connected with the export or wholesale distribution of meat of animals slaughtered at the abattoir concerned.</block>

<p>Sir, here is the crux of the whole matter. Where you have expropriated land for the benefit of an individual or a company, a commercial enterprise, which is there not in the public interest but which is there for one object only, and that is to make money, then we believe that it would be utterly wrong for the commission to give that land in freehold because there would be no hold whatsoever over the person or the company concerned; next year they could change their minds and say, &#x201C;We are not going to carry on with the wholesale distribution of meat; we want to establish some other kind of factory.&#x201D; This would be entirely wrong; it would be unfair. We feel that this should be done by lease and we feel further that the land should not be expropriated with the object of leasing it to a particular individual or to a particular enterprise. Once having expropriated the land and having made the land available for lease, that lease should be put out to public tender because, as I said yesterday in discussing another matter, not only must justice be done but it must also be seen to be done. Let us make sure that there will be no scandal attached to this; the only way I believe this can be done is to put the lease out to public tender once the land has been expropriated.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the course of the Second Reading yesterday the hon. the Deputy Minister indicated to me that he was convinced that certain amendments would be necessary. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister would perhaps clarify the position now before we go further and enter into a lengthy debate, which will be unnecessary if the indication which he gave us yesterday is going to be fulfilled. If the hon. the Deputy Minister would deal with the matter at this stage, it might curtail the debate.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>It is very clear that the whole problem in regard to this Bill concerns expropriation for the benefit of outside parties, i.e. of private persons. As I said yesterday, I feel that I can to a large extent meet the objection of the Opposition if we introduce an amendment in line 19 by inserting, after &#x201C;abattoir&#x201D;, the words &#x201C;of which the commission is the owner&#x201D;. I wonder whether this will be sufficient to satisfy the Opposition. I do feel that I should make it clear again that while we are in general agreement that expropriation must be handled very carefully, this concerns a specific matter, namely the abattoirs and matters related to abattoirs. So we cannot cast the net too wide. We are concerned here with meat, with the handling of meat. I think that this amendment can certainly meet the objection. Accordingly I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 19, after &#x201C;abattoir&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;of which the commission is the owner&#x201D;.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry to say that the amendment does not meet our objections at all. What it indicates now is merely that the expropriation for the benefit <span class="col_3459-3460" refersTo="page_0283"/>of a private person can take place only when it is in relation to an abattoir owned by the commission. But that still leaves open in this clause the position&#x2014;and I read from the commencement&#x2014;&#x201C;The commission may, with the approval of and on the conditions determined by the Minister, for its own benefit or for the benefit of any other person expropriate land&#x201D; for certain purposes, and then in line 19 &#x201C;slaughtered at any abattoir which is the property of or is owned by the commission&#x201D; as it is to be amended. So it makes no difference whatsover.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>The commission is the owner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, the hon. the Deputy Minister has still in this amendment not met the objection. What does it mean now&#x003F; Those premises of which the commission is the owner refers to the abattoirs&#x2014;&#x201C;slaughtered at any abattoir which is the property of the commission&#x201D;. Now, what ground has been expropriated&#x003F; It may be ground adjacent to the abattoir of which the commission need not remain the owner, because it does not say so in this amendment. So the commission may expropriate for itself or &#x201C;for the benefit of any other person&#x201D;. If the Deputy Minister means that he does not want the expropriated land to be owned by any individual, but that it remains the property of the commission, then his amendment does not say that. It does not achieve that end. The words which must be deleted are &#x201C;or for the benefit of any other person&#x201D;. In other words, the proposed section 31A would then read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) The commission may, with the approval of and on the conditions determined by the Minister, for its own benefit expropriate land which (a) &#x2026; (b) is required for the handling &#x2026; of animals slaughtered at an abattoir owned by the commission.</block>

<p>What it boils down to, is that the provision that the commission can expropriate &#x201C;for any other person&#x201D; must be deleted.</p>

<p>I think we have now reached the stage where we are possibly going to land in a drafting problem across the floor of the Committee. I want to put simpe questions to the hon. the Deputy Minister who is handling this Bill. The first simple question is whether he and the Government intend proceeding with the right to expropriate land which will become the property of a third person; in other words, the commission will be able to expropriate land which will then become the property of another person. In other words, will subsection (3) still apply&#x003F; This subsection reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the commission expropriates land for the benefit of any other person &#x2026; such person shall become the owner thereof.</block>

<p>If the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to continue with this, then we are opposed to this. However, if the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s intention is that land which may be expropriated must be adjacent to or in connection with a commission-owned abattoir and that that land must remain the property of the commission for its ancillary use or purposes, then we are with him. The position is, however, that the amendment does not meet that position. If we may depart from the purely legal language in this matter, let us look at the factual position as to whether the department will commit itself to the expropriation of land in connection with an abattoir owned by the commission and that the land so expropriated will remain the property of the commission. If that simple question is answered in the affirmative, then we are with the hon. the Deputy Minister. He can then get the legal advisers to redraft this provision and it could then be dealt with in the Other Place. I think I can say so on behalf of this side of the Committee.</p>

<p>May I just put the questions simply again&#x003F; Do we have the assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister that what he is aiming at is the right to expropriate land adjacent or near to or in proximity of a commission-owned abattoir&#x003F; That is question number one. The second is whether the land so expropriated will become the property and remain the property of the commission &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have been asked by the hon. member for Green Point what the object of this amendment is. It is obvious that we should like to make the process of slaughtering livestock and the marketing of meat operate very smoothly and that we want to make the Abattoir Commission function efficiently in such an abattoir. I fully agree with him that this procedure, as proposed in the amendment of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District as it reads at the moment, ultimately does not make sense. Consequently I am glad that the hon. member for Green Point agrees with me that such an amendment results in a large number of consequential changes which are unfortunately not accommodated by the amendment. The object of the amendment is to make things function smoothly. It is still an open question whether we are going to lease it or in what other way it is going to be dealt with. We are investigating whether we can do this and whether we shall then be able to meet the requirements that exist.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because we are now changing it into an abattoir belonging to the commission, we thought that it would be sufficient and that the hon. members would be content. For that reason I want to express my appreciation for the fact that the hon. members are really trying to co-operate. As the hon. member for Green Point said, it is in fact no easy matter to effect these amendments in the legislation as it stands. For that reason I want to undertake that we shall go into the matter, together with the law advisers and the Abattoir Commission, in order to see whether we can meet their requirement by having the premises leased. If we can do it that way, I shall change it accordingly in the Other Place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for the assurances he has given us. I want to make it quite clear that our approach in the Second Reading was that we believe that we stand by any steps which are necessary to modernize, develop and to make the abattoirs more efficient in this country. The only point which we have raised and which remains with us is the point of the deprivation of a private person of the property, property which belongs to him, for the benefit of another private individual and not for the benefit of the commission or a public body such as a municipality. We have the assurance from the hon. the Minister that so far as the Government is concerned, that is what they want to achieve with the amendments which still have to be drafted. Unfortunately the hon. the Leader of the House is not here, but this is again an instance of the problems we run into when legislation comes in such quick succession that there is not the time to investigate it properly between the one stage and the next. We in this House this afternoon have to leave this matter for adjustment in the Other Place only because we had the Second Reading finished last night at seven o&#x2019;clock, and are now already busy with the Committee Stage. That is not the fault of the hon. the Minister or the hon. the Deputy Minister; it is a fault on the Order Paper which we have before us. I think that on the assurances which have been given by the hon. the Deputy Minister, we are satisfied that there will be a protection of the rights of private persons and that any expropriated property will be utilized by the commission, that it will remain under their control and that there will be no posibility of preferential treatment to a certain individual at the cost of another.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to make the position very clear. We really do have a problem with leasing. I stated yesterday that we could easily encounter the problem that the Abattoir Commission owns an abattoir, that it has the land available in the vicinity of the abattoir and now wants to lease it, but that there are no entrepreneurs who are willing to invest money there and to spend a large amount of money there, because it takes place on a leasehold basis. That is a problem which we could encounter. I foresee that it is possible that such objections may arise. I should very much like the hon. members to understand very clearly that we are concerned with a practical matter here. For that reason I cannot give an absolute assurance that we shall deal with it in the way that <span class="col_3463-3464" refersTo="page_0285"/>the hon. member for Green Point has now advocated here. However, we shall give serious consideration to his proposal, because we believe that he wants to cooperate in this matter. In this regard, however, we shall have to learn from practices, and the best people will have to assist us in framing a definition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is obvious that in proposing this amendment to this Committee, the hon. the Deputy Minister meant that when it was necessary to expropriate for the handling, the treatment, the storage, the packing and the subsequent processes, it would only be done in certain cases. I want the hon. the Minister to understand me perfectly well; we do not want to quarrel about this matter later on. In terms of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment these powers of expropriation granted to the commission will only apply in cases where the commission itself is the owner of that abattoir. Are we quite clear on this&#x003F; In other words, if the amendment moved by the hon. gentleman is accepted, if we are prepared to accept his amendment, it obviously means that the commission cannot expropriate in cases where such an abattoir belongs to someone else, or if the commission wants to expropriate for the purposes of paragraph (b). Let us be quite clear on that point. In that case we are prepared to accept the amendment moved by the hon. gentleman and also to accept the undertaking he has given, that proper consideration will be given to the proposal of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, i.e. that when it is possible, the land or property which is expropriated should rather be left in the hands of the commission and leased. In other words, if the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s advisers advise him accordingly, he must also introduce that amendment in the Other Place. If that is the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attitude, we are prepared to accept his amendment and also to take his word for it that it is in fact his intention to amend it in the Other Place under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Yes, I know the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned it in his speech, but what he said in his speech was not the interpretation which the hon. member for Newton Park now places on it. This is why we want clarity. Before we accept this amendment, we want clarity on exactly what the hon. the Deputy Minister means by this amendment. [Interjections.] The noisy gentlemen on my left can participate in the debate. If they have any courage and if they know anything about this matter at all, let them participate in the debate instead of sitting here making noises and disrupting what is a serious debate. What exactly has the hon. the Deputy Minister put forward&#x003F; He has suggested that when the commission expropriates in terms of paragraph (b), i.e. expropriates land which is required &#x201C;for the handling, treatment, storage, packing, cooling, freezing, sale, distribution or processing of meat&#x201D;, the commission may only do that in respect of abattoirs the commission itself owns. In other words, it cannot be done for an abattoir which is owned by a local authority or by a person authorized by the Minister in terms of section 30.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>So far, so good, but where do we go from there&#x003F; After the land has been expropriated for an abattoir owned by the commission, what happens to it&#x003F; I submit that in that case the provisions of subsection (3) come into effect and that that land can still be passed on to a private individual, which he may hold in freehold; he will have full rights to that land. That is the crux of our objection; it is stated in subsection (3), it is implicit therein, that the land will be handed over to a third party. As far as the limits which are proposed in the <span class="col_3465-3466" refersTo="page_0286"/>amendment are concerned, namely that depending on circumstances it is limited to certain people such as the local authority, the owner of an abattoir or the holder of a certificate that has been granted in terms of section 30, we have no objection to this measure. We have no objection to subsection (3) either, as it stands. But when it comes to a private individual who is operating for his own economic benefit, although it is associated with the abattoir and although the continued existence of the abattoir is dependent upon those subsidiary services, which we accept, it is something completely different. We are prepared to meet the hon. the Deputy Minister with this compromise solution which I have suggested this afternoon. If he will add that, then I can say that we can accept his amendment. The case made by my friend for Newton Park is to the effect that it limits all this expropriation to the commission. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that there is a doubt as to whether the commission may lease land &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I was going to refer the hon. the Deputy Minister to what I believe is an empowering clause whereby the commission is empowered to lease land. In terms of section 4 the commission is empowered to let land out to other individuals and it was on this basis together with the object of the commission in section 3 of the Act that we have based our amendment. However, it appears that at least we are <i>ad idem</i> on the whole question of where we are trying to go. I am sorry that we were unable to sort this matter out before. We on this side of the House did attempt by negotiation with the department to arrive at some compromise solution on this matter. Unfortunately we have been unable to do so before coming to this House, but the hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated his <i>bona fides</i> and I hope he will give us the assurance now that the hon. member for Newton Park has asked for. In anticipation that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give us that assurance, with the permission of this Committee I withdraw my amendment.</p>

<p>Amendments proposed by Mr. W. T. Webber, with leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p>Amendment proposed by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the proposed subsection (1):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that such levy shall not be more than 12 cents per head for cattle, horses, mules and donkeys, not more than 6 cents per head for calves and pigs, and not more than 3 cents per head for sheep and goats.</block>

<p>In the Second Reading debate I already made it clear that we on this side of the House were originally opposed to the imposition of this levy, but subsequently we got the hon. gentlemen on that side to the point of restricting the levy to certain amounts. In the Second Reading debate the hon. the Deputy Minister made out a case for the fact that increased costs are indeed involved in the work the commission is doing, and we are prepared to accept that their work has increased considerably since six or seven years ago. We can understand that the commission now needs additional revenue; we are not opposed to that, but what we are, in fact, opposed to here is that completely unlimited power is being given to the commission, precisely what we had a quarrel with hon. members on that side of the House about six years ago. They now come along and want the same position, and can therefore not expect to get this clause through the House without our again making our standpoint clear in respect of this matter. I therefore want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to accept this amendment of ours. If it has taken six years for the Abattoir Commission to come back to the House and make out a case for increased revenue, and we on this side of the House are prepared to increase their revenue by not more than 100%, it will most certainly be possible for them to carry on for a few years before it would be necessary for them to return. It is therefore not necessary to do this each year. We also hope that they will not immediately demand from the producer the maximum we are now proposing, but that they will initially increase it by say 33&#x2153;%. They could then increase this to the maximum in the course of time. Thereafter they would again have to come back to this House so that we could make the change.</p>

<p><span class="col_3467-3468" refersTo="page_0287"/>There are many good reasons why we feel that this House should give the decision. Here is a service which the livestock farmer in South Africa furnishes to the local authority, the public and every consumer. He is the only person who pays for that. It is actually unfair that he alone should pay for this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Correct. Initially this amount had to come from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. But, Sir, since the matter cannot be changed now, I say that the livestock farmer has the right to urge that in this case the minimum should be claimed from him.</p>

<p>What about slaughtering fees&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I knew that argument would crop up now. The hon. the Minister asks: &#x201C;What about slaughtering fees&#x003F;&#x201D; and &#x201C;What now of the Meat Board levy&#x003F;&#x201D; The farmer can go and negotiate all those matters with the Meat Board. We can express criticism about that here in the House of Assembly, which has, in fact, happened before. He can also go and discuss the question of slaughtering fees with the local authority. That is also a service which those people again furnish him with. The levy he pays to the Meat Board, is for the sake of the stability of the price of his product. If he sends his livestock to the local abattoir and they have to be slaughtered, that local authority is furnishing him with a service. As long as it is fair, the farmer is not unwilling to pay it. But it is not comparable to this levy. Because we are not complaining about this levy, do hon. members on that side want to say: &#x201C;Because you say nothing about the slaughtering fees and the Meat Board levy, you agree that it may be sky-high&#x201D;&#x003F; That is absolute nonsense, Sir! That is not the standpoint of this side of the House. We have the fullest right, in the discussion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, to come and speak to him about the increased levy being paid to the Meat Board. We can make representations to him to persuade the local authorities not to set such high slaughtering fees. The opportunity is there. But the hon. the Minister and the commission now want the right to levy any amount. That is what the clause amounts to. The commission may, with the approval of the Minister, from time to time impose a levy in respect of every animal slaughtered at an abattoir. Sir, he can ask R2 or R10. I do not say that he is going to do so; but with the power the hon. gentleman is requesting here, he would, in fact, be able to do so. It is our standpoint that the amount must be kept as low as possible and within limits. It is surely not unfair of this side of the House to ask the Deputy Minister that if he finds that it is necessary for him to change this amount after a few years, he should again return to this House to do so. Even in the normal omnibus legislation at the end of a session, such a provision can be inserted. Special legislation is not even necessary, therefore, to obtain an increase of that amount; as I have said, it can even be included in that omnibus legislation, if it becomes apparent after a few years that it must be an increase of this amount. That is why we request the hon. the Minister to give consideration to this so that he can protect the agriculturalist in this respect, because the agriculturalist is the person who must carry the whole burden in this respect in order to keep the commission going.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Newton Park says he wants a maximum amount laid down by this House, but that is not actually what he wants. What he actually wants is that that amount should come out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<p>We said so originally.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I now want to tell you what the hon. member reminds me of. He reminds me of one of my voters who told me the other day that he actually has two prices he wants for maize this year. If he cannot get the first price, he will be satisfied with the second. That is now what this hon. member wants to do. In respect of the really extensive costs he says the farmer may go and negotiate, in the first place the Meat Board in the case of the levy which it collects, and then with the municipality in the case of the slaughtering fees that are levied. But, Sir, no matter how much the farmer negotiates, those extensive costs cannot be reduced to the level of this small amount. How can the farmer reduce it to such an extent that it will be no more than this small <span class="col_3469-3470" refersTo="page_0288"/>amount&#x003F; In the second place the hon. member says that those more extensive levies are collected in respect of services that are furnished, and therefore they can be collected from the farmer, but this small amount, he says, is something else. Sir, what is this Abattoir Commission doing other than furnishing a service&#x003F; Now I want to refer again to what happened in the case of the City Deep abattoir. Is the saving brought about there not a service that was furnished to the whole meat industry and not only to the cattle farmers&#x003F; It is a service that was furnished to everyone.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>To the consumer as well&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, to the consumer as well, because for whom are those animals slaughtered&#x003F; For the farmer or for the consumer&#x003F; Why does the hon. member not say, then, that the slaughtering fees should be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund&#x003F; After all, the animals are not slaughtered for the farmer. He slaughters his cattle on his own farm. He does not need an abattoir for slaughtering his cattle. It is the consumer who needs those facilities. But, Sir, the hon. member is not concerned about those large amounts, and therefore I cannot understand his reasoning.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that a change in this amount, which must be paid, can be brought about in the omnibus Act at the end of a session. But if the Minister were to go too far and allow the Abattoir Commission to demand an excessive levy, the hon. member can surely in terms of the half-hour adjournment rule, initiate a tremendous debate; then he could obtain all the farmers&#x2019; votes. But the Minister would surely never do such a thing. Only if it were a United Party Minister sitting here would we be needing such an Act. But in this case it is not necessary to have such an Act because, after all, it is our Minister, our farmers&#x2019; Minister, and therefore we are telling him he may continue. After all, we would stop him if he wanted to impose too high a levy. If the Minister were a United Party man, however, he would have been an irresponsible person, and what would we then have been able to do with him&#x003F; Therefore, Sir, it is not necessary for a maximum amount to be fixed. On the contrary, if that amount of 12 cents were to be written into the Act now, the commission would be encouraged to ask 12 cents, or whatever the amount may be that you lay down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Not more than 12 cents.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>What is more, the Act did not initially make provision for a maximum; it was left to the discretion of the Minister. It was later changed and it was then stated that there should be a maximum of 6 cents for cattle and another amount for sheep and goats. Now we are coming back and changing it again to give the discretion to the Minister. This surely goes to prove that the Act, in its initial form, was correct in leaving it to the Minister&#x2019;s discretion and not fixing a maximum. This is precisely what is happening now, and therefore I cannot see why it is necessary to prescribe a maximum here, because the hon. member concedes that that amount would perhaps be insufficient again in two or three years&#x2019; time and that the Minister would then have to come to this House again with a Bill to change the amount, and therefore it is much more practical to leave the levy in the hands of the Minister. He can then change it when it becomes necessary. After all, he looks after the interests of the farmer. Why, then, would he lay down an excessive levy&#x003F; Besides, the levies of all the boards are increased with the approval of the Minister, and there has never been any complaint about that. Why would there now specifically, in the case of the Abattoir Commission, be a reason to complain that the Minister is acting irresponsibly&#x003F; If this clause is passed as it stands, this levy is brought into line with the levies of other marketing councils; it works well in practice, and I therefore do not foresee any problems as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Lichtenburg began by saying that all the other boards impose their own levies, but he forgot that they do so not only with the approval of the Minister, but also under the supervision of the Marketing Council. In other words, there are two supervisory authorities; the one is the Marketing Council and the other is the Minister. But here we are dealing with something quite different; we are dealing with a statutory board, i.e. the Abattoir Commission. Yesteday we were opposed to the principle that the levy could arbitrarily be changed in season and out of season, during the Parliamentary session or out of session, and this is still what we are objecting to today. What objection can there be <span class="col_3471-3472" refersTo="page_0289"/>to our proposal that any change in the levy by the commission should first be approved by this House&#x003F; Neither the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, nor the hon. the Minister can tell me what their objection to that is. The hon. the Minister, the hon. the Deputy Minister and all of us surely foresee that in the course of time the Abattoir Commission will play a big role. I predict that they will also handle the storage of large quantities of meat in times of surpluses, and if that were to happen we do not expect the commission still to impose the same levy as that which the Meat Board imposes. In other words, with the development and unfolding of this scheme, the time will come when the Meat Board as such will possibly impose a lower levy and the commission a much higher levy, but then we always still want the relevant Minister to have to come to this House to tell us for what purposes the levy is being imposed. We want the levy to carry the stamp of approval of this House. Does the hon. the Minister or the Deputy Minister want to tell me that they want the commission to be in a position to change the levy arbitrarily&#x003F; Why must any board be saddled with the responsibility of doing something for which all the farmers in the country can criticize it, while the matter can be submitted to the House and be settled here&#x003F; Everyone would then be satisfied and the board would then not be accused of changing the levy arbitrarily in season and out of season. Sir, I want to lodge a plea with the hon. the Deputy Minister to the effect that he should please accept this amendment. Let us please not argue about this small thing too. It is surely essential to make it possible for any statutory body to be called to account for itself at some or other stage, and the time to do so is when it wants to change the levy, not when it has already done so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City, if I understood him correctly, made the point here that he is satisfied with the system adopted in the case of marketing councils, because the National Marketing Council advises the Minister about the increase of levies. Have I understood the hon. member correctly&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member is therefore satisfied with the system that is adopted by the existing marketing councils, on condition that the National Marketing Council exercises so-called supervision over the Minister. That is actually what the hon. member is implying. He is implying that the marketing council, appointed by the Minister, supervises the Minister to ensure that he does not go too far with the imposition of levies. [Interjection.] That is what the hon. member is implying. The facts of the matter are these: The Marketing Act provides that the Minister must approve or reject any levy proposed by a marketing council, in that case on the recommendation of the National Marketing Council. In this case a recommendation again comes to the Minister to the effect that the levy should either be increased or decreased. But here the hon. member does not want to trust the hon. the Minister with the same power as he has under the Marketing Act in the case of the control boards. But, Sir, the Minister does, after all, appoint the members of the marketing council. In other words, according to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument, he proceeds from the supposition that the marketing council, which is appointed by the Minister, is his boss. I am completely convinced that it is only an O.B. general who can argue in that way. The hon. member for East London City must now take his seat again and think about this matter. If he wants to, I shall explain the facts to him in the lobby in a moment. Then he will perhaps have a better insight into the matter. Sir, I wholeheartedly support this clause because it is no deviation from the principle that it is only the Minister who must approve levies. It is only the Minister who approves them. And I want to ask the hon. member for East London City: Would the Minister approve an excessive levy just to anger the farmers&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am surprised that the hon. member for Newton Park has come <span class="col_3473-3474" refersTo="page_0290"/>along with this amendment. If we analyse this matter properly, we find the following. I have here an account of settlement of ten oxen that were sold on the Cape Town market. Apart from the railage, the slaughter fees were R10-10, municipal fees R16, levy R12-40, fodder R2, telegram 33c, the Meast Board&#x2019;s insurance R1-81, commission by the agent R47-44 and the levy of the Abattoir Commission 60c. Therefore, from total abattoir costs of R90-65, the commission drew an amount of 60c, and that is what this whole debate is about. I want to say again that I do not want to argue, but I am honestly surprised at the United Party taking so strong a stand on this point. I must concede to the view of hon. members that as far as this is concerned, the Minister&#x2019;s approval is sufficient guarantee not to let this 60c increase too much. I honestly feel it is taking the matter too far if we allege, as the hon. member for Newton Park alleged, that for the sake of the farmer it is necessary, from time to time&#x2014;it may be five years, it may be six years or it may be three years&#x2014;for us to come along here to argue each time in the House about this small amount, which I want to concede will increase, but it will not change much in proportion to the other costs. If it were a matter of principle, I would have yielded. The previous point was a matter of principle, as far as I am concerned, but here it is not a question of a principle. All the other boards have this power. This authorization for the levying of this amount I want to bring into line with the position that obtains in the other boards. I honestly feel we are wasting a bit of time if we become so serious about such a trifle. I feel that the Minister and the responsible board are sufficient guarantee that these costs will not be excessive. Now I want to put a final question. When the Abattoir Commission is already making use of its funds and foresees that it is going to get into difficulties, that they are not going to come out with their revenue, i.e. that its revenue and expenditure will not tally, and we then come along here, as the United Party asks us to do, with a law amendment to put this matter right, would they oppose it even if there are legitimate reasons why the costs have gone up and why they have to ask for an increase&#x003F;</p>

No, I am very sorry. Under the circumstances, since we have the co-operation of the Opposition, I should have liked to accept this amendment, but for practical reasons&#x2014;that much the hon. members will concede to me&#x2014;I cannot do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister tried to do quite a bit of play-acting here. He was actually trying to be melodramatic in order to show that the person who sent ten oxen to market only paid 60c. However, the hon. gentleman must not speak of X who sent ten oxen. That hon. gentleman must take into consideration the whole amount that is paid in the case of 5 million or more sheep that are slaughtered at our controlled markets. He should also do so in the case of the one or two million head of large stock that are slaughtered, and then he would see that it is not a small amount which the Abattoir Commission collects in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister tells us, however, that no principle is at stake here. I want to ask him what has consequently happened to the principle adhered to by ex-Minister Uys in 1967 when he accepted in this House that a maximum should be fixed&#x003F; If no matter of principle was at stake then, what is at stake now&#x003F; Are we on this side of the House so unreasonable that when the commission comes to us with a case of its expenditure having been increased, we would not grant an increase in its revenue&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister asks us whether we would support an increase in the future if the committee were to approach us for an increase. Of course we would, if a case could be made out to justify why the commission should obtain increased revenue from the livestock producer. Today, by way of our amendment, we are giving the guarantee that we are prepared to do this. That is why we are prepared to raise the ceiling a little, because then the commission could have a little leeway. The hon. the Deputy Minister asks me whether we would like to see the commission landing in financial difficulties because its revenue is less than its expenditure. Of course we do not want to see this happen, and that is why we are prepared to help. We also know, however, that the South African farmer is increasingly, and to a much greater extent than in the <span class="col_3475-3476" refersTo="page_0291"/>past, being faced with increased production costs. What we are doing now is to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that we are not prepared to accept his amendment, because it would perhaps not mean, as far as the farmer is concerned, an increase of 6 to 12 cents in the levy that can be imposed by the commission, since the hon. the Deputy Minister can then fix any amount. Does he want to create the impression in the outside world that because the expenditure of the commission could increase to such an extent in the future, he needs unlimited power when it comes to the imposition of this levy&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman is creating the impression that we are fighting here over a trifling matter. It is not a trifling matter when it affects the entire slaughter-stock industry in South Africa. The hon. the Deputy Minister could have made out an even better case if he had had the slaughtering account of a person who sold one or two oxen.</p>

If that increase appears to be justified, we would consider it in the light of the circumstances prevailing then. We say that this is the maximum increase we are prepared to accept, and we are not going to leave it to the commission to levy any amount, because this could greatly increase the production costs of the farmer.

Since the hon. member now wants a fixed amount to be written into the legislation here, can he tell the hon.

The hon. member says this is a new principle, but it is not a new principle, because it is done in the case of all control boards. I cannot see what the argument of the hon. members is. One moment they have the utmost confidence in the fact that the Abattoir Commission can own land and can expropriate land, as long as it does not transfer the land to a private person, but now they do not even want to trust the commission with the imposition of a levy on slaughter-stock.

<p>Mr. Chairman, my hon. colleague, the hon. member for Newton Park, has made it quite clear that this is a matter of principle as far as we are concerned. It is interesting to read what this hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor had to say on this matter (Hansard of 1967, col. 7303)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am quite prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. It seems to me as though the hon. member is quite surprised! But I am quite prepared to do <span class="col_3477-3478" refersTo="page_0292"/>so. At the same time I do not bedrudge him the little propaganda he can make amongst the farmers &#x2026;</block>

<p>We have not made any propaganda amongst the farmers. We are debating this measure purely on its merits and on what we believe to be in the best interests of the farmers. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">However, I say that if it is justified to appoint a commission for the overall control and promotion of abattoirs, it ought also to be worthwhile for the people making use of abattoirs to pay for it &#x2026;</block>

<p>This brings me to another point, namely the people who are using the abattoirs and who will pay for them. Hon. members know that as the years go by the cost of providing clean, hygienic food to the public of South Africa is going up by leaps and bounds. One of the biggest factors for the escalating of the costs is the question of hygiene. This applies to all &#x201C;bederfbare Produkte&#x201D;, perishable products. This happens in the case of milk and all dairy products. It happens in the case of meat as well. Now it seems to me an extraordinary thing that while this is the case, the man who is footing the bill at the present stage is the farmer. He is called upon to foot the bill and it is because of the fact that this is happening that we on this side of the House are wary of giving the commission a free hand to charge what it will in these particular matters. We believe that the right place to exercise some control over everyone&#x2019;s interest as far as these matters are concerned, is this honourable House. That is why we are taking this stand; it is a matter of principle and not a case of making propaganda or playing politics. We believe we have a sensible case. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that when in future levies are imposed&#x2014;I believe he already has this in mind&#x2014;he should think of sharing the cost and the burden of providing hygienic food to the public of South Africa, so that the total cost is not borne by the farming community. I do not say this because I want to make propaganda amongst the farmers. I believe that since this is an economic necessity it should be attended to. We on this side of the House believe that is is absolutely essential that every possible measure should be taken to see that, bearing in mind the composition of the population in South Africa, cheap food should be made available wherever possible. We believe that no money should be wasted and that there should be no doubtful use of our resources. At the same time, we feel that the burden of providing that food cheaply and hygienically to the consumer should be borne by all sectors of the community.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member says they would like to see cheap food reaching the consumer. If that is the case, he ought to support the clause so that the private person could get hold of the land through the Abattoir Commission in a reasonable way and not in an unreasonable way. They were not in favour of that. The Minister is now meeting them half way, but is still going to do the same thing.</p>

<p>No, I know exactly what he did. The hon. member for Newton Park said that the Deputy Minister stood up anl did some play-acting. The data the Deputy Minister furnished are quite correct; if it applies to ten carcasses, it also applies to 100 carcasses and to a million carcasses; it applies to all the carcasses slaughtered in the country. But it was the hon. member for Newton Park who stood up here and tried to play-act like a clown.</p>

<p>It is the amount. 1,2 million head of cattle were slaughtered. Hon. members must work out for themselves what the value of those carcasses are at R80 per carcass. It is over R100 million. But then there are the costs the farmer has in having 1,2 million head of cattle slaughtered. The slaughtering fees and abattoir fees amount to a minimum of R2,5 million. The Meat Board&#x2019;s levy is an additional R1,5 million, which amounts to a total of R4 million. Hon. members are not worried about that.</p>

<p>Yes, hon. members say the farmer himself must negotiate about that. But an amount of R239 000 is involved here. Hon. members say there is going to be an increase in the funds needed to furnish a service not only to the farmer, but also to the consumer and everyone else in extending the abattoirs, co-ordinating them, streamlining them, modernizing them, etc. The hon. member for East London City went as far as to say they are going to take over a function of the Meat Board. In other words, the levy must be increased even more than that small amount of R239 000. We are now only comparing cattle&#x2014;I am not even speaking about sheep, goats, etc. The total cost is R4 million. Now the hon. member says that the Meat Board can increase its levy of R1,5 million on cattle only with the Minister&#x2019;s approval, while the House of Assembly must give approval for the small amount of R239 000. The large amount can be approved solely by the Minister, but the small amount must be approved by the House of Assembly. I now want to ask what their line of reasoning is. Then hon. members opposite still say that we do not try to do something for the farmers. I now want to tell that hon. member that he is insulting the farmer; that is why they will never obtain a farmer&#x2019;s vote. A person who comes to light with such reasoning, and then stands up like a hero and says: &#x201C;I am fighting for the farmers,&#x201D; is insulting any farmer. We cannot accept that amendment of the hon. member. The attitude of the hon. member and the other United Party members on that side of the House annoys our farmers, and we are not going to put up with that in the future.</p>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Newton Park is wide of the mark because if there has ever been a Minister and a Government that have been close to the farmers, it is this Minister and this Government. Some of our older members know of the benefits we reaped under the United Party Government of the time. The hon. member alleges that the Minister should not have the power to use his own discretion in the fixing and levying of abattoir fees. Suppose Parliament adjourns in June, but the Abattoir Commission&#x2019;s costs increase in the meantime because the number of sheep slaughtered per week, perhaps 20 000, decreases to 15 000 per week and those costs must be increased, but this can only be done when Parliament begins its session again in January. Seven months are lost before this Parliament can decide about what the hon. member wants. By the time Parliament again convenes in January or February, that Abattoir Commission can already have a deficit of R15 000 or R20 000. Who must then pay that deficit&#x003F; The farmers who market in the future&#x003F; Or must the payment be retrospective in nature in respect of persons who have already marketed&#x003F; The hon. member cannot do any good thinking about these things. He has never thought about these aspects, because he is not a practical farmer. He has only been farming for a short while and therefore does not yet have sufficient experience of this matter to express himself about the practical implementation of this measure. If I will not be ruled out of order, I want to tell the hon. member that it is now high time he represented a farming constituency so that he could get abreast of matters involving farming interests.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if one listens to the allegation of the hon. member for Prieska to the effect that the hon. member for Newton Park is not the son of a farmer one could almost say that farmers come only from Prieska. In addition the hon. member for Lichtenburg said that because it is a National Party Government <span class="col_3481-3482" refersTo="page_0294"/>the Minister is their Minister, as if to say he is not also the Minister of this side of the House and the country as a whole. I want to tell the hon. member for Lichtenburg that they do not know how to speak to the hon. the Minister. We know how to speak to him, and therefore we have his sympathy. The hon. member for Prieska asked how the Abattoir Commission must get its money if it has a deficit as a result of a decrease in the slaughtering. Does the hon. member not know&#x2014;or does he know so little about boards&#x2014;that each board builds up a reserve and that all boards have large reserves&#x003F; [Interjections.] It is no use the hon. member screaming now; I sat quite still when he spoke. If the board has build up a reserve, it can eliminate deficits from time to time. It is to the principle involved here that we object, to the principle of arbitrarily, in season and out of season, changing the board&#x2019;s levies. I have already said this previously and I am now saying it again for the hon. member&#x2019;s information. We are opposed to the principle of the matter. I have already said that I foresee that in future the Abattoir Commission will need a great deal more money than this insignificant small amount mentioned here. This amendment is only there because we want to throw light on the principle that this hon. House must be taken into consideration when changes in levies take place. I foresee that this will happen in future, and I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister also sees it in that light. We have all been working together for years on this body, and we have given it our approval. This commission must continue with its work. We say that there should be many abattoirs, and that the commission must carry out many extensions and furnish many services. It must also furnish hygienic products in this era of pollution; everyone is making a fuss about it at present. As a result of this the commission will in future need much greater levies than this insignificant little amount. By what means, then, does one do it other than by the means our amendment proposes, i.e. by prescribing a maximum levy&#x003F; When the maximum is exceeded, we come to the House and speak about that again. If the maximum is too low, we can triple it, or even increase it fivefold as the activities and functions of the Abattoir Commission extend themselves. Is there an hon. member on that side who thinks that the commission will continue with its functions on this small scale&#x003F; How, then, must it obtain its revenue&#x003F; Is the livestock suddenly going to increase to such an extent&#x003F; This will not be so rapid an increase. After all, there is only one way to ensure sufficient revenue, and that is eventually to increase those levies considerably. I am sure that in his heart of hearts the hon. the Deputy Minister is sympathetic to our standpoint that it is necessary to come to this House repeatedly to bring about an increase of the levy. We do not have any objection to the board building up a reserve fund either. No board can operate properly without a reserve fund. But then the methods must be discussed and approved in this House. That is all our standpoint entails. It is no use continuing to argue that the amount is so small in comparison with the slaughtering and administration costs of the whole industry. That argument does not hold good. It does not affect the principle of the matter.</p>

<heading>MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 3, of course, is the whole body of this particular measure and makes provision for a new agricultural reference board. Here for the first time we are making provision that an agricultural control board need not necessarily make a decision itself on an application for a licence; the control board can divest itself of the power which it has to grant a licence or a permit to do certain things with an agricultural product and pass on that power to the new Agricultural Reference Board. Sir, in the proposed new section 7C(2) we find that where members of a control board, because they have vested interests, have recused themselves from participation in the proceedings of the control board, particularly where they are trying to come to a decision on an application for a licence or a permit, and the remaining members are then too few in numbers to constitute a quorum for a meeting of the control board, in other words, that the control board is no longer properly constituted and therefore cannot take a decision, then&#x2014;and I now quote from the proposed new section&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The control board may and, if so directed by the Minister, shall refer the matter in question to the reference board for decision by it under subsection (1).</block>

<p>As I have said, it then divests itself of all its powers in regard to this matter and passes those powers over to the Agricultural Reference Board, which will then come to a decision on behalf of the board on this particular application. Sir, we believe that this is a tremendous step forward and that it is therefore something to be recommended and to be accepted by this House. But, Sir, we believe that once again the Minister has not really taken his courage in both hands. He has not really gone as far as he should perhaps have gone in this particular respect. As I pointed out yesterday, we are not always satisfied that the members of a control board who have a vested interest always recuse themselves. I believe this is something which should have been taken care of in this legislation as well, but unfortunately that is something we cannot discuss now. I believe also that the hon. the Minister should have gone further and in some way or other should have indicated that the board must come to a decision within a specified time. That we will be able to discuss a little later when we come to another provision in the Bill. But the provision we are dealing with right now, and where I have an argument with the hon. the Minister, is because I believe that he did not go far enough in that he has retained these words, that the control board may refer the matter in question to the Reference Board. I believe that this should be mandatory for the board, that if it is unable for some reason to come to a decision, it should be compelled within a specified period to refer this matter to the Agricultural Reference Board which is now being created. We asked the question during the Second Reading debate what was meant or envisaged by the Minister by the inclusion of the words &#x201C;if so directed by the <span class="col_3485-3486" refersTo="page_0296"/>Minister&#x201D;, but unfortunately we did not get a reply. We do not really know what he is after. I believe that those words are completely unnecessary or would be completely unnecessary if we were to make this measure mandatory and make it imperative for the control board to refer this matter to the Agricultural Reference Board when it is unable to raise a quorum. For that reason I now move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 21 and 22, page 6, to omit &#x201C;may, and if so directed by the Minister,&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The clause will then read to the effect that the control board shall refer the matter in question to the Reference Board for a decision by it. I believe that this can only be in the best interest not only of the agricultural sector but also of the consumers in this country. In fact, I believe it can only be in the best interest of all persons because we have had too many hold-ups at certain levels. There have been bottlenecks, and this is one of the bottlenecks there have been where, as I tried to point out yesterday, we even had monopolistic tendencies developing because of the bottleneck at this particular point, where either a board will not make a decision or cannot make a decision. I believe that if we were to accept the provisions of this Bill today, the establishment of the Agricultural Reference Board&#x2014;which we accept and welcome as a very good idea on the part of the Minister and of the department&#x2014;and if we would only accept this amendment now to make it mandatory on the board that it shall refer the matter to the Reference Board, so that it will not be able to sit on the applications and hold-up a decision, I believe that we will be going a step further which will be in the interest both of the producers as well as the consumers.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I do not think this amendment moved by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is acceptable to us. We are very proud and very jealous of the autonomy of our control boards and we do not want to tamper with it unnecessarily. The Minister has the last say in anything the control boards do. But where it concerns the registration and appointment of agents, and so forth, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District was guilty of gross exaggeration. He said, &#x201C;the board divests itself of all its powers&#x201D;. Sir, that is not so. It is only with regard, to specific matters that he passes these powers on to the Reference Board. Then the hon. member says he cannot understand the meaning of the words &#x201C;if so directed by the Minister&#x201D;. These words only refer to these specific powers and it remains at the discretion of the Minister whether he wants to pass on those powers to the board, and he may say, &#x201C;No, go ahead and appoint these people even though you do not have a quorum; you are still qualified to do this work&#x201D;, or he may say the matter has to be referred to the Reference Board. I think the legislation is quite clear. I do not think there is any doubt that we must trust the control boards to handle this matter correctly where they, after all, know what the position is. They know when they do not have a quorum and nobody else knows what happens in the inner sanctums of the control boards. They may be relied upon to take these steps when they find they do not have a quorum.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down has, in his remark that nobody knows what goes on in the inner chambers of the board, completely borne out the argument which I raised yesterday. This is the whole crux of the matter that nobody knows what goes on.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite right. That is exactly what I said. Nobody will know in the future, because I believe that this legislation does not go far enough. Unfortunately I cannot discuss that particular point now; it is beyond the scope of this clause. I accept that and therefore I cannot take it any further.</p>

<p>However, I believe there is one way in which the hon. the Deputy Minister can help aggrieved parties, parties who are interested in the distribution or the processing of agricultural products, who are tied to these control boards and who have to apply to them for permits. The one way in which the hon. the Deputy Minister can help these parties is by accepting this amendment which we have moved. I believe that this will ease the situation, that it will make it a lot easier for the public to get answers from the boards. I believe that that hon. member on the other side is right. I agree with him that we are proud of the work which is done by these control boards. I believe that the control boards do an excellent job of work to a <span class="col_3487-3488" refersTo="page_0297"/>point. I believe that the powers and the functions of the control boards have been extended beyond the powers and functions which were originally designed for them and that they are today controlling the processing, the manufacture and the distribution of their particular products. They are now infringing into the commercial sphere where, because of their control and because of the manner in which it is carried out, we are developing monopolistic conditions.</p>

<p>Nobody today can have a baker&#x2019;s licence without a certificate from the Wheat Industry Control Board. Why is there this monopoly in that particular sphere&#x003F; Similarly, as far as the meat industry is concerned, nobody can have a butcher&#x2019;s licence, whether it is in the public interest or not, whether there is one butchery or ten butcheries in a small town, unless the Livestock and Meat Industry Control Board decides that he ought to have such a licence. Nobody else can decide on such issue.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am ranging a bit wide, but I am trying to build a case why I believe that we have to compel these boards to make a decision and we have to compel them, if they are unable to make a decision, to pass it on to this new board which we are creating. This new board has to function and I believe it is in the interest of this new board, which I believe will serve a wonderful purpose, that the boards should be compelled to refer these matters to the new board, the Agricultural Reference Board. As this is written at the moment you can have the situation where nothing will be referred to the Agricultural Reference Board. It will never get off the ground, because it will never have any work to do since each of the control boards will sit jealously guarding its own rights and it will say that the Act does not say that it has to refer the matter to the reference board and therefore it will not. If the onus is left on the board, the board alone will decide whether it shall refer the matter or not. I believe that this is wrong. I believe that we should take that onus away from the boards and that the onus should be on the Minister to amend this legislation so that the boards shall refer such matters to the Agricultural Reference Board if they cannot make a decision themselves.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I feel the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is correct when he says that not all that many matters will be referred to the Reference Board. That is exactly what we do not want to happen, and I cannot see why he wants something else. It sometimes happens with a board that the members of such board have something to do with the matter under discussion. They then have to recuse themselves and the board is then left without a quorum. I cannot see why the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District should have the idea that the Reference Board should take over the work of the boards. I simply cannot believe that that is the intention of the board. For that reason I think that the hon. member for Humansdorp is quite correct. It is only when stagnation takes place, when the board&#x2014;for a specific reason&#x2014;simply cannot continue, that something like this may happen. We are now establishing the Reference Board to solve problems of this nature. In short, the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment amounts to the substitution for &#x201C;may&#x201D; of &#x201C;shall&#x201D; &#x2026; &#x201C;kan&#x201D; and &#x201C;moet&#x201D; in the Afrikaans version. I want to put only one question to the hon. member. If a board meets, let us assume it meets to consider some application or other, and it is short of a quorum because the members who are involved in the matter under discussion have recused themselves and the amendment moved by the hon. member is accepted, this matter has to be referred to the Reference Board. If all the members are present, they will, in fact, have a quorum to be able to decide. Why does he now expect us to write into the legislation a measure to compel the boards, also under those circumstances, to refer the matter to the Reference Board&#x003F; I think that is where the minor misunderstanding arises. Our intention is not to have the work of the board taken over by the Reference Board, and for that reason I feel that the law advisers have quite rightly used those specific words.</p>

<p>No, on any account. I do not know on what account, and this is the whole point. Nobody knows on what account and why, but the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. the Minister knows. The hon. member for Wynberg referred a case to the hon. the Minister a little while ago, the case of the Dairy Board, which for three years had messed around and had not given a decision on an application. I have the papers, or rather an application form, for a wholesale dairy product distribution licence on my desk right now. For three years this dairy board has sat there without making a decision for some or other reason. The reason might be the reason advanced by the hon. the Deputy Minister, namely that when the board came to sit, certain members recused themselves and then the board could not sit without a quorum. I do not know, because I do not know what happens at these board meetings. The whole point is if this goes on and on there is no justice done to the applicant and no justice done to the public who is waiting for another distributor. Then there is no justice to the producer who is looking for another outlet for his products.</p>

<p>There is no competition for those who have the permits at the time, and this is where monopolistic conditions come in. I believe it is in the best interest of all parties that this should be done; I believe that it is in the interest of justice that this should be done. If the board cannot come to a decision, even if the reason why it cannot come to a decision is because it has not a quorum, it should be referred to the Agricultural Reference Board. This is the referee, the board which is going to decide on this matter. Where a board is sitting and for some reason or another it cannot make a decision, it should be sent down to the referee, to the Agricultural Reference Board and let them take action. I really cannot understand what objection the Government has to accepting this amendment. It is taking away from the hon. the Minister the power to direct a board to refer a particular case, but what it is giving the Minister is the power to say to all the boards in all cases that, if they do not come to a decision, they must refer that case to the Reference Board. I cannot see the difference. What it is doing, is that it is tying every one of these control boards to making a decision or passing the matter on and letting someone else make the decision on their behalf. The hon. member for Humansdorp referred to the fact that I had said that a board would divest itself of all its powers. When he quoted me he only went halfway because I said it would divest itself of its powers in respect of a particular application. That is in effect what it does; it hands over to the Reference Board&#x2014;the hon. the Deputy Minister is nodding his head to indicate that he agrees with me&#x2014;its powers to deal with that particular matter. The Reference Board as such has no powers except those passed over to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is conjuring up spectres. He insinuates that we cannot always trust the control boards with regard to the things that happen in their offices. He also insinuates that &#x201C;there is no justice to the public or the producer&#x201D;. To my mind he is sowing the seeds of suspicion here. These control boards have been doing good work through all these years. I think that our control boards have a good record. I think the Minister has sufficient confidence in the control boards to leave this matter to the control boards themselves and their members to decide whether to pass on a matter or refer it to the Agricultural Reference Board. These control boards consist of people who have honest intentions with the industry they are serving on those boards. There are also producers on those control boards. They will not allow their industry to be prejudiced by unnecessary delays. Neither do I think that we, with our democratic system in this country, will allow the Minister to act in an autocratic way, and always say: &#x201C;You have to!&#x201D; We are not dealing with children here; we have adults serving on these control boards, experienced people, businessmen and men who know the industry. To my mind the hon. member is merely conjuring up a whole lot of spectres. He looks very innocent, but he is sowing the seeds of suspicion here when he tells us that he has a suspicion that justice does not always prevail in the dark rooms of the control boards. I feel very strongly that we have a good case here, and that we should retain it as it is laid down in the Bill.</p>

<heading>SOCIAL PENSIONS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as we have already said, this legislation deals with social pensions and for the most part it is a consolidation measure comprising a part of the Aged Persons Act of 1967 with regard to pensions, the War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act of 1968, the Blind Persons Act, the Disability Grants Act, and of course a number of amendments with regard to these measures. We have already said that we on this side of the House welcome this measure. It facilitates and, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, it simplifies the administration of these measures by the department as well as any future amendments which may possibly have to be made with regard to this measure in the future. In future the Minister and his department will therefore deal with the administration of all social pensions under this legislation. Since it is not only a consolidation measure, it also gives us on this side of the House the opportunity of raising a few matters with the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>When the debate was adjourned yesterday, I was raising two matters with the hon. the Deputy Minister. The first was that the hon. the Deputy Minister should, in terms of this legislation and in consultation with the hon. the Minister of Finance, consider the possibility of exempting war veterans who served in the Zulu Uprising in 1906, in the 1914-&#x2019;20 First World War, and who in 1914-'15 were protesting citizens, in exactly the same way as the people who served in the Anglo-Boer War, from the means test. These people are nearing the end of their lifespan, and very few of them will reach the 100 years&#x2019; mark which the hon. member for Germiston mentioned. This may be an opportunity for the Government now to make a special concession in this case with regard to these war veterans. In the second place, I recommended, and it was merely a thought, that the hon. the Deputy Minister should consider appointing postmasters as assistant district pension officials, in consultation of course with his colleague the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. In addition he should also consider whether the Post Office, especially in the urban areas in South Africa, cannot serve as an information bureau for pensioners. The Post Office is surely one of those places which is regularly visited by elderly people. They will then be able to obtain information there in regard to concessions and amendments which are made from time to time. I believe that notices can be put up in post offices. When elderly people go to collect their pensions at post offices, pamphlets could <span class="col_3493-3494" refersTo="page_0300"/>possibly be given to them together with their pensions if certain amendments are made with regard to this legislation. I believe that there are thousands of pensioners today who either did not previously qualify and who do qualify now as a result of concessions, or pensioners who are receiving pensions but who are, as a result of concessions entitled to more money but are in many cases unaware of the fact. We all know that when the basic pension of elderly people is increased, it is automatically paid out to them, but with regard to concessions to pensioners, especially with regard to the means test, they have to make application. We know that the press and the radio does much in this regard to convey information to elderly people, but in many cases they have to rely on someone telling them about it by chance. To me it seems an inadequate arrangement and I believe that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can do a great deal to help the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard. Many elderly people hear only by chance about concessions which are made from time to time. If they do not hear about it, they have to do without the extra money which they could have received. Except for the Post Office, the hon. the Minister could possibly also consider police stations as possible information centres for elderly people. Yesterday I said that if elderly people living in the vicinity of Johannesburg wanted to make application or obtain information with regard to various concessions which are made from time to time, they have to travel from the suburban areas to the centre of Johannesburg to get to the office of this department. We know that it is very difficult for old people to get about. Sometimes they have to travel by bus and have to walk for blocks to reach the office. But they go to the Post Office regularly, for it is situated in their immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Clause 4 of this amendment Bill provides that application must be made to a district pension officer. As I have already said, he is&#x2014;especially in urban areas&#x2014;not easily accessible to elderly people. In this regard the Post Office could solve this problem for us. Clause 12 provides that the hon. the Minister may appoint district pension officers. In this regard I want to say that a postmaster may also be able to solve many problems for us if we could appoint him as assistant district pension officer.</p>

<p>Clause 17(1) deals with regulations. Here there are only three minor matters which I would like to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister. In the first place, under paragraph (b), the maximum amount payable to old-age pensioners, or social pensioners as they will now be called, is deter-minded by the Minister. Perhaps this is the opportunity this afternoon, in the discussion of this Bill, to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to use his influence with the Minister of Finance. I know there is very little time left before tomorrow, but the hon. the Deputy Minister could perhaps, under the powers granted to him by this legislation, discuss the possibility of an increase with the Minister of Finance. Last week we heard that the Post Office had increased the telephone rental by 50%. Perhaps it is not asking too much that the Deputy Minister talk to the Minister of Finance about a possible 50% increase to pensioners. It is not much, Sir. It will only bring about an increase from R41 to R62 per month.</p>

<p>In the second place, provision is made in paragraph (f) for regulations to be made in respect of the means test. In this regard I want to tell the Deputy Minister that I know it is very difficult for him, in terms of Government policy and the present legislation, to abolish the means test completely. We know he cannot do it, for the system does not allow it. I only want to tell him that he must give further thought to the possibility of considering the approach of this side of the House, namely that we introduce a contributory pension scheme in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the third place I want to plead with the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider extra concessions with regard to the maximum pension payable to that group of pensioners who have no other assets of income than the basic pension which is paid to them. They are solely dependent on the maximum pension with regard to an income.</p>

<p><span class="col_3495-3496" refersTo="page_0301"/>Then I want to conclude by saying that we are with this legislation repealing the War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act of 1968 today. The hon. member for Umbilo has already referred to it. You know, Sir, the war veterans in South Africa do not like to be referred to as social pensioners. The old people who served, whether in the Anglo-Boer War, the Zulu Uprising of 1906, the Rebellion, the First World War or the Second World War, feel that, to a certain degree they are entitled to a pension. After all, special reference is made to them in the Act, and the definition of veterans pensions is still included in this legislation. As it is in the main only a consolidating measure, we on this side of the House have no objection to it, and we will support the legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Turffontein who has just resumed his seat, tried yesterday and again a moment ago to make a good deal of political capital out of the position of our elderly people. We are of course accustomed to that. He mentioned two matters which move me to say this. The one matter, which he has just repeated, concerned the means test which has to be abolished. He also expressed his amazement last night when the hon. member for Germiston told how the elderly people in his constituency had already been educated and conditioned in this connection, how they had already obtained information so that they knew exactly where they had to go, armed with all the documentation which they may require, and that they were being assisted in a very pleasant manner by a friendly department. The hon. member expressed his amazement that that could be so. He felt that that was probably not possible; possibly there were no such people in the constituency of the hon. member for Germiston, or perhaps they were unaware of the provision which is being made for our elderly people, for he, the hon. member for Turffontein, and his colleague, the hon. member for Umbilo, were, as it were, being inundated with letters, etc., in which these people pleaded for assistance, and possibly for enlightenment and guidance.</p>

<speech by="#prinsloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. P. PRINSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I can only say to the hon. member that as far as my constituency is concerned&#x2014;and if he likes he can accuse me of making a little political capital of this&#x2014;my voters are also being given proper information. They are told exactly what documentation they require, whether for a war veterans&#x2019; pension, a disability allowance, an old-age pension, or a blind persons&#x2019; pension. They are told what they will require when they go to the district pension officer, and if they are unable to go to the pension officer, they can come to me and I shall help them, just as a friendly clerk of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions would help them if they were to go to him. This would then have the same value when they arrived at that office with their applicants. I can also tell him that an application for a pension, of whatever nature, is never finally rejected. The pensioner may perhaps miss out at the first attempt, but he can ask repeatedly for his pension to be reconsidered. If a person is dissatisfied with his pension or at the fact that he does not receive a pension, he is even free to appeal to the Minister. Actually, the application for a pension is, in the general sense of the word, not merely a privilege which our elderly people, our sick people and others have; it has become an absolute right, and from time to time they can go further with it. Their attempts will never be frastrated.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with a consolidation of four Acts, and it is really unnecessary to say this, but we support it even more whole heartedly than hon. members opposite who have already spoken, because, in the words of the hon. the Deputy Minister, it makes matters so much more convenient. In regard to this subject I just want to refer to one <i>Government Gazette</i> which was recently issued, namely <i>Government Gazette</i> No. 3797 of 9th March of this year. If we turn to page 3, we find that virtually two pages are devoted to one and the same purpose. The regulations which are amended and which appear here, are all quite identical, but now they have to be published in four different <i>Government Notices</i> because they fall under four different Acts. So we find that <i>Government Notices</i> 326, 327, 328 and 329 take up so much unnecessary space and paper. It is unnecessary to stress this further, but if hon. members would only refer to this <i>Government Gazette,</i> they would realize that by means of this consolidating legislation, time, money and, <i>inter alia,</i> also printing costs, are being saved. Possibly this money could, at a later stage, be <span class="col_3497-3498" refersTo="page_0302"/>utilized for some other purpose. I want to say that this House could also continue to set the standard for more streamlined departments. Since the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions has adopted such a commendable course, I think it would be appropriate if there could also be a constant check on the operation of other Government departments in order to ascertain to what extent they could be made more streamlined.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, so much has been said and there has been so much repetition already, but there is just one minor matter which I should like to stress here and in respect of which the department may possibly be of assistance. I refer to the protection which these pensioners are being afforded. In terms of subsections (2) and (3) of clause 9, protection is being granted in respect of the monies which a pensioner receives if there should perhaps be proceedings for civil imprisonment against that pensioner, or if the estate of that pensioner is being sequestrated. There are many pensioners who do not realize this and who perhaps pay out of the goodness of their hearts instead of protecting themselves, and one would like to see this provision brought to their attention.</p>

<p>There is another minor matter which I want to raise. It is not actually stated in this Bill, but a number of pensioners have already been discussing it. Hostile people, or people who perhaps do not know any better or perhaps do not want to know any better, are sometimes inclined to throw a bit of a scare into our pensioners by telling them that if they save some of their money, the department will arrive at the conclusion that they do not need the pension, and will cancel their pension. I have had occasion to put out a number of such little fires. I believe that the same thing has also happened to other hon. members. How those pensioners manage to save, I do not always understand, but if they do in fact succeed in doing so, it is an indication that we have thrifty people. We must appreciate those thrifty people, and if they want to save, the correct information must be brought to their attention so that they can save as much as possible of their pensions for the day when they may perhaps need it rather badly, for example for a short holiday.</p>

<p>Sir, our elderly people are very sensitive and one must deal with them very carefully. In this respect I agree that a man who was a war veteran, does not want to drop that designation, but he need not do so. In fact, the Bill has been drafted in such a way that provision is made for veterans&#x2019; pensions, old-age pensions and so on and the war veteran is still able to carry that fine label round his neck, even though the consolidated designation is now going to be &#x201C;social pension&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to associate myself with what the hon. member for Turffontein said here in connection with the war veterans. Sir, this is a consolidation measure, and certain improvements are also being effected to the Pensions Act, but we are very disappointed that the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; remains exactly the same as in the old Act. This means that our Bantu who fought for South Africa in wars in the past, are not regarded as war veterans. Sir, that is really a great injustice, because these are people who served South Africa well. Many of these people are old and sickly today, and are in rather a bad way. I think it is the duty of the State to look after those people. We cannot insist strongly enough in this House that the Government should display gratitude towards those people.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another point which is important in this connection, and that is that our method of warfare has changed completely. Today we have to deal with a kind of warfare which we were previously unacquainted with, namely terrorist activities. People fighting these terrorists elsewhere and who are experts in this field, tell us that in order to fight terrorists, one must in the first place have the goodwill and co-operation of the local people on one&#x2019;s borders, and in our case the people living in those areas are all Bantu. In the second place, Sir, I do not think that we can do better than to train these Bantu to oppose terrorism on our borders. They are extremely suited to this kind of work, because they can pursue the terrorists.</p>

<p>I want to say to the Government that we should encourage these people to help us in our fight against the terrorists, and in that case we should not discriminate against them. [Interjection.] Sir, it seems to me that I am not very popular with the Deputy Minister in making a suggestion of this kind, but I leave the matter at that. We have often discussed this matter before, and I am convinced that we shall eventually convince the Government.</p>

<p>Another matter concerning which I want to heartily support previous speakers, is the question of the means test as applied to the war veterans of the Zulu Rebellion in 1906 and the war veterans of the First World War. I think that the time has arrived for us to look after these people. Their numbers are decreasing year after year; they are getting old; they are needy; many of them are ill and they need help. I think the time has arrived for us to do away with the means test in the case of these people, just as in the case of the war veterans of the Boer War.</p>

<p>Then there is just one other thing. Yesterday mention was made in this House of the sympathetic attitude of the department and I would be guilty of dereliction of duty if I did not add my small contribution. In the smaller centres in our country in particular, where there are officials of the department to whom people must go for help and to obtain information, one always finds the most deeply sympathetic treatment on the part of the officials. I think that we must stress in this House that we express our appreciation for this towards the department and also towards the officials whose doors are always open to us. We always get sympathetic treatment from them and we appreciate this very much. Now, as I have already said, this is a consolidating Bill. It is just a pity that these few matters which could have been corrected have not been corrected now, but, as I have already said, we shall persist in this until it has been rectified.</p>

<p>Previous speakers have emphasized the need for further information to be passed on to people who may qualify for certain benefits under this Bill, but I want to deal with an aspect which has not yet been mentioned and which deals with all races. I am aware of the provisions of clause 19 which excludes Coloureds, but I assume that this is an umbrella Bill which gives the Minister power to delegate to other Ministers, and I raise this matter because it is a question common to Whites, Bantu and Indians.</p>

<p>If one studies the Bill one finds in clause 1, the definition clause, that a blind person is defined as anyone over the age of 19 year who has been registed as a blind person under any law. Then we have the disabled person being defined as any person who has attained the age of 16 years and is, owing to physical or mental disability, unfit to obtain from any service, employment or profession the means needed to enable him to provide adequately for his maintenance. Sir, I was struck most forcibly recently by an article which appeared in one <span class="col_3501-3502" refersTo="page_0304"/>of the daily newspapers in Durban. It was from a correspondent and the letter was addressed to the editor. It was headed &#x201C;Sickening sights in Durban streets&#x201D; and it said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the corner of Warwick Avenue and Alice Street an African stumbled into the pavement kerbing and fell apread-eagled on the payement. He struggled to get up, stumbled on, bumping everyone in his way. He walked straight into a fence, veered to the right and crashed into a barrier on the edge of the pavement, which saved him from certain death under the wheels of a bus. At first I thought he was drunk but then the horrible truth dawned on me, that this man was blind.</block>

<p>Then there is another case which this correspondent witnessed shortly afterwards concerning another disabled person. He went on to say in his letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Had these people been animals the SPCA would have been called in a short time to assist them.</block>

<p>Sir, I suggest that it is incidents such as these which could blur the image of our social welfare services in South Africa, I think undeservedly, but the fact remains that they could very well create the wrong impression. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he gives this mater his serious consideration. I would like him to give me the assurance that he will take every step possible to see that those who are maimed, crippled or blind and who are unable to support themselves are at least given the opportunity to know that in fact there are means by which they can be assisted in terms of this particular Bill. Many of them, I am sure, if they were to know it, would be able to qualify for a blind person&#x2019;s pension and many others who suffer from serious disabilities would qualify in some way for a disability pension. I think one can safely say that people of all races are found in the streets of our cities and towns every day and every night of the year and many of them appear to be dependent on the compassion of passers-by. I believe that no one would like to be in the position to capitalize on infirmity in order to exist. I want to plead with the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;I believe that he has the power in terms of this Bill to delegate certain powers to other Ministers&#x2014; to use every effort to try to get the fact across that assistance is available. I want to ask him too that he will satisfy himself that it is adequate assistance, because I believe that anybody who is enjoying this assistance should not be allowed to beg. I am not suggesting that there should be intensified police action or that these cases should be swept under the mat to get them out of sight; I am suggesting that we should use every means at our disposal to try to assist them and to see that they are given some help and, if possible, that they are placed in institutions where they can be cared for and not left to roam the streets of our cities. I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he is able to give some assurance that he will look into these matters because I believe them to be a source of concern to the citizens of South Africa and one which creates a wrong impression in the minds of many of our visitors to South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first pace I am rising to express my great appreciation of the fact that the Opposition support this Bill and in the second place to convey my thanks too for all the speakers who participated in this debate for the very positive and constructive manner in which this debate has been conducted. Quite a number of practical suggestions were made, to which consideration will be given. I shall try to reply, to their satisfaction, to everything hon. members have asked me.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo referred to the proviso in the definition of war veteran in clause 1 of the Bill. You, Mr. Speaker, ruled that the hon. member could not discuss that matter, and I do not know whether you are going to do the same to me, but by your leave I should like to furnish the hon. member with a brief explanation, since I know what the hon. member actually intended saying. The hon. member for North Rand finally succeeded in saying it this afternoon. It concerns the position of Bantu war veterans. As the hon. member for North Rand correctly stated, this Bill was taken over precisely from the principal Act of 1968, and it does in fact exclude Bantu war veterans. The position is that provisions in our law affecting the Bantu war veteran have been transferred in their entirety to homeland legislation. Pensions are one of the matters transferred to the respective homelands in terms of the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act, 1971. <span class="col_3503-3504" refersTo="page_0305"/>Our estimate is that approximately 92% of the possible Bantu war veterans are already in the homelands, and that the rest are citizens of some homeland or other. As hon. members will know, this Bill which is now before the House cannot apply in the homelands because they have the power to pass legislation on pensions. Nothing which we pilot through here may be applicable to homelands.</p>

<p>As a result of this situation we will not interfere with something which has been transferred to the legislative assemblies of the homelands. If they want to introduce pensions, they can do so. If we were to try to introduce pensions for even a limited number of war veterans, it is very possible that we would in this way be placing a subsequent financial burden on the homelands. They will have to pay out that money. The position is that we can do nothing about the position of Bantu war veterans. They were not given pensions in the past either. In future this matter will be vested completely and exclusively in possible legislation which the homelands are able to pass themselves.</p>

<p>The other point to which the hon. member for Umbilo referred, is that certain benefits are no longer applicable in terms of the provisions of clause 3. I cannot see how any of the benefits could have been removed. Earlier, not under this Bill therefore, the residence qualifications were 15 out of the 20 years preceding the application for the pension. For war veterans it was five out of the 10 years preceding such application. Now the figure throughout has been made five years preceding the application, and an additional concession has been made in as much that a person who has permanent residence in South Africa also qualifies. For that reason I cannot see how the hon. member could have been correct when he said that we had removed certain benefits.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I only referred to it because you put the war veteran&#x2019;s pension on the same basis as the others. The war veteran pensioner has no longer an advantage, whereas he had it previously.</p>

<p>I cannot see how the hon. member can say that there was a special advantage. What is the difference between the provision of five years which we now have, and the provision of five years out of ten, as it was previously.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Previously the old-age pensioner and the other social pensioner had to wait longer. Now it is the same.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite correct that the war veteran pensioner had a shorter period than the ordinary old-age pensioner, but we have now placed it on the same basis. We have, in other words, given the old-age pensioner an advantage which he did not previously have, but we have not deprived the war veteran pensioner of anything. The period is still five years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I merely indicated that there were no longer such advantages in being a war veteran pensioner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite correct, and I concede to the hon. member that the advantage which a war veteran had over an ordinary old-age pensioner no longer exists, for we have now evened out the advantage. Nevertheless we have removed nothing from the position <span class="col_3505-3506" refersTo="page_0306"/>of the war veteran. In other words, we have given the old-age pensioner something, and taken nothing away from the others.</p>

<p>Both the hon. member for Umbilo as well as the hon. member for Turffontein referred to a notification to the public of the various advantages which a person may obtain on application. In the past we made pamphlets available, but we found that before all the pamphlets were distributed further changes had been made to the pension scheme. It was quite an impossible task to distribute pamphlets furnishing certain figures because they became obsolete so quickly. I am in full agreement with one of the suggestions made here, namely that notices could be put up on the walls of post offices in which brief particulars were furnished of what the advantages were to which each person was entitled. We shall give that matter our attention.</p>

<p>Then I want to express my thanks to the hon. member for Germiston in particular. In the first place I want to say thank you very much for a very well deserved compliment which he paid the officials of this department. It is truly one of the departments in which our relations with our elderly people via the official have to be sound. I say with great pride and humility, for it is not I who am responsible for this but those officials themselves, that they are filled with edealism for this task and that this department is doing tremendously good work, and work which requires tremendous self-sacrifice, with enormous patience. I am very grateful that the hon. member for Germiston took the trouble to bring that aspect of the department&#x2019;s work to the attention of the House.</p>

<p>He also asked us to treat the centenarians in some special way. I am in full agreement with him, and we shall go into the question of what we can do to benefit them a little. Quite probably we will abolish the means test in their case. That point will still be looked into, and we will see whether there is anything we can give those people. He also asked us to request the post office to make their best people available when payments are made to our &#x201C;senior citizens&#x201D;, as the Americans call them&#x2014;I find that a very fine concept. I shall definitely take that suggestion further. We shall inform the various post offices that it is actually a great honour for us to be able to make a payment to our senior citizens, and that we should like the officers who are appointed for that purpose to render service of the same standard as that rendered by the officials of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions itself.</p>

<p>Then, the hon. member for Turffontein as well as the hon. member for North Rand requested that certain of the war veterans be exempted from the means test. I just want to say that, as far as the Anglo-Boer war is concerned&#x2014;the hon. member referred to people who were citizens during the Anglo-Boer war&#x2014;there are of course very few veterans of that war left. One should not forget that the reason why there is no means test for them, as far as I could ascertain, is that those citizens fought for three years without any compensation. In regard to all the other wars we find that the soldiers received a measure of compensation. They did receive something, certain benefits when they returned from the war. But the men who were in the field for us for three years, sacrificed all they had. For that reason we abolished the means test as far as they are concerned. I do not know what the position is in respect of the Zulu Rebellion. I have an idea that those people are also being compensated, but I shall go into the question of the position in their case. If they are not receiving compensation, we shall consider abolishing the means test as far as they are concerned. We know that the men who fought in the First World War have been compensated, and enjoyed certain advantages when they returned. I shall also go into the position of the citizens of the 1914 uprising. We shall review the entire matter in the light of these proposals and suggestions which were made, and we shall quite probably effect a measure of relief.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein also requested that postmasters be appointed as district officers. Unfortunately, I am afraid that this is not very practical. One must have control over one&#x2019;s own officials; one must have control over him as person, and also over his position. If we were to appoint a postmaster as one of our officers, it would mean that there would be dual control, which in practice would be completely unpractical. I concede to the hon. member for Turffontein that in a big city like Johannesburg one should like to appoint more district pension officers, and we shall give this matter our attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein also put the usual type of questions to us. He asked for more pensions; very well, tomorrow is Budget day. Someone told him <span class="col_3507-3508" refersTo="page_0307"/>to make a political issue of this to a certain extent, and I do not take it amiss of him for doing so. Apart from that he made quite a good and positive contribution. I therefore do not blame him for asking for more money for the pensioners at the very last moment before the Budget Debate. I cannot tell him whether they are going to receive anything, for unfortunately I cannot foresee what will happen tomorrow. The hon. member also asked for an amendment of the means test, and said that he wanted a contributory pension scheme. This is a matter which we debated in the House two or three weeks ago, and he knows very well what our standpoint in that regard is. He asked for additional concessions to people who have no additional income. As far as this matter is concerned, I want to admit quite candidly to the hon. member that this is something which I am also concerned about. The department will go into this matter very thoroughly. The whole idea of an old-age pension is that it should be a supplementary amount. One will probably have to review the entire matter in respect of people who have absolutely no income at all. Whether we shall succeed in this matter, is not for me to say, but the sympathetic attitude and the goodwill is there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal mentioned the fact that we should make more knowledge and information available to our people so that there will be protection against civil proceedings and insolvencies. This is another good suggestion and it would be a good thing if one could consolidate all these particulars and display them on a poster which could be put up in a post office or a similar place. We shall consider this suggestion. I am sorry to have to tell the hon. member for North Rand that his contribution was the least positive of all. He began politicking, while all the other hon. members made positive suggestions in regard to what we should do. I made notes of what he said, and apart from the fact that he mentioned the Bantu war veterans &#x2014;a question which I have already replied to&#x2014;the hon. member said virtually nothing further. He simply referred to and affirmed what previous speakers had said. I think he was simply trying to while away the time, and I therefore do not blame him for that. With this, I think, I have replied to all the questions.</p>

<heading>ALIENS CONTROL BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill with which I shall deal here this afternoon, concerns the control of aliens in South Africa. In the main the object of this Bill is to strengthen and render more effective the existing measures by which the residence of aliens in the Republic is regulated and controlled. The first Act which is to be amended by this Bill is the Aliens Act, 1937, which regulates the temporary and permanent residence of aliens in South Africa.</p>

<p>I shall start by dealing with clause 1 of the Bill, the tenor of which is that no person shall employ any alien or conduct any business with him or harbour him if he is not in possession of a valid permit allowing him to be in the Republic, to accept employment here or to conduct business here. The permit which an alien must have in order that his presence in the Republic may be lawful, is either a permanent residence permit, commonly known as an immigration permit which is issued to aliens whose applications for permanent residence in the Republic have been approved by the Immigrants Selection Board, or a temporary residence permit, known as a temporary permit for aliens which is issued to aliens who are only paying a temporary visit to the Republic.</p>

<p>It must be added that distinguished visitors, such as diplomatic staff and their families, and certain citizens of certain countries, such as the United Kingdom, are exempt or may be exempted from the provisions of the Aliens Act.</p>

<p>It happens virtually every day, notwithstanding strict measures of control, that aliens enter the Republic unlawfully at unguarded places along the border and then live here with their relatives and friends and are even concealed by them, enter into their employment, or are taken up by them in their businesses. It is difficult to trace these persons, and if they are in fact traced and called upon to leave the country or if they are removed, one finds that in some cases they return to the Republic in the same unlawful manner. What is more, sentences of imprisonment do not have any <span class="col_3509-3510" refersTo="page_0308"/>beneficial effect on these persons, for having served their terms of imprisonment and having been removed from the country, they simply return to the Republic at a later stage. It also happens that many persons who come to the Republic for a holiday visit, for instance, start working here without having obtained the necessary prior approval for changing the purpose of their visit. It often happens that persons who do not have the slightest hope of ever having their applications for permanent residence in the Republic approved by the Immigrants Selection Board, because of their deficient education for example, or whose applications for permanent residence in the Republic were rejected, sometimes repeatedly, by the said board, enter the Republic temporarily on the pretext of paying a visit to their relatives in the Republic whilst their real reason is to live permanently with the said relatives and to work for them here. In such cases it is sometimes only with a great deal of trouble and unpleasantness, and sometimes only after such persons have been prosecuted amid sordid publicity and unfounded criticism in the Press at times, that one can get rid of these persons, in most cases long after the validity of their temporary permits as aliens have expired</p>

<p>It is in the light of these circumstances that it is being proposed to insert in the Aliens Act, 1937, a new section 5<i>ter,</i> which provides that no person shall employ or continue to employ any alien, conduct any business with him, or harbour him if he is not in possession of an immigration permit or a temporary permit for aliens to sojourn in the Republic, or if the period of validity of such temporary permit in his possession has lapsed. The proposed new section goes on to provide that no person shall employ or continue to employ any alien or conduct any business with him in conflict with the conditions subject to which the temporary permit for aliens was issued to such alien, for instance, in a case where an alien was only admitted for a holiday visit. If any person acts in conflict with the said provisions, he shall be guilty of an offence. The effect of this proposed new provision in the Aliens Act, 1937, is that employers, before employing any aliens, will have to satisfy themselves that such aliens are in possession of immigration permits or temporary permits for aliens to sojourn in the Republic, that the validity of such temporary permits have not expired, and that the conditions of the temporary permit authorize the holder of such permit to take up employment. The same applies to persons wishing to enter into business with aliens or who provide aliens with accommodation. They will have to satisfy themselves that such aliens are in possession of valid permits. However, it is not being proposed to impose on hotel managers a similar obligation in regard to providing aliens with accommodation&#x2014;hence the provision in clause <i>5ter</i>(4)&#x2014;since the imposition of such an obligation would mean, for instance, that hotel managers would not be in a position to provide the thousands of tourists and other visitors to this country with accommodation before it has been determined that the tourists are in possession of temporary permits for aliens to sojourn in the Republic and that the validity of such permits have not expired. In terms of section 10 of the Aliens Registration Act, 1939, it is already incumbent upon hotel managers to keep registers in respect of all persons provided with accommodation on their premises, and such registers must be signed by the persons concerned. However, other persons will have to determine whether aliens are in possession of valid temporary permits for aliens before providing them with accommodation. The provisions of the proposed new section 5<i>ter</i> of the Aliens Act will, in addition, not be applicable in the case of aliens exempted from the provisions of section 7 and 7<i>bis</i> of the Act, such as distinguished persons and certain citizens of certain countries.</p>

<p>Subsections (6) and (7) of the proposed new section 5<i>ter</i> are aimed at making it easier to prove the offence created by subsection (5) of the said section 5<i>ter,</i> and at making provision for convictions under alternative provisions of the section if proved by the facts of the case.</p>

<p>In explaining clause 2 of the Bill, I should like to refer hon. members to the provisions of section 5(1) of the Aliens Act, 1937. This section provides that any alien who has complied with all requirements prescribed by regulation may be issued, on application, with a temporary permit for aliens; in other words, the alien concerned applies for the said permit, upon which it is then issued to him.</p>

<p>In terms of the power conferred on him by section of the said Aliens Act, 1937, the Minister of the Interior has exempted certain citizens of certain countries, such as the United Kingdom, from the control by way of temporary permits <span class="col_3511-3512" refersTo="page_0309"/>for aliens in terms of which the temporary sojourn and taking up of employment in the Republic by other aliens are controlled and restricted. In terms of section 7<i>bis</i>(3) the said Minister (or any officer authorized thereto by him) has the power to withdraw the said exemptions granted to an individual or a class of persons. Consequently it does happen from time to time that the exemption granted to the said aliens from the requirement of being in possession of a temporary permit for aliens, is withdrawn in respect of individuals in cases where it is deemed in the public interest that their temporary sojourn in the Republic be controlled and restricted by way of a temporary permit for aliens.</p>

<p>In a recent legal opinion the State law advisers drew attention to the fact that in terms of section 5(1) of the said Aliens Act, 1937, temporary permits for aliens could only be issued to aliens if they applied for them. Aliens whose exemption from the requirement of being in possession of a temporary permit for aliens has been withdrawn, are therefore in a position to make it difficult for action to be taken against them by simply refraining from applying for the said permits.</p>

<p>I should like to refer in passing to the provisions of section 5<i>bis</i> of the Aliens Act. This section provides that any alien who does not apply of his own accord for a temporary permit for aliens, may be called upon by a passport control officer to apply for such permit, and if he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence and may be removed from the Republic.</p>

<p>The provisions of the said section 5<i>bis</i> of the Aliens Act are mainly employed for taking action against such aliens as may have entered the Republic unlawfully, usually at unguarded places along the border. This section is not suitable for taking action against aliens whose exemption from the provisions of the Aliens Act has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>It is in the light of these circumstances that provision is being made in clause 2 of the Bill for the addition of a new subsection to section 7<i>bis</i> of the Aliens Act, in terms of which it is provided that the Minister of the Interior, or any officer authorized thereto by him, may, without a prior application, issue a temporary permit for aliens to any alien whose exemption from the requirement of being in possession of a temporary permit for aliens has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the last section of the Aliens Act which is to be amended by this Bill, is section 10, which makes provision for the penalties that may be imposed for the contravention of the provisions of the Aliens Act. The said section of the Aliens Act provides that any person convicted of an offence under that Act shall be liable to a fine not exceeding R200 or in default of the payment of the fine to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months. These penalties, which do not make provision for the imposition of imprisonment in addition to a fine, are not considered to be an adequate deterrent to persons repeatedly committing a similar offence under this Act. In the light of this it is being proposed in clause 3 that the said section 10 of the Aliens Act be amended to provide that any person shall, on a second or subsequent conviction of a similar offence, be liable to the existing penalty of a fine not exceeding R200 (or in default of the payment of the fine, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months), or to both such fine not exceeding R200 and such imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or to the said imprisonment without the option of the said fine. On a first conviction the person concerned will still, as is being provided at present, be liable to a fine not exceeding R200 or, in default of the payment of the fine, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that concludes my explanation of the proposed amendments to the provisions of the Aliens Act, and I shall now proceed to deal with the proposed amendments to the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act, 1972.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, during May last year the Government decided in principle to relax to a certain extent the present control over the interprovincial movement by Asians. Even before unification in 1910 the admission to the former colonies of Asians was restricted and in some cases altogether prohibited, for instance in the case of the former Orange River Colony.</p>

<p>On unification this policy of restricting the admission of Asians to the various provinces was continued and a permit system was introduced to control the movement of Asians between the various provinces. This position continued throughout the years since unification and we still have the position today that Asians must apply for a permit if they wish to visit members of <span class="col_3513-3514" refersTo="page_0310"/>their families, friends and business associates in provinces other than the province of their domicile. These permits which are issued in terms of the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, are for temporary visits of 90 days&#x2019; duration, and in the case of Asians wishing to work in a province other than the province of their domicile, of one year&#x2019;s duration.</p>

<p>The issue of these permits has now become an enormous task. Like all other nations in South Africa the standard of living of Asians has also increased. They travel more to visit their families and friends, to attend sporting events in other provinces and for many other reasons. Annually more than 25 000 permits have to be issued.</p>

<p>The South African Indian Council has also indicated that it would welcome a relaxation of the present permit system applicable to the interprovincial movement by Asians.</p>

<p>It is in these circumstances that it is proposed in clause 4 of the Bill to introduce a new section 19A into the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act, 1972. In terms of this new section it will be possible for the responsible Minister, the Minister of Indian Affairs in the case of Indians and the Minister of the Interior in the case of other Asians, to exempt Asians as a category of persons from the present permit system whereby the movement of Asians between the provinces is controlled.</p>

<p>It is further provided that the Minister concerned may withdraw in any individual case the exemption so granted to a category of persons. In such a case the individual concerned would again have to acquire a permit for travel outside his province of domicile.</p>

<p>The relevant provisions whereby visits by Asians to the Orange Free State, certain Northern Natal districts and the Transkei are, except in certain circumstances, restricted, will not be affected by the proposed new section 19A.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the remaining clauses of the Bill I have to deal with are clauses 5 and 6.</p>

<p>Section 43 of the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act provides that any person other than a South African citizen by birth or descent who has been sentenced to imprisonment for certain specified offences may be removed from the Republic if by reason of the circumstances of the offence the person concerned is deemed by the Minister of the Interior to be an undesirable inhabitant of the Republic.</p>

<p>One of the offences specified in the relevant section is the offence committed by the sale or supply of or dealing in, or being in possession of any habit-forming drug in contravention of any law.</p>

<p>Section 13 of the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act specifies which persons shall be deemed to be prohibited persons to the Republic and who may in consequence not enter or remain in the Republic. Amongst such persons are persons who have been convicted of an offence detailed in Schedule I to the Act, such as murder, robbery, fraud, etc.</p>

<p>The said Schedule does not however contain any reference to the offence now included in section 43 of the Act of selling or supplying or dealing in or being in possession of habit-forming drugs in contravention of any law. This means that if a person has been convicted of such offence in another country he cannot for this reason be refused entry into South Africa since the offence does not appear in the said Schedule to the Act.</p>

<p>It is therefore proposed in clause 6 of the Bill that the offence of selling or supplying or dealing in or being in possession of any substance from time to time, referred to in Parts I, II and III of the Schedule to the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act, 1971, be included in Schedule I to the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act.</p>

<p>Because of the inclusion of the said offence in Schedule I to the last-mentioned Act, it is proposed in clause 5 of the Bill that reference to the said offence in paragraph (c) of section 43 of the Act be deleted. This can be done because in paragraph (a) of section 43 of the Act reference is made to offences mentioned in Schedule I to the Act. This means that a person, other than a South African citizen by birth or descent, who has been sentenced to imprisonment for an offence in Schedule I to the Act may be removed from the Republic if by reason of the circumstances of the offence the person concerned is deemed by the Minister of the Interior to be an undesirable inhabitant of the Republic.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment of section 43 of the Act is therefore consequential in <span class="col_3515-3516" refersTo="page_0311"/>nature. The effectiveness of the section will not be affected by the proposed deletion of paragraph (c) thereof.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I venture to state that hon. members will agree with me that the Bill is not contentious in nature but is designed mainly to strengthen the control of aliens in the Republic, and to provide the Ministers concerned with the authority to relax the permit control over the interprovincial movement by Asians.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has concluded his remarks by suggesting that this Bill is not contentious. That may be correct but there is a good deal in this Bill which needs clarification and I wish to draw the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention to some of these points. Sir, whenever one has provisions dealing with aliens&#x2014;and in this case we are dealing with aliens who are in the Republic legally in terms of the laws applicable in South Africa&#x2014;one always has to be careful that one is not creating a situation or a picture or an image of reluctant host to persons whom we might wish to have in this country, and as many of them as we can, particularly as far as our tourist trade and the development of the country is concerned. It is therefore necessary for us to examine this Bill in the light of the needs of the country in that regard and to see whether there are not perhaps aspects of this Bill which we might improve or amend at a later stage. In saying that I want to assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that we on this side of the House will support the Second Reading of this measure, but I have various observations which I wish to make in regard to the provisions contained in the Bill.</p>

<p>It is clear that aliens in this country, or aliens who may be in the Republic&#x2014;here I exclude those who are illegally in the country&#x2014;fall into four categories. In the first category we have the alien who has been granted a right of permanent residence in South Africa. The persons who fall into this category are in the majority of cases those who have applied for permanent residence and who have a desire to live in this country and to make their future in this country. They have been granted a permit to stay here on a permanent basis and enjoy all the privileges, such as seeking employment and freedom of movement, which are enjoyed by the citizens of this country. Of course, such a person does not have citizenship, but we look to all these persons who have permits for permanent residence to become full citizens of the country eventually. When one looks at that category of persons, those who have come to this country to make a future, one realizes that he must be protected to the extent that he is not prejudiced in that future life which has been made open to him in South Africa, by illegal or irregular actions by persons who do not have the same privilege. That is where I think this Bill is particularly useful in that we have the recognition of this different type of alien who may be in this country. The first category of aliens therefore comprises those with permanent residence permits.</p>

<p>The second category of aliens whom we have in this country comprises those who have temporary residence permits in terms of section 5 of the principal Act. This permit restricts the holder thereof as to the time he may stay in this country and may also restrict the holder as to the area in which he may reside and whether or not he may take employment. Even the type of employment and the employer in whose service he may enter may be restricted.</p>

<p>In the third category of aliens we have the alien who, as some kind of dignitary, is individually, or together with his family and his employees, exempt by special action of the Government. He is allowed free movement in the country.</p>

<p>Finally there is the fourth category of aliens. Aliens who fall into this category are the exempted class under section 7<i>bis</i> of the principal Act. In dealing with this class of alien, the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned citizens of the United Kingdom and so forth. I should like him to be good enough when he replies to the debate, to elaborate on the question as to who the persons or groups of persons are who are thus exempted or to which nationalities they must belong in order to be exempted under section 7<i>bis.</i> I think it is as well that we direct our attention to this issue. These persons are exempt from the necessity of having visas or having residence permits, whether temporary or permanent. I should be grateful if he could elaborate on that.</p>

<p>At the present time the only person who incurs the displeasure of the law in South Africa, if there is a breach of the conditions of a permit for temporary residence, is the holder of that permit himself. As the law stands at the moment, he is the only <span class="col_3517-3518" refersTo="page_0312"/>person who can be penalized and can have his right of residence withdrawn if he acts contrary to the conditions upon which he has been allowed to come into this country on a temporary basis.</p>

<p>The Bill we are now considering seeks to introduce a new aspect and that is that not only the alien himself who is guilty of a contravention of the conditions of his permit of residence, is to be penalized, but also any citizen of South Africa who, if I may put it this way, aids and abets him in so far as that contravention is concerned. The Bill is aimed at those persons who may aid such an alien to the extent that he employs him, or deals with him or harbours him contrary to the terms of his permit of residence. This always raises the problem, when it comes to legislating, as to how far the ordinary citizen must be involved with the State.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I was saying a few moments ago, one has to determine the extent to which the ordinary citizen is involved with the State in the application of the laws of the country by the State. We now have the position that the ordinary citizen becomes involves in the implementation or the carrying out of a measure which is applicable to aliens and their residence in South Africa. We may on occasion from this side of the House&#x2014;and we frequently do&#x2014;oppose legislation which is introduced by the Government of the day. I believe that once legislation is adopted by this House it becomes by democratic process the law of the country. Once it is so adopted there is justification for an involvement of the ordinary citizen to see that that law is carried out in the interest of the country as a whole. For that reason I believe that in this instance we are justified, in the circumstances which are apparent from the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech and of which we are all aware, i.e. the difficulty we have in controlling persons who come into the country and act contrary to the terms of the authority to be here, to request and to expect the ordinary citizen of the country to participate in the enforcement of the law that is applicable in South Africa. It is for that reason that we will support this legislation although it does introduce a new form of offence so far as the employer, the harbourer of or the dealer with an immigrant is concerned. The long title of this Bill rather euphemistically says that it is to provide for the prohibition of the performance of certain acts in co-operation with or in respect of certain aliens. That is a rather euphemistic way of saying that a new offence is being created that can be committed by any person who commits these offences in so far as aliens are concerned, e.g. who co-operates with them in effecting a breach of the terms of their permit to be in South Africa. Nevertheless, we on this side are prepared to accept it. We agree that the principle of this Bill is a sound one. Therefore we will support the introduction of this form of offence.</p>

<p>I do not believe that this requirement of checking on an alien or checking on a person whom one takes into ones employ is an unnecessary hardship on any employer. One would imagine that in these days any cautious employer would satisfy himself as to the identity of the person whom he is taking in his employ. The fact that he is asked to present his credentials by way of his identity documents or passport, or in some way or another, is not an undue hardship on the employer. It is certainly not an undue hardship on any legitimate alien who is here with authority to work at a certain place and for a certain time. I also believe that it is not unreasonable to expect that a precaution of this sort should be taken by the employer in the interests of the security of the country as a whole. I believe that this also justifies checking on the identity of an alien and on his right to be employed by the employer; it is justified that the employer should verify this.</p>

<p>I want to come to clause 1 of the Bill before us. I have difficulty in regard to the new subsection 5<i>ter</i> (1)(b) which is being inserted by clause 1. If the hon. the Deputy Minister will be good enough to look at subsection (1)(b) of the proposed new section 5<i>ter,</i> he will see that it reads:</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall enter into an agreement with any such alien for the conduct <span class="col_3519-3520" refersTo="page_0313"/>of any business or conduct any business in co-operation with any such alien.</block>

<p>That concerns a person who is not in possession of a temporary residence permit, a permanent residence permit or one who is not exempted in terms of section 7<i>bis;</i> in other words, he is an alien. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I believe that the intention there is to deal with such a person in the Republic of South Africa, but that is not what subsection (1)(b) says. I believe that it will have to be amended if that is the intention of the hon. the Deputy Minister, for as it stands, it reads that no person shall enter into any agreement with an alien who does not have any of these four qualifications, if I may put it that way. What is the position of a South African citizen who enters into a business agreement in order to utilize in his business a patent which is held by a German national, if he wishes to utilize those patent rights in South Africa&#x003F; In the light of the wording of subsection (1)(b) as it stands here, that would constitute an offence for because that contract will be entered into in South Africa. Although I know it is not the intention of the Government, clause 1 would also restrict any agreement entered into whereby finance is introduced into a business operating in South Africa by a foreign business house on the continent or by a foreigner or alien. There is the question, too, of the foreign manufacturer who appoints an agent in South Africa and of a South African manufacturer who enters into a business arrangement with an alien in any foreign country in connection with our export trade. I believe that, if the hon. the Deputy Minister will look at this clause as it is drafted, he will see that all those types of contracts will be hit by this clause as it stands. I believe it will be necessary to amend subsection (1)(b) so as to restrict it in some way to include only cases where there is active involvement of the alien in person in the conduct of the business in South Africa, that is to say in the actual physical conduct of the business of South Africa. In other words, the clause must stipulate that his presence is necessary in the Republic and that it does not apply merely when an agreement is entered into between a South African citizen and an alien. I believe that the co-operation, as I have said, must involve the physical presence and physical participation of the alien in the day-to-day management of the business in which he is taking an interest in South Africa; otherwise, it will constitute a prohibitive transaction, and the South African industrialist or businessman at least, will be subject to penalties in terms of this particular clause. That being so, I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give it some consideration. Perhaps if we have time enough between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage, we may have an opportunity of suggesting an amendment to the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to clause 1.</p>

<p>As far as clause 2 is concerned, I believe that there is a rather unsatisfactory provision in our laws at the moment. Section 7<i>bis</i>(3) of the Aliens Act of 1937 reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may withdraw any exemption granted under subsection (1) to any class of persons or to any person, whether as an individual or as a member of a class of persons.</block>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister, as he is now concerned with the control of aliens and matters of that nature, will give some consideration to a clearer definition of the circumstances under which the exemption of, for instance, a subject of the United Kingdom can be withdrawn. I do not believe they have been tabulated or made known. There are, for example, instances where a United Kingdom citizen applies for permanent residence and that permanent residence application is turned down. The Department of the Interior then immediately steps in and says: &#x201C;since the Department of Immigration has turned down your application for permanent residence, how long do you intend to stay here&#x003F; You must make arrangements for obtaining a temporary residence permit&#x201D;. This provision which is contained in section 7<i>bis</i> as it stands is a wide and ill-defined power and I look forward to the hon. the Deputy Minister possibly clarifying that provision in dealing with further amendments in the future. It is, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has mentioned, correct that these permits are issued not necessarily on the application of the individual concerned, but to prevent the automatic application of the harsh provisions of the Act itself which virtually amounts to that man becoming at that very moment a prohibited immigrant and as such subject to the harsh provisions of the law dealing with prohibited <span class="col_3521-3522" refersTo="page_0314"/>immigrants. We welcome this change whereby the certificates of temporary residence can now be granted.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of the amendment of section 13(1)(a) of the Admission of Persons to the Republic Regulation Act of 1972. I think it would be impossible to find legislation which is more inappropriately worded for the present time than the particular provisions of section 13(1)(a) when applied to the Asian community of South Africa. Referring to prohibited persons, section 13(1) states the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Any person referred to in this subsection who enters or who has entered the Republic or who, though lawfully resident in one province, enters or has entered another province in which he is not lawfully resident, shall be a prohibited person in respect of the Republic or such other province (as the case may be), namely&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">(<i>a</i>) any person or category of persons deemed by the Minister on economic grounds or on account of standard or habits of life to be unsuited to the requirements of the Republic or any particular province thereof; &#x2026;</block>

<p>How one can in this time and in this age suggest that Asians should be confined to a particular province of this country on the grounds that they fall within these categories that their &#x201C;standard or habits of life&#x201D; are unsuited to another province of the country is unbelievable. But that is the law as it now stands. The hon. the Deputy Minister and the Government with this legislation are taking a very timid step forward to relieve Asians of these restrictions. Whilst we welcome it, and whilst we realize that this particular measure will be in the hands of the Minister of Indian Affairs in terms of the 1971 proclamation, and not in the hands of the Department of the Interior, we want to urge as strongly as we can to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this antiquated restriction should be repealed and removed from our Statute Book in so far as the Asian population is concerned, as soon as possible. The situation as it now stands is that under section 19(1) of the Act individual Asians can be exempted. Now we are going to have reverse process and a whole category can be exempted, but then the exemption can be withdrawn from individuals within that category. The matter is becoming impossible and I was interested to hear the hon. the Deputy Minister say that they are issuing up to 25 000 permits. The position has been intolerable for employers of Indians. When I talk of employers of Indians, one wonders what would happen to the hotel industry in South Africa if it was not for the Indians who are employed in this industry. But, Sir, what happens&#x003F; At the present moment an Indian may be employed in a responsible position in a hotel in Cape Town. He is expected to return to Natal and there to apply for a permit so that he can come back to the hotel and work for the following year. This is the intolerable position which has arisen in regard to the question of Indian movement. I am glad that this step is being taken to relieve it, but I would like to hear more about the plan to use this permissive power which is now being granted to the Minister of Indian Affairs. I would like to hear a statement from the hon. the Deputy Minister, not in the general terms in which he has stated it in his speech, but in more specific terms as to what he means by &#x201C;categories of persons&#x201D; and how he is going to apply it in regard to Indians. That sort of statement is long overdue.</p>

<p>There is another vexed problem which I must draw to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention when dealing with this free movement of Indians or the relaxation of movement as regards the Asians, namely the total inadequacy in certain parts of the country of areas available to these people for residence. In the Cape Peninsula, for instance, if one were to allow free movement to the large number of Indians who could well obtain employment here, it would not be of much avail, because there is only a small area set aside for them on the Cape Flats, in Rylands Estate where ground is as expensive per square foot, because of its scarcity, as the best sites in Constantia. If the Government is going to give real effect to this proposed amendment of releasing the Asians from some of the restrictions, most of the restrictions of movement, it must simultaneously see to it that there are more adequate facilities for residence and home-ownership in the areas where Asians can be employed and where they can set up their homes without having to pay the prices that are applicable today to ground in these areas. This is a move which we welcome, because it will greatly assist the hotel industry in areas other than Natal, to employ these Indians who have a <span class="col_3523-3524" refersTo="page_0315"/>particular ability, are particularly suited to and are exceptionally effective in assisting in the management and running of the hotel business.</p>

<p>Other speakers on this side will deal with one or two other questions with which I have not dealt in regard to the remaining aspects of this Bill. With these remarks, I wish to say that we support the Second Reading of this Bill, and we look forward to hearing from the Deputy Minister answers to the points I have raised, particularly with regard to those provisions which need to be redrafted, and perhaps we can then discuss them further in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is important in the sense that it supplies certain deficiencies which exist at present in regard to the admission of aliens to this country, and that it also supplies deficiencies in other measures, so as to eliminate in this way bottlenecks and difficult problems which have been experienced in the past. Therefore it is encouraging that the Second Reading of this legislation is also supported by hon. members of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, an analysis of this Bill, as the hon. the Deputy Minister also said, indicates, in fact, that a twofold responsibility is being created here, in the sense that not only may the alien who gains admittance to the country by some illegal means or other, be charged, but that the person within the country who helped the alien to enter the country, may also be brought to book. I think it is essential that this person be held responsible <i>in loco,</i> because in the first instance the alien is very often a person who is not conversant with local circumstances. He is not a person who is conversant with the legislation of the country, and although this cannot be accepted as an excuse, he still tries to plead ignorance as a defence. In most instances the person who works for him or who provides accommodation is in fact the person who is behind the whole plan; he is the planner behind the whole scheme and in fact the principal offender. For that reason I believe that it will be generally agreed that it should be possible to charge this person, who is really the principal offender or criminal in this instance and who ought to know better. There is a general tendency to disregard the position here completely and to adopt the attitude that it does not matter under what pretext an alien enters the country; that it does not matter what methods are used to get him into the country; that once the alien is here, everything is in order again and then ways and means will be devised, whether they be legal or illegal, to keep him here. These illegal actions, these illegal procedures, have also resulted in the establishment of illegal organizations in the country&#x2014;we know that this happens and the Police know this happens &#x2014;organizations which have as their goal the smuggling of aliens into this country under all manner of pretexts. These organizations assure these people that they are coming here legally and that they will provide work for them, etc. Today there must be thousands of strangers in the country who have entered the country illegally in this way. After all it goes without saying that it would eventually make a total farce of our whole immigration policy if we were to shut our eyes to this illegal procedure and allow it to continue on a progressively larger scale, and it is for that reason that I believe that it is so essential for us to come to grips with the position at this stage by means of this legislation and that the necessary legislation in this connection be approved. It causes certain problems for the Government and for the Police when an illegal alien of this kind has once obtained vested interests in this country, for example business interests. One is then really presenting the authorities with a <i>fait accompli,</i> and they are bound to the extent that the actions they take could entail hardship and inconvenience, and everything that is associated with that. As I have said, the authorities are presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> This country, South Africa, is a much-sought-after country. I do not believe that we have any problem in attracting a good type of immigrant, whether permanently or temporarily, to this country. Therefore I do not think that we need welcome the kind of person who enters this country illegally.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Precisely ten years ago my predecessor introduced his Budget Speech with the following words:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C; &#x2018;Growth&#x2019; and &#x2018;growth rate&#x2019; are today the operative words in the dictionary of the economist.&#x201D; Fashion changes occur in economics just as in any other field, and the present-day economist in the wealthy industrialized countries would perhaps not give such unconditional support to the aim of &#x201C;growth&#x201D;. For a country such as South Africa growth is nevertheless still of major importance, and the main purpose of this Budget is to promote healthy growth.</block>

<p>Consequently, in the economic review which, as is customary, precedes my Budget proposals, I shall devote particular attention to the growth prospects in our economy, to any factors which inhibit the growth rate and to measures which could counteract the inhibiting effect of these factors and could positively stimulate growth.</p>

<p><i>Economic Review</i></p>

<p><i>The Balance of Payments</i></p>

<p>Last year our first priority was the improvement of the balance of payments, since without such an improvement it would have been necessary to be very careful in the application of measures designed to stimulate the economy.</p>

<p>The spectacular improvement which did occur is well known, and it is only necessary to mention a number of the most important aspects. The value of exports in 1972 increased by 36% compared with 1971 as a result of a sharp rise in the volume as well as in the unit value of exports. In contrast, the value of imports in 1972 declined by 2,5%, and this notwithstanding an appreciable rise in the prices of imported goods as a result of the depreciation of the rand as well as of rising prices abroad; it appears that imports of consumer goods declined noticeably more than those of capital and intermediate goods.</p>

<p>Despite a decline in the volume of gold production in 1972, the value of this output rose by 26% due to the favourable price on the private market.</p>

<p>As a result the current account of the balance of payments showed a deficit in 1972 of only R97 million compared with R976 million in 1971.</p>

<p>On capital account 1972 saw an appreciable net inflow of R502 million, which was nevertheless smaller than the 1971 figure mainly due to a net outflow of private short-term capital and the repayment of certain foreign loans by the Government and banking sector.</p>

<p>Taking into account an additional allocation of Special Drawing Rights as well as certain valuation adjustments, total gold and other foreign reserves increased in 1972 by R439 million to a level of R1 090 million at the end of the calendar year. If gold were to be valued at its price on the private market instead of at its official price, the reserves would of course have stood at a much higher level.</p>

<p><i>Domestic Economic Conditions</i></p>

<p>The economic growth rate for 1972, as measured by the growth in real gross domestic product, was approximately 3%. This is disappointing figure but, though technically correct, it is to some extent misleading. The low rate of increase is partly due to a decline of 7% in the volume of gold production. This decline is largely the result of a deliberate policy of mining lower grade ore. But due to the higher prices on the private gold market, the <i>value</i> of this lower gold production rose substantially, namely by approximately 26% above the 1971 figure, which however is not reflected in the real gross domestic product. Prices of other export products have also risen appreciably, all contributing to the economic prosperity of the country. If these relative price factors are taken into account, real gross national product shows a growth rate of approximately 4%, or practically the same as the rate achieved during the past three years. Even this figure is still low compared with the new target rate of the Economic Development Programme, to wit 5&#x00BE;%, but there are encouraging <span class="col_3527-3528" refersTo="page_0317"/>signs of a revival in certain sectors during the most recent months.</p>

<p>It is significant that gross domestic expenditure showed only a slight rise during 1972. The fact that inventories actually declined to a very low level, was an important contributing factor to this small increment in expenditure. Other important causes were a drastic reduction in the rate of increase in Government consumption expenditure as well as Government investment (apart from investment in the infrastructure), while private fixed investment remained virtually unchanged.</p>

<p>The various sectors of the economy showed divergent trends. In manufacturing, construction and mining (excluding gold) a moderate upturn in production occurred; in the first-mentioned sector, however, the improvement only commenced late in 1972. Retail and wholesale sales at constant prices showed a declining tendency in general, but sales of motor cars improved noticeably towards the end of 1972.</p>

<p>Agriculture was blessed during the first half of 1972 by favourable weather conditions, and good summer-grain harvests were achieved. The present wheat and sugar cane harvests also exceed those of 1971. Mainly because of the reduction in the numbers of woolled sheep, the production of wool, in contrast, showed a declining tendency, which nevertheless was more than made up by a sharp rise in wool prices. The production of butter and tobacco as well as the total supply of meat also declined. All told the total volume of agricultural products produced in 1972 was about 4% higher than in 1971.</p>

<p>The second half of 1972, however, was characterized by serious drought conditions over extensive areas and these unfavourable weather conditions continued during the first months of 1973. As a result the prospects for summer-grain harvests as well as grazing conditions for 1973 are not favourable. As our celebrated author and philosopher C. J. Langenhoven, whose centenary is being commemorated this year, expressed it:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Die waterfonteine het opgedroog, Riviere verswak en gaan staan, Gesaaides en tuine en boorde verdor, Weivelde en oeste vergaan.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The Government is aware of the problems of the farmer&#x2014;problems which are being aggravated by rising costs&#x2014;and in this Budget they are not forgotten.</p>

<p>Employment in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy rose moderately over the year 1972. Though the number of registered unemployed never attained a high figure and in fact declined towards the end of the year, the labour market still offers scope for expansion. Salaries and wages rose less than in 1971&#x2014;relatively less than profits, in contrast to the tendency over the previous four years.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to analyse in detail the movement of prices during the past year, since this subject has already been discussed at length in the House. From December, 1971, to December, 1972, the consumer price index rose by 7,4%. More than half of this rise was attributable to higher prices of imported goods (partly due to the devaluation of the rand) and to increased food prices (mainly due to unfavourable weather conditions).</p>

<p><i>Monetary Conditions</i></p>

<p>The large rise in our gold and other foreign reserves, together with a substantial increase of R449 million or 11,6% in bank credit to the private sector, were the main reasons for a sharp rise of 14% in the quantity of money and near-money during the year 1972. As a result of the sharp increase in domestic prices, however, the ratio of money and near-money to gross domestic product at market prices rose only slightly over the year.</p>

<p>The expansion of bank credit to the private sector occurred mainly during the second half of the year, probably in part as a result of the relaxation of the restrictions on bank credit. Net bank credit to the Government sector increased over the year by less than R90 million.</p>

<p>The favourable balance of payments contributed to easier conditions in the money market, and short-term interest rates showed a declining tendency. In the capital market, too, the rates of interest on long-term Government stocks and particularly semi-gilt-edged stocks declined. Building societies experienced a record year despite a reduction in their borrowing rates in August and their funds increased by nearly R500 million.</p>

<p><i>Economic Prospects</i></p>

<p>The principal characteristics of the South African economy for 1972 were thus firstly, the dramatic improvement in the balance <span class="col_3529-3530" refersTo="page_0318"/>of payments; secondly, the relatively high level of inflation, which was, however, largely attributable to certain special factors; and thirdly, the comparatively low rate of growth.</p>

<p>The prospects for the balance of payments still appear satisfactory. Reserves have increased further since the beginning of 1973, partly due to the record prices obtained for gold on the private market. The poor agricultural season will indeed affect our exports detrimentally, while imports will probably rise as the economy starts to show a higher rate of growth. Higher imports will, however, probably be accompanied by a higher inflow of capital. On balance the balance of payments should not at present be a limiting factor with respect to the growth of the economy.</p>

<p>International monetary disturbances may, of course, exercise an appreciable influence on our balance of payments, and unfortunately I cannot be optimistic that such disturbances will not recur. Until gold assumes its rightful place as keystone of the international monetary system, I doubt whether a lasting stability can be achieved in this sphere, and this requires a realistic adjustment of the official price of gold. In the meantime there is every reason to believe that the price on the private gold market will remain firm. A general recession in world trade due to exchange rate uncertainties, however, could adversely affect South Africa&#x2019;s export trade. I hope and trust international financial statesmanship will soon find a satisfactory and lasting solution.</p>

<p>In the meantime the rand is strong in relation to other currencies, and though we decided ten days ago to leave our exchange rate with the U.S.A. dollar unchanged, the Government will not hesitate to review the position once more should the most important European currencies appreciate substantially against the dollar.</p>

<p>As far as inflation is concerned, it is clear that excess demand at present plays no significant role, but nevertheless cost factors can be expected to exert further upward pressure on prices in the immediate future. Included in these factors are the increased rail tariffs which had to be imposed recently, higher wages and salaries, the appreciation of the Japanese and certain European currencies and the rising cost of imported goods in general.</p>

<p>There are, however, other factors which may, perhaps later during this year, exert a restraining influence on the rising trend of prices. The first is our rate of exchange. After the devaluation of the rand in December, 1971, the average value of the rand in terms of all other currencies was reduced by some 12%. Subsequently to the recent devaluation of the dollar and the depreciation of the British pound, the rand in fact appreciated, with the result that its average value in terms of all other currencies was only about 9% below its level prior to December, 1971. The recent upward float of certain European currencies and the Japanese yen again counteracted to some extent the upward movement of the rand, but on balance, and purely on the basis of relative rates of exchange, imported goods ought to be slightly cheaper in 1973 than in 1972. The extent to which this effect will be neutralized by inflationary conditions abroad, is naturally difficult to foresee.</p>

<p>The second factor is the fact that labour conditions are still relatively easy and that manufacturing industry in particular still has considerable unused production capacity. If, as I expect, a revival in industrial production should occur during the course of the year, we can assume that unit costs will decline as production capacity is used more economically, without any immediate pressure on the factors of production and their prices.</p>

<p>For these reasons there are grounds for hoping that once the present cost factors have exerted their full effect on prices, the rate of inflation may decline appreciably. To this end it is of course also necessary that the prices of imported goods should not rise excessively and that we should take care that demand inflation does not again rear its head, for example through the excessive creation of bank credit.</p>

<p>The prospect for a faster rate of economic growth is the most important single element in this review, since growth is essential to ensure satisfactory employment opportunities and rising prosperity for our growing population.</p>

<p>As I have already pointed out, there were several signs of revival in the economy since the fourth quarter of 1972, including higher manufacturing output, increased activity in the construction industry, higher sales of motor cars, a lower level of registered unemployment and several more. As Langenhoven put it: &#x201C;You need not drink the sea dry to convince yourself that it is salty.&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="col_3531-3532" refersTo="page_0319"/>In addition the Government has already taken several steps to stimulate the economy, the effects of which have not yet fully penetrated to all sectors of the economy. These measures include the relaxation of restrictions on bank credit; the lowering of the sales tax on furniture, certain household equipment and motor cars; the relaxation of the restrictions on hire purchase and other consumer credit; the earlier repayment of loan levies and the granting of enhanced decentralization concessions to industry.</p>

<p>An important factor which still has to show its effect, is the improvement in the salaries and wages for the Public Service, the Railway Administration, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and other public bodies, as well as in certain branches of the private sector.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the basic conditions for growth are now exceptionally favourable. The banks are in a position to expand credit, labour conditions are easier, there is unused capacity in industry and inventories are at a low level. The economic revival in certain foreign countries will also be a favourable factor.</p>

<p>Another factor which should not be lost sight of is the large expansion programme of the State corporations, particularly the South African Iron and Steel Corporation (ISCOR), and of the Railway Administration and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. These programmes have already assumed appreciable proportions and they will attain a peak during the next few years. This will undoubtedly have a great stimulating influence on the economy.</p>

<p>Against all these favourable factors one has to consider the present less favourable position of certain important sectors of agriculture. The detrimental effect of the drought must exert a restraining influence, particularly in the rural areas. Of course we trust that our country will be blessed during the next season with more favourable weather conditions, to allow us to exclaim with Langenhoven:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Geluk! o dorstende veld en vee &#x2026; Vog vir die droogte, o somershoop!&#x201D;</block>

<p>On balance I am convinced that the forces pointing to an economic revival are very strong, and that we can look forward with confidence to a faster rate of growth during the year ahead. The increased optimism at present noticeable in wide business circles, is a further indication that my confidence is firmly founded.</p>

<p><i>Economic Programme for</i> 1973</p>

<p>In the light of this review of current and expected economic conditions, we are now able to formulate our most important lines of policy for 1973.</p>

<p>As regards the balance of payments, no special short-term action seems called for. We must, however, keep in mind the longterm aspects as well, and here the Government has been furnished with valuable guide-lines by the Report of the Reynders Commission of Inquiry into the Export Trade of the Republic. The Government has decided to implement, without delay, several recommendations of the Commission, and I shall return to this matter when I deal with my proposals for Government expenditure and tax concessions. The Commission has, however, rightly pointed out that the private sector, too, bears an important responsibility for the development of our export trade. I wish to appeal to commerce and industry to accept this challenge and to enter the export field with greater determination. Perhaps Langenhoven&#x2019;s terse advice in this respect is quite appropriate: &#x201C;Do not strike back. Strike first.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Effective action against the present rising tendency of prices is particularly difficult, since this trend is largely due to unavoidable cost factors. By means of price control the Government sees to it that unjustified price rises in respect of a wide range of basic commodities are as far as possible prevented. The public can also assist by buying judiciously, and employees by exhibiting continued moderation in their wage and salary negotiations. As I have already pointed out, there is good reason to expect that the rate of inflation will before long decline. In these circumstances the best contribution that the State can make is twofold in nature: firstly, to lessen the effect of inflation on the less-privileged as much as possible, and secondly, to see to it that as far as practicable any measures to stimulate economic growth are not extended so far that they ultimately give rise to renewed demand inflation.</p>

<p>Since the prospects for an economic upsurge are now particularly favourable, and since the Government has already taken various steps to stimulate the economy, it would therefore be unnecessary and indeed <span class="col_3533-3534" refersTo="page_0320"/>dangerous to introduce large-scale stimulative measures. Nevertheless, in my view there is justification for further moderate stimulation in the fiscal field as I shall propose at a later stage in this budget speech.</p>

<p>The question is, however, whether it is necessary to devote attention to other non-fiscal measures to stimulate the rate of growth of the economy. I am referring here particularly to the factors of production, viz. capital and labour.</p>

<p>The availability of capital and credit is not at present inhibiting healthy development, but rates of interest are still relatively high and a reduction might assist in lowering the cost structure. As already announced last night, the Reserve Bank has consequently decided, after the usual consultation with the Treasury, to reduce its discount rate by &#x00BD;<i>%</i> to 5&#x00BD;<i>%</i> and to lower its pattern of interest rates for Government stocks. I trust that this step will be followed by a reduction in bank lending rates; this matter will shortly be discussed by the Reserve Bank with the institutions concerned.</p>

<p>As far as labour is concerned, the raising of productivity is at present of cardinal importance in relation to our aim of faster growth. There are signs that employers have become more productivity-conscious during the past year. Furthermore, the Productivity Institute has made important contributions by drawing the attention of industrialists to the low levels of productivity in certain industries and to the potential which exists for improvement.</p>

<p>Further, the Government stands by its existing policy as announced in the White Paper on the Decentralization of Industries, <i>inter alia,</i> to promote the reclassification of artisan&#x2019;s work, in co-operation with the trade unions, in order that the less skilled operations may be undertaken by semiskilled workers with a resultant improvement in the status of the artisan. I remain convinced that, through co-operation between the employer and employee organizations, much can still be achieved in this direction.</p>

<p>Training and educational facilities, however, are of the utmost importance. In the case of Whites, Coloureds and Indians the facilities are, generally speaking, sufficient but it is important that they be better utilized.</p>

<p>Particularly with a view to the rising trend in Bantu wages&#x2014;a trend with which the Government has expressed its sympathy&#x2014; the increase in productivity of Bantu employees is today of the greatest importance, and more attention will have to be devoted to the relevant educational facilities.</p>

<p>During the past two decades phenomenal progress has been achieved in the provision of the necessary educational and training facilities for the Bantu. The Government has not only succeeded in bringing primary education within the reach of the broad masses, but praiseworthy progress has also been achieved in the field of secondary education, i.e. academic, commercial, technical and vocational training. On the tertiary level Teacher Training Schools, Colleges for Advanced Technical Training in the homelands and the three universities enjoy high priority and the number of students continues to increase.</p>

<p>In order to provide for the labour needs of border area industries and industries located within the Bantu homelands, a training programme has been initiated in terms of which factory operatives and industrial workers receive formal pre-service training with Government aid. The Government is conscious, however, of the great need of industries in the White areas for better trained Bantu industrial workers, also in order to improve productivity. An Interdepartmental Committee has therefore been appointed to investigate the desirability and practical feasibility of a system of pre-service training and in-service-training of Bantu workers for industrial categories of work in White areas duly released for Bantu persons.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that secondary industry will have to play a key role in the growth of our economy. Industrial protection and industrial promotion thus form an important component of our economic policy.</p>

<p>Under modern conditions, with the establishment abroad of exceptionally large industrial concerns which are located in large domestic markets, South African industry is exposed to severe competition. In addition, certain of our new sophisticated industries require heavy capital investment which results in high unit costs, at least in the initial years. Our policy of protection will of necessity have to be adjusted to meet these changed circumstances.</p>

<p>Another problem arises as a result of the fact that a substantial number of customs tariffs on manufactured goods are bound against increase in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s obligations in terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

<p><span class="col_3535-3536" refersTo="page_0321"/>The Government has been negotiating for some time already in accordance with the rules of the General Agreement in order to obtain the necessary freedom with respect to the tariff bindings concerned, and though progress has been achieved, difficult problems still remain.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Government has given industrialists the assurance that the protection which they enjoy in specific cases through import control, will not be reduced or eliminated until appropriate tariff protection has been considered and put into operation. This means that in cases where the import tariffs are bound against increase in terms of GATT, the Government will not abolish import control in respect of the goods concerned until the necessary freedom has been obtained to provide the desired degree of tariff protection, as recommended by the Board of Trade and Industries, to the relevant domestic manufacturers.</p>

<p>I also wish to mention here the generous concessions at present being offered by the Government to industries which are established in the decentralized areas. I trust that industry will make increasing use of these concessions and in this way create greater employment opportunities particularly within the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>Later in this budget speech additional measures to encourage industrial development will be announced.</p>

<p>Our economic policy for 1973 should thus, in the first place, be focussed on improving the growth rate of the economy, but in such a way that inflationary conditions will not be aggravated at a later stage. In addition, attention must be devoted to measures which will promote our export trade, particularly in respect of manufactured goods. In this budget I also wish to try to alleviate as far as possible the problems brought about by rising prices for the man in the street, and in particular for the under-privileged.</p>

<p><i>The Financial Year</i> 1972-&#x2019;73</p>

<p>I deal now with the Government&#x2019;s accounts for the year drawing to a close.</p>

<p>On Revenue Account it is estimated that revenue will amount to approximately R2 864 million&#x2014;R201 million more than the original estimate. This gladdening result derives mainly from increased collections of income tax on gold mines (R50 million), companies (other than mining companies)(R55 million), and individuals (R73 million). As against this, however, we have lower receipts from customs and excise duties (R19 million). Expenditure from Revenue Account is now estimated at R2 825 million, or R46 million more than originally expected, mainly because of higher expenditure on provincial subsidies (R21 million), interest on public debt (R10 million) and the subsidy on wheat (R10 million). After allowing for a further amount of R30 million to cover the opening deficits on Revenue and South-West Africa Accounts, a surplus of about R9 million remains.</p>

<p>Expenditure on Loan Account will, it is estimated, amount to about R887 million, which is R80 million more than the original figure. The increase is mainly due to an additional R42 million for the Railways and a further R29 million for the Orange River Project. The domestic loan flotations of the Government were particularly successful and produced a net amount of no less than R517 million. In addition the investments of the Public Debt Commissioners will be more than R200 million in excess of what was expected, principally due to their sales of Government stock. The result is that the Government was able to repay the 1967 loan levy, and to transfer an amount of R264 million to the Stabilization Account, while the Loan Account is expected, notwithstanding, to close with a surplus of R10,5 million.</p>

<p>I should like to point out that, whereas a year ago it appeared necessary to provide for a transfer of R161 million from the Stabilization Account&#x2014;R140 million to Revenue and R21 million to Loan Account &#x2014;we are now not withdrawing anything from the Stabilization Account, but on the contrary are going to deposit therein the large amount of R264 million, while the Revenue as well as the Loan Accounts will close with a surplus. Had we transferred R140 million to Revenue Account, as originally envisaged, this Account would have shown the considerable surplus of R149 million.</p>

<p>Revenue and expenditure on the South-West Africa account do not differ much from the original estimates and this account is expected to show a deficit of R22,l million, which will be covered from the Revenue Account.</p>

<p><span class="col_3537-3538" refersTo="page_0322"/><i>The Financial Year</i> 1973-&#x2019;74</p>

<p><i>Expenditure from Revenue Account</i></p>

<p>On Revenue Account the expenditure for 1973-'74 is estimated at R3 392 million, which is 20% above the revised estimate of expenditure for the current financial year. This rise is of course largely attributable to the recently announced salary increases, which will cost the Government about R180 million all told. Without this additional expenditure the increase would have been less than 14%, which under present-day conditions, and particularly after the exceptionally severe economy measures applied in the current year, must be considered as reasonable.</p>

<p>On the Vote Defence an amount of R447 million is provided for. The cost of sophisticated armaments necessary for the effective defence of our borders is high but injudicious pruning in this field may cost a country dearly in the end. As Langenhoven said: &#x201C;Pay the price of a donkey and don&#x2019;t expect the service of a horse.&#x201D;</p>

<p>On the Vote Public Debt an increase of R52 million is provided for mainly as a result of the substantial amount of loan moneys that the State received during 1972.</p>

<p>Provincial subsidies show an increase of R111 million which can be largely attributed to increased salaries.</p>

<p>There is an increase of R48 million in the Vote Bantu Administration and Development due to an enhanced provision for homeland development.</p>

<p>Apart from the amounts in the printed estimates, I should like to propose certain additional expenditures.</p>

<p><i>Social Pensions</i></p>

<p>As always the Government remains mindful of the interests of pensioners, and I gladly and confidently propose that the following increases in social pensions be approved. As Langenhoven said: &#x201C;It is for you and for me to make ourselves the neighbour of the needy and the stranger.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In the first place I propose that the basic social pensions and allowances for Whites be increased by R4 per month and that settlers&#x2019; allowances and parents allowances be adjusted accordingly. This represents an increase of approximately 10%. In view of the substantial relaxation of the means test effected last year, no additional concessions are contemplated in this respect for this year. The increases as proposed will accordingly not result in the extension of the means scale in the case of Whites.</p>

<p>In addition, I propose that the bonus payable to war pensioners be raised by 10% to 35%. <i>Per capita</i> subsidies payable in respect of children in childrens&#x2019; homes or foster-care will be increased by R3 per child per month while children&#x2019;s allowances, payable in maintenance of family allowance cases, will be increased by R1 per child per month and children&#x2019;s allowances payable to settlers will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Similar relief based on the existing ratio-basis is also proposed in the case of the non-White population groups. Where applicable adjustments will also be effected in respect of non-Whites in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that the means test in respect of Coloureds, Indians and Chinese be relaxed by&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) raising the free-income limit from R96 to R252 per annum; and</li>

<li>(b) exempting assets to the value of R3 200 when determining the means of an applicant.</li>

</ol>

<p>The parents allowance payable at present in the case of Coloureds, is R1-25 per month less than that paid in respect of Indians. Unfortunately, it is not possible to eliminate this difference in full immediately. I accordingly would like to propose that the leeway be made up by raising the parents allowance in the case of Coloureds by 50 cents per person per month this year and by 75 cents next year. The parents allowance in the case of Coloureds will thus be increased by R2-50 per month this year.</p>

<p>Last year I mentioned in my Budget statement that the Government had decided to have the whole matter relating to the payment of maintenance grants to all population groups investigated, specifically with reference to the possible abuse of this allowance in respect of illegitimate children. This investigation has been completed and my colleague, the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions will shortly make a comprehensive statement in this regard.</p>

<p>In order to give Departments an opportunity to make the necessary adjustments, the proposals relating to social pensions and allowances will be implemented as from 1st October, 1973.</p>

<p><span class="col_3539-3540" refersTo="page_0323"/>For a full year the additional cost of these concessions will amount to R22 million, for the financial year 1973-&#x2019;74 it will be R11 million.</p>

<p><i>Civil Pensions</i></p>

<p>As was recently announced by my colleague, the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, it has been decided to consolidate with effect from the 1st July, 1973, the Public Service Pension Fund, the Permanent Force Pension Fund, the South African Police and Prisons Service Pension Fund, the Provincial and the Territory Service Pension Fund as well as the Government Service Widows&#x2019; Pension Fund, and to improve the benefits payable from these.</p>

<p>This means that the gratuity to members of the consolidated fund who retire on pension on or after 1st July, 1973, will henceforth be calculated at 6,72% of their average salary during the last three years of service multiplied by the period of their pensionable service. In addition their annuities will henceforth be calculated at 1/55th of such salary multiplied by their period of pensionable service. Widows of officials who die on or after 1st July, 1973, will receive one half of the pension to which their husbands had been or would have been entitled.</p>

<p>The changes which are to be effected will not only involve appreciable increases in gratuities and annuities, but will ensure a pension scheme for employees of the State which will probably be unparalleled in either the public or the private sector. I am convinced that the benefits which are now being provided will ensure a carefree old age for our officialdom and their widows and, what is more, allow them to retain their sense of independence.</p>

<p>Members of the Police Force, the Permanent Force and the Prison Service, who so often have to perform their daily task in dangerous circumstances in order that the citizens of our country may live in safety, will now also get due recognition for this in the form of improved additional benefits.</p>

<p>Though the improved benefits will, in turn, require a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the officials in the form of higher contributions, the State will nevertheless contribute generously in order to make these improvements possible.</p>

<p><i>Existing Civil Pensioners</i></p>

<p>The Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is at present already paying pensions to a large number of pensioners who were formerly officials of the State or of the universities or certain boards. These pensions, as a rule, are composed of annuities, bonuses and allowances.</p>

<p>Civil pensioners were last granted relief in 1971. It has consequently been decided to consolidate the annuities, bonuses and allowances which would have been payable to such pensioners on or after 1st July of this year, and to increase the consolidated amount by 10% with effect from the same date.</p>

<p>This will mean that, in the case of a person who would, immediately prior to that date, have been entitled to an annuity of, for example, R185-70, a bonus of R42-42 and an allowance of R30, that is a total of R258-12 per month, the pension will be increased by R25-81 to R283-93 per month.</p>

<p><i>Minimum Pensions</i></p>

<p>In the case of someone who would have been entitled to a minimum pension of R118 per month prior to 1st July, 1973, the pension will be increased by R11-80 to R129-80 per month, while in the case of a person who is entitled to a minimum pension of R59 per month, the pension will be increased by R5-90 to R64-90 per month. Those persons whose minimum pensions are being increased in this way, will thus no longer fall in the group of minimum pensioners.</p>

<p>The additional cost to the Exchequer in 1973-&#x2019;74 is estimated at approximately R1,2 million, and this amount has already been included in the printed estimates.</p>

<p><i>Mentally Retarded Children</i></p>

<p>Last year the allowance payable by the Department of Health in the case of mentally retarded children in day centres was increased to R1 per child per day. It appears that this allowance is still insufficient and I propose that the allowance be increased to R2 as from 1st April, 1973. The additional expenditure will be approximately R250 000.</p>

<p><span class="col_3541-3542" refersTo="page_0324"/><i>Home-owners&#x2019; Savings Scheme</i></p>

<p>Last year the Government introduced the State-assisted home-owners&#x2019; saving scheme to encourage individuals in the middle and lower income groups to save in order to enable them to obtain a home for their own occupation. Due to rising prices it has now become necessary to raise the limits which have been laid down for the scheme. The maximum value of a property that will qualify for the scheme is therefore now raised from R16 000 to R20 000; the maximum loan in terms of this scheme, from R12 000 to R15 000; the maximum savings total which will qualify for the interest subsidy of 2%, from R4 000 to R5 000, and the maximum earnings of persons permitted to participate in the scheme, from R5 000 to R6 000 per annum. I hope that these enhanced limits will encourage young married couples in particular to make use of this very advantageous scheme in order to obtain their own home. Their first step is to open a special home-owners&#x2019; savings account with a building society. In view of these substantial improvements, building societies are earnestly requested to bring this scheme to the notice of the general public in a more positive manner.</p>

<p>As an additional aid to would-be homeowners, the maximum loan in terms of the 100% housing scheme for Public Servants is increased from R15 000 to R20 000, but the interest subsidy will remain pegged to R15 000.</p>

<p>The cost of these concessions for the year 1973-&#x2019;74 should not exceed R100 000.</p>

<p><i>Export Promotion</i></p>

<p>I have already referred to the importance of export promotion and to the recommendations of the Reynders Commission in this regard. Certain proposals require additional Government expenditure. Two important recommendations in this category have already been accepted and put into operation, to wit specially reduced rail tariffs on export products at an annual cost of R22 million, and an improved scheme of assistance with respect to the interest burden on export financing at a cost of R8 million. Provision for both these schemes has already been made in the estimates. The Government has now decided to accept the following further recommendations which will entail additional State expenditure:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) assistance to reduce the interest burden in connection with pre-shipment finance of capital goods;</li>

<li>(2) similar assistance in relation to the financing of stocks in warehouses abroad;</li>

<li>(3) specially reduced rail tariffs for raw materials consigned from the interior to export industries which are located at the coast;</li>

<li>(4) a State contribution of 40% of the expenditure on approved primary market research abroad;</li>

<li>(5) assistance in relation to approved joint foreign promotion by industrial associations, marketing boards and similar organizations;</li>

<li>(6) aid with respect to the rental of foreign warehouses for finished products and components as well as for semi-processed and processed raw materials;</li>

<li>(7) assistance in relation to expenses incurred in bringing foreign importers of specific South African products to South Africa;</li>

<li>(8) assistance on a selective basis in relation to the cost of electric power required for the beneficiation of base minerals for export; and</li>

<li>(9) an increase in the State&#x2019;s contribution to the National Productivity Institute.</li>

</ol>

<p>Further details of these measures, as well as of tax concessions to exporters which I shall announce later, will be announced by my colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, in due course. The total cost involved in the implementation of the aforementioned recommendations (apart from the R30 million which has been included in the printed estimates in respect of the recommendations already accepted) amounts to R5,5 million.</p>

<p>The Government is conscious of the fact that the present high interest burden sometimes creates problems for industrialists who may wish to install new productive capacity for exports. The Industrial Development Corporation will consider this problem and may possibly be able to devise <span class="col_3543-3544" refersTo="page_0325"/>a scheme to assist export industries on favourable terms in deserving cases. If necessary the Government will be prepared to augment the funds of the Industrial Development Corporation for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Summary of Expenditure on Revenue Account</i></p>

<p>Taking into account all of the above-mentioned additional amounts, total expenditure on Revenue Account will then add up to R3 409 million. In addition, provision has to be made for the expected deficit on the South-West Africa Account for 1972-&#x2019;73, to wit R22 million, and for the payment of R30 million to the Reserve Bank in respect of the Forward Exchange Contracts Contingency Account. As against this latter amount the Reserve Bank will pay over to the State R56 million in respect of the Foreign Currency Adjustment Account. The total amount required on Revenue Account then amounts to R3 461 million.</p>

<p><i>Revenue</i> 1973-&#x2019;74</p>

<p>In a period such as the present when an economic revival is probably imminent, it is particularly difficult to estimate State revenue. For purposes of this Budget I have drafted my estimates on a realistic yet reasonably optimistic basis.</p>

<p>Inland Revenue is expected to provide R2 462,4 million in 1973-&#x2019;74, or R346 million above the revised total for the current year. The special payment of R56 million by the Reserve Bank, to which I have already referred, has been included in this figure. Collections from customs, excise and sales duties will most probably not increase to the same extent and are estimated at R772 million. Total revenue then amounts to R3 235 million, which is R226 million less than the estimated expenditure of R3 461 million.</p>

<p>Before considering methods of covering this deficit, I should like to consider the position of the Loan Account first.</p>

<p><i>Loan Account</i> 1973-&#x2019;74</p>

<p>Expenditure on Loan Account is estimated at R981 million, which is R94 million or 10,6% more than in 1972-&#x2019;73. The most important increases include R24 million for the Railways, R14 million for the purchase of shares in the Armaments Development and Manufacturing Corporation, R11 million for the development of Bantu areas, and R11 million for the provinces (primarily for school and hospital buildings). I wish to draw attention to the amount of R22 million under the Vote Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure for assistance to farmers, R4 million of which is earmarked for loan assistance to farmers who have been adversely affected by the drought. Together with the provision of R1,5 million on the Revenue Vote of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing for grazing relief, it indicates the concern of the Government about the position of the farmer under the present drought conditions.</p>

<p>The provision for the Land Bank is also being increased by R5 million to R23 million, of which R12 million is for the erection of bulk storage facilities by the cooperatives and R11 million for normal loans to farmers&#x2014;the latter amount at the special rate of interest of 2% per annum.</p>

<p>The Railway Administration has recently been authorized to raise its own loans, and though it is expected that in future it will still receive the major portion of its loan funds from the Government, it is at present the intention that the Administration itself should find the funds for the Richards Bay coal export project.</p>

<p>Provision must also be made for the repayment or redemption of foreign loans amounting to R68 million, of local loans and for miscellaneous items amounting to R292 million, as well as for the usual transfer of R5 million to the Loan Fund for the Promotion of Economic Co-operation.</p>

<p>The total amount required on Loan Account is thus R1 346 million.</p>

<p>As against this the following amounts are estimated to be available:</p>

<p><span class="col_3545-3546" refersTo="page_0326"/>In addition it should be possible to issue new local loans and treasury bills to an amount of R180 million and to raise new foreign loans to an amount of R160 million.</p>

<p>All told it is expected, therefore, that an amount of R1 247 million will be available, which still leaves a deficit of R99 million to be covered from other sources.</p>

<p><i>South-West Africa Account</i></p>

<p>Expenditure on South-West Africa Account for 1973-&#x2019;74 is estimated at R75 million, R10 million more than for the current financial year. Revenue is expected, to amount to R87 million or R16 million more than in 1972-&#x2019;73, thanks mainly to increased collections of inland revenue. After allowing for a transfer of R35 million to the Territorial Fund, there will thus be a deficit of R23 million.</p>

<p><i>Deficit on Revenue and Loan Accounts</i></p>

<p>The combined deficit on Revenue and Loan Accounts is thus put at R325 million. In present economic circumstances when it is desirable to stimulate the economy, it would not be expedient to attempt to cover this deficit from increased taxation. On the contrary, I think it is desirable to grant certain concessions, and to cover the deficit from the reserve funds of the State. Obviously, however, the tax concessions will have to be limited, otherwise there would be a big risk that monetary demand will be stimulated to such an extent that demand inflation will once again rear its head.</p>

<p>Before discussing my proposals for tax reductions I should like to deal with a few tax increases. Even Langenhoven, after all, acknowledged: &#x201C;To every silver lining there is a cloud&#x201D;.</p>

<p><i>Taxation Proposals</i></p>

<p>In the consideration of tax matters I am advised by the Standing Commission of Inquiry into Taxation Policy, on which the private sector is represented. The Commission has already submitted a variety of proposals, some of which are being implemented today.</p>

<p><i>Increase in Company Licences</i></p>

<p>The minimum amount for a company licence is at present R10 per annum. I feel that this amount is too low and that it is conducive to the excessive proliferation of small companies. Consequently, I propose that, while the scale remains unchanged (that is 25 cent per R1 000 of issued capital), the minimum amount be fixed at R50. This change will take effect from 1st April, 1973, and is expected to yield an additional R7 million.</p>

<p><i>Taxation on Royalties</i></p>

<p>At present a tax is levied at the company rate (41%) on 30% of royalties and similar payments made abroad. (The levy or scale of taxation is subject to the conditions stipulated in the various double taxation agreements.)</p>

<p>At the moment payments for the supply of know-how, which may also include certain management fees, are not subject to taxation unless such know-how payments are linked directly or indirectly to the use in the Republic of a patent, trade-mark or copyright.</p>

<p>The dividing line between know-how and royalty payments is often very vague and causes considerable administrative problems while at the same time offering an easy loophole for the avoidance of the tax.</p>

<p>It would also appear that know-how payments rather than royalties are being negotiated more and more by international concerns, and that in other countries no distinction is drawn between these concepts for taxation purposes. It is consequently intended to extend the concept &#x201C;royalty&#x201D; in the Income Tax Act so that it will include such payments and will also largely be in accordance with accepted international definitions.</p>

<p>The expected additional tax revenue in 1973-&#x2019;74 will be R1 million.</p>

<p><i>Dividends to Foreign Shareholders in Insurance Companies</i></p>

<p>At present dividends paid by South African insurance companies to foreign shareholders are exempted from the non-resident shareholder&#x2019;s tax. Since local shareholders in insurance companies as well as local and foreign shareholders in other <span class="col_3547-3548" refersTo="page_0327"/>companies do pay tax on their dividend receipts, there is no reason why foreign shareholders in insurance companies should not also make a contribution.</p>

<p>The additional tax revenue is estimated at R200 000 per annum from 1973-'74. It is also proposed that the amendment take effect from Budget date in order to prevent excessive dividend declarations with a view to avoiding taxation (which could conceivably occur should the measure come into effect at a later date).</p>

<p><i>Stamp duty on transfer of flats, etc., in terms of the Sectional Titles Act</i></p>

<p>A portion of a building as envisaged in the Sectional Titles Act will not be transferred by means of a deed of transfer, but through an endorsement on the sectional titles document. Stamp duty on deeds of transfer will then not be payable in the case of such transfers.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that it is only fair that a person who buys a flat for, say, R20 000 should pay the same stamp duty as a person who buys a house for the same price. From tomorrow, therefore, the same stamp duty as that payable in respect of deeds of transfer will be payable in the case of the transfer of units in terms of the Sectional Titles Act.</p>

<p><i>Customs and Excise Duty on Cigarettes</i></p>

<p>The Price Controller has received representations from cigarette manufacturers and the Government is satisfied that a small increase in the price of cigarettes on account of higher costs is justified. The increase which can be allowed on these grounds, however, is &#x00BD; cent per packet of ten cigarettes, and it is felt that this amount could cause inconvenience to the buyer as well as the seller and that the price increase should rather be rounded off to one cent per ten cigarettes. A notice which authorizes such a price rise appears in the <i>Government Gazette</i> today.</p>

<p>Commerce, however, has no claim to the additional one half cent and I feel it is fair that it should be applied to the advantage of the State. The excise duty on cigarettes will therefore be increased by &#x00BD; cent per ten cigarettes.</p>

<p>Coupled with the increase referred to, it has been decided to increases the excise duty on cigarette tobacco by &#x00BD; cent per 50 grams and the customs duty on cigarettes and cigarette tobacco by &#x00BD; cent per ten cigarettes and &#x00BD; cent per 50 grams, respectively.</p>

<p>The increased customs and excise duties on cigarettes and cigarette tobacco become effective immediately and are applicable to those goods which have not as of this moment been cleared for domestic consumption.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in accordance with section 58(1) of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964, I hereby lay upon the Table, for consideration by the House, the formal taxation proposals relating to increased customs and excise duties.</p>

<p>The additional revenue for the Exchequer from these increases will amount to about R9 million per annum.</p>

<p><i>Tax Concessions</i></p>

<p>I come now to what will probably be the most popular part of this Budget. Even so, judging from the numerous requests for tax relief which I have received, a number of taxpayers will certainly be disappointed. However, I cannot shirk my responsibility towards the financial stability of our country. Those who are of the opinion that a massive reduction in taxation is at present justified in order to stimulate faster growth, remind me of Langenhoven&#x2019;s remark: &#x201C;If the trees were to take after us, they would despair in winter of ever having green leaves again.&#x201D; All the signs and conditions for growth are here already; only, we must not become too impatient as we should then create problems&#x2014;inflation problems&#x2014; for the future. We should also keep in mind the other saying of Langenhoven: &#x201C;The downhill of the outward journey is the uphill of the future.&#x201D;</p>

<p>My tax concessions will, consequently, in the first instance be aimed at stimulating the growth of our economy moderately without driving up costs and prices. In this respect I believe that the stimulation of investment rather than of consumption should at present receive priority. At the same time, in view of today&#x2019;s price trends, I would like to relieve the burden on the underprivileged and the man in the street.</p>

<p><i>Sales Duty</i></p>

<p>The latter aim is the principal motive of my proposals relating to sales duty.</p>

<p><span class="col_3549-3550" refersTo="page_0328"/>In my Budget Statement last year it was mentioned that the Standing Commission of Inquiry into Taxation Policy of the Republic would perhaps later during the course of that year submit a report on the possible replacement of the present sales duty by another type of tax. The study has, however, not been completed and the Commission is not yet in a position to report. The task is complex, covers a wide field and requires study in depth of all the facets of the various types of taxes, <i>inter alia,</i> their probable effect on the cost of living, and their administration by the State and by commerce and industry. Sales duty thus, for the present at least, remains in force.</p>

<p>Representations for a reduction in the sales duty on a wide range of goods are continually being received. The Government keeps the position under constant review and will continue to do so. Should it be found that relief is necessary and that the financial position of the country allows, the necessary adjustments will be made.</p>

<p>In this way it was possible during 1972 to lighten the burden of sales duty in certain respects. During September, 1972, the administration of the duty was facilitated by exempting certain intermediary products in manufacturing processes from the payment of the duty. Next, the export trade benefited through the provision for a refund, subject to certain conditions, of the duty on dutiable goods which are exported. Then, too, it was arranged that registered old-age homes and schools will be entitled to acquire certain goods under rebate of duty.</p>

<p>Additional concessions were made during November, 1972. On this occasion certain industries which needed encouragement were assisted and the sales duties on, <i>inter alia,</i> motor vehicles and household furniture, refrigerators and stoves were reduced.</p>

<p>The concessions made in respect of sales duties during 1972 resulted in a loss of revenue to the State of about R20 million per annum.</p>

<p>I propose now that the sales duty on a range of goods, primarily household goods and the few less important foodstuffs which are taxed, be reduced by 5%. It is not possible to enumerate all the goods here but they include spices, sweets, biscuits, sauces, cups, saucers, plates, knives, forks, pots, pans, mincers, polishers, vacuum cleaners, paint, tyres and tubes, radios, gramophones and watches. In addition I propose that the sales duty on glues for household use be reduced from 30% to 20%. In one case the reduction is intended to act as a stimulus to local industry: that is a 5% reduction in the duty on pianos and organs.</p>

<p>These concessions are being made effective by means of a <i>Government Gazette</i> which will be promulgated tomorrow; they will result in a loss of revenue of approximately R13 million per annum.</p>

<p>The Government expects that importers and manufacturers will pass on these concessions to the consuming public. The Department of Commerce will keep a close watch in this respect and should it appear that these concessions are not passed on to the consumer, further action will be considered.</p>

<p>I wish to remind the House that I have the authority to reduce sales duty at any time&#x2014;an authority which I have already used in the past and which I will use again should circumstances so demand.</p>

<p><i>Transfer Duty</i></p>

<p>In view of the rising costs of houses and particularly to help newly-weds to obtain a house of their own, I feel that a concession in respect of transfer duty is justified. At present a rebate of two-thirds of the transfer duty is allowed when the value of the property does not exceed R5 000, one-half for properties between R5 001 and R10 000, and one-third for properties between R10 001 and R15 000, on condition that the property is acquired by a natural person for his own occupation or for the occupation of certain members of his family. I propose that, in respect of developed property, the rebate of two-thirds be applicable up to a value of R15 000, the rebate of one-half between R15 001 and R20 000 and the rebate of one-third between R20 001 and R25 000. On unimproved land there will only be a rebate of two-thirds up to a value of R15 000. The existing conditions as to occupation and the like remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The effect of this concession is that transfer duty on a house of R20 000, which in the past amounted to R700, will henceforth only be R350.</p>

<p>The concession will come into operation tomorrow and will result in a loss of R6 million per annum, but for the 1973-&#x2019;74 financial year it will amount to R4 million.</p>

<p><span class="col_3551-3552" refersTo="page_0329"/>I now come to certain concessions in respect of income tax.</p>

<p><i>Income Tax</i></p>

<p><i>Concession to physically and mentally disabled persons</i></p>

<p>At present expenditure incurred by a disabled person because of his handicap, may be deducted from his earnings up to a maximum of R600 per annum, but only if the expenditure had been incurred to enable him to carry on his trade.</p>

<p>I feel that the latter condition is too limiting, since such expenditure weakens the economic position of a disabled person even though his income may consist primarily of pension or investment moneys. I wish to propose, therefore, that the condition be withdrawn, that is, that the deduction of a maximum of R600 will hold even though the expenditure does not relate to the carrying on of a trade.</p>

<p>In addition I feel that the existing condition according to which the deduction disappears completely as soon as the level of income reaches R4 000 (or R5 000 where both husband and wife are disabled) is somewhat severe in that an increase of only R1 above this level entails the loss of the total benefit. I propose, therefore, that the deduction be gradually diminished by R1 for every R10 by which the income exceeds R4 000 or R5 000. Should a person be entitled to the maximum deduction of R600, it will then only disappear completely when the taxable income exceeds R10 000 or R11 000.</p>

<p>As Langenhoven wrote: &#x201C;Help your neighbour to carry his cross and you will be surprised how much lighter your own will become.&#x201D;</p>

<p><i>Contributions to Pension and Retirement Annuity Funds</i></p>

<p>In view of the rising level of incomes and in order to encourage saving, I propose that the maximum deduction in respect of contributions to a pension fund be increased from R1 000 to R1 250 per annum, and the maximum in respect of a retirement annuity fund from R2 000 to R2 500 per annum.</p>

<p>The loss of tax revenue for 1973-&#x2019;74 will amount to about R2 million.</p>

<p><i>Exporters&#x2019; Allowance</i></p>

<p>Last year the exporters&#x2019; allowance was increased in accordance with the recommendations of the Reynders Commission at a cost to the Exchequer of R9 million per annum. Further recommendations of the Commission relating to the scope of the allowance, however, had to stand over for further consideration.</p>

<p>The Commission recommended that the emphasis in the application of the exporters&#x2019; allowance should not be limited to the development of export markets, but that it should also include the retention of those markets. I am in agreement with this change in emphasis. As a result, certain additional expenditure items of exporters will qualify for the exporters&#x2019; allowance. The most important are:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Insurance premiums.</li>

<li>(b) Exceptional discounts to promote competition and to reward the foreign distributor or agent in lieu of commission.</li>

<li>(c) Certification fee levied by the South African Bureau of Standards.</li>

<li>(d) Proportional costs relating to the maintenance of a joint domestic-foreign marketing operation.</li>

<li>(e) Cost of registration of patents and trade-marks abroad.</li>

<li>(f) The pre-production expenditure on design of export labels and packaging.</li>

<li>(g) Packaging costs in excess of those required for the South African market.</li>

<li>(h) Membership fees in respect of institutions involved in export promotion.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Commission further proposed that the exporters&#x2019; allowance be extended to cover service industries. The Government accepts this recommendation in principle but further investigation is necessary before it is implemented. As was proposed by the Reynders Commission, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Commerce, will go into the matter further and will shortly draw up a list of the various <span class="col_3553-3554" refersTo="page_0330"/>service industries which will be permitted to participate in the scheme, and will publish this list in the <i>Government Gazette</i> as soon as the necessary amendments to the Income Tax Act have been effected.</p>

<p>The loss of taxation for 1973-&#x2019;74 is estimated at R1 million; for subsequent years it could be R2 million per annum.</p>

<p>The annual value of tax concessions granted by the Government to exporters during 1972 and 1973 now amounts to R11 million, and the value of other benefits, R35,5 million&#x2014;a total of R46,5 million.</p>

<p><i>Gold and Other Mines</i></p>

<p>Divergent provisions exist in the Income Tax Act regarding the redemption of capital expenditure by mines. The capital expenditure incurred in the development of a gold mine established prior to 1946, is capitalized and allowed as expenditure over the life of the mine. Similar expenditure incurred by post-1946 mines is allowed as current expenditure in the year in which it is incurred. Coal and other mines (excluding diamond and certain copper mines) are treated in this respect in the same way as the pre-1946 gold mines, but to the extent that mining products are beneficiated in the Republic increased annual deductions are allowed.</p>

<p>In the interest of uniformity and in order to encourage mining development, I propose that future capital expenditure of all these mines be allowed in full as a deduction in the year in which it is incurred.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport_for_the_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT (for the MINISTER OF FINANCE)</person>:</from>

<p>The remainder of the unredeemed capital expenditure in respect of the pre-1946 gold mines will be deducted over a period of four years, and in the case of other mines (except diamond mines and certain copper mines) over the life of the mine or 30 years, whichever is the shorter.</p>

<p>The loss of tax revenue for 1973-'74 will be about R3 million.</p>

<p><i>Undistributed Profits Tax</i></p>

<p>A company (except a financial company) which has not yet built up a reserve to an amount of R20 000 is at present exempted from the tax on undistributed profits. In order to permit smaller operating companies to build up a more substantial operating capital, I propose that this limit be increased to R50 000.</p>

<p>As regards the determination of distributable income, I propose that in cases where the deduction relating to the purchase of machinery and equipment is more than sufficient to wipe out tax liability for the year, the balance be allowed to be carried forward to the next year. The company will then not lose any benefit from its capital expenditure on machinery and equipment.</p>

<p>Some of the concessions which I have already announced will stimulate our economic rate of growth indirectly. The concessions which I now wish to propose are aimed directly at higher growth.</p>

<p><i>Concessions Relating to Moneys Received from Industrial Training Funds</i></p>

<p>In certain industries every industrialist pays a levy, based on the number of artisans in his employ. These levies are deposited in a training fund, which has been established in accordance with an approved scheme in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, and from its subsidies are paid to employers who train skilled workers. The intention is that employers who do not themselves provide training are obliged to contribute financially to the cost of training in the industries concerned.</p>

<p>The levy payable by an industrialist is deducted from his taxable income, but any amount which he receives from the fund is at present taxable. In order to promote industrial training in general and this type of scheme specifically, I propose that one half of any moneys which an industrialist receives from such a training fund be allowed as a deduction from his taxable income.</p>

<p>The loss of revenue for 1973-74 is estimated at R300 000.</p>

<p><i>Investment Allowance</i></p>

<p>With a view to encouraging industrial investment and also to allow to some extent for rising prices and consequential increased replacement cost of industrial buildings and machinery, an increase in the investment allowance is, to my mind justified. The present investment allowance amounts to 15% on machinery and equipment and 10% on buildings, but in economic development areas the allowances <span class="col_3555-3556" refersTo="page_0331"/>may be increased to 50% and 35%, respectively. I propose that these allowances be increased by 5% in relation to buildings, the construction of which is commenced on or after 1st April, 1973, or in relation to machinery and equipment which have been brought into use on or after that date.</p>

<p>This concession implies that in the metropolitan areas 120%, and in the economic development areas up to 155%, of the cost of machinery is deductible over the life of the asset. In the case of machinery used intensively and on which a wear and tear allowance of 25% is allowed, this means, further, that in the first year of use, and taking into account the initial allowance of 15%, altogether 56% of the cost of machinery may be deducted from taxable income in all areas; in the economic development areas the deduction may be as high as 91%.</p>

<p>The present investment allowances lapse on 30th June, 1975. In order to give greater certainty to industrialists, I propose that the termination date be extended by two years and that the allowances be applicable to machinery, equipment and factory buildings which are brought into use prior to 30th June, 1977.</p>

<p>The loss of tax revenue for 1973-&#x2019;74 is estimated at R6 million, and for later years at R18,4 million per annum.</p>

<p><i>Company Income Tax</i></p>

<p>Representations have been received from various quarters for a reduction in the rate of tax or loan levy on companies. Any meaningful reduction, however, will result in a substantial loss of revenue. It should also be remembered that our rate of taxation on companies is lower than that in many other countries. Moreover, companies have benefited appreciably from the earlier repayment of the 1967 loan levy, and they will benefit further from the concessions relating to the investment allowance and the undistributed profits tax, which I have announced in this budget speech.</p>

<p>Consequently I cannot see my way clear to agree to these representations. I wish to propose, however, that the remaining 3 % loan levy on dividend receipts of companies be abolished. Because of this the Loan Account will suffer a loss of R10 million.</p>

<p><i>Income Tax on Individuals</i></p>

<p>There is at present a 20% surcharge on personal income tax applicable to all taxpayers whose liability for income tax (before the surcharge) is R150 or more.</p>

<p>I propose that this surcharge be reduced to 10%. This concession has the additional effect that the maximum marginal rate, at present 72% when taxable income exceeds R28 000 (in the case of married taxpayers) or R24 000 (in the case of single taxpayers), will be reduced to 66%.</p>

<p>I trust that this substantial concession will be an incentive to all to work diligently for the prosperity of our country.</p>

<p>The loss in tax revenue in 1973-&#x2019;74 will be R60 million.</p>

<p><i>Summary</i></p>

<p>The net effect of all these taxation changes is a loss of R72 million in respect of the Revenue Account and R10 million in respect of the Loan Account. The deficit on Revenue Account, after allowing for these changes, is therefore R298 million, and on Loan Account R109 million.</p>

<p>I propose that the balance in the Tax Reserve Account, i.e. R56 million, be applied towards reducing the deficit on Revenue Account. The balance of the deficit on Revenue Account (R242 million) and the deficit on Loan Account (R109 million) can then be covered from the Stabilization Account. The latter Account has at present a balance of R426 million, and is, consequently, more than sufficient to meet these deficits.</p>

<p><span class="col_3559-3560" refersTo="page_0333"/>Mr. Speaker, the mainspring of economic growth is the enterprise of the private entrepreneur. The Budget can only create the framework and the right climate. This I have tried to do in this Budget, namely, by the following measures:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) the judicious increase in Government expenditure on necessary services, particularly in relation to the economic infrastructure and the promotion of exports;</li>

<li>(2) the financing of these expenditures by drawing where necessary on reserve funds in order to avoid any general increase in the level of taxation&#x2014;on the contrary, substantial tax concessions are proposed to promote economic growth, including&#x2014;</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(a) the halving of the surcharge on personal income tax;</li>

<li>(b) the abolition of the loan levy on dividends received by companies;</li>

<li>(c) the increase and extension of the investment allowance;</li>

<li>(d) the concession relating to industrial training funds;</li>

<li>(e) the concession to mining companies relating to capital redemption;</li>

<li>(f) the extension of the exporters&#x2019; allowance; and</li>

<li>(g) the concessions relating to the tax on undistributed profits.</li>

</ol>

<p>Apart from these measures the Government has already done much to stimulate economic growth, and where necessary it will consider further measures; in this respect I refer in particular to my remarks relating to industrial protection and promotion and to the training of labour, as well as to yesterday&#x2019;s announcement by the Reserve Bank regarding lower interest rates.</p>

<p>Further, the Government remains mindful of the interests of the underprivileged and of the ordinary citizen, particularly during these times of rising prices. Here I refer to the concessions to pensioners and prospective home-owners, to the reduction in sales duties, to the concessions relating to transfer duty and also those relating to disabled persons.</p>

<p>To sum up, I feel that this Budget establishes a balanced and firm foundation for the economic progress of South Africa. The basic conditions for economic growth are right and the climate favourable; it is now for all of us, and particularly for the private entrepreneur, to put our shoulders to the wheel and to grasp the opportunities offered by economic revival. Langenhoven said: &#x201C;You will have more than enough troubles if you wait till they come&#x201D;; let us then go forward with confidence to develop the economy of this land of ours to new heights of prosperity.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now lay upon the Table:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Estimate of Expenditure to be defrayed from&#x2014;</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(a) Revenue Account [R.P.2&#x2014;'73];</li>

<li>(b) Loan Account [R.P. 3&#x2014;'73]; and</li>

<li>(c) South-West Africa Account [R.P. 4&#x2014;&#x2019;73]</li>

</ol>

<p>during the year ending 31st March, 1974;</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) Estimate of the Revenue to be received during the year ending 31st March, 1974 [R.P. 5&#x2014;&#x2019;73];</li>

<li>(3) Statistical Survey [W.P. B&#x2014;&#x2019;73];</li>

<li>(4) Comparative figures of Revenue for 1972-'73 and 1973-'74; and</li>

<li>(5) Taxation proposals [A. 1&#x2014;'73].</li>

<from><span class="col_3569-3570" refersTo="page_0338"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure I speak for every member in this House when I say how distressed we were when the hon. the Minister had to break off in the middle of his speech. We are very happy to see him back in his seat again and I am happy to tell the House that I am informed that there is nothing seriously wrong with him and that it was merely having had to stand up for so long that affected him. I am not surprised, Sir. The hon. the Minister this afternoon undertook a mammoth task in delivering his Budget Speech.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the sound picture of the country&#x2019;s finances he was able to lay before the House this afternoon, and I share with him his satisfaction in reporting to the House that this year he was able to announce a surplus. But my satisfaction is tinged with a certain sense of concern, when I give thought to the wage-earners, the fixed income groups, the pensioners and the lower income groups who in the middle of all this affluence have been and are still fighting an unequal struggle against inflation and against the rise in the cost of living. They are battling against the inflation that rose last year by 7,4%. It rose for the period from February, 1972 to February this year by 8,9%, and is running currently on an annual basis of very nearly 12%. My satisfaction with the picture painted today by the hon. the Minister is tinged with a deep sense of responsibility that it should be possible amidst all this wealth, for tens of thousands of our people in South Africa to be living below the poverty datum line, while thousands more throughout the Republic, including those living in such places as Dimbaza and Sada and Limehill, are trying just to exist on a mere pittance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Budget is set in a framework of hardship and poverty amidst a background of plenty, and whilst the proposals of the hon. the Minister are welcome they will provide only minimal alleviation. We have been told by the hon. the Minister that our growth for last year was approximately 3%. I predicted some weeks ago that this was probably the case and I will have a great deal to say about this at a later date. But this is not all the public is tolerating at the moment. We have already felt the mailed fist of the hon. the Minister of Transport, who with his increases in railage rates, harbour rates, pipeline rates and airways rates has taken out of the pockets of the public of South Africa R180 million. We have also had the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs wanting his pound of flesh and he has just taken from the public of South Africa R28,5 million. These two hon. Ministers are the poor sisters&#x2014;I will not say the ugly sisters&#x2014;but the fairy godmother, or the fairy godfather rather, is the hon. the Minister of Finance who sits with his coffers bursting at the seams; and it was within his power to return to the public of South Africa the R208 million which has been taken from them by the two poor sisters. Now, he has made a number of concessions and we welcome those concessions, but the hon. the Minister has a lot of leeway to make up, because what we received from him today amounted to only R72 million. At first blush this Budget savours of a great deal of complacency. In spite of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reference to the question of inflation and growth, there are too many banalities, too little hard, realistic, concise and meaningful blue-prints for action which will ensure an increase in the rate of growth and a halt to inflation. But there are some hopeful signs. The hon. the Minister has at long last taken some cognizance of the advice that we have been giving him gratuitously year after year. I do not want to prejudge the issue, Sir. I want to examine his Budget with my colleagues in much greater detail and I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>In the first instance we want to tell the hon. the Minister that we will not oppose the Third Reading of this Bill, for the simple reason that the hon. gentleman has, in regard to the contentious clause 5, done a great deal to set the minds of hon. members on this side of the House at rest as far as this <span class="col_3571-3572" refersTo="page_0339"/>clause is concerned. The hon. the Minister has proposed an important amendment, namely that the powers of expropriation of the commission will remain limited to only those additional facilities it may grant when such an abattoir belongs to the commission itself. We welcome that concession by the hon. the Minister. We have also received the assurance from the hon. gentleman that, if possible, he will effect a further amendment in the Other Place to see whether this property which is expropriated in this way and made available to another person, will not be sold, but rather let to bodies or persons who may require it. We want to urge the hon. gentleman in all seriousness to explore the possibility of leaving it in the hands of the commission and rather to let them hire it out than to expropriate the property for someone else. If that were to happen the last shadow of doubt in the minds of hon. members on this side of the house about clause 5 would be eliminated and then we could have no objection to this clause.</p>

<p>It is a pity though that the hon. the Deputy Minister was not prepared to accommodate us in connection with clause 6. No limit whatsoever is placed on the levies which may be collected by the commission. Since this commission naturally needs revenue, and since we do not want to stand in its way and would also not like to see its expenditure exceed its revenue, we shall have no objection to this clause and we shall accept the Third Reading as such.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I should like to insist that the hon. the Deputy Minister, now that he has this unlimited power, very carefully bears in mind the objections which we on this side of the House have raised. We should have preferred him to come back to this House from time to time to obtain the approval of the House for further increases in the levy. I think the objection raised by hon. members on this side of the House was a valid one. In my opinion it was just as valid as it was when we first considered this legislation six or seven years ago. I want to insist that the hon. the Deputy Minister points out most clearly to the commission that although their services are appreciated, they must bear in mind that it is still only one sector of South Africa that is responsible for the maintenance of the activities of this commission and that this levy be kept as low as possible and within reasonable limits.</p>

<p>With these words we give our support to the Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in regard to the clause dealing with expropriation, I do not wish to elaborate any further on what I said yesterday. I still intend to rectify what is laid down here in the Other Place, under the same conditions, i.e. if it is possible to do so. I have already been in contact with the Abattoir Commission and they will let me have their comments on this matter as soon as possible. I want to assure the hon. gentleman opposite that we shall handle this matter with great care and to the best of our ability and to the benefit of the industry, with the same degree of earnestness as that expressed here by the hon. the Opposition.</p>

<p>As far as the levy is concerned, it is clear that, as we have stated, we should like to bring it into line with the practice followed in the case of all the control boards, even though there might be a minor difference of opinion as to whether the Abattoir Commission is somewhat different to the normal control board because it does not fall directly under the Marketing Board. It is clear, however, that in the last analysis the responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Minister and I am convinced that, as in the case of all rising costs, the Minister will have a restraining influence and that he will definitely keep a watchful eye to ensure that the farmers do not have to pay unnecessarily, because they are of course the people in whose service we are here and to whom we should like the benefit to accrue. We are also not losing sight of the fact that good services must be rendered and that it is also to the benefit of the consumer that this whole matter of abattoirs be dealt with in the best possible manner. For this reason we shall try to maintain an equilibrium and keep the costs low for both these sectors.</p>

<heading>SOCIAL PENSIONS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is an important clause of the Bill. When <span class="col_3573-3574" refersTo="page_0340"/>one looks at the Schedule of the Bill one will see that a number of Acts are being repealed by this Bill. Consequently the definition clause is of considerable importance particularly in view of the various types of pensions that are to be provided for by the remainder of the Bill. Firstly I would like to refer to the definition of &#x201C;social pension&#x201D;, paragraph (xvii), and which is defined as meaning:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; an old-age pension, a blind person&#x2019;s pension, a disability pension, a veteran&#x2019;s pension or an allowance.</block>

<p>I would like to hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister who is handling this Bill, whether these pensions will still retain their identity as such when they are awarded. I refer to this matter in particular as it vitally affects those persons who apply for a war veteran&#x2019;s pension. In the past the War Veteran&#x2019;s Pension Act has made provision for a war veteran&#x2019;s pension as such. In 1971 the 1968 Act was amended but in terms of the Schedule both these Acts are now to be repealed. There are a number of war veterans who feel that the term &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; and the award of such a pension signifies recognition of the service they have rendered during time of war. In the definition of a war veteran, in paragraph (xxi), the various wars in which a person must prove to have served before he can apply for a war veteran&#x2019;s pension is mentioned. This definition has been amended fairly recently in that the definition in the 1968 Act was amended by the 1971 Act. As I mentioned aerlier, the 1968 and the 1971 Acts are now to be repealed. Therefore this definition is of considerable importance. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give me some clarity in regard to the extension of the definition whereby a person is able to claim a pension if he is physically or mentally disabled or unable to provide adequately for his maintenance but who is still under the age of 60 years. This is a slight alteration to the previous definition which was provided for by other legislation. According to that legislation a person under the age of 60 could still qualify for a war veteran&#x2019;s pension.</p>

<p>Secondly, under the definition of a &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; a person only has two advantages when he applies for a war veteran&#x2019;s pension. That is, firstly, that he can apply at the age of 60 whereas the age at which a person can apply for an old age pension in the case of a male person is 65 years. Secondly, once a White person is awarded a war veteran&#x2019;s pension he receives an extra R10 per month. The allowance in the case of a Coloured or an Indian war veteran is R5 per month. The advantage of being a war veteran has also lost some significance in that in terms of the regulations which are dealt with later in the Bill, the means test is now on a standard basis whereas in the past a war veteran pensioner who was over 70 years of age or who was a veteran of the 1914-&#x2019;18 war or a veteran of the 1906 Zulu rebellion or was classified as a 1914 protesting burger, received preferential treatment as far as the means test was concerned. So, in terms of this clause there are two aspects that are to the advantage of war veterans. I mentioned this because when one considers the definition of a &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;, one sees that at the end after stating the various wars in which a person might have served, there is a proviso providing that this does not include &#x201C;any person who immediately prior to the commencement of this Act was not a war veteran in terms of any law then in force&#x201D;. I would like to refer to the fact that in terms of previous amending legislation all reference to race was excluded and in terms of the definition that is now before the Committee, it is merely stated that a &#x201C;war veteran means any person&#x201D; without any reference to race. We on this side of the House believe that that is the manner in which it should be dealt with, namely that if a person served during the war years and did full-time service in any of the wars that are specified in this definition of a war veteran, they should all be treated on the same basis, i.e. they should all receive some additional recognition for that war service. Consequently the proviso that is included in this definition, means in effect that one group will remain outside this definition by virtue of the fact that previous legislation in spite of it being repealed in terms of the Bill before us, will still maintain the position whereby a person who is a Bantu will not be able to receive any of the additional benefits that are provided for in this definition of a war veteran, by virtue of the particular proviso. I do ask that the hon. the Deputy Minister in considering this matter should give further consideration to this definition. If it was permissible we on this side of the House would move the deletion of that proviso but I understand that in terms of the rules it is impossible to do so at this stage, because it would extend the scope of the Bill and result in an increase <span class="col_3575-3576" refersTo="page_0341"/>in expenditure. Therefore only the Deputy Minister who is handling the Bill would be able to delete that particular provisio. However, I wish to place on record that this side of the House is convinced that this proviso is not necessary and that it would be possible to proceed with this Bill in spite of the fact mentioned by the Deputy Minister that a number of Bantu persons fall under the Bantu homelands. But in terms of other clauses of the Bill it will, with the administration of the Act, be possible for certain portions of this legislation to be administered and dealt with by other departments. There are Bantu persons who are war veterans, but who are not receiving such a pension and are instead receiving an old-age pension. Here I am referring to the Bantu who come under the laws of the Republic and the legislation that is now before us. So I do hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give further consideration to this matter as we believe that it is unnecessary to continue with this particular proviso, which precludes a section of the community when one should be considering as a whole all members of the community, irrespective of race, who perform war-time service in terms of the definition as it stands specifying in which wars these persons have served. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give further consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the reply to the question whether the various pensions will retain their identities, is yes. They will still remain exactly the same. The definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; remains precisely the same and a person who is medically unfit and under the age of 60 years, will still be able to receive a veteran&#x2019;s pension as at present. As far as the one group referred to by the hon. member is concerned, the hon. member is quite correct in saying that no mention is made of race in this Bill. The hon. member is also correct, however, when he refers to the proviso which reads &#x201C;but does not include any person who, immediately prior to the commencement of this Act, was not a war veteran in terms of any law then in force&#x201D;. In other words, this excludes people who were excluded prior to this legislation and the hon. member is quite correct that there is a group who is perhaps not being excluded. In terms of the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act that group now falls under the homelands. As I also said in my Second Reading speech, anything which I might put into this Act would not apply in a homeland.</p>

<p>There are still a few Bantu outside the homelands who are concerned in this matter, but we do not want to grant them any benefits which may eventually have to be carried by the homelands concerned. For that reason absolutely nothing is being given to them. The hon. member also knows that the total administration of pensions has been handed over to the Department of Bantu Administration by proclamation. I think this answers all the hon. member&#x2019;s questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very sorry but we on this side of the House are simply unable to accept the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s explanation in regard to this definition. We cannot agree with it. Yesterday, in his Second Reading speech, the hon. the Deputy Minister said the same thing he said today, and that is that he cannot place a burden on the department at this stage since it may subsequently have to be carried by the homelands. I think that he is completely mistaken in that approach. Firstly: The Bantu who rendered war service, did not do so for the homelands, but for South Africa. Yesterday the hon. the Deputy Minister said that if he transferred the burden, he would also have to transfer the funds. That is quite correct. These people rendered service to South Africa and they should derive the benefit from that. In that case there would be no difference between the Bantu outside the homelands and those within the homelands; they would both get the same.</p>

Admittedly this definition has always been applied to the Bantu ex-servicemen but the reason for it has never been given before as it was given by the hon. the Deputy Minister yesterday.

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause which deals with the payment of social pensions also deals with the question of additional and supplementary allowances. I particularly would like to refer to paragraph (c) which deals with the position concerning the payment of an attendant&#x2019;s allowance. I should like some further information particularly in regard to blind persons. Paragraph (a) of this clause states that the Minister may pay to aged, blind and disabled persons and war veterants old-age pensions, blind persons&#x2019; pensions, disability pensions and veterans&#x2019; pensions, respectively and in terms of paragraph (c)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">to or on behalf of any person to whom such pension is paid and who has attained an age determined by the Minister for this purpose or is in such a physical or mental condition that he requires regular attendance of any person, an attendant&#x2019;s allowance.</block>

<p>I should like greater clarity from the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to the expression &#x201C;physical or mental condition&#x201D; as a result of which persons require regular attendance, particularly in regard to blind persons. Obviously the interpretation of the physical and mental condition will to a certain extend depend on medical evidence being submitted by a private medical practitioner or by a district surgeon. I should like further information concerning the blind person, because, although it is provided <span class="col_3579-3580" refersTo="page_0343"/>that all categories of social pensioners may qualify for this attendant&#x2019;s allowance, it would appear that there are blind persons who have no other disability apart from that of blindness. In those cases the department has not seen fit to classify these persons as being of a physical condition requiring the attendance of another person so as to qualify for the attendant&#x2019;s allowance as provided for in paragraph (c). A person who qualifies for this allowance receives an extra R10 per month.</p>

<p>I should therefore like the hon. the Deputy Minister to give an indication how this affects the blind person as far as that particular group of social pensioners are concerned. Some of them are not able to live alone and have to have someone to live with them in order to assist them in their everyday needs. The physical disability of these persons is, however, only that of blindness. They do not have any other physical disability. The physical disability is, however, of such a nature that it is often dangerous for these people to live alone. They do require someone to assist them. If they have no members of the family or other means to assist them, it would mean that these people would be precluded from qualifying for the attendant&#x2019;s allowance in view of the interpretation placed on the words &#x201C;physical condition&#x201D;, which means that a person would have to have some other physical disability to qualify for the attendant&#x2019;s allowance. These blind persons invariably have considerable additional expenses which other social pensioners do not have. Some of them require guide dogs and other means to assist them. I do hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give greater detail concerning the definition of &#x201C;physical condition&#x201D; as pertaining to blind pensioners.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position is exactly the same as it was before. Blindness <i>per se</i>&#x2014;as such&#x2014;is not considered to be that type of condition that does entitle a person to an extra amount. In actual fact, it will only be a further disability which will bring him within that category.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the time has come for this definition to be clearly stated. I think it is up to the hon. the Deputy Minister to take it upon himself to alter this clause so that those people who are blind can be given a special allowance for attendance, even if their physical condition, other than their blindness, is normal. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows as well as I do that a man who is blind has to have help to guide him even in his own home. What happens when he goes into the bathroom&#x003F; What happens when he has to eat&#x003F; Who goes to the fridge; who takes the things out of the fridge for him&#x003F; He has to have someone to do these things for him and, as I mentioned to the hon. member for Umbilo, many of these people have guide-dogs. Somebody has to prepare the food for the dog. Who is going to do that&#x003F; A blind person cannot get this done by somebody else free of charge, unless he is living in a home for blind people. If he were living in such a home, I could understand it. I think we have an opportunity now to amend this clause, and I think it is up to the hon. the Deputy Minister to do that as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause brings about a change in the existing position in so far as the various Acts which are now being repealed, are concerned. A person who is not a South African citizen is now able to qualify for a social pension if he has been resident in the Republic for a period of not less than five years immediately preceding the date of his application. Then, Sir, there are further conditions which apply to such a person. He is also entitled to a social pension if he is allowed in terms of any provision of the Aliens Act to be permanently resident in the Republic or if he has been exempted in terms of any such provision from the provisions of section 2(a) of that Act for an unspecified period. I would like some clarity from the hon. the Deputy Minister concerning the actual <span class="col_3581-3582" refersTo="page_0344"/>period required for such a person to qualify, because there appears to be an additional provision that such an applicant must have been given permission to reside permanently in the Republic.</p>

<p>My question to the Deputy Minister is: Is the period of five years which is laid down here reckoned to be a period of five years prior to such a person making his application, or is it reckoned from the time when he was granted permanent residence in the Republic in terms of the Aliens Act&#x003F; I ask this question because the word &#x201C;and&#x201D; in line 30 seems to imply that this is an additional provision to the five-year requirement, and there may be a difference between the time when a person takes up residence in South Africa and the time when he is actually granted permanent residence in terms of the Aliens Act. I should, therefore, like to have some clarity in regard to the actual period of five years which is laid down in this clause.</p>

<p>Secondly, Mr. Chairman, I refer to paragraph (c)(iii) of this clause. This paragraph refers to a person who has entered the Republic from other territories or other countries. This paragraph appears to have a very wide scope. It would appear that the Minister would have to name a specific country or territory in order to exclude the requirement of a residential qualification, as provided for in paragraphs (c)(i) and (c)(ii). In other words, the Minister has to name the specific country or territory concerned before such a person is excluded from the provisions of paragraphs (c)(i) and (ii). I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he has any powers to take into account cases such as the following, which do occur from time to time: For instance, in one particular case an immigrant came into the country accompanied by his aged mother. After a short period of only three years the son of this elderly lady died, and it meant that that aged person was left without any assistance. Yet she would not be able to qualify for a social pension in terms of the legislation now before us, unless the hon. the Minister had specifically named the country that that person had come from as being a country in respect of which persons would be excluded from the other residential qualifications.</p>

<p>From information I received some time ago, it would appear that the Minister and the department restrict this type of concession to persons who have come from Angola, which is mentioned in this clause, as well as from the Congo, Tanzania and Kenya. Therefore, as the clause now stands, it would appear that if a person requires assistance urgently, it would be necessary for the Minister to name his country of origin, unless he has come from one of the countries which has, in terms of the existing position, already been specified. I do hope that there is some administrative way in which this problem can be overcome so that, instead of having to name a territory or country for such a person to obtain assistance, other ways may be found, perhaps in terms of later clauses of this Bill, to help such applicants. I should also like the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us an indication of the number of countries that have been specified already, in other words, in respect of which persons receive special consideration as far as these residential qualifications are concerned.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the first place I want to react to the hon. member&#x2019;s question concerning the period of five years mentioned in paragraph (c)(ii). The period of five years from a person&#x2019;s entry into the Republic need not correspond to the period of five years preceding his application. The Act provides that the period of five years shall be a period dating back from the date of the application. If a person had obtained entry in terms of the Aliens Act within a period of, say, three years prior to that date, he would still qualify for this pension.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Therefore it is the date of arrival which counts&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is the date of arrival. He must have been in the Republic for a period of five years. Actually I cannot imagine that there will be two different periods; I think the two periods will always correspond, but the point is that the Act does not distinguish in this regard. The Act simply provides for a period of five years preceding the date of application. Therefore, if we were to get a case of a person who did not have to make any application or obtain any permit originally, and who subsequently had to obtain a permit, his full period of residence would count, and he would still qualify.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put a question concerning those countries which are specified. <span class="col_3583-3584" refersTo="page_0345"/>The countries which he mentioned are already specified. To my mind this provision is wide enough to allow the Minister a further discretion in the kind of case mentioned by the hon. member. In such a case the Minister would specify the country of origin, as one of the countries to which the conditions contained in paragraph (c)(i) and (ii) did not apply.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It would actually depend on the number of people involved. It would depend on certain factors which the Minister would have to take into account. He would certainly not make an exception for one person, for instance, one coming from Timbuctoo. If, for instance, there were a group of people from a certain place, people who would be affected by this, he would&#x2014;after taking the other factors into consideration&#x2014;probably specify that country of origin as one of the countries referred to in sub-paragraph (iii).</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I would like to say a word or two about clause 4. Earlier during this session we had an opportunity of discussing the question of pensions with the hon. the Deputy Minister. We then raised the question as to whether the public was sufficiently and fully informed as to what the regulations contained with regard to the various formulae and the conditions under which persons are entitled to pensions in terms of our law. It was then said that information is always available and that there are district pension offices all over the country and that any person wishing to know what his rights are merely has to make inquiries at the district office. But I feel that it is of very great importance that the public should constantly be informed what their rights are as far as pensions are concerned. This clause provides that any person who claims a social pension shall apply to a district pension officer, and that the district pension officer shall, after such inquiry as he may consider necessary, and, in the case of any person who applies for a social pension on the ground that he is a disabled person, after such person has been examined by a district surgeon, send the application to the Secretary. But because the question of pensions is of a community nature and affects the lives of 112 000 persons at the moment and will affect more and more as time goes on, and in view of the constant changes in practice, such as were announced here earlier today in the Budget proposals, I think it is important that from time to time, through Press announcements, we should bring home to the public precisely what their rights and privileges are in terms of the Pensions Act. Sir, I think this is relevant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is relevant, but the hon. member should not repeat himself so many times.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I merely wish to emphasize this point, and I do so because on the last occasion this matter was raised, the answer given to us was not encouraging. The Minister&#x2019;s department is aware of the fact that we constantly receive letters from people who, because they have a certain amount of money, believe that they are precluded from applying for a pension. I had a case today where a man who came up to my office said to me that he was receiving a pension and that he has a little cottage which he wants to sell because he and his wife can no longer run the cottage. They are both in receipt of a pension, and the cottage is probably worth about R10 000. In terms of the present formula, the value of the cottage does not come into the picture at all and they both receive their full pension. He now wants to sell the house but he is afraid that if he sells it for, say, R14 000 or R15 000, he and his wife may then lose their pensions. I had to explain the formula to this person and reassure him that there was no danger at all of their losing their pensions; that they could sell the house for about R22 500 to R23 000, and that they would still be entitled to the full pension because of the way in which the formula is applied in assessing the income that they derive from the capital funds that they have in hand. I can show the hon. the Deputy Minister many letters on this aspect. I have had inquiries from numerous people who are completely befuddled as to what their rights are, and I think in the interests of the community, particularly those people who do not have the wherewithal to consult the right people or even, in some cases, to travel to the district pension office, the more information <span class="col_3585-3586" refersTo="page_0346"/>we can disseminate through the Press, in both languages, and even through the secretaries of the old-age homes, the better it would be for all concerned.</p>

<p>Then I want to say this just to re-emphasize my point: A retired medical man, who is working in a part-time capacity in one of the day hospitals in the city and who was present at a meeting where I discussed this question of pensions and the meaning of the formulae, asked me whether I would send him a copy of the regulations. He said that numerous inquiries were addressed to him by people from time to time, and that if he had the regulations it would be so much easier and simpler for him to answer their questions immediately. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will bear that in mind in his discussions with his department, who, I am sure, will be only too happy to help him to find some means to propagate this information on a much wider scale than is the case today.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the hon. member for Jeppes in his appeal to the hon. the Minister. We are dealing now with a Bill which consolidates the measures as far as pensions are concerned. I think it is high time that this was done and I think it is all to the good but at the same time I am sorry the hon. the Minister has not gone further in regard to the application form for pensions, in view of the fact that all applications will now be computerized. As the hon. member for Jeppes has said, when people go to make an application for a pension they go there with the greatest trepidation; it is not easy to complete the forms. You can imagine these people of 66 years of age, some of them suffering from disabilities, having to sit there and wait for a long time and then to start completing the application form. In nine cases out of ten they fill it in wrongly and they have to come back; so they become frustrated. Some time ago the former Minister was kind enough to produce a little illustrated booklet showing who may and how one should apply for a pension. But of course we must appreciate that this booklet becomes out of date because every year, as the result of our efforts on this side of the House, pensions are increased and naturally the booklet so becomes out of date. But I would like to prevail upon the Minister to do something about it. The former member for Kensington, Mr. Moore, pleaded for the streamlining of pensions to try to make the application form a little simpler. You get a pensioner coming along to the pension officer, completely uninformed; the pension officer start asking him questions. They ask him whether he has any money and he says he has some in a building society. He is then told to go home and get the relevant documents. Then off the trundles again, maybe he has to take a taxi to get the building society documents and bring them along. Then they may ask him whether he has any other money and he says that he has some money in the post office, but that he did not bring his post office book along. So these people have to go backwards and forwards and eventually become so frustrated that eventually they go to their members of Parliament. They go to my colleague here, the hon. member for Umbilo, or they come to myself and others and we have to try to explain what the position is. Now the memorandum the hon. the Minister gives us every year is a wonderful help to us because it sets out the position very clearly but it takes a long time to study. If you look at the position the one way, you find that the man qualifies but if you look at it another way, you find that he does not qualify. So what do you do in the end&#x003F; You sit down and write a letter to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and you would expect to get a reply quite promptly but you find that you have to wait two or three months before you get a reply to tell you exactly why the applicant does not qualify. Even the local pension offices quite often disqualify persons and then advise them to apply direct to the Head Office in Pretoria. In regard to this application form, I would like to appeal to the hon. the Minister, in view of the fact that he has this big computer, to see whether he cannot do something about streamlining the application forms. He should also reintroduce the little booklet I mentioned, not because it becomes outdated as the result of our efforts from this side of the House, but to have the basic requirements clearly set out. If a person wants to apply for a pension, he can go to the post office or pension office and get the booklet and knows exactly what to do. It will save the department a lot of work and it will save us a lot of work. Then I am quite certain that the hon member for Jeppes will probably find that these people who are left out, will now be able to apply for pension benefits.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to deal with the first subsection of this clause which stipulates certain requirements which an applicant for a social pension must meet. First of all it will be necessary to apply by means of the prescribed form. In line 44 I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and shall furnish such particulars and information in support of his application as may be prescribed or as the district pension officer may require.</block>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he is satisfied that the district pension officer has sufficient discretion to dispense with the necessity of producing certain documents, because the clause makes it clear that certain information shall be produced. However, as I have mentioned earlier provision is made in respect of &#x201C;such particulars and information &#x2026; as the district pension officer may require&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I mention this point because in many instances there are persons who apply for a social pension and then they are required to produce certain documents and proof of various financial matters. Sometimes they are required to produce a death certificate of a husband who might have died many years previously and they are then unable to do so. They may also have to produce a copy of the will of somebody who died many years previously. They may also be required to produce the terms of a trust fund whereby they are enjoying certain usufruct from such a trust fund. These people have tremendous difficulty in producing such documents. My question to the hon. the Deputy Minister is therefore whether a district pension officer will be sufficiently empowered in terms of this legislation to dispense with the necessity of producing certain documents in terms of the provisions that they shall furnish particulars and information which may be required.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply to the representations made by the hon. members for Jeppes, Salt River and Durban Central first. I quite agree with the hon. members that one should furnish as much information as possible. I have suggested in my Second Reading speech, however, that this is a little easier said than done, because when we issued an information booklet at the time, these people did not understand it anyway. I think one should make it as simple as possible. That is why I said yesterday that as far as I was concerned one should rather make the necessary points of contact available to the aged people so that they may know where they can obtain the necessary information, for example that at such and such an office they can obtain this type of information, and certain other information at another office. It is no use giving them a booklet which they can understand as little as they can understand Greek.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo dealt with what was required by the district pension officer. The requirements are usually determined by regulation. The required information is indicated in the application form which has to be completed. Sometimes, however, other documents are necessary in order to determine whether a person falls within a certain income group. The department may also need other documents to be able to determine a certain aspect. This is communicated orally to the persons concerned, but nothing can be accepted without proper proof to go with it. In fact the department is, as the hon. member has admitted more than once, very considerate in regard to this matter. Just an affidavit would perhaps be necessary and sufficient instead of a document that had got lost, but the department must satisfy itself that the amount it determines for a pension, or the money which allegedly accrues to any person on account of his income, is correct. That is all that is necessary here. I should like to give the hon. member the assurance that the department will, as in the past, also in future do its utmost to help people without becoming excessively dogmatic about it and placing an onus on people which they cannot meet.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened to the hon. the Minister but his reply was not very satisfactory. I do not think that he offered any solution. I know that he is new at this job, but I think that he realizes the difficulties. The hon. member for Germiston has the same difficulties we have, but he does not want to get up and make a speech.</p>

<p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to give consideration to a suggestion of mine. The Department of the Interior with the new system they have with the population register they produce a fine brochure which is attached to the application form for the Book of Life. This brochure is quite good. The alternative is of course to have a facsimile of the application form. I think it does save much trouble and if you read the instructions on the brochure you do not make such a mess of the form. In the absence of handing out a facsimile with every application form you should have a instruction brochure. In doing so you can save the department a lot of time. The hon. the Minister must remember that these people are pensioners. They are 60, 65 years of age or older and cannot go backwards and forwards. Therefore he must assist them wherever possible. His department wants the information and we are trying to help them. They must produce the means of getting the exact information so as not to waste the time of the department. Moreover, it takes months before a person gets the pension. We are only trying to assist the hon. the Minister in his new job. He has come forward with new legislation and I hope he can do something about this proposal.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not know whether other hon. members <span class="col_3591-3592" refersTo="page_0349"/>have seen the effect of the terms of this clause, but it does cause a certain amount of hard feelings and hardship amongst pensioners. Where reference is made to the Secretary in this clause, I take it that it means that the Secretary is allowed to delegate the powers to various other people. According to the terms of this particular clause if a pensioner misuses his social pension, the Secretary may suspend payment thereof in order that it may be administered subject to such conditions as he may determine. It is my experience that that is done from the local office. I take it that the local office can act for the Secretary. The definition of a &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; is not very clear to me, however.</p>

<p>I take it that that is the position and that every suspension of a pension cannot go to the Secretary. What actually happens is that a person may have his pension suspended or it may be decided that the pension should be paid to somebody else so that it is not abused. The trouble is that you sometimes find that these pensions are paid to certain societies attached to church organizations and what is more, the person who administers this pension money is a social welfare officer, sometimes very young and probably inexperienced. I had the case of a person who spent a time in gaol, not as a result of alcohol, but because of certain other troubles and who, when he came out received a substantial pension payment. He then came down to Cape Town, looked for a room and stayed in Sea Point. When he went to re-establish his rights as far as his pension was concerned, he was told that he would have to go to some organization in Wynberg, some eight or nine miles away and apply there for his pension monthly. This organization would administer his pension, because they felt that he would not be able to look after his own affairs. Be that as it may, the social welfare officer in that organization&#x2014; it was not the department itself&#x2014;decided that the room this man was living in was too expensive and that he should get a cheaper room. He therefore had to move out of his room in Sea Point to a cheaper room, notwithstanding the fact that he was entitled to his full pension. But he still had to catch the train and bus to Wynberg every month although he was a cripple. His clothing was very poor and he asked them for money to buy a suit, but they told him that he should get a cheaper suit somewhere else and that they would allow him something like R10 for a new suit.</p>

<p>At that stage, and I think other hon. members have also had similar experiences, the case came to me and I asked this organization what money stood to the credit of this individual. They were not prepared to tell me and they were also not prepared to tell me on what basis they handed out the money every month. Notwithstanding the fact that this man was a pensioner, he was becoming destitute. I admit that there are certain cases where people are alcoholics and this require a certain amount of control, but I think that if money is withheld it should be withheld by the department and not handed out to other organizations or persons. When other organizations handle this money we do not always know what happens to it, what happens to the interest on that money if it is invested, or whether the pensioner can find out at any time how much money is standing to his credit. I think there is merit in this particular clause, but I wonder how often these cases are reviewed and these organizations asked for statements as to how much money they are holding and what is happening to it. Pensioners have no idea of the money standing to their credit because they are not given the information when they try to find out. I was also unable to find out and was told quite plainly that they are not prepared to tell me how much money stood to the credit of this man. I told them that the man needed clothing, but they told me that they went into the matter and that they were of the opinion that he could acquire clothing more cheaply. It was not for them to decide, because it was this man&#x2019;s money. One does not want to say this is an abuse, but I think it can lead to incompetent administration. I do not think those people are competent enough to administer these funds. I think that if moneys are withheld they should be administered directly by the department and not by other organizations.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to tell hon. members that I should like very much to help where I can, and that I should like to explain how the legislation works, but it is terribly difficult when the hon. member for Salt River comes with a case without giving me names and addresses so that we cannot identify the case. I cannot find out whether something has gone wrong and whether the department should intervene. The hon. member for Salt River will probably get <span class="col_3593-3594" refersTo="page_0350"/>annoyed if I do not give him a complete reply to this. But it is simply impossible for me to do so. He should like us to administer the money ourselves when in our opinion it is being abused, as I understand his argument. Let me just tell the hon. member that we are not prepared to do that. The department cannot do it, because it would mean that there would be too many separate administrations of money. When we find out that certain of the pension moneys are abused, we find a responsible person to administer that money on behalf of the aged person or pensioner. I do not by any means blame those people who refused to tell the hon. member for Salt River what was standing to the credit of the pensioner concerned. As a matter of fact, this is proof to me that those people are indeed administering that money well. What the balance of the pensioner&#x2019;s money is, is no concern of other people&#x2019;s. What would you think of a bank manager if I went to him and asked him how much money the hon. member for Salt River had in the bank, and he told me that&#x003F; The example the hon. member for Salt River gave me is to me a perfect example of proper administration of that money. This clause is an exceptionally good clause in the Bill, because it puts the department in a position to retain some control of an aged person or people like that. They are in need of control. They can tell those people: &#x201C;Look, you are an alcoholic,&#x201D; or &#x201C;You are simply unable to handle that money; we are going to give to your daughter to administer it for you&#x201D;, or something to that effect. There are thousands of cases like that, and I do not think the department can reasonably be expected to administer those cases as well.</p>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday during the Second Reading debate I raised a few matters with the hon. the Deputy Minister, but his replies were not adequate in respect of my plea that he should consider appointing also postmasters as district pension officers. His excuse was that it would be an unpractical measure and that the Government could not apply dual control in such instances. To me this is not an excuse because in many instances one department acts as an agent for another department. There are many examples, but I do not want to mention them. Officials of the Department of Justice, for example, often act on behalf of the Department of Bantu Administration as Bantu Affairs Commissioners. I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister should not reject this idea altogether, but that he and his department should go into the matter and consider establishing post offices as information centres and appointing postmasters as district pension officers.</p>

<p>I am very pleased the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to give consideration to the appointment of more than one district pension officer in Johannesburg and not just one who will be in the centre of Johannesburg. But this will cause problems; it will involve additional expenditure for the department. I do not know how many of them he is going to appoint in the peri-urban areas, but this will cause problems. I would just like to request the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to this idea before he rejects it finally.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I said yesterday, one department can sometimes act as an agent for another department. In fact the Department of Posts <span class="col_3595-3596" refersTo="page_0351"/>and Telegraphs acts as an agent on our behalf in regard to the payment of pensions. But if we were to appoint a postmaster as a district pension officer, that would mean that such a person would have to be placed wholly under our control. It would mean that this person would have to know the Act and all the regulations. He would have to fulfil certain obligations in terms of the Act. He would be under the control of his Secretary, as well as under the control of the Secretary of this Department. In the light of this fact it would be a totally impossible position. However, it is a completely different matter when one department acts as an agent for another. This is done simply for the sake of convenience and as an intermediary. I am afraid we cannot give consideration to the hon. member&#x2019;s request.</p>

This concerns an urgent new approach to the publicizing of conditions under which people are eligible for blind or disability pensions.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I take this opportunity of bringing something to the notice of the hon. the Deputy Minister, something which he does not perhaps quite realize. A man who qualifies for a social pension and who is getting more than R58 from another pension cannot get a social pension. I think that is correct. For instance, if a man has an injury and he receives a pension of R59 under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, he does not qualify for a social pension. The same applies to people who work on the mines. The department has had representations about this from time to time, and I think the time has come for the Minister to give consideration to the two separate sets of circumstances. When a man is receiving a sum of money which has only to do with compensation for an accident or for ill-health as a result of his work, I think he should not be disqualified from receiving a social pension, whether <span class="col_3597-3598" refersTo="page_0352"/>he qualifies or not. The fact that he is receiving a pension by way of compensation for injury or ill-health as a result of his work should not disqualify him in respect of the social pension. This has been asked for from time to time, and it has been refused. I think the time has now come for this newly appointed Deputy Minister to give this matter careful consideration; he should see whether the time has not arrived when these people who suffer disability through injury or illness contracted through their work should not be disqualified for a social pension.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall give consideration to all these aspects, but I want to tell the hon. member at this stage that that will be a very difficult matter, because it amounts to abolishing the means test for some people and not for others. This might cause us many problems, and it might give rise to still further problems. It could mean that the people from whom an ordinary civil pensioner receives his pension, might think, &#x201C;My contribution may be low, because this man will in any event receive a social pension&#x201D;. That is the evil we must guard against. Here I am referring to the ordinary pension scheme where the people in charge may think, &#x201C;Let us keep our payments low so that they may remain within the limits of the means test; then our pensioners will receive an additional social pension&#x201D;. That is really one of the reasons why the means test stands at R58. However, I want to say to the hon. member that we shall go into this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to put a question to the hon. the Deputy Minister in this connection. I want to know why a person does not receive a social pension as well if he is in receipt of a civil pension of R59. In other words, if he has an ordinary income of say R60 per month, he has the right to receive a social pension, but if he is in receipt of a civil pension of R59 per month, he is subject to restrictions.

<p>Sir, I do not intend dealing with the whole aspect of the means test, but it is clear from this clause that the means test will be embodied entirely in the regulations promulgated in terms of this clause. Sir, I would like to put a question to the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to what he has just said in reply to the point raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville. The hon. member referred to the income ceiling of R58 per month as a pension from another source, and the hon. the Deputy Minister in his reply said that this was due to the fact that civil pensions are set at a figure of R59 per month. My question to the hon. the Deputy Minister is whether, in view of the announcement in the Budget speech today, the new regulations will take into account the fact that the minimum civil pension is to be increased. I take it that in promulgating the regulations, the department will take due cognizance of the fact that the ceiling is no longer R59 per month, but is to be increased.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate on this measure was adjourned last night, I was saying that South Africa is a much sought-after country. But in the same breath we also want to state that there is no room in this country for the in-infiltrator, that we have no need of him here and that there is no place for the undesirable type of person who enters our country illegally. In that respect I agree with the hon. member for Green Point when he says that in cases of that nature we are an &#x201C;unwelcome host&#x201D;. Sir, our doors are open to the decent, respectable type of immigrant who comes here in good faith and whose intention it is to settle here in South Africa, whether temporarily or permanently.</p>

<p><span class="col_3599-3600" refersTo="page_0353"/>Sir, the provisions of clause 1 of this measure are quite clear and quire simple. There are only three kinds of aliens as laid down in section 4 of the Aliens Act of 1937. The first type comprises those who possess a permanent residence permit in terms of section 5 and then, thirdly, there are those who enjoy exemption in terms of the provisions of section 7 and 7<i>bis.</i> All other aliens are here illegally. Every immigrant and every South African citizen are aware of these provisions. We welcome the concept in this Bill that such an illegal alien may not be harboured in this country. We accept the concept that he may not be employed here, and that if he possesses a temporary residence permit, the limits of his permit may not be exceeded.</p>

<p>But, Sir, like the hon. member for Green Point, I also have something of a problem in regard to the provisions of the proposed new section 5<i>ter</i>(1)(b) concerning entering into an agreement with an alien for the conduct of a business. I should like to refer the hon. the Deputy Minister to the provisions of the Aliens Act, Act No. 1 of 1937, and particularly to section 1 thereof, which provides a clear definition of an allien, i.e. someone who is not a British subject or Union national (Staatsburger) by birth. In this Bill we are apparently only concerned with aliens who are in fact inside our borders and who are exceeding the limits of their residence permits. That is why I am inclined to agree with the hon. member for Green Point that, as I see it, the provisions in this connection are not quite clear, since I do not think our aim is here to try and limit trade or business with aliens abroad, but that we are only concerned here with those aliens who are already inside our borders. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister in a friendly way in case he has not yet come to a firm decision in this respect.</p>

<p>Then I want to say a few words concerning the presumption created in clause 1 of the Bill. In my opinion it is a very reasonable presumption and it is quite easy to discharge the onus of proof. All the citizen or the immigrant has to do, is to satisfy himself in regard to the legality or otherwise of the residence of the alien. This he can ascertain quite easily. It is merely a question of fact; the man resides on the premises or he does not reside there; he harbours the person or he does not harbour the person. I think that a simple explanation, if the facts justify it, can clear this matter up completely.</p>

<p>Sir, then I come to clause 2. This clause in fact provides the Minister with an important and essential right, a right the Minister did not have before. As the Act reads at present, he was unable to replace any exemption issued in terms of the provisions of section 7 and 7<i>bis</i> by a temporary permit unless specific application for it was made by the alien. This very definitely created major problems for the Minister. All he was able to do, was to withdraw the exemption and then deport the alien from the country; no other procedure was available to him. Sir, we accept that this is a very drastic measure because the Minister only had the right to withdraw the exemption and deport the alien from the country. That was a very drastic measure, and I believe that under certain circumstances this could involve a great deal of inconvenience, embarrassment and probably also a great deal of hardship. That is why I want to welcome this measure. This is also to the advantage of the alien as such because it now gives him the opportunity, if anything irregular has occurred, which would otherwise have justified the withdrawal of the temporary residence permit, of rehabilitating himself in cases of offences of a less serious nature. I therefore believe that this measure will be a welcome measure also in this respect and that it will be in favour of the alien.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 3, the penalty provision, we want to endorse this wholeheartedly, and I believe that on account of the large-scale illegal traffic taking place in this connection, the enormous&#x2014;if I may use the English term&#x2014;&#x201C;racket&#x201D; which exists, of people who repeatedly smuggle aliens into the country illegally, because&#x2014; in spite of their being convicted, the light penalty and on account of the financial gain involved&#x2014;it pays these people to keep on with this practice. I am now speaking from experience, particularly the eastern parts of the Transvaal adjoining the Swazi territory and the Portuguese territory of Mozambique, where infiltration takes place which is sometimes difficult to bring to book. For that reason I am in favour of this increased penalty provided for here.</p>

<p>I want to refer to clause 4. This indicates the categories of persons who may be exempted by the hon. the Minister. I believe that this is fully justified for the reasons mentioned by the hon. the Minister. But I also want to say that the position in this <span class="col_3601-3602" refersTo="page_0354"/>country has changed in recent years and that other machinery is now available to us. For example we have the systematic application of our group areas machinery which, as I see it, controls the position efficiently and quite effectively. There is also the easy identification which we have in respect of people, by means of reference documents and other identity documents with which it is quite simple to ascertain the identity of a person. Apart from that, these communities have actually been established permanently and effectively and the movements to and fro are not as fluid as previously. In fact, our traffic is fast and there is so much temporary visiting, and so forth, that I think provision will definitely have to be made for this. Then there is also the more realistic handling of dignitaries to whom exemption may be granted in terms of clause 7. But I want to refer to what was said by the hon. member for Green Point in this connection when he also welcomed the greater flexibility with which this measure will be applied. He said he regarded it as &#x201C;a timid step forward&#x201D;. Sir, I would rather call that R25 he donated to Nusas, &#x201C;a timid step forward&#x201D;. Sir, I regard this as a very wise and essential step in the light of the changed circumstances and the measures which exist at present. But as I see it this is a step which must be approached with great circumspection and I definitely believe that we cannot do it in the overhasty manner pleaded for by the hon. member for Green Point last night. Therefore I believe that unless we want to cause a great deal of disruption, unless we want to find ourselves on the verge of chaos, it is essential that we retain those reservations we still have, and we welcome the thought that as far as the Orange Free State is concerned the <i>status quo</i> will remain and also as far as the position in Northern Natal is concerned, otherwise we could certainly expect a rebellion and a secession from the Republic by these areas within the foreseeable future, if we were to wait in order to safeguard the position. I want to suggest that if we did not embody this reservation in our legislation, this reservation in respect of an illegal influx of Asians into this country, we could and we would have&#x2014;in view of the developments taking place in Africa to the north of us as we see it today&#x2014; shared the same lot as Britain today in this respect. Therefore I think it is a good and wise thing for us to approach these reservations with circumspection and that, if we were to plead for and recommend exemptions, we should do so in a cautious manner.</p>

<p>I want to refer to clause 5 and then I also want to refer to reports which appeared in the newspapers in this connection. I refer to the following report in <i>The Argus</i> of not so long ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The legislation will also allow the Government to deport any naturalized South African or an alien who has been sentenced to imprisonment for offences including &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then they give a list of offences and transgressions and go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any offence under the Immorality Act.</block>

<p>I suggest that this in fact a slanted presentation of the facts, because the amendments proposed in clause 5, are merely a rearrangement. It merely comprises the deletion of subsection (c) of section 43 of Act 59 of 1972 and the transfer thereof, in the form in which it appears now, to schedule 1 of Act 59 of 1972. Apart from affecting the position of a prohibited immigrant, it remains the same in practice, and there is no change whatsoever. The position is in fact that section 43(f) of Act 59 of 1972&#x2014; that is, as the Act exists at present&#x2014;already provides for a naturalized South African citizen to be removed as an undesirable resident if he is found guilty of an offence under the Immorality Act. Therefore I say that it is quite wrong of <i>The Argus</i> or the Press in general to try and create the impression that this is now being done under this legislation. Our present principal Act already provides for that.</p>

<p>It gives me pleasure to support this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Ermelo has expressed on several occasions this evening his agreement with my colleague, the hon. member for Green Point, but there was one omission. As far as clause 4 is concerned the hon. member for Ermelo referred to the timid steps forward&#x2014;a remark made by my hon. colleague. I think in this regard the hon. member for Ermelo has dutifully allied himself with the hon. the Deputy Minister who has taken these timid steps forward in regard to the relaxation of conditions applicable to and permits for travel issued to the Indian population of South <span class="col_3603-3604" refersTo="page_0355"/>Africa. However, I should like to draw the attention of the hon. member for Ermelo to the fact that the South African Indian Council resolved as early as 1964 to request that the fee in connection with permits should be done away with and on several occasions since then, has asked for the removal of restrictions and not the relaxation of restrictions.</p>

<p>In so far as his reference to clause 5 is concerned, he says that the intention is practically the same. I hope to indicate during the course of my speech that there again, while we do not argue with him over the intention of the clause, the scope of the clause has been considerably broadened. Before I do that, I wish to reiterate that we on this side of the House welcome clause 2. Those of us who have had problems concerning people who have applied for permanent residence and whose applications have met with certain difficulties in the Department of Immigration, have found themselves in a very difficult position sometimes due to the fact that there may be a delay or uncertainty or suspense in regard to the issue of a temporary permit. I see that clause 2 does give authority to specific officials to exercise discretion in regard to these temporary permits. I believe it will eliminate difficulties which concern both the Department of Immigration and the Department of the Interior and as such we welcome it.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to clause 4 and here again we have made our attitude clear that we welcome the limited improvement in regard to the inter-provincial movement of Indians. It is an improvement on an archaic system that has been a bone of contention and source of frustration to many of our South African Indians, because when they are met with illness, death or domestic crises, before they can journey from one province to another, they have to get this permit which sometimes involves delay. This may lead to considerable frustration if, for example, the Department of Indian Affairs is closed and they have to make application at a police station. I believe that the hon. the Minister in his reply could indicate to us whether he in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs, and after due consultation with the South African Indian Council, which has made its position quite clear, could not see his way clear ultimately to remove the further restrictions. The hon. the Minister in his Second Reading speech said that the issue of these permits had become an enormous task; he indicated that approximately 25 000 permits were issued during the course of a year. Actually the figures indicate that over the last seven years nearly 161 000 travel permits were issued. This is only half the picture because these figures only reflect those permits issued by the Department of Indian Affairs itself. Other departments entitled to issue permits&#x2014;and I am told that the figures from these departments are not easily available&#x2014;are the Department of Police, magistrates and in some instances the Department of the Interior. Therefore I believe one can say that this figure can easily be doubled and that round about a third of a million permits were issued in the course of seven years. It is an enormous task and I believe one has to highlight the question of fruitless expenditure which has been incurred as a result of the unproductive man-hours. This is a situation which has applied to virtually four State departments.</p>

<p>What is the other side of the coin&#x003F; The other side of the coin is that there has been approximately&#x2014;I must concede that this is an estimate&#x2014;a third of a million Indians who have been involved at various times in making application for a permit. They too have not only suffered frustration but experienced a waste of their time. In many instances it means a loss of income to them. I can refer to a specific case because I had personal association with the applicant. This particular Indian, a professional man of high standing in Durban, had an appointment in Pretoria with the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs. In order to be sure that he could keep the appointment, it was necessary for him to fly to Johannesburg the day before. He stayed quite legally with his friends in an Indian area in Pretoria and subsequently he returned on the day he had the interview with the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs. However, before he could do that he had to go to get a permit from the Department of Indian Affairs and then having returned safely from his interview, he himself was required to take the permit and to surrender it to the Department of Indian Affairs. This particular man is a busy professional man who performs a task for his people under very difficult circumstances, because there are very few of these professional men who are able to render this particular service. One can just imagine the loss of revenue, the inconvenience to his patients and the difficulty he had in catching up with the lost <span class="col_3605-3606" refersTo="page_0356"/>time because of this, what I believe, unnecessary provision.</p>

<p>I want to come to clauses 5 and 6. I appreciate that the restrictions here apply to persons other than South African citizens by birth or descent. I submit&#x2014;as I did originally to the hon. member for Ermelo &#x2014;that I believe the scope has been broadened considerably. I want to make it quite clear again that we on this side of the House have no objection to the inclusion of the new provision in clause 6. However, I feel it is only fair to point out to the hon. the Minister that to my mind there will be greater problems in administration because the scope has been considerably broadened. The old provision only dealt with habit-forming drugs, a relatively small class of drugs with a relatively small use in medical circles and then under strict control, but now the provision in clause 6 of the Bill includes &#x201C;dealing in, selling, supplying or being in possession of any substance from time to time referred to in Part I, II or III of the schedule to the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act, 1971 (Act. No. 41 of 1971)&#x201D;. This means that three schedules of drugs are now concerned. We have the prohibited dependence-producing substances, the dangerous dependence-producing substances which have been referred to as habit-forming drugs and then we have the potentially dangerous dependence-producing substances which are commonly referred to as the potentially harmful drugs. But I would say that whereas before we had a relatively small number of drugs involved we have literally hundreds of drugs involved under these various schedules. The provision in clause 6 refers to the dealing in, selling, supplying or being in possession of any substance and as far as dealing, selling, supplying or being in legal possession is concerned, I believe the situation is amply catered for under the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, mainly in section 65 and 65<i>bis</i> of Act 13 of 1928. But when it comes to illegal possession we find that there are other provisions which now exist in the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act. These are referred to in sections 5, 10 (1) (c) and 10 (4) of that Act, namely Act 41 of 1971. Section 10 (4) is the presumptions section and this section lays down certain conditions under which potentially harmful drugs may be possessed legally by patients. Broadly speaking it lays down that dangerous dependence-producing drugs can be possessed by patients as long as they are not in excess of roughly one month&#x2019;s supply. That is all right as far as it goes, but let us look at the scope of people who are legally entitled to handle, to supply and to be in possession of these drugs. Here I am referring particularly to the third schedule drugs, the potentially harmful drugs. We find that we have laid down in the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act and by subsequent regulation, 16 different categories of persons who are legally entitled under prescribed conditions to be in the possession of these drugs. You have the doctors, the dentists, the chemists and druggists, the veterinarians and certain types of people registered under the Nursing Act. You have certain scientists who are entitled to for purposes of research. You have certain people performing health services, for instance in clinics in out-lying areas. You also have captains of ships and officers in charge of aircraft. Just to give an example of what this could mean, you could have the case of a person taken into custody on the suspicion of being&#x2014;and I realize the type of person involved may not be a South African-born citizen&#x2014;in the possession of potentially harmful drugs. He could have on his person some tablets which had been duly ordered by a veterinarian for administration to his dog, but the presumption would be on this man to prove and to establish that they had been supplied to him in terms of the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act. I believe this is a complicated procedure. I reiterate that we have no objection to this clause, but I do want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether the clause could not be made a little more clear or more specific in so far as the term &#x201C;possession&#x201D; is concerned in view of the fact that illegal and legal possession of drugs is a complex matter with many connotations. I believe it would be of assistance to those who have to administer this Act if it were found possible to clarify the matter in the amendment to this particular clause. I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give this matter his consideration.</p>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Sneaker, the hon. member for Berea dealt chiefly with two matters, one of which is the question of the mobility of the Indian population. I want to suggest that the hon. member for Berea, coming from Natal, is perhaps better <span class="col_3607-3608" refersTo="page_0357"/>equipped than many of us to speak about this subject. I am therefore not going to discuss it with him any further. Those ideas he raised here, which must in fact be given attention, will be given attention by the hon. the Minister. As regards the second subject raised here by the hon. member, i.e. the question of habit-forming drugs, I want to say that as I understand clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill, what is actually being done here in terms of clause 5 is to remove drug offences from section 43 of the Act, and to include them in the Schedule so that action taken in respect of people who commit offences involving habit-forming drugs, may correspond to action taken in respect of persons who commit other offences in terms of Act 59 of 1972. That is how I understand it. I see nothing sinister or complicated in that. It is just that it is removed from one place and inserted in another so that these offenders can be dealt with in the same way as other offenders in terms of the relevant Act, i.e. the Admission of Aliens to South Africa Act. So much for the hon. member for Berea.</p>

<p>This Bill, the Aliens Control Bill, contains, as far as I am concerned, a compliment for South Africa. The fact that, by means of this Bill, we envisage combating this growing problem, in my opinion, embodies the compliment that South Africa, which is accused by Nusas men and other bodies of being a police state, is indeed such an attractive place that we cannot get rid of some of the aliens who come to our coasts. We have heard from the hon. the Minister that there are as many as 80 000 to 90 000 suspected aliens in South Africa whom we cannot get rid of. Apparently they are living here very happily. They are quite satisfied to remain here with us under circumstances of near statelessness without taking part in politics as long as they can just have the protection of law and order here together with the privilege of making a living. Apart from these people, we must also bear in mind that there are probably about a million or more so-called alien Bantu in South Africa who also brave the &#x201C;terrible conditions&#x201D; we have in South Africa to remain with us as guests; as far as we are concerned, they are undesirable guests, because we would like to see them return to their country of origin. That is specifically the object of this legislation, i.e. to make it easier for the authorities to trace these persons, get hold of them and send them back to their original countries of origin. We therefore welcome this legislation which is going to make that easier for the authorities, and we gratefully accept the fact that the hon. Opposition is not opposing this legislation, but is rather joining us in support of it. Its object is to clear up the abuses that have developed over many years, abuses created by people who come to South Africa without permits, and by people who come to South Africa and violate the conditions of the permits they obtained and remain here longer than they are allowed to do. In conjunction with this situation we also frequently find that exploitation of these persons takes place. I am personally aware of the fact that numerous people of this kind, who are in the country illegally, nominate certain agents in South Africa to make representations to the authorities on their behalf so that they may remain in South Africa permanently or can obtain temporary rights here. And thousands of rand are sometimes paid to these agents, or so-called agents, to try to get hold of these so-called permits. From conversations I have had with some of these people, it appears that false documents are sometimes cooked up and given to these aliens, documents whereby they are led to believe that they are now legally in South Africa. It is specifically to combat such abuses that we must pass this legislation today. We are aware of the fact that these people, who are in South Africa illegally, are very frequently employed by a so-called member of the family. He is dealt with very strictly by that member of the family. He is told: Man, if you do not want to work the hours I tell you to work and are not satisfied with the wage I am paying you, I am going to report you to the authorities. The result is that one gets large-scale exploitation of those persons who are in the country illegally. In spite of that, the conditions under which they are living in South Africa, are always still better than those of their countries of origin.</p>

<p>We have our immigration legislation. We set certain standards for those people we would like to bring to South Africa as immigrants. We expect them to have obtained certain educational standards. <i>Inter alia,</i> we expect them to have had at least ten years of formal schooling and to have achieved certain standards. We expect some of them to be professional people who can make a contribution to production in South Africa. We have enough labour in South Africa. We have enough so-called cheap <span class="col_3609-3610" refersTo="page_0358"/>labour in South Africa. It is not necessary for us to import this labour from overseas as well. We want immigrants that can make a contribution to the creation of job opportunities for our Black and Brown people in South Africa. That is why it is unnecessary for us to have to import more labour in the form of unqualified persons who find themselves in our country.</p>

<p>In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to the fact that the general attitude amongst numerous people of this kind&#x2014;and I have also come across this personally&#x2014;is that once one is in South Africa one will, in fact, manage somehow or other. The idea is that if one initially comes as a visitor and makes oneself at home in South Africa, no one will ask one how long one has been here, where one works and what one is doing. Such an attitude apparently comes from certain agents abroad. I have already spoken to many of them and they will tell one that they were given the assurance that once they had come to South Africa as visitors and remained here a while, they would be accepted in South Africa as immigrants. As I understand the position, it is also the policy, and an agreement between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Immigration, that in highly exceptional cases the latter has a look at applications for permanent settlement in South Africa from persons who are here in South Africa on temporary permits. I have frequently found the Department of Immigration telling such a person that it would only consider his application for permanent settlement if he returned to his country of origin. I also welcome this, because it indicates that in this respect we are disciplined and do not want to create the impression that a person can come to South Africa, and once he is here have the right, in next to no time, to remain here permanently. We have our standards that we set. We have our requirements. We know what we want to achieve with our immigration programme. Immigrants must therefore adapt to those standards.</p>

<p>Persons who are here illegally and came here without authorization, or persons who have violated their rights of residence, must in time be found by the police. Then they are told to leave the country. It is a tremendous task. I am aware that the police cannot always lay their hands on these persons. We are also aware of the fact that these people change their address without giving the authorities the proper notification. Under these specific circumstances the police are finding it increasingly more difficult to catch up with these people and to deport them from the country. The result is that we now have this legislation before the House, in terms of which we expect the general public also to make their contribution, admittedly under a degree of coercion, i.e. under such pressure that if they do not make their contribution, they can be prosecuted, and I regard this as an important step forward. I regard this as a step in the direction of co-operation between the authorities and the general public to solve this problem which we in South Africa are faced with. As far as this is concerned, I therefore most certainly want to welcome this legislation.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the remarks which the hon. member for Green Point made yesterday when, at the beginning of his speech, he said we must be careful that we are not hard-handed with guests, or words to that effect. But we are not dealing with guests in this instance. Here we are dealing with unwelcome guests. We are dealing here with two classes in particular. Firstly there are the so-called uninvited guests. If one has uninvited guests at one&#x2019;s home, one very quickly shows them the door. One can perhaps be polite for a while and admit them, but one would very soon send them off. What difference is there now between one&#x2019;s own domestic situation and the national situation&#x003F; We must have the right to send these uninvited persons off, and we also want to do this with the co-operation of the general public. The second group we are dealing with here is the group whose presence here we permit to a certain extent. Those are people who have been invited for a short while, or who have been invited in terms of a certain understanding and under certain conditions, and who then do not want to leave. It reminds me of the story of the man who said to his wife: &#x201C;Dear, let us go to bed; it looks as if the guests want to leave.&#x201D; Here we have the same kind of situation. We must also be able to catch up with those people. Those are people who exceed the bounds of the hospitality we offer them by staying longer than they were initially permitted to stay. This legislation does not affect the so-called exempted individuals in terms of section 7<i>bis.</i> They are our guests; they remain here unrestricted and indefinitely in terms of the exemption they have obtained, and it is only when the <span class="col_3611-3612" refersTo="page_0359"/>exemption is withdrawn in respect of a specific person, or is specifically withdrawn in respect of a class of person, that the hospitality given to them is withdrawn. From the remarks the hon. member for Green Point made here yesterday it seemed as if he were a little unsure of the conditions under which this exempted group, the group which falls under section 7<i>bis,</i> would be able to remain here in South Africa. They are actually not at issue in the discussion of this Bill, and I do not think he was correct to have spoken about that subject, but since he has raised that point, I want to tell him that a large group of these so-called exempted individuals are people from the old Commonwealth countries who can freely come to South Africa. If one looks at the restrictions to which those same Commonwealth countries subject us, as South Africans, these days&#x2014;one thinks of the case of Australia which does not even want to allow our Springbok team across their air space&#x2014;one asks oneself if one should still as freely admit this class of exempted individuals to South Africa. One wonders whether this class of exempted individuals should not be treated like all other Europeans. Sir, I am just asking that question in passing. Why would a person be allowed in South Africa under exemption though he does not quite qualify as an immigrant&#x003F; That is a question one would do well to ask in this connection, because such an exempted person, because he falls within a particular class or group, would perhaps not qualify as an immigrant because he does not comply with certain educational standards or because he has not had certain training, but would nevertheless be able to come to South Africa under exemption.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one aspect I want to deal with in more detail. It is an aspect that was broached by the hon. member for Green Point and also by the hon. member for Ermelo, and it involves the question of the restriction placed upon business transactions with aliens. The hon. member for Green Point had certain doubts yesterday about the relative clause, and at first glance, if one looks at the ordinary meaning of the words as contained in the Bill, I want to say that this legislation does appear to one to be drastic; it looks as if it restricts all transactions with aliens, even Aliens that are not here on our soil but who are abroad. The hon. member for Green Point also mentioned an example of such a person. At first glance, if one looks at this Bill, one gains the impression that that is the meaning of the Bill, and one is encouraged, in this view by the definition of &#x201C;alien&#x201D; as contained in the principal Act, i.e. all who are not South African citizens. In the principal Act an alien is defined as a person who is not a South African citizen, who does not have a permit in terms of section 4 or 5, or who has not been exempted in terms of section 7 or 7<i>bis.</i> Everyone is prohibited from having business dealings with such a person, i.e. any alien abroad who has not yet applied for such privileges. I wish to accept that it was in no way the intention of the Act to restrict or limit such transactions. I wish to accept that this is in no way the intention of this Bill. The intention of this Bill is to get rid of uninvited guests or those who abuse hospitality; that is the intention of this Bill. In the first place, therefore, it affects aliens who find themselves here in South Africa&#x2014; aliens who work here, aliens who live here and aliens who conduct business here. The intention, then, is that this Bill will affect those classes of aliens.</p>

<p>I believe that any other interpretation would lead to an absurdity and that it would invalidate this measure. In the interpretation of an Act there is the general principle, which the hon. member for Green Point and other legal men will know about, the principle of the restrictive interpretation as contained in the legal maxim <i>cum lex plus scripsit minus voluit,</i> in other words, when the Act contains more than the Legislature intended, the intention applies. Well, the intention is also very clear here. The intention of the Legislature is always stronger than the language used, and the intention of the Legislature is merely to affect a certain class of aliens. You will know that there are two concepts in our law according to which legislation is interpreted restrictively. The one is the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule which is not applicable here; the other has to do with the <i>ratio</i> or the <i>intentio</i> of the Legislature. Here we have a specific case where the Legislature has a specific intention, i.e. that only aliens in South Africa will be included and not aliens outside South Africa. Our principles of interpretation are based on the judgment in the case of <i>Venter</i> V. <i>Rex</i> which was given in the Transvaal in 1907. That is a very interesting case, if I may mention it to you. The case there was that the Transvaal Act provided the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3613-3614" refersTo="page_0360"/>Any person entering into this colony after the passing of this ordinance shall be guilty of an offence if he has been convicted elsewhere than in this colony of theft.</block>

<p>That was the case of a Transvaler, a person who was domiciled in the Transvaal, who went to the Free State, committed theft there and then returned to the Transvaal and was prosecuted there because he had &#x201C;entered the Province&#x201D; i.e. returned to the Transvaal province after he had committed an offence elsewhere. In spite of the wording here &#x201C;any person entering&#x201D; the eventual decision on appeal was that it was not the <i>ratio</i> of the Legislature to restrict everyone, and certainly not persons domiciled in the Transvaal, but only to exclude offenders from beyond the Transvaal&#x2019;s borders. And the same kind of <i>ratio</i> would be the restrictive factor in this particular case. But through you, Sir, I want to put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister that there is also another case which could be given profitable scrutiny and that is the case of <i>De Kock</i> v. <i>Resident Magistrate of Caledon</i> (13 SC). In that case an old Cape Act applied, to the effect that where one had more than two attorneys in a town a so-called law agent could not be appointed.</p>

<p>In this specific case there were three attorneys in Caledon and a law agent wanted himself appointed, but the three attorneys were all partners in the same firm. The intention of the Act was clear. The intention was that when one has two opposing attorneys, so that one has two groups of attorneys that could handle the cases of certain parties, one could not admit a law agent. The Judge had to watch this. The Judge saw the <i>ratio</i> but felt himself so tied to the <i>ipsissima verba,</i> the actual words of this specific Act, that he did not want to admit the law agent in spite of the fact that in this specific case <i>ratio</i> should, in actual fact, also have given a restrictive interpretation to the legislation. That is why I am being careful, Sir, and I express my caution to the hon. the Deputy Minister by saying that we should perhaps take another look at the wording of this legislation so that we do not fall into the same trap with respect to its eventual interpretation, as happened in the case of <i>De Kock</i> v. <i>Resident Magistrate of Caledon.</i></p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bellville has treated this House this afternoon to a very erudite speech, a long legal argument, on the question of the interpretation of legislation, and, I cannot presume to match the hon. gentleman when it comes to such an argument.</p>

<p>However, what I can say to the hon. member is that I believe that the judiciary will only look to the intention of the Legislature when the intention of the legislation is not clear. If the intention of the legislation is obscure, then the judiciary will look to the intention of the Legislature. I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with me on that point. I believe that this Bill is quite clear. This is what the hon. member for Ermelo has to say in regard to the argument of the hon. member for Bellville. He says that clause 1 is clear and unambiguous, I am inclined to agree with the hon. member for Ermelo that it is in fact clear and unambiguous. This is the point which was put to the hon. the Deputy Minister by my colleague, the hon. member for Green Point, yesterday when he discussed this measure.</p>

<p>Something else that must be pointed out to the hon. member for Bellville is that he, quite correctly, says aliens come here under conditions which they promptly proceed to break. What he sought in this Bill is an example of co-operation between the authorities and the public. I think something which must be brought pertinently to the notice of the public and which I believe speakers on the other side have failed to do, is exactly what is being imposed upon the public by this measure. This is that we are creating new offences, offences of which the public of South Africa will be found guilty. The Legislature is now saying to every member of the public that they have to help the Government to solve its problem with these, as the hon. member put it, uninvited guests or guests who have outstayed their welcome.</p>

<p>I am not saying it is unfair. The hon. member is very sensitive, I must say. I have not for a moment suggested that it is unfair. All that I am asking is that we must make it quite clear to the public what exactly we are passing here. That is that we are saying to every member of the public in South Africa that if they employ or continue to employ an alien who has outstayed his welcome, they are liable to a fine of R200 or six months <span class="col_3615-3616" refersTo="page_0361"/>in gaol. We are saying further to the public of South Africa, to every South African and everybody else who has permanent residence or is domiciled in the Republic, that if they enter into an agreement with any alien who does not have the necessary permission of the Government to enter into such an agreement with them, they will be liable to a fine of R200 or a maximum sentence of six months&#x2019; imprisonment. We are saying to every person who has a home that if he harbours an alien who has no right either to be in the Republic or to be in that particular area where he is living, he is liable to a fine of R200 or to imprisonment for six months.</p>

<p>Obviously the hon. the Deputy Minister has been listening because he seems to take exception to what I have said. Why does he take exception&#x003F; I cannot understand why he takes exception because I believe that I have put the position quite straight. I hope that this will be brought to the notice of the public and that they will know what the position is, so that there will not be some poor unfortunate individuals who will suddenly be arraigned before our courts because they happen to have committed some of these offences because they are completely unaware of what is taken place in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bellville went further. He dealt with the new subsection 5<i>ter</i>(1)(b). He said that it looked as if it limited all transactions with aliens. He went further and he repeated &#x201C;with all aliens&#x201D;. Then he went on to say &#x201C;but it is not the intention &#x2026;&#x201D;. This is where I want to cross swords with him and say that at this stage it is impossible for us sitting in the Opposition to debate the intention of the Government with this measure. All that we can debate are the words which are written down here. We can only debate what is written in the Bill and I believe, with the hon. member for Ermelo, that what is written here is absolutely clear and unambiguous. I want to deal particularly with this new subsection (b) whereby no person shall&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; enter into an agreement with any such alien for the conduct of any business or conduct any business in cooperation with any such alien;</block>

<p>I do not believe that I have to go into all four categories of aliens that we have in this country, namely those with permanent residence permits, those who have temporary residence permits, those who are distinguished persons and those who are citizens of countries which are exempt from obtaining such permits. The hon. member for Green Point made it quite clear that he believed that if this was tied to the personal involvement of the alien, not only involvement at the time of entering into the agreement, but if it was tied to the personal involvement of the alien and his actual physical conduct of the business which was carried out here in the Republic, we could accept this measure. I believe it even goes further than that. We have the situation where many businessmen from overseas <span class="col_3617-3618" refersTo="page_0362"/>come to this country on a fleeting visit for business purposes and to conduct negotiations with businessmen in this country.

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned a little earlier I was developing on the theme which was introduced by the hon. member for Green Point, who had put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister that in so far as the proposed new section 5<i>ter</i>(1)(b) was concerned, it should be limited to aliens who were in the Republic and who were in actual physical control of the business, who actually conducted the business or would conduct the business in respect of which an agreement was being negotiated. I had put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he had now reached the position that anybody from overseas who wished to come out to this country to negotiate any business deal, if we accepted the provision as it is before us now, would have to report at his point of entry what his interest was, that he intended to negotiate an agreement or a contract with certain South African businessmen and in what particular category. The temporary residence permit of that particular visitor would have to be so endorsed. The South African businessman concerned, before he can begin to negotiate with the person from overseas, would have to ask him to produce his credentials and demand from him sight of his temporary residence permit in which this condition would have to be prescribed. I believe that that is not really what is intended by this legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister tells me that that is what is intended. I am very sorry&#x2014;I almost said horrified&#x2014;to hear that, because I do not believe that is the right attitude we in this country should adopt. Instead of putting impediments in the way of businessmen who come from overseas to negotiate business with us, we should be putting out the red carpet and not asking them to get permits to come here to negotiate with particular individuals or to negotiate a particular alliance.</p>

We support the measure, but not this sort of provision. This is not what we believe the position was from the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister and I want to quote it. I want to quote from his speech and say that this clause is far beyond what he led us to believe when he introduced the measure. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die permit wat &#x2019;n vreemdeling moet h&#x00E9; om hom wettiglik in die Republiek te bevind is of &#x2019;n permanente verblyfpermit, alombekend as &#x2019;n immigrasiepermit wat aan vreemdelinge uitgereik word wie se aansoeke om permanente verblyf in die Republiek deur die Immigrantekeurraad goedgekeur is, &#x00F6;f &#x2019;n tydelike verblyfpermit, bekend as &#x2019;n tydelike permit vir vreemdelinge wat aan vreemdelinge wat die Republiek slegs tydelik besoek, uitgereik word.</block>

<p>Yes, we were talking of a conditional permit, but we did not believe it would be this sort of condition. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, who has control over the entry of aliens into this country, whether he is going to put such notices up at all our points of entry. Is he going to tell people that they must first get this sort of permit before they can enter our country and can negotiate with our industrialists and businessmen in this country&#x003F; I believe that this Government is doing South Africa a great disservice. Only this afternoon we had the hon. the Minister of Finance introducing his Budget in which he is stimulating trade with overseas countries and here is this hon. Minister hamstringing his efforts at the first opportunity. He is not only making it most difficult for our local people to negotiate and trade with overseas persons, but he is making it even more difficult for those persons from overseas to come to this country to trade with us. I repeat that we should be rolling out the red carpet for them, we should be f&#x00EA;ting them and treating them well instead of asking them to get permits, which is what this hon. Minister tells us we must do. I believe we are going to have to reconsider our attitude towards this particular measure. I think I have made my point on that particular clause and I intend leaving that clause to move on to another provision in the Bill, namely clause 4.</p>

<p>A thought has occurred to me: The hon. the Deputy Minister, in a recent exchange with me, indicated that a temporary residence permit would be issued automatically on arrival at, for instance, Jan Smuts airport. I think that is what he intimated. If this is going to be done automatically, why do we want legislation&#x003F; No, Sir, I do not know what the trouble is with the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with the provisions of clause 4. At the beginning of this session we heard with a great fanfare that the movement of Indians within the Republic was going to be made easier, that restrictions on the movement of Indians, were to be removed, or alleviated anyway. Well, the hon. the Deputy Minister passed this off too in his introduction. He did not really tell us what he was going to do. The provision is there that &#x201C;the Minister may exempt any category of persons from the provisions of section 13(1)(a).&#x201D; That is fine, but who or what does he mean by &#x201C;any category of persons&#x201D;&#x003F; He did not tell us. He spoke of football teams. Is he now going to exempt all members of a particular football team or perhaps the supporters of that team&#x003F; What does he mean by &#x201C;category of persons&#x201D;&#x003F; Does he mean he is only <span class="col_3621-3622" refersTo="page_0364"/>going to exempt the Muslims, or perhaps the Hindus&#x003F; He can take his pick; whatever he wants. Is he going to exempt only businessmen and industrialists, or farmers, or perhaps only the males and not the females&#x003F; This provision goes even further than that. I want to say that I believe there are sections of this provision which are absolutely impossible of execution because we suddenly find the double negative in this clause. Having exempted a class of person, the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to exempt one individual from that class of persons from the exemption he has already granted to that class of persons. How does he think he is going to implement this provision&#x003F; How does he think he is ever going to carry it out&#x003F; As I say, I believe it is impossible of execution.</p>

<p>I may be obtuse on occasions&#x2014;I must admit that&#x2014;but there is something I really do not understand. I listened to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech; I have a copy of his Hansard which I have read through again to try to find out about a little amendment in the Bill in clause 5. The proposed new paragraph (d) of section 43 of the Act serves to delete &#x201C;section 52&#x201D; and to substitute it by &#x201C;section 51&#x201D;. I have been wondering what this is all about and why we have the deletion of section 52 and its substitution by section 51. I really can see no reason for this.</p>

<p>Will the hon. the Deputy Minister just repeat that for the record&#x003F; It is what&#x003F; Is it putting right a printing error&#x003F; Now I can understand what this is all about. People could have gone to gaol because of a printing error; people could have been thrown out of the Republic because of a printing error. But I am very glad to find that it has been put right. I am very glad to discover it in this particular way, that is by way of an interjection across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>I have raised various issues and I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister has got to either introduce an amendment at the Committee Stage or else accept an amendment from this side of the House. This will clarify once and for all exactly what is, meant by the proposed section <i>5ter</i>(1)(b). I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister was right when he indicated to me a moment ago what in fact the intention was. The hon. the Deputy Minister must make this quite clear when he replies to the Second Reading debate. We can only at this stage accept what is written here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bellville did raise; the question of the intention of the legislature. Now there seems to be a doubt as to what exactly was the intention of the legislature. What the hon. the Deputy Minister has told us now was not what he told us when he introduced this measure. I believe that we must have clarification on this matter. We are not against the Bill in principle but we would like to hear his explanation on this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#louw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District got up with much gesticulation and said that the principles, as contained in the Bill, are acceptable to him. Immediately thereafter, after he had said that he accepted the principles, he challenged this side of the House to differ with him, ironical as that may seem. If one agrees with someone how on earth can one challenge him to differ with one. Anyone who does a thing like that is bereft of his senses.</p>

<p>In the second place, the hon. member went off the deep end about a printing error, i.e. the figure 52 which should have been 51. The hon. member ought to be ashamed of himself to have said that a responsible Government could throw people out of the country on the basis of a printing error in an Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the proposed section <i>5ter</i>(1)(b) which is now being inserted in Act No. 1 of 1937. He did so on account of a reference to that same section by the hon. member for Green Point and also in following up on what was said by an hon. member on this side of the House, i.e. the hon. member for Ermelo, when referring to the same section. He said he had reservations about the wording of this particular proposed section as printed. This section refers unambiguously to the person who does not have a permit.</p>

<p><span class="col_3623-3624" refersTo="page_0365"/>It is beyond me to understand how he can make such a fuss about a section which is absolutely clear.</p>

<p>I now want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Ermelo. He referred to certain deficiencies which may arise if careful note is taken of the proposed section <i>5ter</i>(1)(b)<i>.</i> Doubt could exist and the impression could be created that this could include actions beyond the intentions of the legislator, particularly if such actions were directly or indirectly linked with companies. A person from this country could for example negotiate with a person from another country to enter into a contract without it being the intention of that alien to commit an offence in accordance with the provisions of this Bill. In so far as this may create any doubt, I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Ermelo and ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, when he has the opportunity to reply to this debate, perhaps to dwell on this clause, to see whether it is necessary to make an adjustment in the wording thereof so as to cover also those possibilities which have been referred to by the hon. member for Ermelo in particular.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the Bill is considered as a whole, one can only come to one irrefutable conclusion, i.e. that it is most certainly of the greatest importance for every people and every country, when it intends establishing sound, proper and positive government, and when it aims to establish a well-ordered society for the citizens of the country, to have immigration laws, and to have laws dealing with the control of aliens which, as far as is practicable, must border on the concept of perfection. It is most definitely not easy to make an Act border on the concept of perfection because, in the nature of things, experience teaches us that the transgressor is always more clever than the legislator. For this reason it is essential for adjustments and amendments to be effected from time to time in order to close such loopholes and adapt the existing legislation to the changed requirements of the times. That is really what this particular Bill is aiming at. This Bill aims at adapting the two Acts affected here, to changed circumstances and to close loopholes which have arisen. For that reason this Bill stresses five particular aspects.</p>

<p>In the first place, inasmuch as the Bill introduces amendments to the Aliens Act, No. 1 of 1937, a new offence is being created in that the wilful employer, the wilful co-business contractor or the wilful host, now commits a crime, as is defined here. This particular Act, No. 1 of 1937, has already covered the whole aspect of the alien as such fully and quite thoroughly by defining in clear unabiguous terms in sections 4 and 5, the offence an alien commits if he is not in possession of a temporary or a permanent residence permit, or if he exceeds the limits and the conditions of such a permit. But now we come to the position of the wilful employer or host or co-business contractor. This is now the new situation, the new offence, which is being defined here. This is an extremely important and essential aspect which is being stressed here. This is very important because it goes much further than merely the superficial creation of an offence. Sir, what is the position in respect of this wilful employer&#x003F; He merely derives financial gain from this position of the alien. The alien himself is guilty of an offence by being here without the necessary permit and by being here as a prohibited person. But this wilful employer derives financial gain from the presence of that alien. He conceals his presence. He has created for himself a source of cheap labour and he makes use of this source. He utilizes it for his own benefit and to the prejudice of others. Often he has assisted in smuggling in this kind of person, or he is associated with a gang of smugglers who conduct a business in bringing into this country persons who are not entitled or authorized to be here. This aspect goes very far, in so far as it involves enormous disadvantages for a country which has to contend with such problems. There are probably hundreds or thousands of aliens inside the borders of this country, aliens who do not comply with the requirements of the Act, and these are people whom we must carry here; these are people who render no positive contribution to the development of this country. These are people who are not at any particular level of development. These are people who are usually either totally or partly unskilled and unqualified. They practice no trade or profession. Sir, it is these people who feed on this country like parasites, and to this is added the employer who in his turn feeds like a parasite on the employee because the employee has his head in the noose, with the result that he, the employer, is able to exploit the position this person is in. Sir, the position of this particular employee who is an alien and who is here illegally, places any government <span class="col_3625-3626" refersTo="page_0366"/>in a tremendously embarrassing position. Subsequently he and a woman are living together and they have children. This thing sprouts wings; this thing takes roots; the position becomes progressively more difficult, and that is why it is of the utmost importance that stress be laid on this particular clause.</p>

<p>Sir, apart from this the Bill goes further by laying down certain provisions in regard to the onus of proof, in that it makes use of presumptions regarding an offence and transfers the onus of proof to the accused, so that he has to prove his innocence. Sir, this practice of reversing the onus of proof may not be a very general one, except where sufficient justification for it exists. If one looks at this Bill and its wording, one sees that the Bill is quite clear in itself, because the Bill states that the alien must be found in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that he has broken the law. All the accused has to do now, is to say exactly what this illegal alien is doing on his premises under circumstances suspected to be in contravention of the provisions of this Act. We cannot stress enough that we are dealing here with a person, an employer, who is collaborating with this alien; we are dealing here with a wilful employer who acts as the one who protects, cares for and hides this alien. This is a situation which must be eradicated entirely, and therefore it is of the utmost importance that this Bill be placed on the Statute Book in the most effective form, and that is why this Bill goes further in the proposed new sections 5<i>ter</i> (7) (a), (b) and (c), where it is made possible and easy to find a person charged with one offence, guilty of the alternative offence where it is obvious that he has committed one of the two offences concerned.</p>

<p>In the second place, Mr. Speaker, in terms of this Bill a further amendment is being effected to the Aliens Act of 1937 by providing for the Minister to issue a temporary residence permit to an alien, even in cases where a stranger has not applied for it and even in those cases where the exemption of the alien concerned from the requirement of being in possession of such a temporary permit, is withdrawn. Sir, it is not necessary to elaborate on this. This is an inevitable result which must necessarily be effected administratively and legally in order to give effect&#x2014;and to give effect unambiguously&#x2014;to the intentions and provisions of section 5<i>bis</i> of the Aliens Act in light of the explanation given by the hon.the Deputy Minister when introducing this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the third place this Bill goes further by laying down more severe penalty provisions. I should like to compliment the hon. the Deputy Minister on the fact that provision is now being made in this Bill for a person found guilty of a second or subsequent offence to be sentenced to both imprisonment and a fine. In the case of the first offence either one or the other sentence may be imposed. Sir, if I may express any criticism in this respect, I want to say that it strikes one that 36 years have elapsed since 1937, when provision was originally made for a fine of R200 (at that time &#x00A3;100) or, alternatively, six months&#x2019; imprisonment. Since then we have had inflation. Inflation cannot ofcourse affect the six months, but it can affect the R200. I feel that if all circumstances are taken into consideration and if the seriousness of the offences which this particular Bill attempts to cover is taken into account, the time has probably arrived now to consider increasing both the fine and the imprisonment. In problems of this kind which penetrate to the heart of a country and its continued existence, I believe that the most severe penalties should be laid down for offences in terms of the Act.</p>

<p>Sir, in the fourth place, in clause 3 of the Bill, by means of the insertion of a new sectionl9A, Asiatics are allowed free movement or greater freedom of movement between the provinces. There is no need to elaborate on this; this goes without saying, and everyone will welcome this amendment. Probably one is being petty to expect that even the Asiatic, in every instance of a quick visit to a friend or relation, should first obtain a permit, and it is an impossible task if the department is to be saddled with the administrative work which is involved in the issuing of thousands and thousands of permits, let alone the time which is lost on interviews and the money and precious time wasted in the issuing of permits of this nature &#x2026;</p>

<p>Because it is in accordance with the policy of this Government and with the decision of this Government as announced last year, and also because it is welcomed by the South African Indian Council, this is most certainly another forward step.</p>

<p><span class="col_3627-3628" refersTo="page_0367"/>In the fifth place, Mr. Speaker, a further adjustment is made in terms of this Bill with regard to the Admission of persons to the Republic Regulation Act, and a new Section is substituted for section 43 of Act 59 of 1972, a new section in terms of which the offences as defined in Schedule 1 to that particular Act are extended. This is necessary because new offences arise from time to time; because offences which previously were not regarded in such a serious light are now, with the development and modernization which has taken place, regarded in a more serious light, and for that reason I want to express my heartfelt thanks to the hon. the Minister for having seen fit to include this serious offence of trading in or being in possession of habit-forming drugs, in this particular Schedule so that a prohibited person, in accordance with section 13 (1) (f) of Act 59 of 1972, may be prohibited from entering or may be expelled from the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I may summarise this measure, then I believe that we are dealing here with a Bill which may be a positive aid, a Bill which is established to exercise the most effective control over aliens within the borders of this country; a Bill which is established in order to prevent aliens, unqualified and in uncontrolled numbers, from settling here in South Africa; a Bill which also aims at preventing the good, sound immigration policy of the Government from being prejudiced. If that is not the case, Mr. Speaker, what purpose would the Immigration Selection Board have&#x003F; What good purpose would it have if conditions were laid down for the admission of aliens over the borders of this country if aliens could settle here without any permission and get away with it easily and easily remain unpunished&#x003F; Sir, it is of the utmost importance that the character, background and integrity of these people be investigated; that it be ascertained whether they are capable of making an economic-industrial labour contribution to the progress of this country; to ascertain whether they have a religious, adaptable disposition; to ascertain whether they take part in communistic political activities. Mr. Speaker, this amendment Bill is an essential positive contribution to prevent the Republic supplementing its numbers with people who do not have the potential to render a useful and positive contribution to the progress of this country and to the development of the phenomenal potential which lies hidden in this country.</p>

<p>In the last place, this Bill is an essential positive contribution to help the Republic so that the person who settles in South Africa, whether temporarily or permanently, can also take his place with honour among the other citizens of his host country with regard to his character, his integrity, his disposition and his outlook on life. With these words I have pleasure in recommending whole-heartedly this Bill as a whole.</p>

<p>Firstly I want to thank the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, very much for the very clear explanation of the Bill. He did not ask me as many questions as some of the other hon. members did, but he did study the Bill and he gave a very clear explanation of it.</p>

<p>I firstly want to refer to the hon. member for Green Point and the questions he put to me the other day. He referred to clause 1 and asked whether the word &#x201C;alien&#x201D; could not be interpreted&#x2014;if I have understood him correctly&#x2014;as being a person who is outside the Republic, thereby implying that people outside the Republic could not do the things laid down in the Bill. That point was mentioned by the hon. member for Ermelo in a very interesting way and it was very clearly stated by the hon. member for Bellville whom I want to thank for the court cases he looked up and submitted to me. I am of the opinion that it cannot be interpreted in any way but that that person is an alien in South Africa. If one looks at the scope of the legislation, and if one realizes that it is territorial in nature&#x2014;its whole nature and scope is territorial&#x2014;and if one realizes that legislation can, in any event, only be applied to people coming under its purview &#x2026;</p>

<p>We are now speaking about interpretation. It can only be an alien who is within the borders of South Africa. I am quite satisfied that according to the interpretation of the courts this Bill, as it stands, will convey exactly what we want from it. But because the hon. members on this side of the House have come along with such interesting references and because I would not like any mistakes in connection with this matter, I have decided to state matters as clearly as possible, and in the Committee Stage I shall introduce a small amendment which will result in the section only being applicable in respect of aliens in the Republic. This is just to make sure that the hon. member does not run to the courts with this matter. [Interjections.] I want to reiterate that in no one way do I concede that hon. members are right. I am just saying that we do not want any uncertainty; therefore I shall do this.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked what the position is in connection with the categories in clause 4. He asked what categories of prohibited persons these are. Sir, the meaning of the word &#x201C;categories&#x201D; is very clear. I can just mention that it could possibly be Indians. It could be Chinese. There are quite a few categories in South Africa. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg-District asked whether the categories could be even more restricted. That is also possible. It can also be Indians or Asiatics of a certain area that are being exempted. It could also be a certain school. It could be categories of persons.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks what one is withdrawing if he is without a permit. The hon. member ought to know, and if he had read this Bill he would have known, and not asked such questions, that that class of persons are a prohibited class of persons In other words, they are automatically prohibited from moving from one province to the other. It has nothing to do with the permit. The hon. member must just not display his ignorance here. [Interjections.] The hon. member may ask as many reasonable questions as he wants to.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also referred to sections 7<i>bis</i>(<i>3</i>) and (13)(1)(a) of the Act and said that the provisions were not stylishly drawn up. I am not prepared to speak about other legal provisions in this debate. I am only prepared to speak about this Bill. I may or may not agree with him about the stylishness of certain other sections in the Act, but that has nothing to do with these clauses, therefore I cannot discuss this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also asked me to say what people are at present exempted under 7<i>bis.</i> These are at present the people from the Commonwealth countries: England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Rhodesia, the old Commonwealth countries. Those are the people who have been exempted under 7<i>bis.</i> I do not know why the hon. member asked this. I did not find it relevant, but I am nevertheless explaining it.

The hon. member also referred to clause 6. I want to tell the hon. member that here he has brought something to my attention which I have not previously given attention to.

The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District <span class="col_3631-3632" refersTo="page_0369"/>launched such an attack on me that I cannot believe he really supports the Bill. He waved his arms and argued, challenged me and carried on, but I think that in the course of my answer I have replied to everything he raised. I think he now knows everything he wanted to know. I should like to invite the hon. member, if there is still something else, to ask me now across the floor. I think, however, that I replied to everything when I replied to the hon. member for Green Point&#x2019;s argument.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As development occurs in almost every sphere today and brings about resultant adjustment of concepts, we find that in the sphere of education as well, development entails that existing arrangements have to be adjusted. In the Act in question&#x2014;the 1963 Act relating to Coloured persons&#x2019; education&#x2014;vocational education is formulated as consisting of commercial vocational education, domestic science vocational education and technical vocational education. The concept of &#x201C;vocational education&#x201D;, however, covers a far wider field, and in order to effect expansion in this field from time to time the definition of &#x201C;vocational education&#x201D; is being adjusted by means of this statutory amendment so as to adjust to the present as well as to future requirements. The Minister is now being empowered, according to the requirements and constantly expanding technical sphere, to declare by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> which fields of study shall be vocational education for the purposes of Act 47 of 1963.</p>

<p>The importance of vocational training for Coloured persons has been realized for a long time. The Executive of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, to whom education for Coloured persons was entrusted by delegation, today controls several institutions at which vocational training is being offered. At present there are technical colleges in Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Kimberley, and there is also the Peninsula Technical College for Advanced Technical Training at Bellville. Recently various bodies have approached the Administration of Coloured Affairs for registration as private vocational schools for Coloureds. At this stage the registration of private vocational schools for Whites is regulated in terms of Act 41 of 1967. The Coloured Persons Education Act, on the other hand, makes no provision for the registration of such schools. In particular, the registration of private vocational schools at a department of education involves the maintenance of standards of education and the protection of the interests of the students. Clause 1(1)(a) of the Bill under discussion will regulate this position.</p>

<p><i>Private Schools</i>: Section 6 of the Act (Act No. 47 of 1963) is consequently being adjusted to emphasize specifically that if education other than the education offered at State schools, State-aided schools, industrial and reform schools and registered correspondence colleges, is provided for reward to Coloured persons, the educational institution in question shall be registered with the Administration of Coloured Affairs. Further protection of a student and of control over the offered academic standards is being effected by causing private <span class="col_3633-3634" refersTo="page_0370"/>schools to be inspected. Ultimately, if circumstances should necessitate this, the Minister will have the power to cancel the registration of a private vocational school.</p>

<p><i>Training Colleges</i>: As was said by way of introduction, adjustments have to be effected in the sphere of education as a result of practical considerations. Aspirant Coloured teachers have been attending training colleges and training schools since education was taken over from the various provincial departments of education. The latter educational institutions provide training only to those who have successfully passed the examination for the eighth standard. Training colleges for Coloured persons, on the other hand, offer teachers&#x2019; training courses for those who have passed the examination for the eighth and tenth standard, as well as for those who wrote the examination for the latter standard but failed to obtain a pass mark. In terms of the definition of training colleges in the Act in question, however, only persons who have passed the examination for the tenth standard are admitted as students. In order to give validity in law to the enrolment of students with lower academic qualifications, the existing definition of training colleges is being adjusted to include these candidates as well. The certificate or diploma which is awarded after completion of a teachers&#x2019; training course, is of course related to the academic qualification upon admission to the college, and comprise, <i>inter alia,</i> the following: The Lower Primary Teachers&#x2019; Certificate, the Intermediate Primary Teachers Certificate, the Lower Primary Teachers&#x2019; Diploma and the Higher Primary Teachers&#x2019; Diploma.</p>

<p><i>Financial assistance for education and training:</i> Like my predecessors I am doing my best to achieve an accelerated training program in the field of post-school training for Coloureds. Over the years financial assistance has been given to Coloured students to enable them to study further. I am thoroughly cognisant of the growing needs for service among their own community. In the immediate future professionally qualified Coloured persons are required in numerous spheres in the service of their own people, not only in their own state machine and educational institutions, but also in the private sector.</p>

<p>For several years bursaries have been awarded, on an extra-statutory basis with the approval of the Treasury, to students attending the University of the Western Cape. At present the Coloured Person Education Act makes no provision for such assistance. The envisaged amendment of section 24 will now make provision for that, and more. Since certain academic fields of study are not yet being offered at the University of the Western Cape, and Coloured students are attending other White institutions to further their studies, the amended section 24 will entail their also being able to acquire bursaries. But the implications extend even further in that Coloured students&#x2014;we have in mind postgraduate students in particular&#x2014;will be able to ask for assistance to continue their studies overseas.</p>

<p>As is clearly apparent from my elucidation of the factors considered in amending the Education Act in question, these new measures will all contribute to the continued expansion of Coloured education. We are dealing here with positive measures through which it will be possible to stimulate the development potential of the Coloured persons further.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, no one in this House can find any fault with the sentiments expressed by the hon. the Minister in the latter part of his speech, namely achieving the continued expansion of Coloured education. Consequently we on this side of the House are prepared to accept the changes the hon. the Minister wishes to make in respect of the definition of vocational education as such. The hon. the Minister is certainly correct when he says that vocational education as a subject is constantly expanding, and that constant new additions to the old definition consequently have to be made. If the Minister will therefore decide himself what the definition of &#x201C;vocational education&#x201D; is, as it is adjusted in future, one can definitely not find fault with that either. In the second place one cannot find any fault either with the statement made by the hon. the Minister in this speech to the effect that they want to render assistance to those student teachers among the Coloureds who previously received what was virtually extra-statutory support as far as their bursaries were concerned and who even received, one could almost say, extra-statutory training because the Act makes provision only for those who have matriculation. It is, after all, general knowledge that there are many Coloured student teachers who are receiving their training after passing only the eighth standard, but who nevertheless go <span class="col_3635-3636" refersTo="page_0371"/>on to render an important service in the interest of the Coloured community. In this respect therefore we cannot object to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech and the introduction of the Bill. But what we on this side of the House are concerned about most is the clause of the Bill to which the Minister gave the least attention, namely clause 2. I am afraid that unless the hon. gentleman is able to give us certain assurances in regard to clause 2, we will not be able to accept the Second Reading. The fact of the matter is that we should like to accept the Second Reading. We realize that the registration of private schools is in the first place absolutely essential. What causes us concern in this clause is that we think that the hon. the Minister is drawing that net too tight. I want to explain this statement to the hon. the Minister. In clause 2 it is provided that no person may provide education at a Coloured school unless that school has been registered. He may not provide such education for reward. I now want to point out to the Minister that Coloured education is today probably the most important factor in providing those people with the necessary education so that they may be a greater asset to society. In the first place there are hundreds of thousands of them attending school today. In the second place there is a tremendous shortage of classroom accommodation for these people. In the third place there is a tremendous shortage of teachers. In the fourth place it is the desire of that hon. Minister and this side of the House, too, that compulsory education in respect of Coloureds be introduced as rapidly as possible. The hope has already been expressed by the member of the Coloured Persons Representative Council charged with education that the introduction of compulsory education could possibly commence at the beginning of 1974. I am merely sketching this background to prove that there is a shortage of teaching staff and a shortage of classroom accommodation, to such an extent that Coloured teachers have to work double shifts. It is very clear to me, in view of the fact that the pass rate among Coloured persons is tremendously low and cannot be compared with that of the Whites at all, that those people will constantly have to receive extramural training. This position we also have among White children today where a young boy or a girl does not do well in a subject like mathematics for example, and that child is then sent to a teacher or other person so that that child may attend special classes and improve his or her achievements in that subject. Now, my question is this: If clause 2, the proposed new section 6, is accepted as it stands here, are we not then excluding the possibility of the teacher giving special classes to those pupils who do in fact need them&#x003F; One cannot expect such a teacher to do this without any form of remuneration. In terms of the original 1963 Act one could in fact begin such a private school on condition that that school did not have more than 14 pupils. If it had more than 14 pupils, that school had to be registered, but if it had less than 14, it was not necessary to do so. That provision is being deleted entirely now. In other words, suppose a teacher gives extramural classes to only one child, am I not entitled to ask the hon. the Minister whether, even under the provision of this Bill, such a person will have to register such a school&#x003F; He may perhaps say: &#x201C;Yes, but it is a teacher,&#x201D; but I want to ask him what the position would be in terms of clause 2 if the person who gives lessons is not a teacher but does have a B. Com. degree and is able to teach commercial subjects such as bookkeeping. As I, and all the hon. members on this side read it, it means that as a result of the lessons which he is giving, he will have to register his class as a private school. If he does not do so, he is breaking the law. Is the hon. the Minister able, in terms of subsection (3) of the proposed new section 6, to take action against such a person&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman is probably entitled to his views, but he can come and state them here in the House. All that we want to know from the hon. the Minister is this: If our interpretation of clause 2 is correct, would the hon. the Minister be prepared to move an amendment during the Committee Stage to exempt that type of tuition from any action against it, and to prevent such teachers having to have themselves registered as a private school&#x003F; Again I want to urge upon the hon. the Minister&#x2014;we have special circumstances under which we are today providing the Coloureds with education&#x2014;the need for us to understand their position. There are thousands of Coloureds who are still not attending school. Soon the policy is going to be one of compulsory education. Does the hon. gentleman have <span class="col_3637-3638" refersTo="page_0372"/>the teachers with whom to achieve this&#x003F; Does he have the classroom accommodation with which to achieve this&#x003F; Is he certain that that education is going to be effective enough&#x003F; If we are certain, particularly in view of the tremendously low pass rate at present, then I say that it is absolutely essential that the door should be kept open, and that the hon. the Minister should not draw the net too tight. We must afford the Coloured child the opportunity of improving himself. That is all we on this side of the House are advocating. We agree with the hon. the Minister that a private school as such should in fact be registered. This is the case with White schools as well. We have no quarrel with that. But it is not completely clear in terms of clause 2 whether all parties who fall into that category will have to have themselves registered as private schools. Now the hon. member for Stellenbosch is saying that surely that is not a private school. If that hon. member were to read the proposed section 6 properly, he would see what the position is. This section provides, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>No person shall &#x2026; provide for reward education to Coloured persons&#x2014;(a) unless such person has been registered with the Department &#x2026; as a private school for Coloured persons &#x2026;</p>

<p>Such a person could be the hon. member for Stellenbosch, or it could be a Coloured person with the necessary training. If he wants to provide education of that nature, he will have to have himself registered. One person could teach or give lessons to five or 50 people, if it were possible for him to do so in his spare time. We on this side of the House are prepared to give those people the opportunity to provide and receive that form of education. But I want to make it clear once again that if the hon. the Minister can give us the assurance that that is not the intention, and that he does not want to go so far but will protect this type of education which I have sketched, so that it may continue, we will support him in the Second Reading. But if he cannot give us that assurance, I am afraid that we will not be able to vote for the Second Reading.</p>

This policy of parallel development of this side of the House entails that we should not begrudge the Coloureds anything, and also that we wish to give them everything which the White child in this country enjoys. We are in earnest about this, and we are being quite sincere in this regard. We shall also, in future, regard this matter as being a very serious one. The amendment of section 1 of Act 47 of 1963, in respect of vocational education, opens up a new field. There is no restriction now. The Minister is now being given the right to supply the <span class="col_3639-3640" refersTo="page_0373"/>needs, as the demand may arise. I know that in 1963 there was the fear in the Opposition ranks that if Coloured education were to be transferred from the provinces to the Department of Coloured Affairs, the standard of education for Coloureds would be lowered. Tonight I am convinced&#x2014;and if the Opposition wants to be honest, they will have to agree with me &#x2014;that precisely the opposite has proved to be true during the past 10 years. This amendment which is before the House tonight, indicates to us that we want to make all those fields of development available to the Coloured child which are available to the children of other population groups in this country. It is true that during the past decade there has been a tremendous amount of study and research in the sphere of education, and that our children are reaping the benefit of this today. We also want Coloured children to reap, and the Coloured population to enjoy, these benefits. The opportunities are there, and I wish to express the hope that the encouragement for these children will also be there. This encouragement cannot come from us; it must come from the parent, and particularly from the teacher.</p>

<p>A new section which makes provision for private schools is now being substituted for section 6 of Act 47 of 1963. Here, too, the Coloured child will now enjoy the same privilege as the White child for example. Because applications were made in this connection, it was found that such a need existed. This new section is now making provision for the registration of private schools that comply with the prescribed requirements and conditions. In addition, it will be possible to hold an inspection at any time, and the Minister will have the right to cancel the registration of a private school if it should appear that the conditions are not being complied with. Now, the hon. member for Newton Park has an objection, which is that if a teacher instructs a child in certain subjects, it will be regarded as a school and will have to be registered as such. I am convinced, Sir, that those of us sitting here who are parents frequently meet that need in our own children. If a child should perhaps not be doing well in a certain subject at school, and the teacher, in the nature of things, does not have the time to devote the necessary individual attention to that child, we arrange for our children to attend extramural classes in that particular subject, and surely that is not a school. I think perhaps the hon. member and the Opposition should first acquaint themselves with the definition of a school. If one reads this clause it is very clear that what is being referred to here is the registration of a private school, and one teacher giving extra lessons to one child in a few subjects, surely cannot be regarded as a school.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that this amending Bill makes provision for registration and that certain requirements and conditions have to be complied with, and also that inspection will be made, for I should like to put it like this: These private schools should under no circumstances become a stumbling block; they should be there to contribute a positive contribution to upliftment and to education. The emphasis should fall on education, and on education only. I am convinced that the Minister will not hesitate to make use of his powers if the contrary should appear to be true. I am saying this because when it comes to education one always has elements which want to utilize education and the school for purposes other than those for which they were really intended. I do not like the name prestige schools, but if these schools are going to serve the Coloured population in this way and if they are going to be geared to education, then we will welcome them. These private schools will also have to set as their goal turning out products which will be able to hold their own in the academic field, and who in their turn will be able to make a very important contribution in respect of their people.</p>

<p>I also think that we should take cognizance of the fact tonight that the establishment and the registration of private schools also has a financial side to it. The financial requirements will of course have to be met. I want to express the hope tonight that these funds will come from well-meaning persons and bodies, for I believe that having a financial grip can be extremely dangerous. But I think, too, that we are with this amending Bill this evening affording the Coloured population an opportunity of coming forward and making the financial contributions in respect of their people.</p>

<p>Section 24 of Act 47 of 1963 is also being substituted, and the new section makes provision for rendering financial assistance for education and training. Here I want to let the emphasis fall, as the amendment also indicates, on the fact that assistance will also be rendered to a student <span class="col_3641-3642" refersTo="page_0374"/>of a university college or a university. Frequent mention is made of a ceiling above our Coloureds, a ceiling which they come up against. With that is meant that there are no real opportunities for these people. I am not much interested in this statement, for I am convinced that no people may speak of a platform if their academic field still lies fallow. Now, I do not want to allege with this, that this is the case with the Coloureds, but I do want to put it like this: The level of development of a people is measured by its academic achievements, for surely these are basic to all achievements, progress and development. I believe that in respect of the Coloured population a tremendous amount still has to be done in this field, the academic field. Therefore we welcome the fact that this clause makes provision for financial assistance to students. It is true that one cannot agitate for academic qualifications. If you do not have them, there is no one you can hold responsible for that. This is something which is only achieved&#x2014; we are all aware of this&#x2014;by hard, strenuous and sustained labour.</p>

<p>However, one is aware of the fact that it costs a considerable amount today to acquire that academic tuition and achievement. For that reason we are grateful that provision is being made in this Bill for those young people of the Coloured population. I am convinced, and this I believe with all my heart, that among our Coloured people, as among all other peoples in this world, there are young men and women who are endowed with very good minds. I want to reiterate that they should be encouraged to make the correct use of what has been placed at their disposal. The facilities are all there. I believe that if the correct use is made of these, and if this is done in future, it will not be possible for anyone to be frustrated. The hon. the Minister also said that these bursaries would make provision for post-graduate study. I hope and believe tonight that there will be many young men and women from among the ranks of our Coloured persons who will come forward and avail themselves of these opportunities, who will not allow themselves to be influenced, who will not allow themselves to be led astray, but who will allow themselves to be geared to acquiring these academic qualifications, and who will also go on to do post-graduate study. For that reason we on this side of the House wish to give this amendment Bill our wholehearted support. I believe, as I have already said, that this is a step forward. I believe that it will lead on to even greater things in Coloured education. It simply indicates so clearly again tonight&#x2014;I recently read the debate conducted in this House in 1963 in respect of Coloured education&#x2014; that the Opposition was wrong at the time and that they are wrong again tonight in what their spokesman, the hon. member for Newton Park, said.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Oudtshoorn should not take it amiss of me if I do not dwell on his speech at length. I think that in the first place it reminded me a great deal of a second maiden speech. In the second place, the speech by the hon. member has simply revealed in effect the typical attitude we find, with the average hon. member on that side when the Coloureds are discussed, an attitude of &#x201C;we do not really know where we are going; we let things take their own course; we give with the one hand and take away with the other, but we may as well call it parallel development&#x201D;. For that reason I should rather identify myself with the speech made by the hon. member for Newton Park, and I want to tell the hon. the Minister at once that we on this side of the House are prepared to support the Second Reading provided that the hon. the Minister can convince us that all these clauses seek to promote education. Sir, we are dealing here with an amending Bill on education, and in order to qualify as such each of its clauses must promote education. Now we are saddled with the problem, especially in view of the insufficient light shed by the hon. the Minister on the various clauses, that in respect of certain clauses there can be no doubt&#x2014;i.e. they do promote education&#x2014;but in respect of other clauses and possibly in respect of parts of other clauses, it is questionable whether they really promote education.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I give you an example. As regards clause 3, we have no doubt; it does promote education. When we look at clause 3, it is particularly interesting to find that the hon. the Minister took as the basis for the amendments contained in clause 3 the legislation relating to education for Coloureds and for Coloured races in South-West Africa, which we passed here last year. In the case of the legislation relating to education for the Coloureds, for the Basters of Rehoboth and for the Nama in South-West Africa it was, for instance, possible for the hon. the Minister to grant <span class="col_3643-3644" refersTo="page_0375"/>financial assistance not only to pupils, but also to students. The Minister is now effecting amendments in clause 3 in terms of which financial assistance may also be granted to Coloured students. But, actually, he went further than that; he also extended it to another type of Coloured person, and that is the type of Coloured person who is neither a student nor a pupil but a person who nevertheless requires certain training. The hon. the Minister is prepared to grant financial assistance to them as well. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that it is a good thing that these benefits being enjoyed in South-West Africa have been transferred to the Coloureds of the Republic and that he has even extended them. But, Sir, when we come to clause 2, it is very difficult for us to support it unconditionally. We have no objection to the principle that a private school must be registered. Nor do we have any objection to the principle that the hon. the Minister must have the right to cancel that registration, but the way in which the hon. the Minister wants to apply the principle in the first place, is something we find alarming, to say the least of it. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if he wants to avoid confusion, it will be imperative for him to take another look at this specific clause at the Committee Stage. As this clause reads at present, there is no doubt that an individual is prevented by this clause from providing education to another individual unless this is done, as it is put here, at a State school a State-aided school, a school of industries, a reform school, a correspondence college, or, of course, a registered private school. And what does &#x201C;at&#x201D; mean&#x003F; It has only one meaning, and that is physically in that school. In other words, any person who does so outside, will be guilty of an offence. Such a state of affairs simply will not work in practice. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister to draw comparisons with the other education ordinances we have in South Africa, and I think it is particularly interesting to come back for a moment to the hon. member for Oudtshoorn, who said, <i>inter alia,</i> that we wanted to give the Coloureds everything enjoyed by the White child. I want to prove to him that by way of clause 2 we shall be taking away from the Coloureds privileges enjoyed by White pupils and White teachers. What would the hon. member say to that&#x003F; His reply would of course be, &#x201C;Oh well, all of this is simply parallel development.&#x201D; But I am not so convinced of that. The hon. the Minister must understand full well that nowhere in the principal Act was any prohibition imposed on the provision of education by one individual to another. A prohibition was in fact imposed on a person to manage a school at which more than 14 pupils were enrolled, and that is in section 6 of the principal Act. But here we find that in clause 2 this is stated very clearly: &#x201C;No person shall &#x2026; provide for reward education to Coloured persons &#x2026;&#x201D; In the past this was: &#x201C;No person shall manage any school &#x2026; Now I must ask the hon. the Minister this: is it at all possible for him to give us a guarantee that in terms of this legislation a Coloured teacher will have the right to provide education to a Coloured pupil after hours&#x003F; Does the Minister and all the hon. members opposite expect the Coloureds to accept it to be normal procedure that whilst it is possible for every White teacher in South Africa and for every Nama teacher in South-West Africa, and for the Basters of Rehoboth and the Coloureds in South-West Africa, to give private classes to pupils after hours, with the approval of their principal or the director of education, they will not be allowed to do this in terms of this clause&#x003F; They will only be allowed to do this if they are prepared to run the risk of incurring a fine of R500 or 12 months&#x2019; imprisonment, as it is stated in clause 2. Now, is this parallel development&#x003F; This is not even parallel with the Coloureds in South-West Africa, let alone the hon. member&#x2019;s idea that we should give them everything the White child is enjoying. How can the hon. the Minister avoid confusion&#x003F; I want to tell him that the principal Act was much clearer. The principal Act dealt with certain matters, with a person managing a school, and there was a definition of a school; it had to be at least a classroom or building with 14 pupils, but what do we find now&#x003F; We now find a vague concept. Reference is made to the provision of education. From the nature of the case the provision of education is a vague concept, for what is education&#x003F; Education may in fact be the imparting of any form of knowledge by one individual to another. [Interjection.] No, let us look at the definition. What do we find in the principal Act&#x003F; It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Education&#x201D; means any education other than education provided by a university or a university college established by or in terms of any law, and includes vocational education and special education not so provided.</block>

<p><span class="col_3645-3646" refersTo="page_0376"/>Sir, can you think of a wider definition&#x003F; It is so wide that I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister how he is in fact going to bridge over this problem. He appreciates that if he does not put it beyond all doubt, and these are our reasonable conditions &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>But if a person may not provide education to another person, surely we must determine what the definition is. The definition simply means that if one Coloured teacher were to provide for reward education to another person after school, he would find himself in trouble, as I have already mentioned. In respect of clause 2, as it reads at present, we therefore believe that measured in terms of the criterion of promoting education, this does not qualify, for one may go wherever one pleases and one will find that there are hundreds, even thousands of White pupils who are passing the matriculation examination purely as a result of the extra classes they receive after hours. I know the hon. the Chief Whip was a teacher, too, and he knows this is true.</p>

<p>If we were to place this clause on the Statue Book as it reads at present, who would eventually be the losers&#x003F; The losers would be the thousands of Coloured pupils in South Africa.</p>

<p>Now I come to the second aspect, and I want to say once again that in principle we agree with the hon. the Minister that the Minister must have the right to be able to cancel the registration of a private school. In that regard we have no quarrel with him. However, it is very regrettable that if this clause were to be placed on the Statute Book like this, we would have the position that the Minister would be able to cancel the registration of a private school for Coloureds in a harsh manner. I am the first one who will admit that there was a deficiency in the principal Act. The principal Act only made provision for sentences for offenders, but not for the cancellation of the registration of a private school. In terms of this clause the Minister now has certain powers, and I want to quote subsection (3) of the proposed new section 6&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If at any time it appears to the Minister that the conditions referred to in subsection (1)(b) are not being complied with in any particular case, he may direct that the registration &#x2026; be cancelled as from a date determined by him &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now I want to come back to the hon. member for Oudtshoorn, who expressed the wonderful thought that what we are doing to the Whites, we should also do to the Coloureds.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us see what is being done at private schools for Whites in South Africa. We find that in the Transvaal the registration of a private school may also be cancelled, but it may only be cancelled after the Director of Education has set a date to the proprietor of that private school and determined certain conditions which must be complied with. That is the position as far as the Transvaal is concerned. In the Free State the position is neither fish nor flesh, for there the position is that after the Administrator has been satisfied that a building is unsuitable for a private school or that such school is managed in a way which may be detrimental to the physical, intellectual and moral well-being of the pupils attending that school, he may direct the owner of that school by written notice (a) to close the school immediately or (b) to change such building or the way in which the school is managed in the manner and within the period determined in the notice. In other words, there, at least, the owner is still given a change to remedy what is wrong. Now let us take a look at a province such as Natal, which is of course a model province! What do we find in their ordinance&#x003F; I agree that it would be irresponsible for me or any other hon. member to say, &#x201C;Go ahead; establish a private school&#x201D;, <span class="col_3647-3648" refersTo="page_0377"/>whilst one does not have the right to cancel that registration. One must reserve the right to cancel the registration. What procedure is one to follow&#x003F; Let me now read this to hon. members&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before withdrawing the certificate of registration of a private school, the Director shall give the proprietor written notice, setting out in detail his reasons for such proposed withdrawal and his requirements in order to avoid such withdrawal and calling upon the proprietor to comply with such requirements within a reasonable time fixed by the Director and stated in such notice. If the proprietor fails so to comply within the time stated in such notice, but not otherwise the Director may withdraw the certificate of registration.</block>

<p>This is the way we treat our private schools for Whites in South Africa. If we are to follow parallel courses in South Africa on a road leading nowhere, we just want to ask that everybody should at least be treated alike. I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that there are also other reasons which I deplore. As I have said, it is very obvious to me that one of the motives for the introduction of this Bill was actually one which sought to put the edlcation of Coloureds in the Republic on a level with what is being enjoyed by the Coloureds in South-West Africa, the Basters of Rehoboth in South-West Africa and the Nama in South-West Africa. I can accept that the Department is after all responsible for the education of Coloureds in South-West Africa as well as here in South Africa. That is why we find that clause 1 defines the definition of &#x201C;vocational education&#x201D; and puts it on a level with the definition which we find in the three Acts relating to Coloured education in South-West Africa. In other words, the benefits they enjoy there, are also transferred to the Coloureds in the Republic. This is also the case in respect of clause 3 in regard to funds. What is to me a deplorable point, is that while the hon. the Minister had this wonderful opportunity, he did not extend the other benefits enjoyed by those population groups to the Coloureds here in the Republic as well. I can give hon. members a few examples. In terms of the principal Act relating to Coloureds in the Republic and in terms of the Acts relating to Coloureds in South-West Africa, we find that both groups have the right, for instance, to form school committees and to have local school boards. This is a good thing, for the principle in that respect is the one that the parent must have a share in the education of his child. In South-West Africa we find that a school, a hostel or facilities may only be closed after consultation with the local committee. In looking at the principal Act of the Republic, we find that the benefits enjoyed by Coloureds in South-West Africa have not been transferred to the Republic. In addition we find that both Acts do of course define misconduct of which teachers may be guilty. In South-West Africa one may be a member of a political party without being guilty of misconduct, but in the Republic one still has the position that if a Coloured teacher becomes a member of a political party, he is automatically guilty of misconduct.</p>

<p>Order! I have now given the hon. member an opportunity to put his case. Now he must come back to the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come back to the Bill and, to be specific, to clause 1(1)(d), which deals with Coloureds who may receive training after Std. 8. Persons who have passed this standard, may also receive training at training colleges now. The position in the past was that Coloureds could only receive instruction at teachers&#x2019; training colleges on condition that they had passed Std. 10. In other words, they had to have passed Std. 10 before they could receive such training. In the past we had the position that a Coloured person could be trained as a teacher if he had passed Std. 8. However, he could not attend a teachers&#x2019; training college after passing Std. 8, since a training college for Coloureds could only admit people who had passed Std. 10. Persons who had not passed Std. 10, therefore had to receive their training at an institution which was known as a training school. The hon. the Minister is remedying this position now&#x2014;to a certain extent, so I believe, as a result of pressure brought to bear in practice&#x2014;by providing that any person who has passed Std. 8 will in future also be able to attend a training college and qualify as a teacher there.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister that this is another example of clauses which we can support, for it is very clear that the object of the clause is the promotion of the teacher. Then I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that it actually makes one feel sad to think that in South Africa the position in respect of the Coloured teacher is still so poor that we still have to fall back on persons with a Std. 8 certificate and have to give them two years&#x2019; training, which one can in fact only call a &#x201C;glorified matric&#x201D;, and then expect them to be teachers. That just goes to show us that there is a tremendous backlog for us to make up in respect of education. Especially as far as the Coloureds are concerned, this is a case of the sooner we can do so, the better.</p>

<p>I just want to say that in the end we no longer knew where the hon. member stood in regard to this legislation. His leader, the hon. member for Newton Park, did at least make it clear that they were supporting the legislation, except that they wanted elucidation from the hon. the Minister in regard to clause 2. I just want to tell the hon. member for Durban Central that clause 2 does not seek to put the legislation relating to Coloured education on a level with the legislation relating to White education; the only matters dealt with the growing circumstances and needs of Coloured education as the department has to deal with them and as requests are submitted. The position is that in the past <span class="col_3651-3652" refersTo="page_0379"/>application was in fact made for the establishment of private schools for Coloured pupils by Coloureds. For that reason it goes without saying that the hon. the Minister and his department must deal with those requests in a fair, reasonable manner, that they must reply to them, and that in order to give a reasonable reply they must make the necessary statutory provision. We should like hon. members opposite to accept that in this respect the department is acting in all good faith, that it is acknowledging the right of Coloured parents to have also their children taught at private schools, provided that they can afford it, and that by way of this clause the hon. the Minister and his department are making provision not only for the establishment of such schools, but also for proper inspection, proper control and even for the necessary penalties should contraventions occur. On the other hand, if they are convinced that this legislation, as it is, is sound legislation, hon. members need not wait for further explanations; what is written in the legislation, may be accepted by hon. members as being simple Afrikaans or English, depending on the language in which they read it and which they understand better.</p>

<p>I want to point out further that I welcome the fact that by way of this legislation the hon. the Minister is laying a broad foundation for vocational education for Coloureds. It is true that we sometimes gain the impression that the more academic trend does not cater for a large percentage of our Coloured pupils at school because these people do not have such a marked aptitude for academic subjects and are in many cases more practically inclined and have more aptitude for vocational subjects, in which they are often more interested as well. As the demand arises, just as there is a demand in the Western Cape today in regard to the training of Coloureds as, for instance, motor-car mechanics and in many other fields, the hon. the Minister is laying the foundation in clause 1 of this Bill, namely for planning and work in respect of vocational education for Coloureds to take place on a broad basis.</p>

<p>I should like to submit to the consideration of the hon. the Minister that in our whole planning of Coloured education we should take these facts very duly into account. The pass percentage for Std. 8 and especially Std. 10 shows us that a relatively small number of them are capable of attaining the senior certificate standard. We take it that this percentage will in fact increase over the years. What this underlines, however, is that we should not overlook the fact that on the part of the Coloureds there is a very strong need for vocational education. We shall therefore have to start with vocational education at a fairly early stage. We must give our high schools in particular a strong vocational bias so that the Coloureds need not waste years at school while they have no aptitude for or are making no progress in the more academic subjects. But when it is clear to us that they are practically-minded and have a vocational aptitude in a particular field, we should guide and train them in that field. We should as soon as possible prepare as many of them as possible for jobs and occupations. As I have said, the foundation is being laid here, and I want to encourage the hon. the Minister and Parliament to carry on along these lines, and I want to express the hope that in this respect Coloured education will be made as up to date, effective and fruitful as possible.</p>

<p>Then I also want to express a few thoughts in regard to the subsection dealing with training colleges. I remember that while the previous legislation was being dealt with&#x2014;I think it was in connection with the University of the Western Cape&#x2014;the Opposition had grave objections about the fact that more Coloured lecturers were not being appointed. The question was asked why these people were not getting more recognition for the high posts. Now we see what is being done here. Provision is being made here for training colleges and for candidates with a senior certificate. But provision is also made&#x2014;and this is necessary&#x2014; for those persons who wrote the examination but were not successful, as well as for those who have obtained a Std. 8 certificate. That underlines the fact that in spite of the continued growth of Coloured education and the large numbers of pupils at school, there is still a tremendous shortage of teachers. The fact remains that as yet we simply do not have a sufficient number of people who are properly qualified to be trained as teachers. What we should set ourselves as an ideal to be pursued, is that in future prospective teachers should at least have passed a senior certificate examination. But if we were to set that as a requirement today we would be cutting the throat of Coloured education. Then we would simply not have sufficient teacher material at our disposal. Therefore this is <span class="col_3653-3654" refersTo="page_0380"/>an interim provision which is essential. We have now reached a stage of broadening the scope of Coloured education. We are providing education to Coloureds on a primary level at least and therefore to the largest number of pupils possible. This provision is being made in the Bill, and I want to thank the hon. the Minister for it as well as for the fact that those who have a Std. 8 certificate and are interested in the teaching profession, are being afforded an opportunity of making their contribution. That is really necessary. In due course we shall in fact be able to make progress and raise the standards as well.</p>

<p>We also welcome the introduction of bursaries for Coloured students. One finds that from time to time there are intelligent Coloureds who do not have the financial means but ought to be trained. They ought to be afforded the opportunity of attending a training college or university or even to do post-graduate study and research. It is only in this way that we shall in due course train the people who can also be appointed as lecturers, not only at training colleges, but also as professors at the University of the Western Cape. They will also be able to follow other specialized professions. We welcome this legislation and hope that in this way generous support will be given to those Coloureds who really have the talent and display the necessary diligence.</p>

<p>Sir, I am very sorry that hon. members on the Opposition side who participated in this debate, are not present now. However, I notice the hon. member for Newton Park has just returned. Right at the outset I want to quote the following to him from the Educational Services Act, Act No. 41 of 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Registration of private schools by Whites: No person shall, except at a subsidized school or at a university or university college &#x2026; provide for reward vocational education unless such person has been registered by the Administrator in question as a private vocational school.</block>

<p>That is vocational education.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Vocational education is simply being described here in particular, but education is education. This sectiondeals with the registration of private schools. The hon. member has now discovered a single word in the section, but he does not understand the issue. It is clearly stated here: &#x201C;Registration of private schools.&#x201D; I just want to point out to the hon. member that he really did not do his homework well.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The old Act had a deficiency which we now want to rectify, for after the Educational Services Act was passed in 1967 it was decided not to proceed with the establishment of private schools for Coloured education because the need for them did not exist. In time the need did in fact arise. Recently we have been receiving requests for permission to establish private schools. The Administration of Coloured Affairs is already providing extramural education in terms of its policy of expanding Coloured education. Education is being provided after school hours by teachers and others. They are doing so for reward, but under control. When we provide education to Coloureds, do hon. members opposite not also want it to be thoroughly controlled&#x003F; Do they not want us to lay down standards &#x2026;</p>

<p>Only for the Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; to make it possible for us to inspect schools and for our department to have certain rights&#x003F; Sir, without this clause, which is precisely the same as the section in the Educational Act for Whites, we would surely be leaving the door wide open to abuses. Sir, the Administration of Coloured Affairs, which will deal with the administration of this Act, has in recent years followed a policy of expanding provision of vocational schools, which have now expanded to such an extent that we have to make vocational education subject to the Minister&#x2019;s approval so that we may provide an increasing number of services by making available an increasing amount of education. At present we are even making provision for Coloured persons at training colleges who have not passed the tenth standard, but who would like to enter the teaching profession. If those Coloured persons want to make a contribution then we afford them the opportunity of acquiring an intermediate primary <span class="col_3655-3656" refersTo="page_0381"/>teacher&#x2019;s certificate. Sir, surely hon. members opposite do not expect us to have to spell out everything to them. A word to the wise is sufficient. This entire amendment Bill consists of four or five clauses which became necessary as a result of deficiencies which we discovered in the first place in the definitions, etc; in the second place because we have since as long ago as 1964 been training Std. 8 candidates in training colleges, and because we now have to legalize this. After all, there is nothing wrong with bringing the registration system of private schools into line with the registration system as we have it for White schools so that we are able to exercise better control over these schools. We are giving the Minister wider powers here. The hon. member also referred to the number 14. Sir, I cannot see why the number 14 should be included, for in reality we are being granted wider power now. I think that hon. members opposite ought to accept my guarantee that the entire idea behind this amendment Bill is not one of restriction but one of expansion. The object is to create more opportunities and not fewer opportunities. The object is to render financial assistance to these people, where previously this could not lawfully be done. As was described here, we already have the example of another Act. It has already been described in the Educational Services Act, Act No. 41 of 1967. I should like to say thank you very much to hon. members who made contributions to the debate, also to those members who differ with us. I do not know whether they are satisfied with my explanations, but I can keep on explaining the whole night long&#x2014;if a person wants to differ, he will continue to differ.</p>

<p>Will it be possible for a Coloured mathematics teacher to provide education after hours to one of his pupils for reward at the home of the Coloured person, not at the school&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The department has its conditions. I cannot deal with specific cases. Conditions have to be imposed. Of course such a person may charge something, but if he is registered as a teacher, one could also find abuses. He could provide education to five or six Coloured persons, and then it is a money-making concern.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Conditions have to be laid down. After all, I cannot tell you whether he will be allowed to do so or not. There could be something wrong with that person. He could provide education to even one pupil, and it could be a private school.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to prohibit anything which is allowed by the legislation. The entire problem is simply that exceptions have to be made. If a person wants to give a child a few lessons in the evening on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, and he charges something for that, what kind of inspection can there be&#x003F; We are speaking about private schools. After all, we do not go miles out of our way to drag in something here which does not fit into the context we are dealing with here, namely a school, an ordered function within a certain specific building in which one assembles at night, or in the day, and where tuition is given under certain conditions and according to certain standards. We must abide by that. Sir, I think I have explained as well as I am able. I do not think hon. members have any need to be concerned about this matter, that is, if they are sincere in what they said, that they want only the best for Coloured education. I should like to thank the hon. member for Oudtshoorn and the hon. member for Piketberg for their fine and balanced contributions. I also want to thank hon. members opposite for their interest in Coloured education, although we have said a lot which was not really necessary.</p>
