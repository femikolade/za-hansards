<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House have supported this legislation. We supported the Second Reading, and at the Committee Stage yesterday we supported all the clauses except clause 17, which provides for non-liability <span class="col_6313-6314" refersTo="page_0224"/>in respect of publication in the dictionary. After yesterday&#x2019;s thorough discussion we were not convinced by the hon. the Minister of the necessity for this measure. The hon. the Minister had to confess yesterday that at this stage, even after publication of volumes of the dictionary covering the letters &#x201C;A&#x201D; to &#x201C;K&#x201D;, he was still unaware of any publication requiring this protective measure. In respect of this privilege of the dictionary we can only suggest to the Minister that the compilers of this dictionary should address a warning in one way or another&#x2014;perhaps they could do so in brackets after a word&#x2014;to the student of the Afrikaans language and to the public who may consult the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> in respect of any word or proverb which could possibly be used defamatorily. We on this side of the House also support the Third Reading of the Bill, but as an Afrikaans-speaking person who in the Second Reading debate expressed my sentiments in respect of this Bill, and also our support on behalf of this side of the House, I have no choice this morning but to reject certain charges by the hon. member for Rissik with the contempt they deserve. Sir, I have a great deal of respect for that hon. member, because he is a self-confessed &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; in the Nationalist Party; at least he is honest about it, and we accept him as such, but I do not think that the charges the hon. member made in the Second Reading debate are worthy of him. Sir, I would just like to quote, for the sake of the record, what the hon. member said in the Second Reading debate; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After having listened to four speakers of the Opposition, I want to say that I am in no way impressed by the fact that they support this Bill.</block>

<p>Sir, I would like to know whether that is the attitude of all the members on that side of the House. He went on to say, referring to the hon. member for Durban Central and myself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of the two younger members who spoke, I can say that I think they tried to put matters in historically correct perspective, as far as they could, and here and there, like the hon. member for Turffontein, they had to profess verbally that they are Afrikaners&#x2014;I do not know how deeply felt that is.</block>

<p>Sir, I now want to know whether those sentiments are shared by all hon. members on that side of the House.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to tell the House today that I do not support this Bill with the object of impressing anyone. The hon. member need not be impressed by the fact that I support the Bill; I did not ask him to be impressed by it. We on this side of the House do not support this Bill because we want to impress anyone. I need not profess in this House that I am an Afrikaner, because if I look at the definition or the explanation of the word &#x201C;Afrikaner&#x201D; as it appears in this dictionary under discussion here, then I find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Afrikaner is iemand wat Afrikaans is deur afstammeling of geboorte (an Afrikaner is a person who is Afrikaans by descent or birth).</block>

<p>Sir, in this way every Afrikaans-speaking person in South Africa qualifies, whether he sits on this or on that side of the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">d.i., iemand wat tot die Afrikaanssprekende bevolkingsgroep behoort (i.e. a person who is a member of the Afrikaans-speaking population group).</block>

<p>If that hon. member happens to have any suggestion to make, then he had better fill in a card and send it to the compilers of the dictionary so that it may be published <span class="col_6315-6316" refersTo="page_0225"/>in the dictionary that being an Afrikaner Nationalist is a prerequisite for one to qualify as an Afrikaner.</p>

<p>As I have said, the hon. member comes from a good home; he comes from a good U.P. Afrikaner home, and the remarks he made about us on this side of the House are not worthy of him. Sir, I just want to say to the hon. member that neither he nor any Nationalist in this House or outside it, can take away from me my language, Afrikaans, my sentiments in respect of this <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> and this Bill which is before the House at present, and I shall say this when I like and how I like. After all, Sir, Afrikaans or the dictionary of the Afrikaans language does not belong to the Nationalist Party; it belongs to South Africa and to everyone who lives in this country. The sentiments of the hon. members for Orange Grove and Bezuidenhout and their support of the Bill and their congratulations in respect of this Bill on the Afrikaans language, were rejected with contempt by the hon. member for Rissik.</p>

<p>The question is why the hon. member for Rissik does not accept the sound sentiments and the sound approach of these two hon. members in respect of the dictionary.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not consider <span class="col_6317-6318" refersTo="page_0226"/>it to be necessary for me to react to the minor and sometimes petty feuds which have developed between certain hon. members in the course of this debate. [Interjection.] Sir, I just want to say this to that hon. member who is protesting so noisily over there, namely the hon. member for Simonstown: While the debate was in progress, an hon. member opposite asked by way of interjection, &#x201C;What does the Minister say&#x003F;&#x201D; I want to say very emphatically that the hon. member need only read my reply to the second reading debate to find the answer he is looking for. On that occasion I said, and I am prepared to say it at any time, that the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is our common heritage, it is not a heritage for any one section, and I stand by that.</p>

<p>Sir, after all the discussions that have taken place here, the hon. member for Turffontein still does not have clarity on the reason for this clause. I just want to emphasize again that this is a preventive measure. It would be unwise for us&#x2014;having taken cognisance of what had happened in England and Holland to compilers of dictionaries, who, in spite of all their judiciousness and their scientific approach and care, nevertheless landed in court&#x2014;to disregard the possibility of such action being taken and to fail to take precautionary measures to prevent the compilers of our dictionary being exposed to the same dangers. I think that it is unreasonable of the hon. member for Turffontein to expect us to place on the compilers of the dictionary the onus warning the users of the dictionary that they could land in court if they used a particular word or expression. This is a risk which every person must run if he does not guard his speech. I do not think that this is the function of the compiler of the dictionary.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with that, and I would just like to express once again my sincere thanks to hon. members on both sides of the House for the discussion we have had on this very important matter.</p>

<p>Motion agreed to.</p>

<heading>GATHERINGS AND DEMONSTRATIONS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Although it is not expressly laid down in the Bill, the intention of it is to ensure that the deliberations in this Parliament may take place without any disturbance from outside or in the vicinity of the Parliamentary building. As hon. members will notice, only open air gatherings or demonstrations within the defined area are being prohibited and similar assemblies which take place inside halls or buildings are not affected at all.</p>

<p>These measures are no new phenomenon among Western parliamentary institutions. In regard to the British House of Commons, from which we inherited our system, a sessional order is made at the beginning of each session in which certain instructions are issued to the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. In short, these instructions are to the effect that streets leading to the House of Commons shall be kept open and free of obstructions and that no disorder nor disturbance shall be allowed in Westminster Hall while Parliament is in session. The Commissioner in turn then issues, in terms of the provisions of the Metropolitan Police Act, 1839, a sessional order in which he instructs all constables&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That they shall disperse all assemblies or processions of persons causing or likely to cause obstruction or disorder on any day on which Parliament is sitting within the area specified hereunder &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then follow the names of the streets including an area within a radius of one mile from the parliamentary building.</p>

<p>As far as Belgium is concerned, there is legislation which prohibits open air gatherings or demonstrations within a defined area around the parliamentary building. The long title of this Act of 1954 reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Act to prevent and curb violations of the free execution of the sovereign powers conferred in terms of the Constitution.</block>

<p>It will be noticed that this Bill proposes to prohibit certain gatherings and demonstrations irrespective of whether Parliament is in session or not. After proper consultation had taken place, it was decided to have this prohibition apply at all times, principally because of the vulnerability of Parliament <span class="col_6319-6320" refersTo="page_0227"/>and all those employed therein. In addition, Ministers and other hon. members often commence their activities at Parliament weeks before the official opening while some of them stay on here after Parliament has prorogued.</p>

<p>In short, the provisions of the Bill amount to the following: Clause 1 contains the definitions and requires no explanation.</p>

<p>Clause 2: This clause contains the prohibitory provisions relating to certain gatherings and demonstrations. Certain gatherings of a religious or official nature are excluded from the prohibitory provisions and, in addition, the chief magistrate of Cape Town is empowered to grant permission for a gathering or demonstration on application.</p>

<p>Clause 3: This clause defines the offences and penalties.</p>

<p>Clause 4 contains the short title.</p>

<p>The Schedule defines the area in which the prohibition is to apply.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to support this Bill on behalf of the Opposition. I think one speaks here today not as a member of an Opposition party, not as a member of the United Party, but as a member of Parliament, as a parliamentarian. Sir, I would have thought that everyone in this House would be at one on certain principles relating to Parliament. That is, first of all, the right of Parliament, the sovereign body in the country, to deliberate undisturbed; the right to the protection of the buildings of Parliament; the right of members not to be disturbed: going to and from the Houses of Parliament; the right of its members and officers to move freely to and from Parliament&#x2014;an ancient right of Parliament, a right which, in so far as this House is concerned, has existed since 1911. Likewise there is the right of every other person to move unmolested to and from the Houses of Parliament for whatever purposes they have in mind. There is therefore also a responsibility to ensure that this sovereign body will be able to conduct its affairs without interference in the spheres of its undoubted competence.</p>

<p>I do not believe that there is anything sinister in this Bill. It is normal practice that Parliament and the conduct of Parliament&#x2019;s affairs, should be protected, and protected by unusual laws, as they are in other parts of the world. Indeed, the Mother of Parliaments, the House of Commons, goes much further. At the beginning of each session of Parliament a sessional order is made by the House and that order goes much further. It starts like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ordered: That the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis do take care that during the session of Parliament the passages through the streets leading to this House be kept free and open and that no obstruction be permitted to hinder the passage of members to and from this House, and that no disorder be allowed in Westminster Hall during the sittings of Parliament, and that there be no annoyance therein or thereabouts and that the Serjeant-at-Arms attending to the House should communicate this order.</block>

<p>In Brussels, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated, they have a similar provision, but they go much further than they do in respect of Westminster. There they even provide for compulsory sentences for a breach of the provisions of their Act. It is surprising indeed, the only surprise I have about this Bill, that we have not had provisions like this before, especially considering the experience we have had in this country in respect of our Parliament. What have we found&#x003F; We have found a lot of opposition to the provisions of this Bill from outside. We found that the Press has tried to prejudge the issue and has tried to determine beforehand what the attitude of people should be. Let us look at the criticisms and take as an example the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surely a peaceful demonstration outside the railings cannot detract from the dignity of the proceedings within.</block>

<p>We find other newspapers in the Transvaal saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">M.P.&#x2019;s and Senators need to have protests, yes, peaceful protests of course, brought home to them right to their gates.</block>

<p>Sir, what kind of propagation is this: Is it propagation of street democracy&#x003F; And there are many who do propagate street democracy, and they fly into wild hysteria about the right to protest. That very situation which these newspapers wish to bring about, it would seem, is the very situation which is the most undesirable situation <span class="col_6321-6322" refersTo="page_0228"/>which could occur, one which every Parliament in the world, and ours since its inception, has sought to prevent.</p>

<p>We have had wild allegations about the right of protests. There are many ways of protesting, Sir. The most important way of protest is through the ballot-box, a method which is eschewed by those who favour street democracy, who are always speaking for the right of protests in public places. Now, let us get one thing clear. This Bill deals with open-air meetings, and only with open-air meetings, in a defined area around Parliament. It does not affect the right of protests. In terms of this Bill you can go into the City Hall or the Drill Hall and harangue 3 000 people there. You can have your meetings and you can have your protests, but with the exception of the area contained in the schedule to this Bill, with the exception of the St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral steps and perhaps the Hiddingh Hall campus of the university at the top of the Avenue, almost all the other open spaces are in public streets or public places, places to which the public has the right of access. When one talks about the right to protest, I want to say that you have no right to protest in a public place if your protest might interfere with the rights of any single individual. I think it is time that one realized that the public streets are not the place to have public protests, to practise street democracy, if you may interfere with the rights of anyone else. I think it is time that we must appreciate what we are talking about when we talk about the right of protest. Never mind about members of Parliament, but if any single individual, for instance my African messenger boy, going about his lawful business in the public places and streets is interfered with or obstructed by anyone having a demonstration, then his inalienable right to move about public places is affected. Such demonstration should therefore not take place. <i>A fortiori</i> that should apply in respect of the conduct of the proceedings of Parliament.</p>

<p>The area is considered to be large. I am not an expert on security, but I have seldom seen a Parliament which is so exposed as ours is on the Gardens side. Security-wise I cannot see how you can have the line any further away than it is now, namely Long Street.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>You cannot have it any closer, yes. You cannot have it in Queen Victoria Street. The next street is Long Street. One takes it on the other side. You go down Long Street to Strand Street and from Long Street, taking in the Grand Parade, you go to Buitenkant Street. Again, by the same token, Plein Street is far too close if you are considering the security of Parliament. The next big thoroughfare, security-wise, is Buitenkant Street as provided for in the Bill. From Buitenkant Street you take it back to Timoney&#x2019;s garage in Long Street. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I think one should bear in mind that one is dealing with the institution of Parliament and with its members. I know that the hon. member for Houghton is going to object to the Bill, but, of course, I am not surprised. She must object to it. Certain of the newspapers which support her have objected to it and so she must object too.</p>

<p>The attitude of these people, as I have indicated, is irresponsible. It reminds me of Mr. Stanley Baldwin when he was the Leader of the Opposition in Great Britain in 1931.

<p>No street democracy, no pressurizing will persuade us that the principle involved in this Bill is anything but the protection of Parliament, of the institution of Parliament. We stand behind no one in our respect for the individual and his liberties, for law and order and for the proper functioning of the sovereign body of Parliament in the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from><span class="col_6323-6324" refersTo="page_0229"/>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to a number of silly speeches by the hon. member for Durban North in my day, but I must say that this is about the silliest of all. The hon. member has been here for a number of years. I did not know that he was so terrified of entering the precincts of Parliament, that he felt himself so threatened over all these years. I wonder why he had not submitted a plea before now to the Standing Orders Committee or to the Minister to introduce a Bill to make him feel more secure when he comes to Parliament and has to debate the affairs of the State.</p>

<p>Unlike the hon. member for Durban North&#x2014;and I have been here rather longer than he has&#x2014;I have never once felt myself threatened when coming into or leaving Parliament, or while being inside these hallowed walls. I have felt perfectly secure; I have not been suffering from this attack of nerves that has apparently been bothering the hon. member for Durban North for all these years. Sir, even he must admit that if, within the terms of this Bill, it is Parliament itself that one wants to protect, the area that has been defined, is enormously wide; for it includes not only Parliament and its precincts, but the entire city centre of Cape Town, including the city campus of the University of Cape Town.</p>

<p>But let me leave that aside because I have no compunction whatsoever about differing from the hon. shadow Minister of Justice of the United Party. I have found his legal opinion lacking in the past. He has already given incorrect interpretations of the law and I am not worried, therefore, about opposing him now. Certainly I am not worried about opposing the Government in this respect. Let me say that I cannot recollect any disturbances around or about Parliament which have in any way interfered with our work in this House. In fact, when the demonstrations took place last year on the Cathedral steps somebody had to call here and ask me whether I would come round to the Cathedral to see what was happening, so unaware was I and other members in this House that anything was going on outside of it. That is the actual position.</p>

<p>I will ignore your nonsensical interjection. I want to know exactly what it is that has been worrying hon. members in this House. Has it been the handful of Black Sash ladies standing at the foot of the Avenue in peaceful protest, never numbering more than 25 or 30&#x003F; Has it been little old Miss Lee with her placard parading up and down outside Parliament&#x003F; Or has it been the handful of students, perhaps numbering 50, who were in Parliament Street last year and, without any such law being on the Statute Book, were unceremoniously bundled into police vans and taken off to the police station where they were charged with obstructing the messenger boy that the hon. member for Durban North is so concerned about&#x003F; Indeed, they were charged with obstruction and fined under a municipal by-law. There is already on the Statute Book, or certainly in the municipal by-laws, plenty of legislation under which actual obstruction of the streets around Parliament can be prevented. I have no doubt that the police will not hesitate to act, should anybody find himself obstructed in any way, and unable to reach the precincts of Parliament. I do not, as I say, feel this impending danger that other members appear to have felt.</p>

Of course, there are other countries in the world other than Britain and Belgium&#x2014;I notice not one of them has been mentioned&#x2014;which do not have any such protective laws. Even the British law is very different, as I shall show in a moment, from the Bill which we are considering today. But I am quite certain that there are plenty of these laws behind the Iron Curtain that prevent public demonstrations, processions and meetings&#x2014; indoors and outdoors, let me add. So one could find examples other than Britain and Belgium.</p>

<p>But let me turn to the example of Britain. What have been mentioned have been the British Acts of 1817 and of 1839. I would like to point out that there are very considerable differences between these Acts and the Bill we are considering today. What does the Seditious Meetings Act of 1817 say&#x003F; Where does it differ from the Bill that we are considering today&#x003F; First of all, the Seditious Meetings Gatherings Act of 1817 specifies that not more than 50 persons shall gather. In this Bill, if one looks at the definitions clause, one sees that a demonstration or a gathering by one or more persons <span class="col_6325-6326" refersTo="page_0230"/>is prohibited. So, Miss Lee with her placard takes on the same importance as a large gathering. The 25 ladies of the Black Sash take on the same dangerous importance as a gathering. One single person demonstrating takes on the same importance. The British Act lays down &#x201C;more than 50 persons&#x201D;. That in itself is therefore quite a considerable difference. Then the British Act, as the hon. the Deputy Minister pointed out, applies only to the days on which Parliament is actually in session. And indeed it goes further and provides that during session it applies only on the days that Parliament is actually sitting. Therefore, on Saturdays and Sundays the British public are free to exercise their street democracy, as the hon. member for Durban North describes public meetings and they can protest as much as they like in Trafalgar Square, outside Westminster and anywhere they like. And when Parliament is not in session they can protest on any single day of the week. There is therefore a very considerable difference.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that weeks before Parliament meets members are going backwards and forwards about their business and that after Parliament is prorogued members are also around. But what about the intervening months when there is not a member to be seen within miles of Parliament, when the buildings are closed and there is obviously no activity here&#x003F; Even then the entire city area of Cape Town is closed to meetings. On Saturdays and Sundays when one does not find many members of Parliament eagerly rushing to their desks, no meetings are allowed in this enormous area surrounding Parliament.</p>

<p>There are other differences. Under the British Act of 1817 the meetings must actually have the purpose of presenting petitions to Ministers and Members of Parliament. It is very circumscribed indeed. I might say that there is no ban on giving any publicity to such meetings as is contained in clause 3 of this Bill, in terms of which nobody may give any publicity even to the fact that a meeting has been called, that a meeting has been held or anything else to do with a meeting. Severe penalties apply when they do so. There are therefore very considerable differences indeed. I do not believe therefore that the 1817 Act is relevant to this Bill at all. Not at all. And as to the 1839 Act, if one looks at it together with the orders that are issued under it, they deal mainly with obstructing access of members to the House. By no stretch of the imagination can one really construe anything that has happened in the past here, including the Langa march about which I will say something in a moment, as obstructing Members of Parliament in coming to or going from the House. Furthermore, there would be nothing at all to prevent yourself, Mr. Speaker, from issuing instructions to the police to see that the immediate precincts of Parliament are kept clear. I therefore see no necessity for this Bill at all. It goes very much further than the reasons that have been presented to this House so far.</p>

<p>Let me just say a word or two about the Langa meeting. The hon. member who is always so coy about going to the Press, unlike me of course, gave an interview where he pronounced that he thought there was nothing sinister about this Bill. Well, of course, there has been nothing sinister about a lot of other measures which he and his party have supported.</p>

<p>Like what! You were still in your cradle, [Interjections.] Many Acts which have been passed the hon. member found not sinister, such as the detention clauses under the Terrorism Act, the 90-days provision and various other measures. You supported them in principle. [Interjections.] Yes, in principle. [Interjections.] That is an old argument. Just look at Hansard and you will see how you voted on Second Reading. And then there was the Processions Act which the U.P. supported a couple of years ago, I think it was in 1970 or 1971. In connection with this Act the hon. member for Durban North actually told this House that the penalties involved were no worse than the penalties of municipal by-laws. I who am not legally trained was able to discover immediately that the penalties were far greater, that they were in fact those under the Criminal Laws Act of 1953, which includes a whipping, imprisonment and a severe fine.</p>

<p>I am coming back, Sir; as a matter of fact, the penalties of that Act apply here too and I will come back to that in a moment.</p>

<p>But let me deal with Langa. Apart from saying there was nothing sinister in this Bill, <span class="col_6327-6328" refersTo="page_0231"/>the hon. member said also: &#x201C;Remember Langa&#x201D;; remember the Langa march on the De Waal Drive. I remember it, probably very much better than he does and if it had taken all those years from 1960 to 1973, everybody has been terribly asleep about the very great dangers that are threatening us. It has taken them 13 years to do something about the Langa march. Interestingly enough, the Langa march ended short of the area which is being proclaimed sacrosanct in this Bill. The Langa march did not go beyond the magistrate&#x2019;s courts in Caledon Square.</p>

<p>They were not stopped. That is where they went; they went to see the magistrate and that is where they stopped. They were not stopped there; they voluntarily stopped there.</p>

<p>I just want to prove another little point of inaccuracy in what the hon. member had said. What I have been saying is that neither the 1817 nor the 1839 Acts, as far as I am concerned, is relevant to this particular Bill and I may add that it does not seem to me that what happens in Great Britain is apposite in this country. It is not apposite because Great Britain does not have laws on the Statute Book such as we have which give ministerial power to Ministers to detain and to abrogate the rule of law in all sorts of ways. Great Britain has a very much greater respect for the rule of law and for civil liberties than we have displayed over the years. The powers which people are therefore prepared to give to the authorities in Britain are not powers that I would like to give to the authorities in this country. These onslaughts that we have had in this country on basic rights have not been experienced in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The argument has and will no doubt be used that gatherings and demonstrations are not prevented, except within a one mile radius of Parliament. Outdoor meetings only are prohibited. For such meetings, namely those within the one mile radius, permission may be given by the Chief Magistrate. The hon. the Minister Justice did not give me any reply to the question I put to him this morning how many applications for processions had been granted by the Chief Magistrate since the Processions Bill was passed. He said it would involve a great deal of work.</p>

I am prepared to wager that no applications for open air meetings within this one mile radius will be granted by the Chief Magistrate of Cape Town for the same reason that the procession applications are turned down. The Chief Magistrate will consult the police; the police will say that they do not want any of these demonstrations.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that our attitude differs. Members ask why should permission be given for these meetings&#x003F; &#x201C;Why&#x201D;, said the hon. member for Potchefstroom, &#x201C;should they give such permission for meetings&#x003F;&#x201D; My attitude on what our ordinary civil rights are and the attitude of members on both sides of the House, differ very considerably. I have one attitude. I believe that protest meetings, processions, outdoor meetings and indoor meetings, are part and parcel and form an integral part of the process of democracy.</p>

<p>It is an integral part of the process of democracy. The only violence that we had was caused by police baton charges. All those demonstrations were non-violent protests. I may say that what I say has been borne out by the courts of law. During the demonstrations last year throughout South Africa something like 618 people were charged. They were charged under the Riotous Assemblies Act and various other Acts, and only two were found guilty. One was found guilty of addressing a meeting without permission, and all the others were discharged except those who paid fines on admission of guilt in respect of a municipal by-law, for obstructing the traffic. This does not seem to me to be a very dangerous position. And, indeed, what I say is borne out by judges, for whose views, I must say, I have much more respect than the views of hon. counsel in this House. I would like to give the view that was given by Judge Van Zyl, the acting Judge-President of the Cape Provincial Division. When he was summing up in the case against the students last year, those who were charged with infringing the Riotous Assemblies Act, he had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are part of the democratic rights of every citizen of the Republic, and Parliament guards this right jealously.</block>

<p>This is what the learned judge said. He may of course have occasion to change his mind now about Parliament jealously guarding this right, but in those days he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Parliament guards these rights jealously, for they are part of the very foundations upon which Parliament rests. Free assembly &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Free assembly is a most important right, for it is generally only organized public opinion that carries weight, and it is extremely difficult to organize it if there is no right of public assembly.</block>

<p>Which brings me, Sir, to this great business of the ballot-box. Sir, how do you persuade people to change their minds at election time if you do not have the right of great gatherings and assemblies&#x003F; And there is no hall in this country which is large enough to hold the numbers of people that could meet at an outdoor gathering, and everybody knows that that is why these outdoor gatherings are being prohibited.

<p>The learned judge went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All have the right to protest. In fact, we are a protestant country which arose from the children of protest.</block>

<p>Indeed, South Africa, throughout its long history, has known protest, protest by Nationalists against the Smuts r&#x00E9;gime, protests by ladies at the Union Buildings against the war. We are a country of protests, and my point is that we are here insidiously eroding one of the basic rights which this country has always enjoyed. Every time another measure like this is put on the Statute Book, although other rights may be left temporarily untouched, there is a further erosion. And what is more, there is a rise in the level of tolerance of the public generally to this sort of measure. This is what we have forgotten. First there is one measure and then another; firstly, they are there temporarily, and then permanently, on the Statute Book. First no processions are allowed, and now no outdoor meetings in central Cape Town may be held. So it goes on. One can make excuses for this every time by saying that there are exceptional circumstances, and so on, but measures which are often introduced to cope with exceptional circumstances, so often simply become part and parcel of the ordinary law of this land. That is what is happening now, and hon. members are blind if they do not see that this process is going on under their very eyes. Then they sit back and make nonsensical speeches about &#x201C;street democracy&#x201D;, as if every great democracy in the world does not have these enormous gatherings of people protesting against what they do not approve of.</p>

<p>As I have said, all the demonstrations which we have had have in fact been lawful and, as I pointed out earlier, the people <span class="col_6331-6332" refersTo="page_0233"/>who were charged last year were all in fact found not guilty of unlawful protest. So, as far as I am concerned, this is simply another erosion of the rights of the citizens of this country. We have all forgotten those robust days when there were meetings on the City Hall steps in Johannesburg; then those were prohibited. There used to be meetings, labour rallies, and so on, on the Grand Parade in Cape Town; now that is out. That restriction had to be renewed every two years, but now it has become a permanent part of the law. The Grand Parade is included in the radius which is sketched out by this Bill. We have all forgotten about that; we have forgotten about these good old days when South Africans used to be able to gather and protest, and have processions without any difficulties at all.</p>

<p>We hear, of course, the old excuse about law and order. Everybody is, after all, in favour of law and order. But I have said before, and I say again, that having order does not mean justice. There is plenty of order behind the Iron Curtain, but there is very little justice. Especially, having law and order does not mean that ordinary civil rights enjoyed by democracies should be allowed to fall by the wayside. I say that the right of free assembly is a basic right. It is enshrined in the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations. It is part of the European Convention of Human Rights. It is enshrined in the United States Constitution&#x2019;s Bill of Rights. For all these reasons&#x2014;Sir, I have not quite finished, but just in case my time runs out&#x2014;I wish to say that I intend to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to substitute at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Very well, Sir, the famous words of Justice Black will go unquoted in the House of Assembly. I say that we must look to the real reasons underlying this Bill, and the real reasons are to be found, I believe, in the threats which were uttered last year by the Prime Minister and by other Ministers that they intended dealing with student demonstrators. I believe that is the real and basic reason for the introduction of this Bill. This is the Government&#x2019;s way, or one of its ways, of carrying out that threat. It is perhaps also a way of barring peaceful protests on the steps of the Cathedral, without clashing too openly with the church. That may be another reason. Well, I am not about to help the Government to do this; I have no intention of helping the Government. I leave that to the official Opposition; let them do that, though how their actions today conform with article 6 of the noble Declaration of Principles by the Transvaal leader, Mr. Harry Schwarz, is beyond me.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have once again had from the hon. member for Houghton the sort of exhibition of wild generalities and verbal extravaganza that we get from her on every possible occasion when she sees fit to indulge in debate in this House. Sir, in analyzing a little of what she has said here, one must forgive the hon. member for Houghton, since she represents a non-existent party with a non-existent policy, for fishing around in all directions and for indulging in generalities in dealing with matters which come before this House. Today the hon. member&#x2014;and I must respect her longer service in this House than mine&#x2014;has attempted to read into this Bill a vast amount which is non-existent in the terms of the Bill and certainly cannot be consequential upon the application of the Bill. Sir, I want to ask her where in this Bill there is any contradiction of the principle enunciated by our leader in the Transvaal that we stand for the lawful right of assembly and protest. Where is that negatived in this legislation&#x003F; The legislation before us provides machinery whereby we can ensure that demonstrations or processions which take place within this defined area are under some measure of control, because the demonstrators must obtain the permission of the magistrate before these demonstrations can take place. The magistrate would certainly, as a <i>sine qua non</i> to approval, require to be assured that the procession, if it is going to take place, is going to be under some sort of control. Sir, does the hon. member for Houghton want a recurrence of what happened in Wale Street and then in St. George&#x2019;s Street and Longmarket Street last year&#x003F; Is that what she wants&#x003F; Does she want that sort of situation to recur&#x003F; We feel that at least within this prescribed area that sort of situation should not be permitted to occur, and for that purpose there must be a regularization of any procession that takes place. Sir, the hon. member talks of the system in Britain and suggests that it is so vastly different from the position that applies here. The position in Britain is that there is for all time the need to obtain the authority of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to hold any type of demonstration or procession within a mile of Westminster; that is the law, and it is made even more stringent at the beginning of every session of the British House of Commons when the sessional order is issued by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Sir, what is more, in Britain there is a restriction placed on persons wishing to come to the House of Commons even to present a petition. There is nothing in this Bill to stop people from coming to this House legitimately to present a petition to Parliament. No, Sir, the hon. member has utilized or attempted to utilize this situation today to create the impression that we are now passing legislation to prohibit protests, to restrict the right of protest, to restrict freedom of speech. There are no provisions in this Bill to that effect. Surely the hon. member stands for&#x2014;or does she not&#x003F;&#x2014; ordered control of large masses of people who may or may not wish to demonstrate&#x003F; Sir, the hon. member also suggests that every demonstration or protest apparently must be open-air. Sir, there have been many protest meetings held recently&#x2014;even addressed by the hon. member for Houghton &#x2014;which have been held indoors, and the demonstrators or protestors have not filled the hall; there has still been room for other people in the hall. Why they should impede the public and interfere with the ordinary citizens of Cape Town by marching up and down Adderley Street, I do not know, if they are unable to fill a hall for the purpose of their protest.</p>

<p>I see in the Press this morning that the Cape Town City Council wishes to see the hon. the Minister to discuss this matter with him. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not give serious consideration to the question of allowing the City Council to create some place where these people can let off a little bit of steam. In Britain they do it; there they have Hyde Park corner, which has become a tourist attraction. In Britain they also allow Trafalgar Square to be used periodically. I want to suggest as a Capetonian that perhaps in the middle of the unused Golden Acre in Adderley Steet we can have a temporary <span class="col_6335-6336" refersTo="page_0235"/>rostrum erected on which people can go and let off steam and make their protests on any matter which they would like to discuss. There is this position that one must consider, and I want to mention this seriously to the hon. the Minister in the hope that he will consider it. One must always remember that there are certain sections of the community who may wish to demonstrate on a certain matter perfectly legally and in a perfectly orderly manner and to whom the expense of hiring one of the central halls of Cape Town may be a very heavy burden. I think serious consideration should be given to this, and I merely pass the matter on to the Minister for him to give consideration to it, to discuss it with the Executive Committee of the Council whether or not some sort of steam-letting area should be provided somewhere for these people who want to protest. I want to say this to him, and I hope, and in fact I am sure I am speaking for the majority of the citizens of Cape Town, that I do not want him to agree that the Grand Parade and Church Square or other squares of the city should no longer be used for the convenience of citizens for parking but should be kept vacant in case somebody wants to hold a protest meeting there. I hope he will not agree to that. The citizens of Cape Town will not appreciate any steps he takes in that direction.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that none of the provisions of the Bill before us will have any of the effects which the hon. member for Houghton has read into them in the extravagant language she has used in this House.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank hon. members, particularly those on the Opposite side of the House, who participated in the debate for their support, but you will appreciate, Sir, that this is not exclusively a Government measure. I am introducing this measure, but the Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders and the Sessional Committee on Internal Arrangements decided that this measure be brought before this House. For that reason the measure is being introduced by the Government. What we are doing is simply to respect the feelings of the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders and of the Sessional Committee concerned. It is not my intention to sink to the level to which the hon. member for Houghton, in my humble opinion, has sunk by making a speech here which in fact reflects in words what the far-leftists, the new Left, the socialists, are so fond of doing, i.e. to be forever pleading for the rights of a democracy, while their real intention is to destroy that very democracy by making use of those rights. It is therefore clear to me that the hon. member wants this right to exist to allow demonstrations and protests and agitation to take place in the streets of Cape Town so that there can be complete chaos, so that the general public can be antagonized and so that there can be anarchy. When we read what has been written by the far-leftists, the socialist types, you, Sir, will recall that their first rule is to create chaos and anarchy; then you can obtain control; use the democratic institutions and the rights of democracy and in this way you are able to disrupt the bourgeoisie, and in this way the proletariat can achieve victory. Sir, I do not want to deal with all those things in detail, but I just want to tell the hon. member that she is typical of those people. She referred immediately to poor old Gladys Lee. Sir, this Bill is not before this House to deal with Gladys Lee. I want to tell the hon. member that if this poor old soul feels like demonstrating, I shall request the Police not to take any notice of what the poor old aunty is doing there. But this Bill has nothing to do with that. It concerns this, i.e. that the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders and the Sessional Committee concerned thought it fit to maintain the dignity of Parliament at all times. They do not want the Parliamentary employees who grow up and work in this atmosphere of dignity, to be disturbed by people shouting in the streets and by the long-haired fraternity wandering about, provoking the police and running into batons. [Interjection.] But of course this is aimed at the students. Whom did the hon. member think it was aimed at&#x003F; Who started milling about in the streets, hurling challenges, here in the vicinity of Parliament&#x003F; Is this conducive to the dignity of Parliament&#x003F; No I quite agree with the Sessional Committee, and we are very glad that this Bill is serving before us today.</p>

<p>However, there is one aspect that worries me and that is the manner in which the English-language Press comes forward to save the powers of democracy from the Government. When notice was given of the motion for permission to introduce this Bill, <i>The Argus</i> published a leading article in which it tried to create the atmosphere of a last stand. That leading <span class="col_6337-6338" refersTo="page_0236"/>article was published under the heading &#x201C;Under the Big Stick&#x201D;. However, the Government was quite innocent because the Sessional Committee, in which the Government and the Official Opposition serve, took the decision. This has to do with something quite different, but <i>The Argus</i> comes along with &#x201C;Under the Big Stick&#x201D;. What did it say&#x003F; It asked, &#x201C;Why&#x003F;&#x201D; The newspaper dragged in Miss Gladys Lee and wanted to know what would become of her. I quote from the leading article of <i>The Argus</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why&#x003F; The reason is obvious. The Government wants no repetition of the police/student affair at the St. George Cathedral. It was an unhappy, violent affair, but an isolated one in the city&#x2019;s history.</block>

<p>And then, I have to tell you in all honesty, there follows the understatement of the year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We in Cape Town are not a demonstrative citizenry.</block>

<p>What a fine city this is! We want to give effect to this point of view and the statement of the Capetonians &#x201C;that we are not a demonstrating citizenry&#x201D;, and we therefore say that you are not allowed to demonstrate and particularly not in the vicinity of Parliament, because we who come from the Transvaal and other parts of the country are not a &#x201C;demonstrating citizenry&#x201D; either and we want a stop to be put to demonstrations.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was necessary for you to issue a statement that this is not, in fact, a Government measure. What I should like to know now, is whether <i>The Argus</i> would change its attitude. I want to express the hope that the newspapers will try not to belabour the Government to such an extent about supposedly wanting to water down democracy. They must wait and first find out where something comes from before raising a hue and cry about it.</p>

<p>Of course, the hon. member only got carried away because the newspapers told her to raise a hue and cry. I listened to her speech very attentively. She simply rattled on and on. She is so eager to maintain the image of being the lonely fighter in Parliament. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Never mind, I need say no more. I am very grateful that we have been afforded the opportunity of submitting this Bill to this House. I am also very grateful that all the parties that mean anything in this House are agreed on this score.</p>

<p>Question put: That the word &#x201C;now&#x201D; stand part of the motion, and a division demanded.</p>

<p>Fewer than four members (viz. Mrs. H. Suzman) having supported the demand for a division, Questions declared affirmed.</p>

<p>Bill accordingly read a Second Time.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 62, to omit &#x201C;, who shall be the deputy chairman,&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I just want to explain briefly that there are some misgivings about the fact that the director shall automatically be the deputy chairman of this advisory council. Hon. members are aware that the director is really concerned with research. It is my intention to bring about some separation between the supervisory responsibility and the research responsibility. I think that this can only be to the benefit of the director as far as his research work is concerned. I do not think it will make any difference in practice, because subsection (2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A council referred to in subsection (1) shall consist of the Secretary or his authorized representative, who shall be the chairman, the director, who shall be the deputy chairman, and so many other members, not being less than nine, as the Minister may appoint &#x2026;</block>

<p>The words &#x201C;who shall be the deputy chairman&#x201D; are now being deleted by this amendment. This still means that in his absence, the Secretary may nominate someone else in his department to be chairman. I therefore do not think that this will make any difference in practice.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens yesterday referred to the possibility of space being made available in the fishing harbours for amateur fishermen. He particularly mentioned yachtsmen. In terms of this clause the hon. the Minister is given not only the right to establish fishing harbours but also to control them. I would therefore like to ask him to give very serious consideration to the situation. You have, for example, at the fishing harbours of Kalk Bay, Gordons Bay and Hermanus, a situation where traditionally over the years amateur fishermen have had the right to moor their boats. There is constant difficulty and I personally am constantly being approached by people who would like to moor boats in those harbours. There seem to be suggestions in some cases that some people get preference not only to moor their boats in those harbours but also to the use of the slipways in those harbours to the exclusion of others. There would thus appear to be inefficient administration in some of those harbours.</p>

<p>There is another point I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister in regard to harbours. This concerns the access to harbours. We have the situation at Kalk Bay where the Railways control the access to the harbour. There is a level crossing. In terms of the regulations applied by the Railways the level crossing opens about 9 o&#x2019;clock in the morning and closes at 5 p.m.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>What has that to do with clause 4&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>It has to do with the control of fishing harbours. This is one of the fishing harbours under the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s control. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can make representations for that harbour to be opened earlier and certainly to close much later. The harbour is extensively used by amateur fishermen after hours. Once the gates have closed it is impossible for them to get their cars out of the harbour. It is a source of friction and I think the sooner the Minister arrives at some compromise with the Railways, whereby the public has greater access to the harbour and particularly for parking facilities, the better. I commend that to him for his attention.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member referred to what had been said yesterday by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, namely that there had to be better facilities for people and vessels in the fishing harbours. I gave the undertaking yesterday that we would give our attention to the matter. In fact, negotiations with my department have <span class="col_6341-6342" refersTo="page_0238"/>already taken place. It is envisaged that before the end of this month a meeting will take place with officials of my department, a meeting at which the various bodies will be represented, <i>inter alia,</i> the Department of Tourism, the S.A. Railways, Viskor, etc. They will discuss the matter to which the hon. member referred, namely facilities for the public in respect of other vessels. The hon. member must take account of the fact, however, that it is our primary task to develop these harbours as fishing harbours with a view to the fishing industry. That must remain our primary task. I myself was impressed by the idea yesterday, and it is in fact being seen to.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the control of these harbours which was raised by the hon. member, there is a tremendous difference from harbour to harbour. I am aware of the level crossing at Kalk Bay. The space there is particularly limited, and the level crossing affects access to the harbour to a large extent. I do not think that this is the right time for going into all the details of the harbours. We shall take into consideration the thoughts expressed by the hon. member in regard to freer access to the various harbours. If representations should be made by any bodies or persons in that respect, we shall attempt to remedy the matter on a departmental basis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to thank the hon. Minister for his reply. It is relevant at this stage. As the hon. the Minister will know Viskor has plans to expand that harbour. I think Parliament has actually passed an amount of R1 500 000 for further extensions to Kalk Bay harbour. Now, you have the problem, and I think it is appropriate that I should bring it to his attention at this moment, that the department and Viskor are willing and able to go ahead with the expansion of that harbour. The money has been voted and the plans that I have seen are first class plans. As a matter of fact, they are very close to the plans that I suggested here in this House a few years ago. But Mr. Chairman, you have that difficulty. The railway bridge access is a problem. Until the question of access is cleared up I think you will find that the department or Viskor will have great difficulty in extending the harbour. But the Cape Town Municipality is also in the picture. Until such time as the Cape Town Municipality builds its tunnel through the mountain above Kalk Bay the builders of the harbour will not be able to use the fill from the tunnel for providing the breakwater. I would therefore like to ask the Minister to please give consideration to calling together a departmental committee to deal with this matter. I would be only too pleased to discuss this with him privately if he so wished. It is a situation where Parliament has voted money and Viskor wants to go ahead and expand the harbour at Kalk Bay, but because of the City Council and the Railways there is no way of getting on with the job. It is an important matter.</p>

<p>Then there is a third point I should like to make. The hon. the Minister referred to the Department of Tourism being consulted in the committee to which he referred. There is no governmental body whatsoever that is able to provide the funds with which to build small-boat harbours. That is your problem. That is why most of the people that have small boats, namely private people and yachtsmen, have to use the commercial fishing harbours. There is no government agency of which I know which is able to expend funds for the building of pleasure harbours, boat harbours or tourist harbours or whatever you want to call them. I therefore ask the hon. the Minister to give this his attention.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not feel that I am in a position at this stage to give a definite reply, in detail, to the points raised by the hon. member. All I can say is that we shall give attention to the matter. The hon. member is quite right in saying that there is no body or government department which has funds available for constructing facilities in harbours and making them available to the general public. This may possibly be one of the matters which will be discussed, at the coming meeting.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in respect of clause 5 I have one or two observations. The first observation is in respect of the certificates of appointment mentioned in subsection (2). This is a new subsection. It is welcomed. I think it is an excellent idea that anybody that is appointed as an inspector, officer, or honorary fisheries officer should have in fact a <span class="col_6343-6344" refersTo="page_0239"/>certificate of appointment. I want to go further and to suggest that at any rate in regard to the honorary fisheries officer, he be given a badge of appointment. We have recently discovered in the Republic as a result of a greater awareness of the necessity for conservation that there are conservation societies of one kind or another springing up. They have great pride in the work that they do; some of them have achieved an enormous amount in a short space of time. I think in this particular context of the False Bay Conservation Society which, in a period of six or seven years, has achieved a great deal in conserving the resources of False Bay of one kind or another, and, I think, is establishing a very fine liaison between itself and the Department of Sea Fisheries. I would suggest that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to badges being provided, certainly for the honorary fisheries officers, and also possibly for the inspectors and the other officers of the department who have to discharge the duties described in the following clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause is a new provision, but the certificate of appointment is not completely new. The hon. member himself says that he is a honorary fisheries officer. If that is true, then he has received a card of appointment to that effect. The idea of a certificate or a card is therefore not completely new, although provision has not previously been made in the Act for this. As far as a visible token is concerned, the hon. member spoke about a> badge for these people. This would be a visible token signifying that such a person is an honorary official. This is something we could consider. We shall have to investigate the cost this would involve, but I see no reason why this should be excessive. In my opinion there is merit in the idea.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to refer briefly to two points. The first relates to clause 6(1)(b), which states that an inspector or an officer generally or specially authorized by the Minister, and a member of the police, may&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Examine any implement he has reasonable grounds to suspect is being used or intended for use in the catching or handling of fish, or the gathering of seaweed or shells or the recovery of salt.</block>

<p>I have in my possession regulations issued by the department concerning the implements that may be used. I refer particularly to the implements that are being used at the moment for the cutting of red-bait and for the taking of mussels from the rocks. The implements are prescribed in some detail in those regulations. I do not think that the sizes of those implements are satisfactory; I think some attention should be given to this matter. More particularly&#x2014;and this comes back to the necessity of having honorary inspectors&#x2014;there is not sufficient patrol work being done to see whether those people who go down to the coast to collect shells, bait and fish of one kind or another, are using implements that are prohibited in terms of the regulations. I have been horrified from time to time to see people armed with spades digging whole masses of red-bait off the rocks in front of my house. I find people armed with hammers, hammering away at rocks, trying to get mussel-worms. I find that they are not only damaging the rocks, but also damaging all the sea life-attaching to those rocks. I find that the mussel-bed in which many of the mussel-worms shelter are being completely denuded as a result of the excessive use of over-sized implements by these collectors.</p>

<p>I want to refer also to paragraph (f) of clause 6(1). This paragraph relates to the right to order the master of a fishing boat to remove it at a specified time from a fishing harbour or not to bring it into a fishing harbour at all. I take it that this applies to foreigners as well. I take it that this is one of the measures with which we are hoping to combat the situation regarding foreigners, those who are perhaps not signatories to the convention of the South-East Atlantic, or even those who are signatories. I take it that this is aimed at prohibiting them from transgressing our fisheries regulations with impunity. If that is so, then I welcome this provision, because it will give us some teeth with which to handle a difficult situation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, both these provisions are existing provisions. Clause 6(1)(b) already exists in section 3(1)(c) of the Sea Fisheries Act. Similarly the provision contained in clause 6(1)(f) already exists <span class="col_6345-6346" refersTo="page_0240"/>in section 3(1)(g) of the Act. The hon. member said he was horrified from time to time to see how spades, etc., were used for digging red-bait off the rocks. I am really amazed that he said this, for the hon. member is, after all, an honorary fisheries officer; surely he acted in these cases&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Be that as it may, Sir, I realize it is no easy matter to notice all these small things, for our coastline is a long and extensive one, and from time to time we shall have cases of people transgressing and exceeding the bounds of the regulations altogether. I agree with the hon. member that we must do our utmost to prevent this. I am well aware of the damage to our marine life in the past number of years, and especially in the case of bait attaching to the rocks, such as white mussels, red-bait and even black mussels. From time to time this bait is removed by people in an utterly reckless manner. They use any implement to be found under the sun, for they think that the supply of this bait is inexhaustible and sometimes their motive is one of pure selfishness. I sincerely hope that we shall succeed to a larger extent in doing something in this regard by means of this legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me a question with regard to paragraph (f) of subsection (1). He is quite correct; it also applies to foreign boats, and not only to our own boats.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to point out to the hon. the Minister, now that he has clarified the position in regard to paragraph (f), that it is all very well to have these teeth with which to combat a very difficult situation, but I want once again to bring to his attention the necessity for having an effective patrol service. When I asked him yesterday during the course of the Second Reading what steps he was taking in regard to a patrol service, he said that he was not able to give me an answer immediately. It is all very well to have these regulations and to have these powers on the Statute Book, but unless you have an effective patrol service, like, for example, the United States Coast Guard Service, and the patrol services of other countries with fishing interests, it does not help to have these powers on the Statute Book. You have to have effective control which you are prepared to use.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Committee will appreciate that we have a problem in this regard owing to the length of our coastline. At this stage I can only say that we move the inspectors who are used for patrol work from place to place from time to time. When it is necessary to do patrol work along the coast of South-West Africa, they have to proceed there, and when those services are not so necessary there, in the off-season, those same inspectors are used at other places where such services are deemed necessary.</p>

<p>Clause 11:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the clause which refers specifically to the question of quotas. As I read this clause it means that the Minister may, after having consulted the Advisory Council, make regulations prohibiting the holders of licences in respect of fishing boats from catching or landing more than a certain quantity of fish, and prohibiting or regulating the supply of fish to certain persons. I think I am correct in saying that these are new statutory provisions. They refer to the quota system. I think it is only appropriate for me to say at this stage, in regard to these provisions, that we have read in the Press that the pilchard quotas off South-West Africa have in fact this year been increased. I just want to place on record once again my considerable doubt as to whether it is wise at this stage to increase quotas. I have already during the Second Reading referred to the fact that, elsewhere in the world, where pilchard resources have been on the decline, it has been found that once the decline has started it does not stop unless the most drastic measures are taken. As evidence of that, you have your Californian pilchard resource and you have your west coast pilchard resource. I know that there are members in this House who say that I am always playing the role of Job&#x2019;s comforter, <span class="col_6347-6348" refersTo="page_0241"/>that I am looking on the black side of things, but I can only say that it was not so long ago that the west coast was producing something like &#x00BD; million tons of pilchards a year. Last year it was 60 000 tons.</p>

<p>Sir, since the hon. member has put the question, may I just point out that clauses 11(a) and 11(b) are new clauses. These powers are already being exercised partially in terms of the control over the hold capacity of boats, which is linked to the factory quota. Subclause (c) is an existing subsection, and subclauses (d) and (e) are also new. Last night I referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to (e), which is a new subclause and which provides for separate control in South-West Africa and here in the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<p>Mr. Chairman, I only wish to say that I welcome particularly the increase in the penalty from R500 or one year to R1 000 or one year contained in subclause (3). I think in the light of what has been happening in the fishing industry over some years, it was necessary to increase these penalties, and we on this side of the House, although we regard them as severe, recognize the necessity for them and welcome them.</p>

<p>*To be specific, it was in connection with the matter of dumping. This is a serious situation which has developed over the years and we are totally opposed to it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We support the severe penalties for which provision is being made with a view to trying to stop dumping.</p>

<p>As regards clause 16(1)(f), there is also the question of the discharge into the sea of anything which is injurious to fish&#x2014;fish food, seaweed, etc. I think this subclause is really one that is applicable to what has been happening at Saldanha Bay.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, I am referring to 16(1)(j). I think this clause is relevant as regards the situation at Saldanha Bay. The Minister will recall that earlier this morning he answered certain questions on the Question Paper put to him by the hon. member for South Coast. I would bring to his attention the urgent need for something to be done about the discharge of what I can only refer to as polluted material from various factories. Then there is also the situation at Glencairn. The Minister was himself a director of Marine Products, which is the owner of the factory at Glencairn. If he goes down to Clencairn on any fine day of the week, when the sea is reasonably clear, he will see that the sea is polluted by discharge from that factory. I see no earthly reason why factories that <span class="col_6349-6350" refersTo="page_0242"/>deal with the products of the sea should with impunity be able to discharge their waste products into the sea. It cannot do anything else but have a harmful effect on the sea life in the area. I will go so far as to say&#x2014;I have no evidence to substantiate it other than personal observation&#x2014;that whenever that factory at Glencairn discharges its effluent into the sea it prevents the trek fishermen, who have long-established rights on that beach, from making good catches. I have never seen them make good catches from that beach when there is the discharge of effluent into the sea visible to the eye. The same applies to Saldanha Bay. A serious situation has developed there. One reads of thousands and thousands of sea creatures which have from time to time been washed up.</p>

<p>I want to reply briefly to what the hon. member said here with regard to effluent from factories. Recently my department conducted negotiations with the various fish factories with regard to the so-called &#x201C;pilot plant&#x201D; which they are erecting so as to render this effluent harmless. We are negotiating with them and we shall do everything necessary towards the end of the year to see to it that they make the necessary arrangements so as to render the effluent, which is something unavoidable, harmless prior to discharging it into the sea. Measures of control have been inserted here and we shall now be able to take action against them in terms of these measures.</p>

<p>This follows on what I have just said on the previous clause but one. There is a presumption contained in the new subclause (4), that if in any prosecution for an offence in terms of the Act there has been a discharge of effluent into any area of the sea within a distance of 8 km from a factory and fish or fish food has been injured, etc., it is an offence for which that factory is held responsible. It will be presumed that the discharge emanated from that factory. I welcome this provision. I think the presumption is correct and the onus is rightly placed on the factory to discharge that presumption.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned yesterday, I had indicated that this side of the House oppose the principle of free and unrestricted participation in party politics by members of the Public Service. We believe that it is an approach which, in any event, is adopted by most of the senior Public Service officials. In the time that is left to me, I want to deal with the provisions of the Bill and to indicate to the hon. the Deputy Minister where we have some reservations and where we shall move amendments when we come to the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I want to dispose first of all of the question in regard to sections 17 and 18 the principal Act. We desire that the institution of disciplinary action should be compulsory and not permissive when the amendments in terms of the various clauses of the Bill come into effect. In other words, if a public servant contravenes the provisions which are now to be included in the Bill, then action should be taken departmentally in regard to such transgression.</p>

<p>Clause 4 provides for the insertion of a new section 24A. As far as subsection (a) of the proposed new section is concerned, we support the position that members of the Public Service should be permitted to be members of a political party. However, when it comes to the question as to the extent to which that membership can be exercised, we do not believe that a public manifestation of a public servant&#x2019;s membership should be permitted; in other words, it must not include open, active management activities. Therefore we believe that the words &#x201C;and serve on the management&#x201D; should be further considered. We propose that the hon. the Deputy Minister consider <span class="col_6351-6352" refersTo="page_0243"/>the restriction of membership of the management of a political party to membership of a branch or constituency committee of a party. This will then entitle the individual member of the Public Service to play his part in discussion and formulation of policy and matters of that nature in connection with the party to which he belongs. We do not believe that a public servant should hold office in any political party, be it as chairman or secretary of anything, even of a branch organization of a political party.</p>

<p>We certainly welcome the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), that is that a public servant may attend a public political meeting but may not preside or speak at such meeting and furthermore that he may not draw up or publish or cause to be published any writing or deliver a public speech to promote or prejudice the interests of any political party. There are aspects which are omitted which we think should be included. First of all there is the question of canvassing. It is dealt with specifically in the rules applicable to the Public Service of other countries and particularly in Great Britain where there are special provisions dealing with canvassing. One feels that because of the particular relationship between a public servant and the public, a public servant should not be permitted to canvass. When I say &#x201C;canvass&#x201D; I have in mind that he should not be permitted to canvass for members, because this could be misused in departments, or for funds and at election times he should certainly not be allowed to canvass voters for a particular party. When I say &#x201C;election times&#x201D;, I have in mind the elections for this House, the provincial councils, and I think it should also include elections of municipal councillors where those municipal elections are fought on a party political basis. There are many local authorities where that does not occur. I believe that it is also essential that one should make sure and ensure that no party political organization operates from or use State premises for the purposes of meetings and matters of organization.</p>

<p>We believe that were these provisions brought into this Bill&#x2014;we will submit amendments to deal with them&#x2014;the public servant would have been permitted to exercise his individual right of affiliation to a political party, he would have been permitted to participate in the formulation of the policy of the party to which he belongs. But it would avoid any possibility of direct or indirect influence within State departments; that is, of one official upon another, and it would certainly eliminate any possibility of influence by the State official upon members of the public with whom he comes in contact. We will obviously debate this point more fully when we come to the Committee Stage. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister, in replying to this debate, will indicate to what extent he will be prepared to consider in principle the amendments we put&#x2014;we can discuss the details in the course of the Committee Stage; in other words, to restrict the participation in politics of a member of the Public Service to membership of a party and participation in the constituency formation so that he may not hold office or in any way publicly identify himself with a party.</p>

<p>At the commencement of my remarks yesterday, I made it clear that what is concerning us on this side of the House, is the different standards which apply to different sections of the Public Service. The Railways have a certain code in this matter; the Post Office has another code, and so on, right through the Public Service. Now I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister as the situation is now becoming crystallized in some form, that he should endeavour, if possible, to bring together the Public Servants Association, the artisan and other staff associations of the Railways and the Post Office Staff Association and various other associations to which public servants of various departments are attached, in order to formulate some code which can then be applied throughout the Public Service. In such a code we could well incorporate a lot of the principles which apply, for example in the Public Service of Great Britain, where there are different categories of civil servants that have different rights of participation in the political life of the country. I understand that in Britain there is a much lower strata of civil servants than in South Africa and that certain of the so-called &#x201C;service personnel&#x201D; enjoy complete liberty to do what they like politically, because their status in the Service is so low that it cannot bring the Civil Service as such into any disrepute. But I think the time has come that a thorough investigation should be carried out in this regard and that we should for all time formulate a code for public servants which will be acceptable to them, which will maintain the high traditions of the Public Service as a service to all sections <span class="col_6353-6354" refersTo="page_0244"/>and people of all political persuasions in the public sector of the country. That could be done if we had a uniform code without the exceptions and varying degrees of control which at present exist. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give consideration to organizing an investigation to that end.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill which we have been discussing this morning, and began discussing yesterday afternoon, once again affords us the opportunity to place a little emphasis on the Public Service, the Public Service Commission, and so on, and also to give attention to a large group of people in our society who have a very important and responsible task and who are in fact performing their activities in society in a very quiet, peaceful and modest manner. Therefore it is necessary, when these people come to us, through their associations as well, that we should devote particularly thorough attention to their ideas, needs and ideals. In particular I want to devote my speech to clauses 3 and 4. I then want to begin by quoting an extract from Prof. J. J. M. Cloete&#x2019;s work, <i>Sentrale, Provinsiale en Munisipale Instellings van Suid-Afrika,</i> and refer to certain observations which he made in respect of the central administration of the Government departments. On page 108 of the latest edition of his work he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the well-ordered democratic state, however, changes in political rulers do not cause any crisis situations. This is the case because such a state these days has at its disposal an established corps of officials who enjoy security of service and owe loyalty to the properly elected legislature and not to a particular political party or group. The presence of these expert and experienced public servants enables the party political leaders, of which the Cabinet consists, to exercise their governmental function and to ensure that the administration of the country is continued without interruption.</block>

<p>I think that if we accept this as an ideal situation, the public servants in South Africa have in the course of time complied with this. These two clauses in particular are trying to reconcile two ideals: The first is to have impartial public servants and a public service who have to and want to support the Government of the day faithfully, loyally and in a responsible way; the second ideal is to afford the public servant the right to be a full citizen of his country, and as far as possible, too, in the political sphere. For various reasons this is no easy reconciliation. The one important reason is probably the weakness of the flesh which is present in most people. This reconciliation is one which can only be effected reasonably by responsible people within the democracy through the passage of time. This reconciliation attempt has had its own history within every country where democracy has had an opportunity to grow in a normal and healthy way.</p>

<p>I just want to mention two countries briefly, as examples of countries which contended with the same problem. The one is America, in regard to which I just want to quote briefly from a report which I have here entitled &#x201C;Statement of Robert E. Hampton&#x2014;chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission before the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the United States Senate&#x201D;, of April, 1972. I should like to quote a few passages from this indicate how these people also attempted to reconcile these two ideals. On the first page of the report he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This country&#x2019;s history has taught us that a critical factor necessary to the support of any merit system is the restriction of particular forms of political activity on the part of its officers and employees. In large part this is so because certain forms of political activity, such as campaigning and managing political party affairs, enable an employee to curry favour with the candidate or party for whom he performs the activity. This favouritism results in undermining the impartiality of the system for handling Government business, and the system under which selection, placement, and advancement of personnel is carried out.</block>

<p>Then he goes further and refer to this case, <i>United Public Workers</i> v. <i>Mitchell</i> in 1947, where the court gave the following verdict&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The court said &#x201C;Congress recognizes danger to the service in that political effort rather than official effort may earn advancement and to the public in that government favour may be channelled through political connections&#x201D;.</block>

<p><span class="col_6355-6356" refersTo="page_0245"/>After having referred to that, he said the following at the end of his memorandum&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We too believe that the present law could profit by amendment, not only to clarify the restricted and permitted activities, but to allow a greater degree of freedom of political action for Government employees. We are currently working on a set of provisions which will reflect in their ultimate detail the precise changes we believe will make good sense to the Congress.</block>

<p>In other words, we notice here, too, the struggle of people to reconcile these two ideals. If we consider the Code of Federal Regulations in regard to Administrative Personnel, we also note here that there are certain things which are allowed, and others which they tried to counteract. As regards permissible activities the following is stated &#x2014;and I am quoting a few examples&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Be a member of a political party or other political organization and participate in its activities to the extent consistent with law; attend a political convention, rally, fund-raising function, or other political gathering; sign a political petition as an individual; make a financial contribution to a political party or organization; take an active part, as an independent candidate, or in support of an independent candidate, in a partisan election covered by &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he mentions a specific paragraph. There are certain things which he is in fact prohibited from doing, which are very interesting to look into. We find the same struggle in respect of the reconciliation of these two ideals in Canada. There are certain examples which I found in the treatise &#x201C;Participation by Canadian Federal Civil Servants in Politics&#x201D; in which public servants are on the one hand prohibited from taking an active part in politics so that their impartiality and specific instructions will suffer harm as a result, but yet on the other hand are afforded the opportunity of contributing their personal talent and knowledge to the general political activities of their specific country.</p>

<p>In South Africa where we have certain officials who serve specific institutions, we note that the Railways, for example, has up to now also placed certain restrictions over the years on its officials, but on the other hand wants to afford them the opportunity of participating here and there. So I can quote the following to you from the <i>Railway Regulations</i> under the paragraph &#x201C;Political and Public Affairs&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any servant who desires to seek election to Parliament or to a Provincial Council is free to do so. Any such servant shall simultaneously with the acceptance of nomination, tender a conditional resignation, so conditional as to take effect immediately upon election. Such a conditional resignation shall not be accepted unless the servant concerned is successful in his candidature.</block>

<p>Then it continues as follows. It is also stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A servant may attend public meetings held by candidates seeking election to Parliament, a Provincial, Divisional or Municipal Council, and may vote at such meetings upon any resolutions submitted.</block>

<p>Various aspects are covered by this, and I just wanted to quote a few passages to illustrate that attention has in fact been given to this matter by the Railways. The provisions which we have here today, also have their own special history in the Public Service as such. As long ago as 1951 a draft resolution was submitted by the then Minister of the Interior in which he proposed (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That public servants be allowed to take part in political activities in a limited way.</block>

<p>According to the draft resolution participation is limited to the nomination of candidates for election purposes. In September, 1951, the Minister in question addressed a special meeting of the Public Service Joint Advisory Board on this matter. He asked the board to devote special attention to the limits which should be placed on the political activities of public servants. According to representations which were received, it appeared that public servants and members of their families at that stage comprised up to approximately 80% of certain constituencies in Pretoria. The advantages and disadvantages of this motion were stated, and the following resolution was subsequently passed (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6357-6358" refersTo="page_0246"/>The board expresses it opinion that the existing prohibition on participation in political activities by public servants should be maintained.</block>

<p>Both the Graham as well as the Centlivres Commissions of Inquiry into the Public Service expressed themselves in favour of the maintenance of the <i>status quo.</i> This matter was again debated at the congresses of the Public Servants Association in the years from 1953 to 1958, and in 1962. Each time it was debated it was rejected and it appeared as if the so-called American spoils system attributed largely to the failure to reach a positive agreement in this sphere. In November, 1962 the Public Service Commission convened a special meeting of the Joint Advisory Council to discuss the following draft resolution (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the council express an opinion on the amendment of the Public Service Act to allow officers to become members of political parties.</block>

<p>However the Advisory Council resolved unanimously that the existing provision in regard to participation in politics in the Public Service should be left unaltered. The matter was then left at that until another motion was submitted to the congress of the Public Servants Association in 1969. Under the heading &#x201C;Active Participation in Party Politics&#x201D; a motion was introduced asking that the Government be requested to amend section 17(c) of the Public Service Act, Act No. 54 of 1957, so that (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) any officer may join a lawfully recognized political party or organization as member; and</li>

<li>(b) may actively as member or member of the management promote or propagate openly the principles and objectives of such party or organization in his free time.</li>

</ol>

<p>In a memorandum which was submitted, the following was indicated as motivation (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Association is convinced that several potential leaders with wide experience are being lost to South Africa as a result of the restriction which is being imposed on the public servant by section 17(g), read in conjunction with section 18(2)(a) to (e) of the Public Service Act.</block>

<p>I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore these restrictions are diametrically opposed to all basic principles of democracy in that they, although they do not directly disenfranchise the official, restrict his free expression of opinion, which is a basic right of every citizen of a democratic country.</block>

<block name="quote">The Government is consequently &#x201C;urgently requestion to review at once the position of the public servant in national politics and to amend the Public Service Act in such a way that every official who feels that way inclined and thus called upon&#x2014;without there being a sword hanging over his head&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) may join a lawfully recognized political party or organization as member; and</li>

<li>(b) may actively as member or member of the management promote or propagate openly the principles and objectives of such party or organization in his free time.</li>

</ol>

<p>The following resolution was adopted by the congress:</p>

<block name="quote">That the Government be requested to amend section 17(g) of the Public Service Act, Act No. 54 of 1957, as amended, so that an officer or an employee may join a lawfully recognized political party or organization as member.</block>

<p>This was sent to the Public Service Commission, which replied that they did not see their way clear to accenting the change proposed by the Public Servants Association. After that reply from the Public Service Commission the association again made representations in February, 1970, and requested the commission to furnish further reasons for its refusal. To this the commission replied again in April, 1970, but adhered to its old basic standpoint. The matter was left more or less at that until a change took place and it appeared that the time was ripe to give very definite attention to this matter once again. A <span class="col_6359-6360" refersTo="page_0247"/>memorandum was then drawn up by the Public Service Commission and this was discussed in August, 1970, by the Public Service Joint Advisory Council, on which the Association has representation. In view of this and in view of representations received from a number of congresses of public servants, the National Party stated the following through former Minister Dirkie Uys on 9th June (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the insistence by the officials on acquiring membership of political parties, which met with overwhelming majority support at the latest annual congress of the Public Servants Association, the Government decided to reconsider the existing restrictions in consultation with the Public Service Commission.</block>

<p>Now I should just like to quote to you something which was said by the then Secretary of the Association. I am quoting from <i>The Star</i> of 10.6.1970. According to <i>The Star</i> Mr. Basson had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The new turn in events is welcomed by the association because it seems to be in line with decisions taken at the congress. We are of course anxious to see how the Public Service Act and existing regulations will be amended.</block>

<p><i>Die Transvaler</i> also reacted at the time in a leading article. I am quoting from <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 11th June, 1970, as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The possibility that public servants will be allowed to belong to political parties, which ought to be the right of every citizen, should be welcomed. Up to now public servants have been excluded from the right of becoming members of political parties.</block>

<p><i>Die Transvaler</i> concluded this leading article by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is necessary to act coolly and calmly in regard to this matter. It is obvious that the Public Service Commission will not tolerate unrestrained behaviour and that staff regulations will make provision for regulating the basis of participation in political activities. The teaching profession which already has quite adequate civil rights can testify to the desirability of the step which is now being considered for all public servants.</block>

<p>This is a brief historical sketch which I wanted to make here for the sake of completeness. Before I make my last few remarks I should like to quote again from Prof. Cloete&#x2019;s work, where he states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To obtain the aforesaid situation, and this is indispensable, it is necessary that public servants do not interest themselves actively in party politics.</block>

<p>Even this learned gentleman left himself a kind of loophole by using the words &#x201C;not &#x2026; actively&#x201D;. With the history of this entire matter we have come today to deal with clauses 3 and 4. The realization and acquisition of these two ideals which we mentioned at the beginning, by on the one hand doing justice to the activities and the obligations of a public servant as this has unfolded within the democracy which we know today, and on the other hand affording the public servant certain rights in politics, testifies to everyone involved in this, including the hon. member for Green Point and the Opposition, having tried with the greatest responsibility to bring it about. I think that both parties, striving to achieve the highest ideals of democracy, will try to help the public servant in this, quite probably with certain conditions which we as people involved in active party politics wish to see imposed. Without being didactic I want to say this morning that I hope that the Bill and so, too, the remarks and comments we want to make concerning it, will meet with approval. We want to say to the public servants that through this right which they are acquiring they are in fact receiving a privilege. As with any right and privilege which one acquires, this right and privilege of the public servants will also entail greater responsibility, and I think that these two clauses are only the beginning of a long history which also lies ahead for us. I should like to see our public servants, who have built up such good, sound traditions as public servants in the Public Service of South Africa, will exercise these political rights they are now obtaining with the same sense of responsibility and trustworthiness as they have thus far displayed in the performance of their duties. I want to request them to treasure this privilege, and to be an example in this respect to all persons in South Africa who have the right to participate in the privileges of democracy.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from><span class="col_6361-6362" refersTo="page_0248"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Green Point has indicated that we on this side of the House will support the general provisions of this Bill. However, I want to take this opportunity at the Second Reading to express some reservations on matters of principle which arise in clauses 1 and 2 of this Bill and which I believe could well do with some further reflection and some further attention. Sir, the first of these questions of principle which I wish to raise is the matter of the appointment of non-officers to the Public Service. Clause 1(b) of the Bill provides that if the Commission recommends the appointment of persons who are not officers of the Public Service, these appointments should be brought to the notice of this House by means of the Commission&#x2019;s annual report. Sir, there are two matters which flow from this. The first, of course, is the greater delay in bringing to the attention of the House these appointments of non-officers, and I will deal with that again in a moment. But, Sir, there is a more important matter which flows from it, because the previous amending measure, Act No. 86 of 1969, provided in effect that if any person who was not an officer of the Public Service was appointed, that appointment should be brought to the attention of this House within a month of the reassembly of Parliament. Sir, this provision included the cases of appointments made with or without the recommendation of the Commission. There was no provision that only recommendations of the Commission should be brought to the attention of this House; all appointments to the Public Service of people who were not officers had to be brought to the attention of this House. The effect of this amendment, Sir, is that if the Commission recommends the appointment of a person who is not an officer to fill a post in the administrative division, then such appointment shall be brought to the attention of the House. Sir, this excludes appointments, which have not been unknown, where the Commission has in fact failed to make a recommendation, or where the Commission&#x2019;s recommendation has been ignored or overridden; and it is most necessary for the protection of the Commission itself and for the protection of the Public Service that such appointments, made without the approval or consent of the Public Service Commission, should also be brought to the attention of this House. In fact, it is precisely in these cases where the Public Service Commission is overridden that it is most essential that they should be brought to the attention of this House. I believe that the difference in wording as between the amendment of 1969 and the amendment of 1973 is a most significant one and does require the further attention of this House. It cannot surely be that this House wishes to remove from the Public Service and from its guardian and watchdog, the Public Service Commission, the right to have these cases reviewed by the House; because this is what gives the Public Service Commission authority. This is what gives it some resilience against attempts to intervene and to override its authority. If this right of automatic review of such appointments is removed from the purview of this House, then the Public Service Commission itself is left defenceless and can be overridden with impunity, and then, what of the civil servants&#x003F; They look upon the Public Service Commission as their defender. If the Public Service Commission has no weapons and is left defenceless, what of the public servant himself&#x003F; He too then is defenceless. I believe that this is a most important principle.</p>

<p>The second aspect to which I have already drawn attention in connection with this subsection is that if these cases do occur and they are brought to Parliament, they should be brought to Parliament as soon as possible. The 1969 amendment provided that these cases should be brought to Parliament within one month of its reassembling. This is no longer the case. We have to wait now for the annual report of the Public Service Commission and there is no provision in this Bill as to when that annual report will appear. We have had the experience that certain departments are very prompt in the production of their annual reports. Others are more dilatory. I am not suggesting that the Public Service Commission in particular will be dilatory in this respect in regard to its reports but there is no provision in this Bill to ensure that these reports will in fact be brought to the attention of Parliament within, say, a year or within six months of Parliament reassembling. It may mean that when we assemble for 1975 we may get a report for 1973, when the harm has already been done. I believe this amendment is a retrograde step, firstly, because of the point of time, in that it allows too much time to lapse before the matter is brought before Parliament; and, secondly, and more important, because it no longer provides the Civil Service with the protection or the Public Service Commission with the means to bring to the attention of Parliament those cases in which the Public Service <span class="col_6363-6364" refersTo="page_0249"/>Commission has been obliged to acquiesce in appointments but has in fact seen appointments made against its advice.</p>

<p>I come now to the second principle, and that is the one relating to political activities by public servants. I am grateful to the hon. member for Rissik for covering the history of the situation very fully, because I am therefore not obliged to do the same. I believe that he has given a reasonably accurate report of what has happened over past years and that he has in fact disclosed the situation in which over a number of years the Public Service Commission, and indeed also the Public Service Association, have tried to maintain a very important principle. I will come to the principles in a moment, and the reasons underlying those principles. But they have tried to defend the immunity of the Public Service from political involvement. They have tried to maintain the impartiality of the Public Service in political matters and they have fought on correct principles over many years. It was only recently that they were overridden by certain political pressures which took place through and upon the Public Service Association and because of the intervention, amongst others, of the former Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Uys. I believe that the Public Service was forced into a wrong position and that they have taken wrong decisions because political pressures were allowed to override basic principles, the correct principles in respect of the whole situation. I believe that a grave mistake has been made. I believe that this amendment, the new section 17(g) is, as far as it goes, perhaps better than nothing but I am deeply concerned about the abandonment of a principle which the Public Service Association and the Public Service Commission have themselves shown to be a matter which is important and about which they have been extremely sensitive in past years, and for good reasons.</p>

<p>It has been, I think, a matter of common agreement between international experts in the field of public administration that it is desirable, if at all possible, that public servants, at least of certain categories, should abstain from direct involvement, in the political scene. It has been defined by one as desirable&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C; &#x2026; to maintain a reserve and not put themselves forward prominently in association with one side or the other&#x201D;.</block>

<p>There are many reasons for this. One reason has already been made very distinct in argument in this debate and I shall therefore deal with it only very briefly. It is undesirable in the eyes of the public who look to the public servants for impartiality that they should see public servants who take decisions in regard to the citizenry to be directly associated, to be directly concerned, in political issues. The reason is not necessarily that the public servants will be seen to be acting incorrectly, or will, in fact, be acting incorrectly, but it is desirable that there should not even be suspicions, suggestions, rumours that public servants might act incorrectly in matters where partiality is in question. I believe it is most desirable that the public servant should aim at achieving that high degree of impartiality which we associate with our judges. I have heard a judge say that he took no part in politics and he was proud of it because he wished to be seen to be totally dissociated from any partiality throughout his judicial life. He saw it not as a limitation on his freedom as a person, but as a badge of pride which he wore. I believe that this high ideal is one for which public servants, particularly senior public servants, should also strive. I remember the late Dr. Eric Louw quoting with approval the old maxim about the great traditional civil servants&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They serve all Governments with equal efficiency; they serve all Governments with equal loyalty; and they serve all Governments with equal contempt.</block>

<p>This was the old tradition of the public servant. It indicates a degree of impartiality and a degree of independence of mind which was wholly admirable. I believe that this great principle is to some extent under-mined when public servants are not only permitted but are indeed encouraged to take part in the hurly-burly of domestic politics.</p>

<p>There is a more important reason why I believe public servants should not participate in politics. My first reason was the protection of the public; my second was the protection of the public servant himself against the implications which arise from participation in party politics. However, there is yet another reason and I should describe that as the tacit contract.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House rose I was dealing with the question of the political rights of civil servants. I dealt briefly with the case made by the hon. member for Rissik, which, I stated, had shown that the whole history of this movement towards the greater enjoyment of political rights by civil servants was in fact something that had happened against the better judgment of the Public Service Commission and the Public Service Association, and which had moved against the principles and traditions of the impartial service which we value so highly in this country. I tried to show that it was in fact a movement, a trend or a tendency which had as effect the possible loss of confidence by the public in the Public Service at a time when the Public Service had established a great tradition of loyalty in this country and a tradition of impartiality, and that this trend was in fact moving in the opposite direction, or opening the door to a movement in the opposite direction. I said then that I would deal with the opposite side of the coin, that is to say: What will this do to the Public Service itself&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is between the public and the Public Service what might be described as a tacit contract. This tacit contract contains the requirement that public servants abstain frgm certain activities which are open to the general public. Our traditions of impartial administration demand that public servants should avoid overt political activity. They must resign their posts before they stand as political candidates; they must not hold offices which conflict with their public duties; they must not be directors of firms which have contracts with the Government. And, Sir, they must not divulge information arising from their official duties which will be in conflict with their obligations to the people they serve. All these are restraints imposed on public servants and in return for this the Public Service enjoys very special privileges. In return for the public&#x2019;s confidence thus created, public servants are not held personally responsible for their acts of commission or omission; the responsibility is borne by their Ministers. They are personally protected against public censure. They have security of office and this is a most important thing. The security of office which public servants enjoy is due very largely to the fact that they are seen to be impartial administrators, to be upholders of a high tradition of impartiality and of dispassionate administration. It is because of this that when governments change in this country, there is no question of a spoils system, of a large number of public servants being driven out of office because of their political commitment and their political engagement in certain causes and their replacement by other people thought to be more loyal to the new Government coming into office. They are regarded as impartial administrators and as being entitled to the support, the trust and the confidence of a new government when it comes into office.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what I am propounding here is not a new theory. This is a very old tradition. It is one which we inherited from Britain and the British system, as well as our own, is the admiration of many countries of the world. It is a fact, if one reads the American writers on public administration, that they envy the statuts which an impartial public, service of this kind enjoys. It is because in certain countries they have allowed public servants a greater licence in their participation in political disputes and political issues of the day that these public servants are in fact vulnerable and liable to dismissal when changes of government take place. This feeling and this action has a destructive effect on the efficiency, on the impartiality and on the general administration of the Public Service. We are, I think, jeopardizing a great tradition. It is a tradition which we have come to accept as part of our system in this country, and one which is highly prized and highly admired. I believe that in response to a fairly new and recent series of political pressures, the Public Service Association has been obliged to give support, to give credence, to theories which are not conducive to the maintenance of the traditions which we respect. I believe that this is retrograde and I regret it very much.</p>

<p>I think we must bear in mind that the provisions of section 17(g) of the Public Service Act have, in fact, been disregarded for quite a number of years. In other words, section 17(g) has been a dead letter in that it has been connived at or disregarded. This is serious in itself because it has had an undermining effect. It has decreased that kind of protection which civil servants enjoy <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the public, and which they enjoy in respect of the permanence of their jobs. It has also created a sense of uncertainty in relation to other civil servants who have shown undue political <span class="col_6367-6368" refersTo="page_0251"/>activity and in relation to whom they feel they may now suffer a disadvantage.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. the Deputy Minister will allow me to make my own speech, I shall make everything clear to him. Section 17(g) was not acting as that sort of barrier which is desirable in the Public Service. Now we have a new provision introduced by means of this amendment. This new clause sets a lower standard, a looser standard. If this clause were to be effectively applied, we would prefer it to a section which was not effectively applied, because at least it sets some kind of barrier; it places some kind of restraint on activities which I have said are detrimental to the country and to its administration. If the Minister is serious about this clause and he proposes to see it effectively applied, it will be better than a provision which, though better in principle, was not applied at all. If the old section 17(g) is in fact too difficult to apply and if it has become too unpopular or too unacceptable to apply, then we would prefer to see a more acceptable and more applicable clause. We want to be sure that it will in fact be enforced. I do not believe that the new clause can easily be enforced because it puts the onus on some unknown person to prove a very difficult thing. It is necessary, in terms of this new paragraph (g), to prove that a public servant engaged in political activities has made use of his position in the Public Service &#x201C;to promote or to prejudice the interests of any political party&#x201D;. It is necessary to prove not only that he has promoted or prejudiced the interests of a political party, but that he has made use of his position in the Public Service to do so. This is a very hard matter to put to the proof and who will bring the prosecution&#x003F; I would really have preferred to see a more stringent provision, a more precise provision, and one which would operate more automatically if civil servants were to transgress in this respect or were to jeopardize their position in this respect. I am not entirely happy with this. I am considering, in conjunction with the hon. member for Green Point, whether it might be possible to suggest a provision which would improve this clause. I would sincerely urge upon the hon. the Deputy Minister, who after all is responsible for the conduct of this Bill and who bears a responsibility also for the maintenance of the high standards in the Public Service to which I have referred&#x2014;an interest which I believe he shares with me to a large extent &#x2014;to have another look at this Bill and to see whether it might not be possible to amend this clause in such a way that we can in fact achieve the common purpose which we on this side share with him, without opening the whole situation to the kind of abuses which I have described.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, is very concerned about the implications of clauses 3 and 4. That is supposed to create the impression that that party can <span class="col_6369-6370" refersTo="page_0252"/>sit there with clean hands and talk about this matter. I want to put it to this House that whereas the hon. member is very worried about the situation &#x201C;when Governments change&#x201D;&#x2014;that is what is really worrying him&#x2014;there is nothing he can teach this side of the House. Let us go back in history and see how a leader of the United Party, which was in power at that time, acted. It is common knowledge in this country that long after the death of Gen. Smuts and the taking over of the administration of the country by the National Party, he continued to govern and dominate the Defence headquarters and various other departments through his hand-picked officials. Some of them are still sitting there today. That hon. member cannot come to this side of the House with that kind of suggestion. That party can teach this side of the House nothing about this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member need not be afraid that this National Government will overstep the mark in this respect. As far as this matter is concerned, this National Party has been more than fair and more than tolerant throughout the years. Perhaps that hon. member was not in this country in those years to know what was going on; but the hon. member for North Rand and some of the other hon. members sitting there, will know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>What is important in considering these two clauses, is to ask oneself where these representations came from. These representations came to those of us who as M.P.s and M.P.C.s represent constituencies in which many hundreds of public servants are concentrated, but our Government waited until the representations were made via the channel of the Public Servants Association, the co-ordinated mouthpiece of all public servants, whichever party they may support. These representations, therefore, came from the Public Service as a whole and not just from the public servants who want to become members of the National Party.</p>

<p>The principle which is being advocated, is that of the freedom of the individual to exercise his democratic right of a say in the management of the country; not, in other words, to further the interests of a particular political party, as that hon. member fears. What have we found over the years in hard practice in the constituencies which are concerned with this matter&#x003F; We have found that numbers of public servants, with firm National Party convictions or firm United Party convictions&#x2014;in my constituency there are none who have Progressive Party convictions&#x2014;would very much like to serve their party openly and not covertly. This has been the position for both of the big parties throughout the years. Those hon. members know it. Clauses 3 and 4 now make provision for precisely that for which the public servants asked us; the freedom to be a member of a political party openly without fear of victimization and to be able to work for one&#x2019;s party in a dignified and responsible manner. We do not begrudge either our own supporters or the followers of the United Party this. What this amounts to is that this is a very large step in the right direction and we believe that no single official&#x2014;Nat, U.P., Prog, or whatever the case may be&#x2014;will use this concession irresponsibly. We have known throughout the years of officials who work for the United Party at election times. Everyone knows it. But what happened&#x003F; If those supporters of the United Party in the public service who worked for their party on an election day, were working in the spirit as reflected in the clauses of this Bill, we simply turned a blind eye and allowed them to continue. However, where we noticed that U.P. supporters in the Public Service were abusing their positions so as to undermine this Government, we made quick work of them, and hon. members know that. But that, too, is in the spirit of this Bill. If my people were to commit an infringement, the hon. member for North Rand would be the first to run to the Minister with stories and I would not hold it against him, but then, the same goes for me as well. Things went the same way in the National Party ranks as far as public servants were concerned. As a public servant I was an enrolled member of the National Party; I was that even before I entered the Public Service. I worked for my party openly and served as an office-bearer, but I did this in such a way as not to embarrass my Minister or the Secretary of my Department or my Party. Of course there were attempts from the side of the U.P. to victimize me, but because of correct conduct they were unable to substantiate the charges they had made.</p>

<p>This Bill attests to great confidence being placed in the whole of the Public Service by the Government, quite apart from the question of which party is concerned. It attests to great confidence in people who, in the nature of the matter, handle matters of a highly confidential and a highly <span class="col_6371-6372" refersTo="page_0253"/>secret nature. I believe that few officials will abuse this situation. If they were to abuse this concession from the National Party side, or the United Party side, or the side of another party, I believe there would be no sympathy for them from any quarters. One cannot blame all Opposition members for the political rights which public servants had under United Party rule, but here at the beginning of a new era it is necessary to record that we remember very well how officials with National Party convictions were gagged under Gen. Smuts&#x2019;s r&#x00E9;gime. Even to walk into one&#x2019;s office with <i>Die Burger</i> or <i>Die Transvaler</i> under one&#x2019;s arm, counted against one and was held against one when it came to promotion. Those hon. members know it.</p>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>That is not nonsense. There are members sitting in this House today who were officials under Gen. Smuts&#x2019;s r&#x00E9;gime and who were told when they walked into their offices with <i>Die Transvaler</i> under the arm, &#x201C;you get out of this office with your politics&#x201D;. That is true and those hon. members know it. In that way many promising officials were simply driven out of the Public Service and the Public Service was the poorer as a result. If those hon. members do not believe me, they can go and read Mr. Wennie du Plessies&#x2019;s book <i>Die Goue Draad",</i> then, perhaps, they will see the light.</p>

<p>As I have said, this National Party Government is a fair Government and after mature consideration it grants what the people ask and even runs the risk of perhaps having to put up with a few U.P. supporters in key positions in the Public Service&#x2014;a calculated risk! I want to say that this is the satisfaction of the wish of officials who have been hoping for years to be able to obtain an active membership of the National Party. They appreciate this concession greatly. It is a concession to them so as to enable them to play their role also in politics in the democracy which is a characteristic of the Government of this Republic of ours.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall make haste to try to reply to all the questions asked by hon. members in regard to this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point asked whether the proposed section 11(4) in respect of the return to Parliament in regard to the appointment to the administrative division of persons from outside the service will not result in the delay of such return. In general returns are tabled in February or March. It is not anticipated that the annual report in which these particulars will be furnished will be tabled at a later stage. The report covers the 12 months preceding 30th June of every year. An annual report will therefore contain the appointments made for every preceding July to December. Such appointments will be contained in the following annual report, i.e. at least 12 months later for appointments between July and December of each year. Consequently there will only be a lapse the first year, and subsequently the rectification will be automatic.</p>

<p>Then there is the question why appointments in the administrative division which are recommended by the commission and rejected by the State President, are not also reported to Parliament. The hon. member for Von Brandis asked the same question. Let me put it to you like this: In terms of the Public Service Act all administrative appointments have to be approved by the Public Service Commission. That is why it is stated in the Bill: &#x201C;Appointments approved by the Public Service Commission.&#x201D; They must all be approved by it. There are a few exceptions where appointments are not approved directly by the Public Service Commission, but by the Cabinet, but then such an appointment, which does not meet with the approval of the Public Service Commission, has to meet with the approval of the State President. As soon as the State President has approved it, the Public Service Commission has also approved it in terms of the Act. So it is not necessary, as the hon. member for Von Brandis requested, to insert additional words in that clause, for it is only necessary to say &#x201C;those approved by the Public Service Commission&#x201D;, because everything is in fact approved in terms of the Act by the Public Service Commission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question&#x003F; We always have to obtain information by way of questions to the hon. the Minister on the Order Paper in respect of those cases where appointments are made contrary to the recommendations of the Public Service Commission. What we are asking for is that that type of appointment should be reported in the report or should be tabled <span class="col_6373-6374" refersTo="page_0254"/>without our having to ask each year for this information.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That type of information must be reported in any case in terms of section 7(7) of the Public Service Act. That is the position at the moment in terms of the Act.</p>

<p>*It was then asked whether an amendment of section 13(7) in respect of the issuing of proclamations by the State President, the incorporation of which in the proposed Third Schedule of the Act is now being considered, does not perhaps introduce a new principle in terms of which the State President may now amend the Act by way of proclamation. The reply to that is that no new principle is being introduced. Section 27 of the present Act empowers the State President to amend only the existing First Schedule.</p>

<p>It was then asked why steps were not taken in the past against officers who disregarded section 17(g) of the Act. The reply there is that the onus to take steps against officers is not one which rests on the Public Service Commission, but in fact on the departmental head in question as such. The Commission only comes into the picture after officers have been found guilty of such contravention, and a penalty has to be imposed. The Commission is therefore not consulted in cases where officers are charged and acquitted, or where the charge is withdrawn.</p>

<p>I was then asked why the concession is only being made in respect of a relatively small group of officials, and whether it should not also include the service staff such as teachers and other provincial staff members. The reply is of course that we are here dealing with something which falls under the Public Service Commission in terms of the Public Service Act. We are not dealing now with provincial teachers who already have the right to participate in politics, and other services such as police services which do not yet have this right. The hon. member for Von Brandis, I think, or the hon. member for Green Point, came forward with the suggestion that we should do something to obtain some or other form of co-ordination between the services. I agree with the hon. member that this would be an ideal position, but I also think that this debate, in which the hon. member raised this question, will already serve as a stimulus to the other services to feel that there ought to be co-ordination, and that their administrations should, in some way or another, be brought together so that a joint decision can be taken in respect of the politics of the persons concerned.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not think it is necessary to take the initiative. I think the various staff associations are completely capable of organizing their own affairs. They will in fact take cognizance of the fact that the provincial administrations are allowing their people to participate in certain political activities, while the police in their turn do not allow this. They then have to decide among themselves whether there should be some or other form of co-ordinated action. I do not think that we should interfere with the various persons. I have now dealt with the question put by the hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Von Brandis. I shall deal in a moment with their argument concerning clauses 3 and 4. Before doing so, I want to thank the hon. member for Rissik sincerely for a very good, intelligent and thoroughly studied speech. Not only did it show that the hon. member represents public servants, but also that he took trouble to elucidate to us the entire historical background to this matter, in such a way that I was also able to understand it, and I appreciate this. The hon. member for Pretoria District also thanked us for this concession on behalf of the public servants. The hon. member for Von Brandis made a very interesting speech. He made a speech from an old-world public servants&#x2019; point of view, dating back to the old British tradition.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He advocated that public servants should be entirely separate from any politics. I think the hon. member has already conceded in his speech that times have changed tremendously, and that there are many people with many responsibilities. I think he will admit that a balance has to be struck between certain actions or modes of action in one&#x2019;s life, and certain obligations which one has to one&#x2019;s service. This applies to everyone, whether public servants, bank clerks or a person working for the Stock Exchange. <span class="col_6375-6376" refersTo="page_0255"/>For example, a person working on the Stock Exchange has to exercise a measure of discretion when purchasing shares, and then has to be able to decide for himself whether he is not taking advantage of the knowledge he acquired in that specific office and is not in that way giving himself an improper advantage. When I as a Deputy Minister appear before a political meeting, I must always bear in mind that I can never rid myself of the cloak of my responsibility. A balance has to be struck between how far a person can go under certain circumstances, and how far one must come back again to one&#x2019;s responsibility in respect of one&#x2019;s office. This is simply the responsibility all people have. The public servants have it too.</p>

<p>Let us consider the present position of the public servants. Is the hon. member aware that a public servant is entitled to be nominated as a candidate of a political party&#x003F; He may even pursue that nomination within the party to the point where he is either nominated or not nominated. Should he be nominated for the House of Assembly or for the Provincial Council, he has to resign immediately in terms of his regulations. Should he fail to be elected, no one will take any notice of it, and he will be able to continue with his service. That is the present position. In terms of public service regulation 13(2) an officer may at the moment become a member of a divisional council, city council, municipal council, village management board, etc., with the consent of his Minister. That is the present position. In other words, to a certain extent the public servant has already achieved a major breakthrough concerning his political activities, or his right to participate as individual in public life. Sir, I am very grateful that, as a representative of a constituency consisting to the extent of approximately 90% of public servants, I am today able to honour the promise made by the National Party to public servants that we would open the door to political activities to them. Ever since I can remember public servants have through the existing political organizations been making representations to political congresses to be allowed to be full-fledged citizens in this sense that they may also participate in political activities.</p>

In the two cases in question which I am thinking of at the moment&#x2014;and I do not want to mention any names here&#x2014;the two gentlemen both accepted nomination, but lost.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it was not wrong in terms of the Act. Sir, I say that I am very grateful that I, as a representative of a constituency in which the voters consist mainly of public servants, can bring them this great red-letter day in their lives. Sir, you heard what the hon. member for Rissik said. He depicted the history of this matter for us very well. For 25 years the National Party has cherished the ideal that the public servant should be exempted from certain restrictions and that he should be able to live the life of a full-fledged citizen. Sir, we did not proceed in a haphazard way. When the Public Service Association did not agree with us, we did not press the matter. We waited until the time was ripe; we waited until the association itself requested that its members be allowed to participate in politics; we waited until the Public Service Commission was satisfied with this; we waited until the time was ripe and now we have come forward with this Bill, and I say that it is a glad day for us. I am grateful that the Minister has afforded me this opportunity of piloting this Bill through its Second Reading, because it is a great day for public servants, particularly in Pretoria. Sir, we have stated unequivocally in clause <span class="col_6377-6378" refersTo="page_0256"/>4 that an officer or employee may be a member of and may serve on the management of a lawful political party; that he may attend a public political meeting but may not preside or speak at such a meeting; that he may not draw up or publish or cause to be published any writing, or deliver a public speech to promote or prejudice the interests of any political party. Sir, is there in any way a restriction&#x003F; There is a restriction in section 17(g) (clause 3) which provides that he may not make use of his position in the public service to promote or prejudice the interests of a political party. The hon. member for Von Brandis said that this was very vague. Sir, it is vague, and the reason for its being vague, is because it depends on the discretion of the public servant. This will be proved, just as all facts are proved. The facts will indicate whether the person is promoting or prejudicing a political party. The facts will indicate this in the inquiry. But we believe that the public servant is mature enough to know that he may not use his position in the public service to promote or prejudice the interests of a political party. We also know that he is now a full-fledged citizen. He can be a member of the management of a lawful political party. He may attend public political meetings. He may not preside at these. He may not speak at such meetings. He may not draw up or publish or cause to be published any writings, or deliver a public speech. What more does he want, Sir&#x003F; I say this is a glad day for the public servant and a matter of great pride that the National Party has eventually been able to realize one of its ideals, with peace among all and with the consent of the hon. members on the opposite side, so that the public servant may now again practise his politics.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is a bulky piece of legislation, and it is also a very important Bill, and for that reason I can only do justice to it if I take up a considerable amount of the time of this House in dealing with it.</p>

<p>In 1963 a Commission of Inquiry into the Companies Act, 1926 (Act 46 of 1926) was appointed under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice van Wyk de Vries to investigate all aspects of the present companies legislation and to draw up a draft Bill on the basis of this investigation. Two reports and a draft Bill were submitted to the State President by the commission. These two reports and the draft Bill were tabled in the House of Assembly. They were also published for general information as documents R.P. 45/1970 and R.P. 31/1972. Therefore, hon. members already have copies of the draft Bill.</p>

<p>Volume II of the report, published as document R.P. 31/1972, contains an explanatory memorandum in which the various clauses of the Bill are explained, with suitable reference to the recommendations of the commission as contained in the two reports.</p>

<p>After publication of the report of the commission, various interested bodies, which included the National Council of Chartered Accountants and the Association of Law Societies of the Republic of South Africa, commented on the draft Bill.</p>

<p>A great number of the proposals submitted by the Council of Accountants, the Law Society and other interested parties were included in the Bill now before the House. The deviations which occur between the draft Bill of the commission and the Bill now before this House, owe their origin chiefly to the proposals received from the various interested bodies. Other amendments to the Bill proposed by the Commission were effected to facilitiate the administrative arrangements in the office of the Registrar of Companies, and in the offices of companies. Examples of these include, <i>inter alia,</i> the provisions in the amended Bill prescribing the forms which have to form part of the register in the Companies Registration Office in order to ensure that the information contained therein may be used by every company for writing up its registers. Furthermore it is provided in the amended Bill that directors who hold more than one directorship are given the choice, in respect of the furnishing of particulars of other directorships in the annual return, to indicate one of the companies in whose records the information concerning his various directorships is furnished, and provisions are also included which simplify the <span class="col_6379-6380" refersTo="page_0257"/>methods for the payment of fees upon the incorporation of a company.</p>

<p>The general approach of the Commission to the existing Companies Act was to regard it as a statute which was aimed primarily at achieving a harmonious balance between the interests of a company, its directors, its shareholders and its creditors. Consequently the Commission, in considering the amendments to and the incorporation of new provisions in the Bill, set about its task with circumspection.</p>

<p>However, the Commission expressed its concern at the failure to uphold the provisions of the present Companies Act and, in particular, at the numerous less important contraventions in regard to which provision had been made in the Act. In respect of these offences, which are important from the point of view of the administration of the Act, provision has also been made in the amended draft Bill, apart from the penalties which may be imposed by the courts upon conviction, for automatic sanctions on companies and company officials.</p>

<p>Furthermore the Commission found that in its present form the Act manifested a lack of logical and orderly arrangement: that it, in addition, gave the impression of being especially complicated; and that, in many cases, it created conditions of uncertainty. These deficiencies are attributable to the fact that for the past 60 years there has been no consolidation of the Companies Act in South Africa. The 60year-long process of piecemeal adaptation of the Companies Act consequently resulted in an unsatisfactory Afrikaans version, with the result that the terminology is in numerous respects archaic, indefensible and at variance with the language of the Afrikaans business community. Consequently it was decided to rearrange the Companies Act in its entirety with the object of arranging its provisions properly; of supplementing it at the same time by means of new principles; and of bringing the texts in both official languages into line with each other.</p>

<p>With regard to the possible problems which may be experienced in practice as a result of any alterations of the legal principles included in the Bill, the Commission recommended the appointment of a standing advisory committee with the object of investigating, considering, and reporting on the desirability of future amendments to the new Act.</p>

<p>This means therefore that where radical amendments affecting the principle are included in the new legislation, there will be a body which will, on a permanent basis, maintain supervision over, and be able to make recommendations concerning the solving of any practical problems which may manifest themselves in the application of the Act in question.</p>

<p>The Registrar of Companies will be responsible for the administration of the standing advisory committee. I envisage appointing this standing advisory committee as soon as possible after the promulgation of the Act, so that the committee may immediately commence its task of considering, as these may be necessary, further adjustments to the Act, and of supervising the drafting of the numerous regulations arising from the Act.</p>

<p>Furthermore the standing committee will have to give consideration to certain proposals made by the Council of Accountants and the Law Society and other interested parties which could not be included in the Bill owing to the fact that a further investigation of these proposals was deemed necessary. I want to emphasize once again that the committee will give its attention forthwith to any representations in this regard so that, if necessary, the appropriate amendment of the Act may be submitted to Parliament for consideration at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p>I should now like to furnish a brief explanation of the most important new principles included in the Bill. Unless it is necessary, I shall not deal with any provisions of the existing Act which have also been included in the Bill.</p>

<debateSection name="#definitions">

<heading>DEFINITIONS</heading>

<p>Clause 1 of the Bill contains the conventional definitions which are incorporated in all legislation. The most important new definitions which appear in this clause, are&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) &#x201C;controlled and controlling companies&#x201D;&#x2014;this definition is the same as the one which appears in respect of a holding company and subsidiary in section 90<i>nov</i> of the existing Act;</li>

<li>(b) the definition of a &#x201C;holding company&#x201D; refers to that company which holds in its own name, or in the name of its nominee, at least 30% <span class="col_6381-6382" refersTo="page_0258"/>of the issued share capital of another company, which is called a &#x201C;subsidiary&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(c) the words &#x201C;manager&#x201D; and &#x201C;officer&#x201D; are now being clearly defined in order to bring out the precise meaning of the word.</li>

</ol>

<p>Subclause (2) of clause 1 of the Bill contains the principle that, in cases where a person may give advice to directors in his professional capacity, it is not deemed that the directors, if they should act on such advice, acted in accordance with the directions or instructions of such a person. Certain other definitions appear in the separate chapters to which they apply.</p>

<heading>ADMINISTRATION OF ACT</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 5-18)</summary>

<p>In addition to the exemptions from liability conferred on the Registrar of Companies and officers of the Companies Registration Office, similar exemptions are being conferred in clause 8 on auditors, liquidators and judicial managers in respect of opinions in regard to the company and directors which they express in good faith in any reports. Fees collected by the Registrar may, in terms of clause 10, be paid by means of revenue stamps, a die approved by the Secretary for Inland Revenue, or in such manner as the Registrar may direct. The Registrar shall submit an annual report on company matters to the Minister for tabling in both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>The power to make regulations in terms of the Act is being conferred on the Minister. The Minister may, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, prescribe fees and the conditions of service and allowances of members of the standing advisory committee, or any subcommittee of that advisory committee. Provision is also being made for the insertion of penal provisions in the regulations in cases where such regulations are contravened. The State President may amend or supplement the Schedules to the Act by way of Proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<heading>TYPES AND FORMS OF COMPANIES, CONVERSIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON PARTNERSHIPS AND ASSOCIATES</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 19-31)</summary>

<p>The types of compani&#x00E8;s for which provision is being made in clause 19 are private and public companies with a share capital, as well as companies without a share capital with limited liability of the members. The latter type is called &#x201C;company limited by guarantee&#x201D;, and is deemed to be a public company. Associations not for gain are dealt with in clause 21. The main object for which such a company may be formed is clearly defined in the Act, and they are similarly regarded as being companies limited by guarantee. The consent of the Minister shall not, as is at present the case, be required for the establishment of such a company. An amendment of the Income Tax Act, 1962, is, however, being envisaged by means of which the taxability, or otherwise, of associations of this kind will, as is the case with other similar institutions, be determined by the Secretary for Internal Revenue. Clause 22 up to and including 24 deal with the conversion of private companies into public companies, and <i>vice versa,</i> and with the conversion of a company limited by guarantee into a private or public company, and <i>vice versa.</i> A private company, a public company and a company limited by guarantee may be converted into a company for gain, but not <i>vice versa.</i> The conversion of public companies and companies limited by guarantee requires merely a special resolution, subsequent to which a notice to such effect is published in the <i>Gazette.</i> This notice shall also be sent by post to any creditor. It will not be necessary to obtain the prior consent of a court or, as far as a private company is concerned to submit a statement instead of a prospectus to the Registrar. The notices in question are also being waived as far as private companies are concerned.</p>

<p>An unlimited company may, as is the case with a public company, be converted into any other type of company. Since no provisions in respect of unlimited companies have been inserted in the Bill, the provisions of the present Act remain applicable to them as if the latter Act were not being repealed except that, if these companies have not been converted into some or other type of company after expiration of a year after the new Companies Act has come into force, they will be regarded as public companies.</p>

<p>The provisions in regard to partnerships exceeding 20 persons are not being changed, except that the Minister may exempt persons in certain organized professions from the said provisions by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<heading><span class="col_6383-6384" refersTo="page_0259"/>FORMATION, OBJECTS, POWERS, NAMES, REGISTRATION AND INCORPORATION OF COMPANIES, MATTERS INCIDENTAL THERETO AND DEREGISTRATION</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 32-73)</summary>

<p>Although the number of persons necessary for forming a public company is still seven, a single person may form a private company. The capacity of a company is determined by its main object, as set out in the memorandum of association, and this capacity also includes an unlimited freedom to pursue ancillary objects, except such objects as are expressly excluded in its memorandum. Under the new Act a company shall have unlimited powers, including those powers set out in Schedule 2 of the Act. A company may limit its powers by including any such form of limitation in its memorandum of association.</p>

<p>Clause 35 contains, with minor amendments, the provisions of section 71 of the present Act. It is expressly provided that, on presentation of the memorandum for registration purposes, a pre-incorporation contract shall also be lodged, and in addition that a signatory to the memorandum of association may not certify the copies of the contract.</p>

<p>One of the most important principles included in the existing companies legislation is the <i>ultra vires</i> rule which provides that a company possesses only such capacity and powers as are set out in its memorandum of association, and that any act by it which exceeds this capacity and these powers is void. Consequently, companies are formed with cumbersome and complicated memorandums of association, but in spite of that it is found, time and again, in legal proceedings, that in each such case the company in question exceeded its capacity and powers, which led to the creditors and others being prejudiced. Clause 36 now eliminates the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine as far as it concerns persons who deal with the company, and it will no longer be necessary for external parties to acquaint themselves with the capacity and powers of the company with which they are dealing. The limitations as set out in the memorandum of association are, however, still applicable to the acts of the company in regard to its members and between its members and directors.</p>

<p>The exceptions in regard to the giving of financial assistance for the purchase of shares of a company are being limited by clause 38 to companies whose main business is the lending of money, and not as at present where the lending of money forms part of the ordinary business of the company.</p>

<p>Furthermore clause 39 limits the right of a subsidiary to be a member of its holding company. The exception in section 24<i>bis</i> (3) of the present Act, that a subsidiary may remain a member of the holding company after it has become a subsidiary, falls away.</p>

<p><i>Names of Companies:</i></p>

<p>Clauses 41 up to and including 51 deal with the registration and other matters in regard to the names of companies. The Registrar may refuse to register a company with a name which in his opinion is undesirable. In due course he will publish directives concerning names which he regards as being undesirable. The reservation of a name will be valid for two months and, in special oases, for a period not exceeding thee months. Provision is being made for the registration of translation of names into one of the official languages of the Republic, for shortened forms of names, and also for defensive names. An example of defensive names are names registered as trade marks for goods or services. Where companies change their names the Registrar may also allow the original name of the company to remain entered in the register for a period of 12 months after such a change. For any decisions in regard to names the Registrar may call for affidavits from interested parties and he shall, on request, furnish reasons for such decisions. The court has the power to review these decisions.</p>

<p>The names of companies, when being used, shall be qualified by the necessary additions. In this way, for example, the name of the country in which the company is registered shall be indicated in the case of external companies, while in the case of local companies it shall be indicated whether the company has been incorporated not for gain.</p>

<p><i>Memorandum of Association</i> (clauses 52-58):</p>

<p>The memorandum of association of a company shall no longer contain the expression &#x201C;the liability of the members is limited&#x201D;. However, the memorandum may contain special conditions and requirements, additional to those stipulated in the <span class="col_6385-6386" refersTo="page_0260"/>Act, for the altering thereof. In the case of a private company one or more persons may sign the memorandum. Subject to any special conditions contained in the memorandum, a company may by special resolution alter any of the objects and powers of the company in its memorandum.</p>

<p><i>Articles of Association</i> (clauses 59-62):</p>

<p>In Table A of Schedule 1 the articles of association for public companies, and in Table B of that Schedule, the articles of association for private companies, are prescribed. Provision exists in the statutory provisions in question for any alterations or omissions a company wishes to have effected in its articles of association. Provisions in such articles of association for compulsory loans by members of the company to the company are of no force or effect.</p>

<p><i>Registration and Incorporation</i> (clause 6372):</p>

<p>Upon the incorporation of a company, a non-recurring amount, which includes office fees and the existing share capital tax, is paid. The necessary amendment of the Stamp Duties Act, 1968, to fit in with these new provisions, will be submitted to Parliament at a subsequent stage.</p>

<p><i>Deregistration</i> (clause 73):</p>

<p>The expression &#x201C;deregistration&#x201D; is now being used instead of the expression &#x201C;removal of defunct companies from register&#x201D;. When the Registrar intends deregistering a company he shall, in addition to the normal notice to the company and its directors, also send to the auditor of the company in question notice of the intended deregistration.</p>

<heading>SHARE CAPITAL, REDUCTION OF CAPITAL, SHARES, ALLOTMENT AND ISSUE OF SHARES, DEBENTURES AND TRANSFERS</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 74-141)</summary>

<p>A further new principle included in the Bill is the one contained in clause 74. This clause provides that the share capital of a company may be constituted by shares having a par value or shares having no par value. Other provisions arising out of this principle are the provision that issued shares having par value may be converted into shares having no par value, and <i>vice versa.</i> Shares of the same class or kind shall consist either of shares having par value or shares having no par value.</p>

<p>The proceeds of the issue of shares of no par value is stated capital and when shares of no par value are issued at a price which is less than the previous issue price, such issue shall be approved by the company by special resolution.</p>

<p>As far as increase of capital is concerned, the existing share capital tax thereon is paid as part of the office fees prescribed by the Minister.</p>

<p>In clause 76 of the Bill which deals with the share premium account provision is being made for the substitution of the words &#x201C;capitalization shares&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;bonus shares&#x201D; as used in the present Act. The share premium account may also be utilized in defraying the costs of creating shares or debentures of the company. A further provision in this clause is that, in cases where assets are acquired and no consideration, apart from the issue of shares, is recorded, the assets shall be valued and the difference between the par value of the shares and the value of the assets shall be transferred to the share premium account.</p>

<p>A company which had issued shares at a premium prior to 1st January, 1953, shall, in respect of any balance of share premiums existing at the date of commencement of section 76(4) of the new Act, be subject to all the applicable provisions of the Act.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of capital</i> (clauses 83-90):</p>

<p>Clauses 83 up to and including 90 deal with the reduction of capital. Where a company has no creditors, or where the creditors have consented, a company may reduce its capital by special resolution. The consent of the creditors, if any, shall, together with the special resolution, be lodged with the Registrar for registration. In all other cases application has to be made to the court which has the additional power to approve the repayment of capital by way of instalments. However, no payment of an instalment may be made without the written consent of the Registrar.</p>

<p><i>Allotment and issue of shares</i> (clause 92102<b>):</b></p>

<p>Shares may not be allotted or issued by a company unless they are fully paid-up. Existing companies with partially paid-up <span class="col_6387-6388" refersTo="page_0261"/>shares remain subject to the provisions of the present Act in so far as those shares are concerned, but new share issues shall be fully paid-up. Shares that are not fully paid-up may be allotted for the purpose of their being offered for sale to the public by means of a prospectus, containing an offer to purchase, as fully paid-up shares. Where shares have been allotted or issued irregularly the court may validate such allotment or issue.</p>

<p>Returns to the Registrar relating to the allotment of shares need no longer, as is the case under the present Act, contain particulars of the names of the persons to whom they have been issued.</p>

<p>Share certificates shall be signed by two directors, or by a director and an officer, and such signature may be affixed by autographic or mechanical means. The Registrar may also extend the period within which share certificates may be issued.</p>

<p>Clause 99 authorizes a company to convert preference shares into redeemable preference shares by special resolution.</p>

<p><i>Register of members</i> (clauses 103-115):</p>

<block name="quote">A new provision has been included in clause 103 by means of which the names of executors and administrators of estates and curators may be entered in a register of members as members, <i>nomine officii.</i></block>

<p>Furthermore it is being provided that closed accounts in a register of members may be disposed of after the expiration of a period of fifteen years from the date on which the persons to which such closed accounts refer, have ceased to be members of the company.</p>

<p><i>Debentures</i> (clauses 116-131):</p>

<block name="quote">The new provisions in respect of debentures may be summarized as follows.</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) An officer of the company may not be a trustee for the holders of debentures of the company;</li>

<li>(b) redeemable debentures which are convertible into shares of the company are excluded from the power conferred by section 93 of the present Act on companies to re-issue redeemed debentures;</li>

<li>(c) debentures in respect of any issue shall be qualified by the words &#x201C;secured&#x201D; or &#x201C;unsecured&#x201D;, as the case may be;</li>

<li>(d) the method of mortgaging or binding of security of debentures is clearly defined; and</li>

<li>(e) a wholly owned subsidiary shall be deemed to have the power to mortgage its property as collateral security for the issue of debentures by its holding company.</li>

</ol>

<p><i>Transfer of Shares and Debentures</i> (clauses 133-141):</p>

<p>Since the transfer of shares and debentures of listed companies is in essence a companies matter, it is deemed desirable to include the provisions of the Securities&#x2019; Transfer Act, 1965, in clauses 134 up to and including 138, and 141, of the Bill, and to repeal that Act in its entirety.</p>

<p>The method of transfer of other shares has been extended. <i>Inter alia,</i> it is being provided that a transfer of shares may not be registered unless a proper instrument of transfer has been delivered to the company. Where a company refuses to register a transfer, it shall give notice to the transferor and transferee.</p>

<p><i>Restriction on Offering Shares for Sale</i> (clause 141):</p>

<p>The provisions of the existing Act relating to the offering of shares for sale have been extended in clause 141 of the Bill by providing that, in respect of a public company, the statement relating to the offer for sale shall be registered by the Registrar before issue. The statement may not be issued after the expiration of more than three months after the date of registration. In addition the date of registration shall appear on the statement.</p>

<p>Another requirement is that copies of the last annual financial statements, interim reports and provisional annual financial statements, if any, shall be affixed to the said statement.</p>

<p>The words &#x201C;to any member of the public&#x201D; which occur in the corresponding section of the existing Act, have been omitted from the Bill.</p>

<debateSection name="#offering_of_shares_and_prospectus">

<heading><span class="col_6389-6390" refersTo="page_0262"/>OFFERING OF SHARES AND PROSPECTUS</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 142-169)</summary>

<p>Chapter VI deals with the offering of shares and the prospectus. The definitions are included in clause 142. A clear distinction is being made between an &#x201C;offer and an &#x201C;offer to the public&#x201D;. The definition of an &#x201C;untrue statement&#x201D; relates not only to misleading statements, but also to the omission from the prospectus of any matter, regardless of whether its inclusion is required by the Act or not.</p>

<p>The most important new principles incorporated in the Bill in respect of the offering of shares, are as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) an offer of shares may only be made in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and no offer may be made by an external company which is not registered in the Republic, or by any other unregistered company;</li>

<li>(b) an improved and simplified description is being furnished of offers which are not offers to the public;</li>

<li>(c) a rights issue to members of a company with the right to refuse the issue, is an offer of shares to the public and requires a shortened form of prospectus to which an application form may be attached;</li>

<li>(d) the full instructions with regard to the content of the prospectus are set out in Schedule 3;</li>

<li>(e) the Registrar does not register a prospectus unless the requirements of the Act have been met;</li>

<li>(f) a contract mentioned in a prospectus may only be altered a year after date of issue, or six months after the date of issue if it is done with the consent of a general meeting of the company;</li>

<li>(g) no allotment of shares may be made after the expiration of a period of four months after the date of registration of the prospectus, and the date of registration shall appear on the application form; and</li>

<li>(h) when a prospectus contains a statement that an application for consent to a listing of the shares on a Stock Exchange has been or is going to be made, the prospectus may not be issued before such application has been made. Shares allotted on such a prospectus are subject to the approval of the Stock Exchange to their listing, and if the Stock Exchange refuses such listing the amounts received for subscription to the shares shall be repaid by the company together with any interest, if any.</li>

</ol>

<debateSection name="#administration_of_companies">

<heading>ADMINISTRATION OF COMPANIES</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 170-207)</summary>

<p>Every company with a share capital shall acquire a certificate to commence business, and if it commences business without such a certificate, every signatory of the instrument and the directors are personally liable for the obligations of the company. Such a certificate is issued at the request of the company, accompanied by a statement by the directors that, in their opinion, the capital of the company is adequate and, if not, how it is going to be augmented and what the extent of the further financing is going to be.</p>

<p>Within one month after the end of its financial year, every company shall submit an annual return to the Registrar. The return shall contain a concise history of the company as regards its capital, main business, particulars of forms submitted to the Registrar during the financial year, the names of directors, share issues, and so on. This shall be accompanied by the separate consent of directors to their appointments as directors, together with particulars of their other directorships. Where the same director is involved with a number of companies, he may indicate one company in whose return his other directorships are mentioned.</p>

<p>The expression &#x201C;annual duty&#x201D; is being substituted for the expression &#x201C;company licence&#x201D; which was used in section 228 of the existing Act. The annual duty is payable to the Registrar, together with the annual return or, in the case of a company which is commencing business, the application for a certificate to commence business.</p>

<p>Annual duties are paid on the issued share capital together with the amount of the share premium account or stated capital. <span class="col_6391-6392" refersTo="page_0263"/>The rate of payment is not being altered. An external company will pay annual duty on the same basis as at present, but the annual duty will be collected on lodgement of its annual return. In cases where an external company maintains only a share register office or a share transfer office in the Republic, it pays a minimum amount which is not calculated on the total issued capital and share premium accounts.</p>

<p>The rate of the additional penalty fees for the late lodgement of documents and forms, or for failure to pay the annual duty, is being raised considerably. In this way, for example, a company with an issued share capital of R200, which lodges its annual return a month after the prescribed period, shall have to pay a total amount of R75. However, the total penalty fees which may be collected from one company in any financial year is limited to R1 000.</p>

<p><i>Meetings of the Company</i> (clause 179-192):</p>

<p>An annual general meeting of a company shall be held within 18 months after incorporation. If a company fails to hold any annual general meeting within the prescribed time, it is liable to pay to the Registrar an amount of R1 per day for every day during which the default to hold the meeting continues. The maximum payment of this nature is R20.</p>

<p>The Registrar may, at the request of any member of the company or his legal representative, convene a general meeting of the company.</p>

<p>Clause 184 also provides that in the case of a company having only one member, such member present in person or by proxy shall constitute a meeting.</p>

<p>The requirements of the existing Act relating to the number of members of a company who may request that notice of a resolution, which is going to be proposed at a meeting, shall be sent to members by the company, are being relaxed. The present statutory provisions that an average amount of R200 shall be paid up on their shares, are being deleted.</p>

<p>Clause 192 provides that at a compulsory adjournment of a meeting, the meeting shall be adjourned to a day not earlier than seven days and not later than 21 days after the date on which the meeting was thus adjourned. In the case of a public company notice of such an adjournment shall be given in a newspaper circulating in the province where the registered office of the company is situated, stating the date, time and place to which the meeting has been adjourned, the matter before the meeting at the time when it was adjourned, and the ground for the adjournment. A private company may, instead of publishing a notice in a newspaper, notify its members of such an adjournment by registered post.</p>

<p><i>Voting Rights and Voting</i> (clauses 193198):</p>

<p>In respect of votes of members, the principle of the present Act, in accordance with which each member has a vote for every share which he holds regardless of whether it is a share having a par value or a share having no par value, is being maintained. The concession to certain existing companies who may issue shares with no voting rights, is being withdrawn, and any share issued in future shall be issued with voting rights.</p>

<p>Where power of attorney is being granted by a company to give voting rights to a proxy, sufficient open space shall be allowed on the instrument to enable a member to nominate a proxy of his own choice. The instrument shall also make provision for the way in which the proxy shall vote.</p>

<p><i>Special Resolutions</i> (clauses 199-203):</p>

<heading>DIRECTORS</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 208-214)</summary>

<p>Clause 211 deals with an important provision in respect of directors. A director shall consent in person to his appointment as a director. An appointment of a director does not take effect before the company has received a communication from the Registrar that the latter has received the written consent of the director to be appointed as a director. If such a communication is not received by the company within a period of three months from the date on which the director forwarded to the Registrar his written consent to serve as a director, the appointment of the director lapses unless the court otherwise directs. The same provisions are applicable to officers whose names have to appear in the register of directors and officers. It is an offence to publish the name of a person as a director of a company if he did not consent to his appointment.</p>

<p><i>Register of Directors and Officers</i> (clauses 215-217):</p>

<p>The name of the auditor shall be entered in the register of directors and officers and made known to the Registrar by means of an extract from the register. Another requirement is that the date of birth of a director or officer shall be entered in the register.</p>

<p>The Registrar shall maintain a central register of directors and officers.</p>

<p><i>Restrictions on Directors, their Powers and Certain Acts</i> (clauses 221-228):</p>

<p>Directors may not allot or issue shares of a company unless this is done in terms of a general or specific authorization of the company conferred by a resolution of a general meeting. If a general authorization of this nature is conferred on directors, it is only valid until the next annual general meeting, or another general meeting of the company.</p>

<p>As regards the power of the directors, with the authorization of the company conferred by a general meeting, to issue shares to themselves or to their nominees, the directors or their nominees who possess one-fifth of the voting powers instead of the prescribed one-third as is provided in the existing Act, may now consent to resolutions of this nature.</p>

<p>In addition it is being provided that, when directors issue shares to themselves or their nominees in contravention of the provisions of the Act, they are guilty of an offence and shall compensate the company for any loss or damages.</p>

<p>Directors and future directors may not, unless with the authorization of a special resolution of the company, participate in share option plans of the company, and they are also prohibited from dealing in options in respect of listed shares and debentures of the company.</p>

<p>The prohibition of loans to directors or officers is also being extended to future directors or officers of the company and to other companies which are controlled by its controlling company. An exception is being made in respect of a company whose main business is the lending of money.</p>

<p>Payments to directors and former directors for loss of office, or in connection with arrangements and take-over schemes, shall be approved by special resolution of the company.</p>

<p><i>Interests of and Dealings by Directors and Others in Shares of Company</i> (clauses 229-233):</p>

<p>Clauses 229 up to and including 233 deal with the material interests of and dealings by directors and others in shares of the company. The provisions of section 70<i>nov</i> of the existing Act have been improved by requiring that the directors shall determine which officers, persons and former directors of the company have knowledge of any information concerning transactions or proposed transactions of the company which are not publicly known and which, if they become publicly known, may be expected materially to affect the price of the shares or debentures of the company. The names of the persons thus determined shall be entered in a register of interests, together with particulars of the number of shares or debentures, if any, held by each of them, as well as particulars of any other material interests in such shares or debentures with <span class="col_6395-6396" refersTo="page_0265"/>mention of the dates of exchange of the shares or debentures. Any person has the right to inspect the register, and the Registrar may require that extracts from the register shall be sent to him.</p>

<p>It is regarded as an offence if the directors or other persons who have knowledge of information concerning a transaction or proposed transaction or other affairs of the company which may materially affect the price of the company&#x2019;s shares or debentures, deal in the shares or debentures before such inside information has been publicly announced on a Stock Exchange or in a newspaper or through the medium of the radio or television.</p>

<p><i>Interests of Directors and Officers in Contracts</i> (clauses 234-238):</p>

<p>Clauses 234 up to and including 238 deal with the provisions of section 70<i>quin</i> of the Act relating to the disclosure by directors and officers of their material interests in contracts entered into by the company. These interests shall be entered in the register of interests in contracts.</p>

<p>An ancillary provision is that statements of interests are entered in the minute book of meetings of directors.</p>

<p>In respect of the register of interests in contracts, this is open to inspection by any person. The auditor of the company shall convince himself that the minute book, attendance registers of directors, and registers of interests are maintained by the company.</p>

<heading>&#x2020;REMEDIES OF MEMBERS</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 252-268)</summary>

<p>I now wish to turn to Chapter IX of the Bill which deals with the remedies available to members of a company.</p>

<p><i>Relief from oppression:</i></p>

<p>Clause 252 of the Bill embodies a number of material changes in the remedies available to members of a company who may suffer from oppressive or unfairly prejudicial action on the part of the company. The provision in the existing Act which stipulates that circumstances which justify the liquidation of a company should exist before an application for such relief can be made to Court, has been deleted from the Bill. In addition, clause 252 provides that members may lodge objections against an alteration of the memorandum and against reductions in the capital of a company as well as changes in the rights in respect of shares or the conversion of a company into a private company or <i>vice versa.</i></p>

<p><i>Matters incidental to Investigations</i> (clauses 263-265):</p>

<p>The provisos in the existing Act in respect of bankers and attorneys are further limited by clause 264 which provides that a banker shall not be exempted from the disclosure of details of a person on whose behalf that banker holds shares in the name of his nominee.</p>

<p><i>Proceedings on behalf of Companies</i> (clauses 266-268):</p>

<p>Where a company suffers a loss or is deprived of an advantage as a result of certain acts or omissions of the directors, past directors, officers and past officers, a member of the company may request that the irregularity be rectified. If the company should fail to act in response to such a request, the member may apply to the court for the appointment of a <i>curator ad litem,</i> and if the court is satisfied that grounds for the request for an investigation exist, the court may issue an order for the appointment of a provisional <i>curator ad litem</i> who must investigate the alleged irregularity and report to it.</p>

<p>On the return day, and after consideration of the report, the court may refuse or confirm the appointment of a <i>curator ad litem.</i> If the appointment is confirmed the court issues such further orders as it may deem fit for the institution of proceedings in the name of the company and to rectify those matters in regard to which a complaint has been received.</p>

<p>The provisional <i>curator ad litem</i> and the <i>curator ad litem</i> have the same powers to question the directors and officers of a company and to investigate the books and documents of a company as those which are conferred on an inspector.</p>

<p>If a company is of the opinion that the disclosure of information to the provisional <i>curator ad litem</i> or to the <i>curator ad litem</i> may be harmful to its interests, it may apply to the court for relief in which case the court may issue such orders as it may deem fit.</p>

<p>It is provided, furthermore, that security for costs should be given to the company <span class="col_6397-6398" refersTo="page_0266"/>if there is reason to believe that the applicant, if he should fail in his application, would not be able to pay these costs.</p>

<debateSection name="#auditors">

<heading>AUDITORS</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 269-283)</summary>

<p><i>Appointment:</i></p>

<p>The first appointment of an auditor of a company may be made when the company is incorporated. Otherwise, the name of the auditors must be advised to the Registrar within a period of three weeks from the date of incorporation. If the directors should fail to appoint an auditor, such an appointment may be made by the Registrar.</p>

<p>A firm may also be appointed as an auditor of a company.</p>

<p>An auditor can only resign by giving written notice to this effect to the company, which notice should be accompanied by an affidavit that he has no reason to believe that any material irregularity has occurred in the conduct of the affairs of the company. The directors must immediately thereafter appoint another auditor in his place and must send to the Registrar the affidavit accompanied by a return of an extract from the register of directors and officers. The resignation of an auditor comes into effect only after the Registrar had acknowledged receipt of the affidavit and the return. A new disqualification for auditors is incorporated in the Bill, which provides that an auditor who was also a director of the company during its financial year is not qualified to be an auditor of that company. It is provided, furthermore, that the remuneration of the auditor must be indicated under a separate heading in the income statement of a company. A difference is made between remuneration for audit services and remuneration for other specified services agreed to between the company and the auditor.</p>

<heading>ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 284-310)</summary>

<p><i>Accounting Records:</i></p>

<p>The expressions &#x201C;annual accounts&#x201D;, &#x201C;profit and loss account&#x201D; and &#x201C;books of account&#x201D; appearing in the existing Act are replaced by the expressions &#x201C;annual financial statements&#x201D;, &#x201C;income statement&#x201D; and &#x201C;accounting records&#x201D;, while the expressions &#x201C;accounting period&#x201D; and &#x201C;financial year&#x201D; are used when appropriate. Accounting records must be maintained fairly to present the state of affairs and the business of the company and to explain the transactions and financial position of the trade or business of the company. In addition, a register of fixed assets, with an indication of the dates on which they were acquired, must be kept. In respect of the first financial year after the commencement of the Act, the necessary details for the register may be compiled by means of an inventory. Detailed provisions relating to the determination and alteration of the financial year of a company are contained in clause 285 of the Bill. These provisions should, of course, be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act. Annexure 4 to the Bill prescribes the manner in which annual financial statements should be compiled for presentation to the annual general meeting.</p>

<p><i>Accounting by Holding Companies</i> (clauses 288-294):</p>

<p>In the provisions of the Bill which deal with the accountability of holding companies, the expressions &#x201C;group reports&#x201D; and &#x201C;group annual financial statements&#x201D; are used to replace the expressions &#x201C;group accounts&#x201D; and &#x201C;consolidated annual financial statements&#x201D; appearing in the existing Act. Group reports and group annual financial statements must fairly present, in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, the state of affairs and business of the company and its subsidiaries at the end of the relevant financial year. Clauses 290 and 291 contain provisions as to when annual financial statements should be consolidated, and when it is not necessary to deal with subsidiaries in such statements. The next three clauses cover the position where the accounting periods of the holding and subsidiary companies are not the same. The Registrar, instead of the Minister as is provided in the present Act, is authorized to grant approval to companies not to deal with subsidiaries in their group annual financial statements. The Minister is granted the authority to exempt from, or to prohibit the disclosure of specific information relating to the state of affairs of a company. The principles relating to the preparation of group reports, which appear in the annexure to the existing Act, are now embodied in the new Act itself.</p>

<p><span class="col_6399-6400" refersTo="page_0267"/><i>Disclosure of Certain Matters in Financial Statements</i> (clauses 295-297):</p>

<p>In respect of loans to directors and officers of a company, the expression &#x201C;loan&#x201D; is extended to include money, shares, debentures and other property. Loans which are not repaid during the financial year must be disclosed in the annual financial statements. In addition, details should be disclosed not only of direct loans but also of loans which have been made indirectly. And whenever reference is made to a controlled company, this includes a controlled company which was such a company at any time during the financial year of the controlling company.</p>

<p>Whenever a company grants to its directors, and others associated with it, credit which is not repaid according to the normal business practices of the company, details of such credits should be disclosed by means of a note in the annual financial statements of the company.</p>

<p><i>Directors&#x2019; Report</i> (clause 299):</p>

<p>Annexure 4 set out the requirements in respect of the report of the directors. Clause 299 provides, furthermore, that the directors&#x2019; report should deal with every matter which is material for the appreciation by members of the company of the state of affairs, the business and the profit or loss of the company and its subsidiaries.</p>

<p><i>Auditor&#x2019;s Duties as to Annual Financial Statements</i> (clauses 300-301):</p>

<p>The duties of the auditor in so far as the preparation of the annual financial statements is concerned, are fully defined in the Bill. Additionally, the auditor must satisfy himself that the statements in the directors&#x2019; report do not distort the meaning of the notes accompanying the annual financial statements.</p>

<p><i>Issue of Copies of Annual Financial Statements</i> (clause 302):</p>

<p>Whenever a public company sends copies of its annual financial statements to its members, it must at the same time also send copies thereof, as well as copies of the annual financial statements of each controlled private company, to the Registrar.</p>

<p><i>Interim Accounting:</i></p>

<p>The provisions relating to interim accounting are set forth in clauses 303 to 308, inclusive. A public company, must, within a period of three months from the date of the end of the first half of its financial year, send to its members and to the Registrar an interim report in respect of its activities prepared in accordance with Annexure 4 of the Bill. If a public company should fail to make available to its members its annual financial statements within a period of three months after the end of its financial year, it must send to its members and the Registrar provisional unaudited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with the provisions of Annexure 4.</p>

<p>If a private company should fail to make available to its members its annual financial statements within a period of six months from the end of its financial year, the Registrar may, at the request of any member of that company, order the company to make available provisional annual financial statements to that member. The Registrar may grant exemptions from the preparation of interim reports, and he may also extend the periods within which interim reports or provisional annual financial statements should be made available by a company.</p>

<p><i>Right of Members and Others to Copies of Annual Financial Statements and Interim Reports</i> (clause 309):</p>

<p>Provision is made in the Bill in terms of which a judgment creditor will be entitled to receive copies of the latest annual financial statement of a private company whenever he is advised that insufficient disposable property is found to satisfy the judgment against the company.</p>

<p><i>Compromise, Amalgamation, Arrangement and Take-overs:</i></p>

<p>Clauses 311, 312 and 313 replace the provisions of the existing Act relative to compromise, amalgamation and arrangement in respect of companies. The new principles embodied in these clauses of the Bill are as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The liquidator must, whenever a compromise or an arrangement is concluded in respect of a company in liquidation, report to the Master <span class="col_6401-6402" refersTo="page_0268"/>about any possible offences committed by directors and officers of that company and the Master, in turn, must similarly report to the court about such possible offences;</li>

<li>(b) the court must take into account the report of the Master as well as the number of members of each class of shares which voted in favour of the compromise or arrangement; and</li>

<li>(c) the subsequent order of court has the further effect that the property as well as the liabilities of the company in liquidation are transferred to the transferee company.</li>

</ol>

<p>A new field in our company legislation is covered by clauses 315 to 320 inclusive which deal with take-over offers. The main provisions of these clauses are as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The expressions &#x201C;offeror&#x201D;, &#x201C;offeree company&#x201D;, &#x201C;take-over offer&#x201D; and &#x201C;take-over scheme&#x201D; are clearly defined in the relevant sections of the Bill;</li>

<li>(b) it is required that a valid take-over offer must be accompanied by takeover statements by the offeror to members of the offeree company, and that the directors of the offeree company must also issue such a statement to its members;</li>

<li>(c) all shareholders of the offeree company shall be treated equally;</li>

<li>(d) provision is made for time limits, the circumstances under which a takeover offer may be withdrawn or may be declared unconditional and the period in which the take-over offer thereafter should remain open for acceptance;</li>

<li>(e) provisions are included which stipulate that if the conditions of an offer are improved, the shareholders which previously accepted the offer will be deemed also to have accepted the improved conditions of the offer;</li>

<li>(f) a duty is imposed on the offeree company to furnish the take-over statement;</li>

<li>(g) the content of the take-over statement is clearly defined;</li>

<li>(h) offences committed in connection with take-overs, as well as penalties for such offences, are provided for, while provision is also made for civil liabilities arising from untrue statements; and</li>

<li>(i) the take-over provisions of the Bill do not apply if every member of the offeree company gives his written consent thereto before the take-over offer is made.</li>

</ol>

<p>Few changes are made in the basic principles in the existing Act which deal with the power of a company to acquire the shares of the minority shareholders in another company in a take-over scheme. The wording of section 103<i>ter</i> of the existing Act, which is now replaced by clause 321 of the Bill, has been improved while certain words and phrases have been more clearly defined. Changes of substance which have been introduced in the Bill, are the provisions which stipulate that the offeror company may notify dissenting shareholders as soon as it has acquired the requisite number of shares in the offeree company and not after four months as is provided for in the existing Act, and that any shareholder may apply to the court for relief within a period of six weeks from the date of such notification, instead of a period of one month as is provided for in the existing Act.</p>

<heading>EXTERNAL COMPANIES</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 322-336)</summary>

<p>The expression &#x201C;foreign company&#x201D; which appears in the existing Act is replaced by the expression &#x201C;external company&#x201D;, and as far as it was possible to do so, all provisions applicable to companies which are registered in the Republic, have been made applicable also to external companies. This applies equally to the provisions of the Bill relating to the offer of shares to the public and the issue of prospectuses. The Bill provides, in particular, that external companies must be registered as such in the Republic and they must have a local auditor, even before they issue a prospectus. Most of the other provisions in the existing Act which apply to external companies have been embodied in the Bill.</p>

<p>One important exception to this general rule is provided for in the Bill in the sense that an external company need not have <span class="col_6403-6404" refersTo="page_0269"/>an auditor if it merely establishes a share transfer or a share registration office in South Africa.</p>

<heading>LIQUIDATION OF COMPANIES</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 337-426)</summary>

<p>In addition to a rearrangement of the provisions of the existing Act which apply to the liquidation of companies, the Bill embodies numerous procedural changes in order to establish uniformity between our company legislation and our legislation relating to insolvency.</p>

<p>The main new principles embodied in these changes are as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) only the Master may issue a certificate stating that security to cover the costs of liquidation has been obtained, and this right to issue such a certificate is no longer conferred on a magistrate as is provided for in the existing Act;</li>

<li>(b) in the case of a voluntary liquidation of a company, security to cover the costs of liquidation may be filed with the Master after the passing of the special resolution, and not before such a resolution has been passed;</li>

<li>(c) the directors must compile, or have compiled, a statement relative to the state of affairs of the company which they must then submit to the Master, or otherwise they must present an affidavit in which the reasons for their inability to comply with this requirement are set forth;</li>

<li>(d) as a result of the discontinuation of partly paid-up shares, and since there will be only contributories in respect of companies limited by guarantee, all matters relating to the appointment of a liquidator in the case of contributories have been placed under the jurisdiction of the Master instead of that of the court as is the case at present;</li>

<li>(e) whenever a Master has issued a certificate to the effect that the liquidator has performed his duties, he may then reduce or cancel the security which has been lodged by the liquidator;</li>

<li>(f) the liquidator of a company may deposit in interest bearing accounts any moneys not immediately required in connection with the liquidation of that company;</li>

<li>(g) the liquidator is required to report to the Master about any offences committed in connection with the business of the company, and must also disclose to a meeting of creditors the fact that such a report has been issued by him to the Master;</li>

<li>(h) the Attorney-General may apply to court for the disqualification of a director of a company which had been liquidated consequent upon the report of the liquidator;</li>

<li>(i) the Master may grant to the liquidator extension of time to submit a distribution account, provided he is satisfied with the reasons for such extension presented to him by the liquidator in the form of an affidavit;</li>

<li>(j) the legal representative of a creditor or member may put questions to a witness before a commissioner appointed by the court under the Act;</li>

<li>(k) a witness is entitled to receive a copy of the evidence submitted by him in any questioning about the affairs of a company; and</li>

<li>(l) the winding-up of a liquidated company is done by the Master and not by the court as is the case at present.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Registrar must keep a register of directors of liquidated companies which cannot pay their debts. The liquidator must furnish the necessary details for this purpose to the Registrar, and the directors concerned are granted the opportunity to protest against the inclusion of their names in the register.</p>

<debateSection name="#judicial_management">

<heading>JUDICIAL MANAGEMENT</heading>

<summary>(Clauses 427-440)</summary>

<p>The principle in the present Act relative to the system of judicial management has been changed. The Bill now provides that the issue of an order of judicial management <span class="col_6405-6406" refersTo="page_0270"/>by the court must be founded on the consideration that the company will be able to become a successful undertaking if it is placed under such judicial management.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for the granting of a provisional judicial management order on such conditions as may be determined by the court. The Master may appoint a provisional judicial manager to take over the management of a company and the provisional judicial manager must report on the state of the affairs of the company and must furnish the reasons for the company&#x2019;s failure to become a successful undertaking. In addition he must present his views about the company&#x2019;s prospects to become a successful undertaking.</p>

<p>The provisional judicial manager thereafter calls a meeting of creditors to consider his report, to prove their claims on the company, and to nominate a person for appointment as judicial manager.</p>

<p>A report of that meeting and the conclusions arrived at are then presented to the court on the return day of the provisional management order, and this report must be accompanied by the reports of the provisional judicial manager, the Master and the Registrar. The court then issues an appropriate order.</p>

<p>Loans, advances and credits granted to the company are protected during the period of the judicial management.</p>

<p>The auditor of the company is retained during the period of judicial management.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his speech this afternoon. He has summarized in about an hour and a quarter a Bill which took me some seven days to read and understand and I think it is quite an achievement. Today we come to the end of an era which began in 1909, for it was in 1909 that the Transvaal Act came into being. It was an Act that was based almost entirely on the English consolidation of 1908. In 1926 the present Companies Act was enacted, differing little from the Transvaal Act. It is this Act of 1926, amended no less than 15 times between 1926 and now, with which we have lived and with which many of us have worked during a lifetime, that we are finally laying to rest today. During these 47 years many commissions have considered company legislation both in this country and in England. We had the Lansdown Commission of 1937 and the Millin Commission of 1948. In England they had the Cohen and Jenkins committees, both of which have proved very useful to us. Finally, we have now had the report of the Van Wyk de Vries commission which was appointed in 1963 and which completed its work in February, 1972. That commission sat for a long time. I would like to add my personal tribute and the tribute of this side of the House to the chairman and the members of that commission, the culmination of whose labours is found in the Bill before us.</p>

<p>I want to refer immediately to paragraph 6.03 of the main report, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the absence of qualified legal and accounting staff the major portion of the research, preparation and drafting had of necessity to be done by the Chairman. Up to the end of 1967 the Chairman was called upon from time to time to perform duties in the Supreme Court and it was only during 1968 and 1969 that he was able to work uninterruptedly on the task of the Commission.</block>

<p>I hope that the Government will take cognizance of these remarks. One of the weaknesses of our commissions, and for that matter of our select committees, is that we seldom have adequately trained staff put at our disposal. Departmental officials do a magnificent task, but full-time experts at the disposal of a commission would not only expedite the work of the commission, but would also enable appropriate studies <span class="col_6407-6408" refersTo="page_0271"/>in greater depth to be undertaken, which we believe to be essential to the findings of any Select Committee or commission. It is interesting to note, Mr. Speaker, what happened in the case of the Royal Canadian Commission on Income Tax, which brought out its report some three or four years ago. The number of accountants and other experts who were made available to that commission, if my memory serves me correctly, was something over 150. In the nine years that that commission sat&#x2014;I think it was nine years&#x2014;these 150 experts were made available to it. I hope that this approach will be followed by us in future.</p>

<p>The Bill before us, drafted by the commission and amended by the Government, is a prodigious piece of work. Its 423 pages, its 443 clauses, together with four schedules which the hon. the Minister referred to mainly by omission, would alone call for comment, but the real work of the commission lies in the content of the Bill which, when placed upon the Statute Book, will give us virtually an entirely new Companies Act. I personally have a great deal of sympathy for the view of Mr. Arthur Suzman, Q.C., who, in his minority report, said that the whole Companies Act should not at this stage have been entirely rewritten and that an amending Act embodying the basic recommendations of the commission should first have been introduced. This, Mr. Suzman says, would have allowed adequate time for testing. I also lean towards the view expressed in the minority report that uniformity of wording between our Companies Act and the corresponding provisions of the English Companies Act might well have been preserved. For those of us, Mr. Speaker, who have dealt with the Companies Act over the years and who have been involved in its administration, British company law judgments and particularly British precedents have been of inestimable value to us, and it seems a pity that to some degree anyway these benefits will now be lost. Sir, this Bill is something like the new arithmetic. Old and tried concepts have been scrapped; new and strange terminology has been introduced, and definitions which in the old Act, or through general usage, meant one thing, now in terms of this Bill mean something quite different. For example, the terms &#x201C;holding company&#x201D; and &#x201C;subsidiary company&#x201D; have been given entirely different meanings. When you and I studied the Companies Act, Mr. Speaker, we understood that a holding company was a company which held more than 50% of the issued share capital of a subsidiary, and <i>vice versa.</i> That no longer applies. As in the case of the new arithmetic, the old-timers will have to do a great deal of reorientation and, I am afraid, a great deal of homework. Sir, the establishment and the use of a company is not a static thing; it is part of the everyday dynamic business life of a country, and we therefore not only accept, but indeed we welcome, many of the new provisions which are found in the Bill.</p>

<p>I must say at once that the Bill is by no means perfect. I think this will be conceded. I have here, as I am sure the hon. the Minister has, literally hundreds of suggested amendments, a great number of which will have to find their way on to the Statute Book at the earliest possible opportunity. These are amendments, Mr. Chairman, which are suggested not on the Bill of the commission, but on the Bill which has been tabled in this House, and the early appointment, therefore, of the advisory committee, as the hon. the Minister has acknowledged, becomes of vital importance. As a matter of fact, had this Bill not made provision for the appointment of a standing advisory committee, we would have suggested that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee so that all these queries, all these questions, could have been dealt with. The hon. the Minister has dealt with the changes provided for in the Bill in some detail. Nevertheless there are a number to which I want to refer, and the first is the definition of a &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D;, which is defined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;controlling company&#x201D; means a company which directly or indirectly has power enabling it to control another company; in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the term &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D;, a company shall be deemed to be a controlling company if it holds more than 50% of the issued equity shares</block>

<p>of that company; or if it is entitled to exercise more than half the voting rights in respect of the issued shares of that other company; or if it is entitled or has the power to determine the composition of the majority of the board of directors of that other company.</p>

<p>Our problem is to determine what falls within the ambit of &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;. How far <span class="col_6409-6410" refersTo="page_0272"/>does the chain go&#x003F; We know that when you find that a definition is bound by the word &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;, or the interpretation of the definition is so bound, there are a lot of red herrings that run across the course. I do not think anybody who has to deal with the law likes the term &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;. A direct interest is clear. An &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; interest is capable of innumerable interpretations. I hope that the standing committee will find some method of finding a more definite approach to this situation.</p>

<p>Now the definition of a &#x201C;holding company&#x201D; is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Holding company&#x201D; means a company which holds in its own name, together with those held in the name of the nominee and a controlled company or its nominee, if any, not less than 30% of the issued shares of another company.</block>

<p>Now you will note, Mr. Speaker, that what is being dealt with in the definition is 30% of the issued shares of another company. These must be held to make it a holding company, and not 30% of the issued equity shares. Now this means that a bank or a financial institution or any other company holding preferent shares in another company would be regarded as a holding company of the second company if the preferent share capital represented not less than 30% of the total issued capital, both preferent and ordinary, of the number two company. So you have the position that a bank or any other company having not a single voting share in another company, but holding only preferent shares, must regard itself as the holding company of company number two and make all the statutory disclosures of subsidiaries provided for in the Act. Frankly, this does not make sense to us. I hope it makes sense to the hon. the Minister. We have considered very carefully the motivation of the commission in deciding that issued capital and not issued equity capital should be the determining factor. We still believe that it is wrong that issued capital should be the criteria as to what is a holding company and what is a subsidiary. We believe that the yardstick should be the issued equity capital, and we propose to move an amendment in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>We are in very much the same position in relation to the definition of a &#x201C;wholly-owned subsidiary&#x201D;. A &#x201C;wholly-owned subsidiary&#x201D; means a company all the issued shares of which are held by another company or by another company and its nominees. Here you have a position where a company can own the entire issued equity share capital of another company and in fact therefore control that company, but number two company need not be a wholly-owned subsidiary because of the quantum of the issued preferent shares. I do not know how this makes sense at all. Surely, a subsidiary of a company should have some relationship to the control of its parent company, not merely to the shareholding of the parent company as is the case here. There is a small amendment which is required in clause 3. It is purely a textual one.</p>

<p>Clause 18 provides for the appointment of a standing advisory committee. We believe this to be one of the major recommendations of the commission and we welcome the setting up of such a committee, so that any improvements to the Act which are found to be necessary can be dealt with speedily. The committee, which must have as its chairman either a judge or a senior advocate, is appointed by the Minister, but it is not specified in the Bill what the qualifications of members appointed to the committee must be. I want to say here very clearly that the effectiveness of the standing advisory committee will depend entirely on the quality of its members. If you can persuade the best brains who are concerned with company law in South Africa to serve on such a committee, then you will have a first-class, effective committee. However, if it is going to be a committee to which people are appointed for no real reason, it is not going to serve any purpose whatsoever. We expect&#x2014;I think the hon. the Minister mentioned it&#x2014;that lawyers and accountants and perhaps representatives of mining, industry and commerce and the Stock Exchange will find a place on the committee. I hope that the hon. the Minister will not overlook that there are such beings called shareholders who are not represented in the main by either accountants or lawyers or by mining houses or by industrial concerns. I hope he will give consideration to appoint to this committee perhaps a representative of such organizations as the Shareholder Association of South Africa that is dedicated to protecting the interests of shareholders.</p>

<p>In our view it is important that the terms of reference of the committee should be stated and that the report of the committee <span class="col_6411-6412" refersTo="page_0273"/>should be laid before Parliament. There was this provision in the draft Bill prepared by the commission, but it has been omitted from the Bill presented to the House.</p>

<p>Clause 17 enables the State President to amend the schedules to the Bill by proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Here it immediately seems to me that such amendment should only take place on the advice of the standing committee. Surely, it is its function to consider any changes and therefore, if changes are to be made, particularly by proclamation, they should be on the advice of the standing committee.</p>

<p>Clause 20 makes it possible to have a one-man company. Previously a minimum of two shareholders was required. We all know that this two-man shareholder company was a farce and that the number 2 shareholder in many cases was merely a nominee of the sole owner. Therefore this change merely legalizes what in effect has been practised for years.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister in relation to public companies why are we wedded to seven members for a public company. What is this magical word &#x201C;seven&#x201D; that you cannot have a public company unless it has seven members&#x003F; If perhaps its seven members decrease to six members, it ceases to be a public company. Maybe it is based on the seven fat years and the seven lean years &#x2026;</p>

<p>But it is strange that we have picked the number seven. We say that if there are seven members, there can be a public company; if it is six, it cannot be a public company any longer. I think a little consideration should be given to this.</p>

<p>Clause 30, as the hon. the Minister mentioned, still limits associations, syndicates and partnerships to not more than 20, but there is the very important proviso which makes this provision not applicable to any organized profession designated by the Minister. This will fill a real need for professional partnerships. In other words, professional partnerships of more than 20 are now permitted. Particularly in so far as lawyers are concerned and accountants are concerned we are finding that professional partnerships are growing every year. This is a very excellent clause. However, it has been pointed out that today in professional life you are getting something else. You are getting a professional partnership comprising different professions&#x2014;for example, you can get a partnership which consists of architects, chartered surveyors and engineers&#x2014;where you have a combination of skills which are required to deal with certain specific problems. You can conceivably get this situation in other professions. You might even one day find accountants and lawyers associated in a partnership for specific reasons. I almost say &#x201C;heaven forbid&#x201D;! We agree with this contention and I think that the hon. the Minister might give consideration to amending this clause so that a combination of members of the professions which he specifies could in partnership be permitted to contain more than 20 members.</p>

<p>Clauses 33, 34 and 36 make major changes to the object, powers and <i>ultra vires</i> position of a company. This is a very interesting topic and I am going to leave this to be dealt with by my learned colleagues who will be speaking after me. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I now come to clause 38, subsection 2(a). We believe this requires amendment. Clause 38 deals with financial assistance to purchase shares of a company or holding company, a vexed problem we have always had in terms of the Companies Act. It reads (subsection (1))&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No company shall give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person of or for any shares of the company or where the company is a subsidiary company, of its holding company.</block>

<p>Subsection (2) reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions of subsection (1) shall not be construed as prohibiting&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the lending of money in the ordinary course of its business by a company whose main business is the lending of money &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>&#x201C;Main business&#x201D; is another one of these difficult terms to interpret. I think this clause would be vastly improved if we omitted <span class="col_6413-6414" refersTo="page_0274"/>the word &#x201C;is&#x201D; and inserted the word &#x201C;includes&#x201D; after the word &#x201C;business&#x201D; so that it would read:</p>

<block name="quote">The lending of money in the ordinary course of its business by a company whose main business includes the lending of money.</block>

<p>Then, I think, we would solve the problem. The concept &#x201C;main business&#x201D; is a very interesting one, because the main business of a company can change. I was associated with a company for many years that had two types of business: It did shipping and confirming and the flotation of companies. When the time was appropriate to float companies, we concentrated all our efforts on doing that. That was our main objective at such a time. When the market crashed and we could not float companies any more, we turned our attention to confirming and shipping; and so we changed. So the term &#x201C;main business&#x201D; is a difficult concept to interpret.</p>

<p>Clause 39(2) prevents a subsidiary from holding shares in its holding company, except where such a situation exists on the 1st January, 1974. It also provides that the subsidiary shall not have the right to vote at any meeting of its holding company. The question that arises here is, what happens in the case of a take-over by another company which happens to hold shares in the company doing the take-over&#x003F; The hon. Minister mentioned that under the present section 24<i>bis</i>, the subsidiary company is permitted to continue to hold these shares, but in terms of the Bill before us&#x2014;and, I must admit, in terms of the British Companies Act as well&#x2014;the shares must be disposed of immediately&#x2014;in fact, before the take-over is completed, otherwise an offence is committed. I know that if the shares in the parent company held by the subsidiary are not disposed of, the situation can arise where in effect a reduction of capital results. This is probably the main reason for the change in the Bill. However, what I am concerned about, is that, from a practical point of view, a situation can be reached in a take-over where the company taken over has to dispose of a large block of shares and throw them on the market, which can disturb the market mechanism. This is what is worrying me. I believe we should perhaps make some provision in the Bill for time to put the position right, so that it has not to be done immediately, or before the merger takes place. We do not object to the principle involved. We think it is a correct principle. But what does concern us is the mechanics, and how it is going to work out in practice.</p>

<p>Clauses 41 to 51 deal with names of companies. We welcome these new provisions. They are good provisions, particularly those that provide for the registration of a shortened form of name&#x2014;this would be a wonderful thing for business&#x2014;as well as clause 43(2), which allows for the registration of a defensive name. The hon. the Minister gave one example of a defensive name, but there is no definition of a defensive name. I have in my mind an idea of what it means, but I cannot explain it explicitly. For example, could it also mean that, if Wellworths was registered before Woolworths, they could register Woolworths as a defensive name to Wellworths, and Woolworths could not have been registered as Woolworths&#x003F; I do not know. I think we need some explanation or some definition as to what is a &#x201C;defensive name&#x201D;. We also welcome the provision for the registration and use of the literal translation of a company&#x2019;s name in the other official language. This is long overdue. This is a realistic approach to an everyday problem.</p>

<p>Clause 61 is a provision which is of great value to lawyers, accountants and company secretaries, but I do not think it goes far enough. It would seem from this clause, which deals with the consolidation of the articles of association with resolutions amending the articles, that you can only consolidate a company&#x2019;s articles when it is using the whole or part of either the new Table A or Table B of Schedule 1. If this clause was made applicable to all articles, because many companies do not have a Table A or a Table B but have a new set of articles, it would be of the greatest value, because then articles which have been amended from time to time could be consolidated and in terms of the Bill a notarially certified copy of the consolidated articles would then be the articles of the company. The hon. the Minister has been in practice and he knows what it is like when you get hold of a company that has been in existence for many years and you have to look at the original articles and then go through the minute book for years to see what changes have taken place, it is a nightmare. This is a first-class provision, and I hope it will be made applicable to all companies so that we can get this notarial certification and one can say those are the articles.</p>

<p><span class="col_6415-6416" refersTo="page_0275"/>Clause 76(1) provides that premiums received from the issue of shares be transferred to a share premium account and be reported as permanent capital. A banking institution in terms of the Bank Act is specifically excluded from the provisions of the clause. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not give consideration to including an insurance company in the same proviso which exempts a bank. If he would refer to the fourth schedule, he would see that both banks and insurance companies are exempted from disclosing share premium accounts in their published accounts. I think the position should be the same for banks and insurance companies. Clause 76(2) deals with the setting up of a share premium account where assets are acquired by the issue of shares of a company and no consideration is recorded. The difference between the par value of the shares and the value of the assets so acquired must be transferred to a share premium account. We have no quarrel with this, but there are two questions that arise. What is the basis of the valuation of the assets here&#x003F;, because nothing in the legislation tells you how these assets mut be valued. Must they be valued by the directors, must they be valued by sworn appraisers, or how&#x003F; The second problem we have is this: What is the position where the purchase consideration is met partly by the issue of shares and partly by cash&#x003F; The Bill is entirely silent on what happens in that situation.</p>

<p>Clause 99 effectively does away with partly-paid shares. This is a controversial issue and we have had a great deal of representation by people who suggest that partly-paid shares should be allowed to remain in existence. There are a lot of people who are going to be sorry to see the end of partly-paid shares. We have given the matter a great deal of consideration and have come to the conclusion that the commission is right and that the Bill is right in that more harm than good is done by the ability to issue partly-paid shares, and we go along with removing partly-paid shares from our company life. It would seem that by the omission of any reference in the legislation to vendors, promotors, founders and management shares that the distinction between this type of share and the ordinary share of a company now falls away and that there are no longer these different types of shares. This is a welcome change, for the provisions in the Act regarding these types of shares have been got around by every possible means since, I think, 1926 when the Act was first introduced. They have really ceased to have any purpose, because it was easy to get around those provisions and we are glad to see the end of them.</p>

<p>Clause 140 reduces the time in which a company must deliver the certificates of respective shares transferred from two months to six weeks. This is an improvement, although a very small one. We know the problems of transfer officers being able so to organize themselves to give delivery of shares in a shorter period of time. But I do think that with mechanization and with computerization the standing advisory committee should keep a constant eye on this situation to see whether this period cannot be made shorter and shorter so that in time you will be able to get the shares that you have bought delivered to you in a week or two.</p>

<p>Clauses 141 to 169, dealing with the restrictions on offering shares for sale with a prospectus, and Schedule 3, dealing with the contents of the prospectus, are a vast improvement on existing legislation. Over the years we have had an enormous amount of criticism from every sector of the community with regard to the inadequacy of the provisions of prospectuses, the inadequacy of the information that has to be given to the public. These criticisms, I think, have been met in this Bill. They have been met to a very large extent without placing too onerous a responsibility on those who have to issue the prospectus. However, there is one weakness here, I think, because I still cannot find out&#x2014;maybe it is due just to my own foolishness&#x2014;what constitutes an offer for sale. It has been a problem that has concerned me all my professional life; it is a headache that nobody ever seems to have been able to solve, i.e. what, in effect is an offer for sale&#x003F; There used to be a theory that, if you did not make an offer to more than 50 people, that was no offer, but there are all sorts of interpretations. Perhaps a better interpretation could be introduced into the Bill. I also question whether it is necessary for the prospectus to disclose the individual salaries of the director who is employed by a company in some additional capacity. I would have thought that the aggregate salaries of directors would be sufficient. I know that in America you can easily find out what everybody&#x2019;s salary is, but that is foreign to our way of life in this country; we do not go bruiting about what Mr. A or Mr. <span class="col_6417-6418" refersTo="page_0276"/>B earns. I think some consideration might be given to that.</p>

<p>Paragraph 17 of Schedule 3 deals with the interest of promoters&#x2014;another thing that has concerned the public for many years. I wonder whether this paragraph would not make more sense if the final words of the paragraph &#x201C;if such promotion or formation occurred within five years of the date of the prospectus&#x201D; were deleted there and inserted in line two of paragraph 17 after the word &#x201C;company&#x201D; so that the paragraph, which starts on page 394, would then read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Full particulars of the nature and extent of any material interest, if any, of every director or promoter in the promotion of the company, where such promotion or formation occurred within five years of the date of the prospectus, or in the property &#x2026;</block>

<p>If this is not done, I believe that, if I interpret this provision correctly, you are going to have to deal in the prospectus with the interests of directors that go back for years and which are really of no concern with regard to a prospectus being issued at a particular moment of time.</p>

<p>Clause 186 provides that, unless the articles of a company provide for a longer period of notice, 21 days&#x2019; notice must be given for an annual general meeting or a general meeting called for the purpose of a special resolution. We would like to suggest that the 21 days could perhaps be extended to 30 days. People may be away; they maybe on holiday; they may live in different towns from the registered offices of the company and an unfortunate habit has cropped up with regard to many companies&#x2019; annual general meetings. They are held on the 30th or even the 31st December. This is an awkward time for people and I think to extend the 21 days to 30 days could well be done.</p>

<p>Clause 194 deals with the voting rights of preferent shareholders. Preferent shareholders, we know, do not have the right to vote unless the preferent dividend is in arrears. We have had it suggested to us that, where a preferent dividend has been in arrears for three years or longer, the voting right of preferent shares should be on a par monetary value basis, i.e. a preferent share of R2 should have four votes per share if the ordinary shares are 50c shares. At the present moment, it is parity: One preferent share gets one vote and one ordinary share gets one vote although their values are different. I believe that this suggestion has merit. After all, if a preferent dividend has been in arrear for three years something fairly radically is wrong with the administration of the company and the preferent shareholders should have the right to almost step in and protect their interests.</p>

<p>Clause 207 provides that where a report is circulated on the proceedings of a meeting of a company, it must contain a fair summary of all material questions and comments. We believe that it might be well and a good thing as far as a public company is concerned, to make a report on meetings of the kind referred to in the clause, obligatory. If that is done, and a meeting is held, a meeting like an annual general meeting or a general meeting where a special resolution is proposed, a report on that meeting should be forwarded to all shareholders. This should be done because so many shareholders today are, because of distance, represented by proxies. I think that such a step would be in the interest of good management.</p>

<p>Clause 224 prohibits a director from taking a call-on share, of giving call-on shares, or from entering into a put-or-take deal. This is quite right; it was time that this practice was stopped. However, I do not find anything in this clause which prohibits a bear sale, but I may have misinterpreted this clause. I think that bear sales should also be prohibited.</p>

<p>Clause 231 is one of the group of clauses which deal with the interests of and dealings by directors and others in shares of a company. This question of what the directors are doing is one the public leeches onto. These provisions for what has come to be known as insider-trading are tough and rightly so, but there does seem to be one very interesting omission. As I read the Bill, although directors, officers and people who have knowledge are not allowed to trade, I find nothing which says that a director or an officer of a company may not communicate information he has to another person. This seems very strange to me. In addition this clause should also apply to dealings in the shares of any holding subsidiary or controlling company. How is the spirit of this new legislation to be applied to the large financial institutions which do not have share capital&#x003F; I think of mutual insurance companies which <span class="col_6419-6420" refersTo="page_0277"/>are effectively controlling vast empires. Are they not also to be barred&#x003F; I think that consideration should also be given to that matter. I think this is a very important proviso and I think it can be tightened up.</p>

<p>Clauses 234 to 241 deal with the interest of directors and officers in contracts. This is another hardy annual. We have received very strong representations from people who believe in the principle, as we all do, that you have to control this very toughly, where they say that the provisions as they are in the Bill, are not practicable. Whilst subscribing fully to the principles of the Bill, we will propose some amendments in the Committee Stage which we believe will do what is required to be done, but in a more practical and simpler form.</p>

<p>We now come to the winding-up of companies. There are a number of useful provisions in the Bill but there is one clause, clause 424 on page 334 of the Bill, which causes some concern. When hon. members look at this clause they will see that subsection (1) states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When it appears, whether it be in a winding-up, judicial management or otherwise, that any business of the company was or is being carried on recklessly or with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court may &#x2026;</block>

<p>take certain steps. I do not believe it is right to tie together a person who acts recklessly and a person who sets out deliberately to defraud a company. I believe these are two different types of human beings. A man acts recklessly, that is true, but he has not set out deliberately to defraud the company. Besides, how do you determine &#x201C;reckless&#x201D;&#x003F; Surely there are degrees of recklessness. Recklessness is a subjective term.</p>

<p>If you are reckless and you win, you are a financial genius, but if you are reckless and you fail, you are tied up with a man who sets out to defraud a company. I do not believe that in principle it is right that you should tie people together like this.</p>

<p>Clauses 427 to 440 deal with judicial management. I am gratified that despite the unanimous opinion of the Masters of the Supreme Court, who wanted to do away with judicial management, the system of judicial management, in a vastly improved form, is to continue. I believe it serves a purpose. I know from personal experience&#x2014;I used to have something to do with liquidations and judicial management &#x2014;that many a company has been saved from liquidation through being able to use the provisions of judicial management. It is true that some companies have abused judicial management to stave off liquidation, but I believe that the provisions in this Bill, particularly the provisions referred to by the hon. the Minister that the temporary judicial manager must report whether a company has a possibility of getting back on to its feet, are very good, and I am glad to see that these provisions remain in the law.</p>

<p>I do not intend dealing to any extent, as did the hon. the Minister, with the schedules. The print is very small and they are very complicated. However, I should like to say just a few words about them. Schedule 1 contains table A and table B. This is something new; we now have a set of articles for a private company and a set of articles for a public company. There are model sets of articles, but they only have a permissive use, so they do not require any comment. You do not have to use them; you use them if you want to.</p>

<p>Schedule 2 deals with the powers of a company as laid down by clause 34. This whole question of the powers of a company is very interesting, and I hope my friend, the hon. member for Green Point, is going to deal with this matter. It is very interesting indeed.</p>

<p>Schedule 3 deals with matters which must be stated in a prospectus. I have already referred to this briefly.</p>

<p>Schedule 4 is probably the most important feature of the Bill. It deals with the requirements for annual financial statements and interim reports by companies, so that the public shall know what the standing, the status and the health of a company is in which they hold shares. The changes are far-reaching. I cannot deal with the requirements in any detail, but I would like to highlight one or two of them. The term <span class="col_6421-6422" refersTo="page_0278"/>&#x201C;profit and loss account&#x201D; disappears entirely. We no longer have profit and loss accounts. This is replaced by an &#x201C;income statement&#x201D;. There are no longer annual accounts, but &#x201C;annual financial statements&#x201D;. This is the new arithmetic I was talking about, the new terminology we have to learn. The directors&#x2019; report, instead of being a somewhat meaningless, stereotyped statement, must now&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;be in narrative form, necessary to complement and explain the balance sheet and income statement. In other words, teeth have been put into the directors&#x2019; report. Directors must now tell their shareholders what the income statement means and what the state of the company really is. The financial statement must now fairly present the state of affairs of the company. The details required in the annual financial statement will now give a full picture of the state of the company and of its operations.</p>

<p>The duties of the auditors and the scope of the auditors&#x2019; report have been widened considerably. When I finished reading what the duties and the obligations of an auditor were in this little Bill which we have before us, I thanked the good Lord that I was no longer in practice.</p>

<p>The form of group statements and group reports has been specifically stated. Companies cannot now decide how they would like to present their reports. When they are involved, as a group, with other companies, the requirements are specific, and this is very good indeed.</p>

<p>Interim reports have been a cause of contention in this country for years. It has been a requirement of the Stock Exchange for a long time and it has been a requirement in England and America, and probably on the Continent, for years. Interim profit of loss, are now obligatory. There are one or two questions that do arise: How do you deal with paragraphs 54 and 57 of Schedule 4 when shares are acquired over a period&#x003F; There seems to be a real problem involved here to meet the requirements of these two paragraphs of Schedule 4 when you have not bought the shares in one lot; you may buy them over two, three, four or five years. Perhaps the hon, the Minister might go into that. The other question is this: From what date do the accounting clauses in the Bill begin to apply&#x003F; I think it might be useful for the Bill to state that these provisions shall not apply to any company in respect of any financial year ending prior to the 1st January, 1974, when the Bill comes into operation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is aware that life assurance companies have some difficulties. The interim reports and provisional financial statements are giving them some trouble, and I think they have told the hon. the Minister that there are certain alterations that they would like. They say&#x2014;.</p>

<block name="quote">In many respects it will be impracticable for insurance companies to provide interim profit statements or statements of income owing to the difficulty of complete interim actuarial valuations, and they should be required only to provide limited information in any interim statement. The following, for example, is suggested: Premium income, investment income, expenses, payments to policyholders, reports on company&#x2019;s progress.</block>

<p>Sir, I think they have a case here, because if every insurance company has to start with actuarial investigations twice a year, this position may become well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>Finally, there are one or two other matters that might warrant consideration. Firstly, should not failure by listed companies to comply with Stock Exchange listing requirements constitute a contravention of the Act, with appropriate penalties&#x003F; We do not seem to have a complete tie-up between what is happening in terms of the Companies Act and what happens in terms of the Stock Exchange Act. There is the very useful provision in the Bill that one of the sub-committees of the Standing Advisory Committee must be a committee to deal with problems of the Stock Exchange, but it seems to me that we might put teeth into some of the provisions of the Stock Exchange Act if we incorporated a proviso in the Bill that people failing to comply with the regulations of the Stock Exchange will be guilty of a criminal offence, because you must remember, Sir, that today we have a representative of the Department of Financial Institutions sitting in at the meetings of the Stock Exchange committee and therefore he knows what is happening, and many of the regulations are drawn at his request; so if listed companies do not comply with these regulations, we should consider the question of making it a criminal offence.</p>

<p><span class="col_6423-6424" refersTo="page_0279"/>The other question is this: In view of the provisions of clause 63 of the Bill, which changes the duties, does the Stamp Duties Act not require amendment&#x003F; There is no mention in the Bill that the Stamp Duties Act is to be amended. I also understand that there have been negotiations between the Stock Exchange Committee and the Registrar of Financial Institutions for amendments to the Securities&#x2019; Transfer Act of 1965, but one of the Acts repealed in this Bill is the Securities&#x2019; Transfer Act of 1965. The new provisions which are being discussed between the Stock Exchange Committee and the Registrar are not incorporated in the Bill. In other words, although discussions are going on to amend the Securities&#x2019; Transfer Act, we have ignored that entirely; we have simply said in this Bill that we repeal the Securities&#x2019; Transfer Act of 1965. By the time this Bill comes into operation they will not have had time to amend the Securities&#x2019; Transfer Act, and therefore provision might have to be made in this measure to take care of the desired new requirements.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have raised a number of issues, in connection with this Bill which we believe merit consideration and we will move some amendments in the Committee Stage. We will not move all the amendments which we think should be moved, in the hope that the Standing Committee, which will be appointed as soon as this measure comes into operation, will be able to deal with them and deal with them expeditiously.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown has made a very thorough study of this legislation. He has again made the kind of speech here that we have come to expect of him. He is always positive in his criticism; he is constructive in his criticism, something we appreciate about him. There is very little real criticism that he has offered, but what we appreciate is his constructiveness. The piece of legislation before the House at present is a very complicated piece of legislation. He spoke here also as a professional man. He began by sketching the history of the old Companies Act, and how this eventually led to its culmination in this present Bill. He made certain objections to new concepts that are now embodied in this Bill, but, as he rightly said, one does not remain static in one&#x2019;s views and concepts. As I have said, he had little criticism, but I also want to fall in with him and sincerely congratulate the De Vries Commission, which investigated this matter and eventually came along with a draft Bill, on the work which they did. We have waited a long time for this Bill, but I think it was worth it. I also sincerely want to congratulate the department and the hon. the Minister and thank them for this new Bill and the form in which it has been drawn up. It is a very great improvement on the previous Act, as was, in fact, acknowledged by the hon. member.</p>

<p>There are several forms of business. The very first business known to man was the one-man business and later, through co-operation and seeking help from others, the partnership developed. As someone once identified a partnership agreement, it is &#x201C;an agreement of the utmost good faith&#x201D;, but as people are, confidence is sometimes shaken and consequently new types of companies were sought. Eventually the limited company was arrived at, a company with limited liability. Then there is also the co-operative type of company, whether limited or not, which is not applicable here at the moment. I think that there is room for all types of business in the economy of South Africa and in the economy of the world. But by far the most important type of business, is the limited company, a type that lends itself to the sampling of big capital, powerful capital; a type of business which lends itself to the creation of investment sources from which growth must emanate and from which there must also be proceeds&#x2014;in other words, a very good investment source for the general public. When we think of the extent to which the <span class="col_6425-6426" refersTo="page_0280"/>principle of the limited company is already applicable in South Africa in the various businesses, there is hardly any person who does not, in some or other way, have an interest in a company, whether as directors, as entrepreneurs, as investors, or as persons receiving services from a company. Therefore it is of such great importance that the legislation controlling this type of business should be good and thorough legislation. I think we can say as much about this Bill. The Government&#x2019;s biggest economic critic, i.e. the <i>Financial Mail,</i> recently announced this legislation as follows and said, <i>inter alia:</i></p>

<block name="quote">There is not a businessman or investor who will not be affected by the Companies Bill shortly to be debated in Parliament. The culmination of ten years hard slog by the part-time seven-man Van Wyk de Vries Companies Act Commission, the Bill contains some novel concepts, has benefited from the wealth of practical experience of business and professional men, and has drawn freely on overseas legislation and experience.</block>

<block name="quote">The result is a Bill that goes a long way to providing the corporate legal framework for a modern industrial society. It will, <i>inter alia,</i> pull the wraps off existing complex holding-subsidiary company relationships that tend to obscure or mask who owns and controls whom. The flow of information to investors will also be vastly improved and they will now have an easier means of redress if wronged, while the rights of shareholders involved in take-overs and mergers are by and large spelled out. The risk of delinquency by directors will be reduced, as will be the possibilities for insider trading, which is outlawed.</block>

<p>This newspaper also has certain criticism which it expresses about matters that will have to be taken up in time.</p>

<p>This brings me to the first point I should like to broach, i.e. a completely new concept in this legislation. I am referring to the appointment of the standing advisory committee. I think this is a very good case. In a changed and still-changing modern society and economy it goes without saying and it is logical that legislation must continually be amended to adapt to changed circumstances. This applies, in particular, to this type of legislation where changes are continually taking place. It must therefore continually be adapted. That is why the appointment of the standing committee, as provided in clause 18, is sincerely welcomed. That was actually the only point in the hon. member for Parktown&#x2019;s speech which was not nice. He surely knows that the hon. the Minister will give us the best people available in South Africa to serve on this committee. That goes without saying, after all, because the hon. the Minister has the interests of shareholders and entrepreneurs as much at heart as the hon. member for Parktown, and perhaps much more. We consequently have the fullest confidence in the hon. the Minister in that he will appoint the best people available to this committee.</p>

<p>There are problems which these people will have to solve immediately. There is a great deal of criticism, such as that also expressed by the hon. member for Parktown, <i>inter alia,</i> which these people will probably have to give immediate attention to. They will probably also solve those problems in time. What is most important, however, is that this committee will keep this legislation up to date, and the amendments which the committee will continually submit to the Minister will result in this legislation always remaining streamlined and up to date.</p>

<p>A further point I want to touch upon is the question of directors. Directors are in positions of confidence in a company. They are the watchdogs when it comes to the interests of the shareholders. The weal and woe of a company can be determined by its directors. That is also why so much attention is being given in the legislation to directors, and that is also right. This not only protects the directors, but also the shareholders, and that is how things should be. Directors are people who hold positions of power and authority in large public companies, and they can easily abuse their position of confidence. They must consequently be checked. The new amendments, which are being placed on the Statute Book by means of this Bill, are important. I just want to summarize them briefly in so far as they relate to directors. <span class="col_6427-6428" refersTo="page_0281"/>Firstly every director must consent to his appointment. Unless receipt of consent is acknowledged by the Registrar, as already indicated by the Minister, he cannot act as a director, and his name may not be linked to directorship of the company. In addition, the director is also compelled to record any change of address himself. The onus will now be with the director himself to give notice of his change of address. Secondly, directors can only issue shares with the prior approval of the company at a general meeting, something which directors have also abused frequently in the past. Thirdly, with respect to share or option plans in which directors have an interest, it is provided that shares can only be assigned to them on the same conditions applicable to all other shareholders of the same class of shares. Fourthly, directors may not deal in options in respect of listed shares and debentures. Fifthly, the register of interests of directors in shares and debentures, and the register of interests of directors in contracts, are now being made available for public scrutiny. This is something that is also very important. In many cases, if one wants to find out who the directors of some or other company are, the names are simply not available, and one simply cannot find out in what respect those directors are connected with the company. Now it is compulsory for the interests and contracts to be made public. The register of the interests of directors must contain particulars of the shareholdings officers who, together with the directors, have knowledge of the affairs of the company, specifically to control the position of confidence in which directors are placed. There are essential objections&#x2014; as also indicated by the hon. member for Parktown&#x2014;which could probably be corrected in time.</p>

<p>Those are briefly, then, the few points I wanted to touch on in connection with this Bill. We welcome it and hope and trust that in the light of the steps being taken in this legislation, directors will not abuse their position in future. We shall hope and trust that this legislation will prevent this to a certain extent. You know that we are dealing with human beings. When a person is placed in a position of confidence, he sometimes abuses that position. But we want to express the hope and the confidence that this Bill will contribute towards placing South Africa&#x2019;s economy, and particularly companies, on a sound footing by the methods which will be employed and by means of the standing advisory committee. We wish the Minister every success for the further progress of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must say that it is not often that we have the opportunity in this House to listen, firstly, to such a lengthy and very clear explanation of the contents of a very long and very important Bill, and, at the same time, to have the privilege of listening to the leading speaker for the Opposition being able to deal with what the hon. the Minister has said in introducing the Bill, in such depth and with such clarity, making, at the same time, what I would term very constructive criticism and comments and, if I may say so, useful and interesting suggestions with regard to this Bill and its importance and operation in the activities of commerce in this country.</p>

<p>Having said that, I would like to say something about my conception of companies in general, and in respect thereof, also the Companies Act. I would like to say that the Companies Act, or the conception of company legislation, is the most important factor in the orderly and methodical development and control of large enterprises, and for that matter, perhaps all enterprises requiring the investment of risk capital; more particularly I feel it forms the basis on which enterprise has been able to attract the investment of capital and wealth for the continued growth and development of the economy of our modern society. Its part in the economy is not only vital, but virtually the life-blood of business and industry and has led to the high social development and standards which mankind has achieved. The company conception has been a major cause in the sound and secure conduit pipe for wealth to play its part in the greater rationalization of the needs of people and the greater spread of such wealth to benefit society in general. I would like to take a quotation from the report of the commission which reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that in the interest of the economy and its development the Act should provide the most convenient vehicle for economic enterprise in that it should place the least possible restriction in the way of the smooth running of business life.</block>

<p>To this end it is my view, in supporting <span class="col_6429-6430" refersTo="page_0282"/>what the hon. member for Parktown has said, that we find the Commission has presented a Bill which, with amendments the Minister has in the light of numerous representations already made, is very readable and is presented in a much more simplified manner than the existing Act. There are many reasons given in the Commission&#x2019;s report with regard to that simplification not only in respect of the language in which I am addressing you, but in respect of both languages in our country, because I believe that even in regard to the Afrikaans version of the Bill, we will find a tremendous improvement in the grammar and grammatical construction as well as in the general picture the reader will find when he studies the Bill. The endeavours of the commission to bring about a balance between all interests involved in a company, namely directors, members, the company itself, third parties and creditors as well as the general public, has indeed made an important contribution to this very delicately balanced confluence of interests. I hope it will play the important part it should in preserving the confidence of our investing community and the entrepreneurs who contribute by their know-how, enterprise and expertise to the continued growth of our country and the uplifting of the standards of living of all our people in all its aspects in this modern scientific age and in this country which has such a great future in store for all its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The Bill largely follows the principles of company law as we know it. The hon. member for Parktown has related the history of the Companies Act and I think we are indebted to the country of origin of company law. In fact, the company law of Britain has been the standard from which the whole of the new world virtually, countries of the Commonwealth which were part of the British Empire of the day, and many other countries of the world have benefited. The company law of Britain has virtually been the standard bearer in the development of this form of business activity and in the structure it has created. But certain important changes have been made which will not in my opinion in any way affect the value of company life as we have known it, but which may raise certain doubts as to its practicability or as to its efficacy. I do not find too many problems because largely I believe the changes have been in the interests of the investor, the public, whilst not interfering much with the delicate balance which must always ensure the making of profits by the company, by its founders, its entrepreneurs and its promotors. It may interest hon. members to hear that company life in this country has accelerated, particularly in the last 10 or 15 years. Some figures which we find in this connection in the report are of great interest. For instance, it would appear that in November, 1935, there were approximately 7 852 companies in existence, a number which grew to 32 000 in July, 1948. Those are the figures I find in the report indicating the growth during that period. But the figure for the period 1959 to 30 June, 1969, shows that an additional 99 379 companies were registered, i.e. almost three times as many within ten years as, according to the figures for years gone by, was the case over a period of 13 years. It is also interesting to know that the 99 000, or practically 100 000, companies were responsible for a nominal share capital value of R1&#x00BC; billion. If we take into account the tremendous amount involved in the increase of share capital from time to time over the years, one can visualize that company life today is virtually the backbone of the business life of South Africa. In a country with such tremendous potential, we can well realize, as my hon. friend for Vryburg correctly said, the important role that companies play in the business life of our community. I, like all others, also welcome the early establishment and appointment of a standing advisory committee. However, I do not accept the mild criticism, if I may put it that way in all kindness, which the hon. member for Vryheid made with regard to what the hon. member for Parktown said, because I think we must go by the standards of the past. In Britain, for instance, there are the Cohen Commission and the Jenkins Commission, which have been standing commissions for years, which play a very important and vital part and have been able to call on the best possible ability in the country. Neither I nor the hon. member for Parktown denies that the hon. the Minister will seek men of ability. We hope he will be able to get them, but it is not easy these days, as has been very correctly said with regard even to the commission itself, to get men of ability and standing to take part in this important and vital work unless the hon. the Minister really makes up his mind to elevate the standing advisory committee. I think it is important, against the background I have given, to the proper standard with regard to salaries to attract the correct people and to provide the necessary incentive to attract those <span class="col_6431-6432" refersTo="page_0283"/>whom he feels and we believe are necessary in order to make the standing advisory committee a success. I say this particularly with regard to this Bill, which has been entirely reconstructed and contains numerous provisions which do differ in many respects, thereby creating additional work, as those provisions will have to be tested as time goes on. As has been pointed out, a considerable number of opinions have already been forwarded to members prior to the presentation of the Bill itself, so that one can deal with the Bill from the point of view of future amendments. Therefore the members of the standing committee will have a considerable amount of work to do and the hon. the Minister will require men who will be able to analyse satisfactorily what should be done if amendments are to be brought in. I have no doubt that they will direct their immediate attention to some of the important factors which are still outstanding, factors which may arouse confusion or doubt, as I have said earlier, such as the &#x201C;objects clause&#x201D; of the memorandum in respect of which a considerable amount of discussion has taken place. We find, for instance, that a memorandum, to which we are accustomed at the moment, which is regarded as a document with a prolixity of conditions, authorities or powers to the company, should be more concisely presented because of the tremendous amount of paper work involved. Storage and all sorts of other factors are involved and these should change in essence because the very construction of the document does not make it a sound one. That document may contain 20. 30, 40 or 50 different objects, with a final clause wherein it is stated that every object should be read independently, as if that were the main object of the company. In this way the purpose is defeated, namely to bring about a complete attrition and to endeavour to preserve the object of the company as narrowly as possible in the sense of the wording but as wide as possible in practice. I am sure that it will be the first objective of the standing advisory committee to consider very carefully the points which have been made and also to deal with them and to see whether something can be done in this respect. I furthermore think, as has been pointed out already, that the consideration of the alternative recommendations of Mr. Suzman, one of the members of the Commission, will engage the attention of that standing advisory committee immediately. He deals with this particular factor of insider trading and with one or two other factors which I believe will still worry the public for some time to come. I do think that that will be an important factor, something to which the hon. the Minister even might direct his own attention. We have also had some representations directed to us on the question of insider trading. I have received a very lengthy article which was written by a representative of one of the biggest companies we have in South Africa. This company has international standing, it has an international reputation, and it is a company which is highly respected all over the world. He felt that perhaps a single concise blanket clause should be inserted which would cover the action of any person with knowledge concerning information in respect of which he should observe the utmost good faith in keeping such knowledge secret. As an example I could just read the wording of this representation in order to give the hon. the Minister a better idea of what was intended:</p>

<block name="quote">Enigiemand wat in &#x2019;n vertrouensposisie staan teenoor die aandeelhouers van &#x2019;n maatskappy en di&#x00E9; posisie misbruik om homself te bevoordeel ten koste van die aandeelhouers, is aan &#x2019;n misdryf skuldig en aanspreeklik vir skadevergoeding.</block>

<p>This is an example of the suggestion that has been made to meet a situation which in terms of clause 231 is already causing concern. There is a gentleman who happens to be the secretary of another one of the largest companies in this country, but he has an entirely different individual view altogether. We talk about ensuring that the register shall reflect the interests of a particular director in case it affects a contract. These are matters that I feel should be very carefully considered by the hon. the Minister. Nevertheless, I hope that when the standing committee does deal with some of these important matters, it will preserve what I feel is one of the paramount features of this Bill and that is the simple manner in which it has been presented. I hope that it will make an effort at continuing this simplification both in the interests of those who have to work with it and the public who have to read it as well as in the interests of those who have to interpret it. In that respect one has to some extent a nostalgic thought with regard to the change of terminology, in the change to the entire structure of the Bill, because our law at the moment contains a wealth <span class="col_6433-6434" refersTo="page_0284"/>of precedents of case law which have been invaluable in the company life of this country. A great deal of it comes from England itself. Their laws have been the basis of our law and we have made considerable use of case law from Britain. I sincerely hope that it will not necessarily be destroyed by what I call simplification and what I believe has been a good approach in the drafting and presentation of this Bill.</p>

<p>I now want to say something which I think is particularly important in the whole approach to this Bill, especially by the public. I feel that one of its greatest values lies in the fact that it ensures the protection of the public. Here I want to say immediately that one does not call for protection as against the promoters of the enterprise, the directors of companies; there is no question of any investor having to live in fear. It will, however, give the public a greater sense of security in that they will be entitled to detailed information and to certain necessary disclosures. This approach by directors as regards both the management and direction of the affairs of a company and the involvement of the investor in the affairs of the company is now laid down. I think in that sense the commission has done a very good job of work indeed. I hope that this approach will be continued in the committee which is established, to ensure that the investor can invest his money with absolute ease and comfort. Many of us remember that until some 15 or 20 years ago, if, for instance, one were a trustee or someone in a fiduciary capacity with regard to the management of large funds in charity bodies, welfare bodies and other large undertakings, one would always invest in what we called &#x201C;gilt-edged stock&#x201D;. This meant that one bought either Government stock or municipal stock or any public utility stock. Then the whole trend changed, and that trends was responsible, in my view, for the tremendous upsurge in the commercial life of our country. The trend was then towards the idea that equities can be a safe form of investment; and that one need not fear, because equities would give better returns and would also ensure growth of capital. What has been significant is that as a result of that trend, the entire business and industrial picture of South Africa changed completely. That is where I feel the security of the investor is so important, because we must continue to attract his funds so that he can play his part directly, through the private sector, in the development of the country in which we live. I do not think this is new, but I think it should nevertheless be said: The country has tremendous potential, and the potential of a country can only be realized through its own people. We have at times, in discussions with the hon. the Minister and the Minister of Finance, complained about the imbalance between the public sector and the private sector. Here is one of the avenues in which the private sector can be given an opportunity, and I am sure it will be given the opportunity of attracting the private investor, the man in the street, to play his part in the development of his country.</p>

<p>There are one or two other very interesting features on which I should like to comment. One of them is the question of inspections. Where it was found that the directors in some way or another had harmed a company and that the company would suffer a loss, it was necessary for action to be taken, and the only person who could take action was a member of the company. Obviously a member of the directorate would not take that action; an officer of the company would not take that action. A shareholder could, however, take that action. The result was that, if he was successful in setting an inspection in motion &#x2014;and I understand that this has not taken place very often&#x2014;no matter how small it was, it would cost at least approximately R4 000, according to the report. This has been very well cured, as the Minister himself stressed in his statement, by the new procedure of being able to apply to court, to present a case to court, and for a <i>curator ad litem</i> to be appointed who would almost immediately begin to report on certain factors, for instance, whether there was a sound case to be made for action to be taken. This will now also restore to the investor some form of security because, without involving himself in a very lengthy and costly process, he has an opportunity, within a short period of time, through judicial approach and through judicial sanctions and surveillance, to endeavour to remedy something which he believes is wrong with the company. This will now not take a great deal of time either to prove or disprove. I think this is a very important change which has been made, and I think it should be highly commended.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister something else which rather worries me, and this is in regard to the penalties. I find <span class="col_6435-6436" refersTo="page_0285"/>that the penalties laid down in clause 178 are rather severe. In terms of the present Act, if the provisions regarding the annual duty and the timeous lodging of documents have in any way been contravened &#x2014;in other words if the duty has not been paid or the documents have not been lodged in time&#x2014;certain penalties are laid down. If there was a three-month delay, the penalty was one-half the amount that was payable. If there was a six-month delay, an amount equivalent to the prescribed fee had to be paid. If there was a 12month delay, twice the prescribed fee had to be paid as a penalty. If there was a delay of more than 12 months, three times the prescribed fee had to be paid. In terms of clause 178 of the Bill, after a delay of three months, twice the prescribed fee must be paid. After four months three times the prescribed fee must be paid, and if the delay exceeds four months, five times the prescribed fee must be paid. Sir, this could be a very expensive business, to put it mildly. It could, in fact, be an extremely expensive business. I am sure it was not the intention of the Minister to hound people. I do not expect him to hound people. I also do not believe the drafters of the Bill intended to hound people. I do feel, however, that this is a very extensive form of penalty, particularly when one compares it to the present situation. Perhaps the present penalties are a little too mild and perhaps they have not had the desired effect. If that is the case, we could increase them somewhat, but I think that a penalty of five times the prescribed fee after a delay of more than four months is excessive. I think the annual fee is somewhere in the region of R50.</p>

<p>Well, if the delay exceeds four months, an amount of R250 will have to be paid for that alone. There are numerous documents which have to be lodged from time to time by company secretaries, public officers, etc. These people will be very heavily penalized, and I think perhaps this matter has been carried a little too far.</p>

<p>I would like to comment on one final point, to which some reference has been made, because obviously there is not very much new that one can say about this Bill because the Minister has covered the whole field so fully. Sir, Schedule IV will play a very important part, but there is one thing that we must bear in mind and I hope that the public will take this kindly &#x2014;I have mentioned this to my colleague, the hon. member for Parktown&#x2014;and this is that I think there is going to be an increase in the cost of running companies, as the result of increases in auditors&#x2019; fees, etc. But I think the value of disclosures under Schedule IV should amply compensate the public for the extra costs that they will have to incur. I have no doubt that a lot of concern will be expressed by the directors of smaller companies and by investors in smaller companies. I think that is a matter which the hon. the Minister might perhaps stress a little more. We on this side will stress it ourselves, but I do think that this increase in costs is going to be more than compensated for by the advantages that investors will derive from the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which has been a matter of some concern to some people, and the hon. the Minister should perhaps consider this too. I do not know whether he would wish to remedy this, but at the moment, as hon. members know, the memorandum of a company always provides that the liability of the members is limited. I would imagine that the answer to this would be that the term &#x201C;proprietary limited&#x201D;, or &#x201C;limited by guarantee&#x201D;, speaks for itself. But I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will think about this, because there are some people, particularly accountants, who feel that it would be a pity to omit that clause from a company&#x2019;s memorandum because it merely gives additional clarity, and gives an investor the assurance that if he buys a share of a certain nominal value, his liability is limited to that amount. I think that is a very important factor, and perhaps the hon. the Minister might deal with it.</p>

<p>Then, finally, there is the recommendation which I hope the hon. the Minister will discuss with the Minister of Justice at the appropriate time because he would know something about this. Partnerships consisting of more than 20 persons, in terms of the present Act, must be incorporated in the form of a company. But notice may now been given in the <i>Gazette</i> by the Minister that members of organized professions in excess of 20 may remain partnership <span class="col_6437-6438" refersTo="page_0286"/>bodies. I believe that in the Stock Exchange Act provision has been made to enable stockbrokers to become incorporated. I hope this will apply to legal firms as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, today we have before us, as the three previous speakers have also said, a very important piece of legislation. It is a bulky measure, but I think its bulkiness is small and insignificant in relation to its importance to South Africa. Sir, sitting here and listening to the previous speakers, and looking at the Bill, my thoughts went back to the time, years ago, when I read about Parkinson&#x2019;s Law. Parkinson describes how a certain board of directors convenes on a certain morning to hold a meeting. There was a R30 shortage in the petty cash, and the directors held a meeting about that the whole morning; they called in the typist and the cashier and all the members of the staff and questioned them. Then they adjourned for lunch, and after lunch they continued with the meeting and there was a terrible fuss about those few rand which had disappeared. The following item on the agenda was a large contract of R2&#x00BD; million for the installation of new machinery. One director after another said he knew nothing about that. They then called in an expert and asked him to give them his opinion about the machinery. The expert said a few high-faluten things which none of the directors could understand, and the directors then immediately said: &#x201C;Yes, we think this is a good thing; if you think so, we must then install the machinery,&#x201D; and the expenditure of R2&#x00BD; million was immediately approved. I hope this will not be the case with this new Companies Act for South Africa, but even if things were to be done so quickly, we could freely approve this Bill because it is a very good measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, previous speakers pointed to the importance of this Bill, but I wonder if we do, in fact, realize to what extent the Companies Act affects every person in South Africa. If we take our latest Estimates, for example, we find that the direct taxation of individuals in South Africa amounts to R866 million, while the direct taxation from companies as such is R1 079 million, apart from all the other revenue which the State obtains from them. If we think of the industrial sector in South Africa, which furnishes the largest contribution to the gross national product, one finds that it is just companies that are chiefly involved. If one thinks of all the employees who work for those companies, one realizes that everyone&#x2019;s lives are affected by the Companies Act. Therefore it is good and proper and important for such a measure to be good and watertight to control and regulate the weal and woe of all these people and to control and regulate their money.</p>

<p>If we just think of the Stock Exchange, we realize that there is not a single share that does not come from a company. In other words, the whole Exchange must be regulated and controlled by the Companies Act. Here I want to link up with the previous speakers and thank the Minister very sincerely for having come along with this measure. It is a good thing. We are also grateful for the tremendous task which the commission carried out, and we are also grateful for the work of the department.</p>

<p>I do not think it is generally known what work has been done behind the scenes during the last few months by the department, the legal draftsmen and the printers to get this legislation ready. We want to thank all those people very much for what was done. It is also very important, particularly for our students at university and at school, and for the lecturers. They very urgently need this Companies Act. I want to mention this and say thank you very much, on behalf of these people, for the fact that this measure will be in force from 1st January. This still gives the people sufficient time to conclude this year and to bring themselves up to date with the Companies Act which they have to lecture about next year, and also to draw up handbooks and have them printed and made available. I also want to express the wish that when the Companies Act is printed, a sufficient number of copies will be printed so that everyone can have a copy at the beginning of next year. Because there is probably not a solicitor, auditor, company secretary, lecturer or student, even in law, or an accountant, who will not have to have a copy of the Act. It is therefore essential to realize that we should have a sufficient number of copies.</p>

<p>It is also important for us to think of the companies office. When a new Companies Act is introduced, there are many <span class="col_6439-6440" refersTo="page_0287"/>other additional matters which will enlarge upon the work and the task of the registrar, and although the work is perhaps up to date now, in time to come it may not be so easy for them to keep it up to date. I just want to mention an example, in the light of the report of the van Wyk de Vries Commission, of all the things that have been done. In the year 1968 things were not nearly as active as they are now. Applications for names that had to pass through the Registrar&#x2019;s office, amounted to 34 436. Name changes alone amounted to 1 810. The newly registered companies amounted to 15 845 with a nominal capital of R342 million. This gives us an idea of what must go on in that office, and I want to express the wish and the hope that their compliment remains at full strength and that the administration will be kept in good trim so that everything can be done. We think of the forms that were submitted at the time, there is form C, the annual statement. There were 86 272 of them in 1968 alone, while there were 16 834 E forms, the companies&#x2019; change of address forms. There were 45 926 J forms, indicating changes in the board of directors, and 9 335 L forms, a total of 158 985 for the year. Those forms had to be handled by these people one by one, scrutinized to see if they were correct and then placed in files, and then at times there are still some things that are wrong, for example there are insufficient stamps, and then further correspondence must be entered into. Today of course there are many more. The number of companies registered this year, during the past year, has assumed on such proportions that the hon. the Minister of Finance himself had to increase the company licence this year for R10 to R50 to thereby prevent companies from being registered for every trifling matter under the sun. This indicates that we shall have to have the necessary manpower in the companies office in order to keep abreast of the work so that the private sector will not eventually be embarrassed by all the various returns.</p>

<p>And then I want to come to certain provisions in the Companies Act. I think there are quite a few provisions about which we shall be able to speak at length in the Committee Stage. I also want to express my sincere thanks for the fact that a standing advisory committee will be called into being in terms of the provisions of clause 18. All the members who preceded me in the debate have already spoken about this, but I just want to bring one idea to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. The hon. the Minister of Finance appointed the standing committee on income tax. I thin<u>k</u> it would perhaps be a good thing if one of the members of that committee also had a seat on this standing committee so that there could be a close correlation between the Companies Act and the Receiver of Revenue. A few years ago&#x2014;I do not know if this is still the case today&#x2014;we had the problem of companies submitting income tax statements without those statements being audited. Perhaps that problem has since been eliminated, but I am just mentioning this as an example of an area in which co-operation could take place with a view to establishing a good Companies Act and a good Income Tax Act.</p>

<p>There is also another aspect I want to refer to. In terms of the Bill it will be possible in future to have private companies in which there is only one shareholder. All my colleagues in the accounting profession will agree with me when I say that in the past we have had many problems with companies consisting of only two shareholders. Since provision is now being made for a company to exist with only one shareholder, this will result in a lot of unnecessary work being eliminated, not only for the company secretary, but also for the companies office.</p>

<p>This brings me immediately to the registration of companies. When a company is registered, the original memorandum of association and the statutes, together with two copies, must be submitted. The Companies Act provides that those two copies must be certified by a notary public. Why this must be so, I really do not know. I find it really unnecessary that those copies have to be certified as correct by a notary public. This problem goes further. Someone will draw up all the documents fully and have them ready for submission, but now he must go to a notary public to have the copies certified. The Law Society prescribes that the minimum amount must be asked for the certifying of those two copies. He must therefore ask the minimum amount which he would have asked if he were handling the registration of the relevant company. If he would therefore have asked R80 to handle the registration of the company, he must now ask R80 for the certifying of the copies. I think unnecessary time is being lost by this, manpower is being wasted and unnecessary expenditure is <span class="col_6441-6442" refersTo="page_0288"/>being incurred. If the necessary documents are drawn up by a professional person, that professional person could just as well certify those documents. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether this matter could not be put right.</p>

<p>Next I come to the question of accountancy records. The Bill proposes that a great deal more will be required of companies as a result of the fact that more accountancy records will be necessary. This will result in a great deal more work, and a great deal more skilled work, being required, which means that companies will in future have to appoint better and more skilled employees to do all this work. There will consequently be a drainage from the accountancy and auditing profession. I must point out, however, that there is already a shortage in that profession. Before a person can qualify as an accountant or an auditor, he must study for five years, and then there is still his period as an articled clerk, of course. In future that period of study is going to be six years in length. Qualified persons in this field are scarce, but it will be important for the larger companies to employ more trained people. There are many functions that will be handled by such better trained staff, for example group accounts, directors&#x2019; reports and something new that is added and requires a new technique, i.e. the source-and-appropriation-of-funds statements.</p>

<p>It is true that the layman cannot always understand all that a financial statement entails. He simply cannot understand it and cannot make any sense out of it. It is also true that the form in which various public companies&#x2019; statements are published frequently differs from company to company. Standard forms are not used. The various companies&#x2019; statements contain the same information, of course, but for the laymen it is very difficult to interpret that information. I am very glad that the commission has made the necessary recommendation in this connection. In the commission&#x2019;s report reference is also made to the Kimber Report which made similar recommendations in the United States of America.</p>

<p>There is also something else I want to refer to. Apart from a controlling company (&#x201C;beherende maatskappy&#x201D;) which owns more than 50% of the shares, there is also a holding company. The latter is something new and has already been explained by the hon. the Minister. A holding company owns at least 30% of the shares. I foresee this arrangement causing problems in practice. An example of this is that the word &#x201C;subsidiary&#x201D; will now have two meanings. One has a controlling company, and according to the definition in the Bill one knows what that is. One has a holding company, and according to the definition one also knows what that is. A subsidiary can, however, be any one of those two. If the holding company controls 30%, it is a subsidiary. If the controlling company controls 50%, it still remains a subsidiary. From the point of view of the student, the entrepreneur, the accountant, the solicitor, etc., it would perhaps have been a good thing if there was another name for one of these two kinds of subsidiaries. If the holding company is also a subsidiary, as it can be on the basis of the example I have quoted, it could perhaps be called a &#x201C;daughter company&#x201D;. If such a distinction could be made, it would greatly facilitate matters in practice. As the Bill now reads, the matter is such that if I speak of a subsidiary, it is not clear what I mean exactly. I shall have to clarify whether I have in mind the holding company or the controlling company.</p>

<p>I also see a further problem. According to the definition, a holding company has 30% of the shares in another company. One could easily have the position where three companies each hold 30%. If such a thing were to happen, one would have three subsidiaries and they can have nothing to do with each other. Problems could therefore crop up in relation to co-operation, etc.</p>

<p>The Bill therefore makes provision for our carrying out an experiment as far as these matters are concerned. I am not implying that I am not in favour of that; I am in favour of it. However, I want to point out that we must realize that certain problems can result from this. Such problems will then have to be ironed out in time. I believe that the aspects I have just referred to are matters that must be brought to the attention of the standing advisory committee in good time so that attempts can be made to solve the problems which will be experienced before they become too serious.</p>

<p>I now come to another matter. This matter concerns auditors. As I have already said, <span class="col_6443-6444" refersTo="page_0289"/>we are experiencing a manpower shortage in South Africa. The auditing profession is one of the sectors for which one cannot, as it were, recruit manpower from the streets. It takes years of training, and then there is the additional problem that a person does not necessarily remain in the profession after he has been trained as an auditor. Big companies are only too anxious to draw trained auditors from the profession. It is also true that auditors usually retire at a relatively young age because of the fact that it is a demanding profession.</p>

<p>Clause 280 has to do with the resignation of auditors. I quote subsection (2)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An auditor intending to resign shall notify the company in writing of his intention and deliver to the company an affidavit in the prescribed form to the effect that he has no reason to believe that in the conduct of affairs of the company a material irregularity has taken place or is taking place which has caused or is likely to cause financial loss to the company or to any of its members or creditors.</block>

<p>It does not matter when the auditor resigns, whether in the middle of the financial year or at the end of it, but when he resigns, he must submit an affidavit, I really do not know why such an auditor must submit an affidavit. If a person dies and the doctor issues the death certificate, he is really not going to have that certificate sworn to. He merely issues a certificate. Why this certificate, issued by a professional person, must be sworn to, is not clear to me. Let us argue this matter. Suppose the certificate is not sworn to. If he issues a certificate and the company&#x2019;s statements are in order, nothing can happen, after all. Let us suppose he issues a sworn certificate. What could happen&#x003F; But if he has not sworn to it, what could happen then&#x003F; What I am saying is that exactly the same thing could happen. A person has issued a certificate which is incorrect, and he can surely be held liable. The auditing profession is, as far as I know, the only profession to which a man may never return once he has been scratched from the role. I think that is a good sword. It was introduced at the time by the Accountants Act of 1951. The discipline is strict. The people are objecting to the fact that these certificates must be sworn to, and I think this is really something we should eliminate. I want to ask that the Minister move an amendment for the deletion of this provision in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I now come to the fourth schedule. Here one of the most important factors in the private sector is dealt with, i.e. all that must be included in the statements. This is explained here with crystal clarity, and quite a few amendments are being introduced. But there are a few small matters that could, in fact, be raised, <i>inter alia,</i> translations. I notice that the Bill was drawn up in English&#x2014;that is the conclusion I come to&#x2014;and then translated into Afrikaans. The heading of paragraph 11 of the fourth schedule reads: &#x201C;Secured liabilities&#x201D; and the translation is &#x201C;Gesekureerde Verpligtinge&#x201D;. In practice we know this as &#x201C;versekerde verpligtinge&#x201D;. This is also the term as mentioned in the Van Wyk de Vries Report. I think we could have a look at that. I am no linguist, but I take my hat off to the quality of this translation and the speed with which it was done. While there is still a chance, however, to correct certain matters in the Committee Stage, I think it would be a very good thing if we could have a look at that.</p>

<p>In concludion I want to make no secret of the fact that I want to refer to the importance which this Bill entails for the accounting profession in South Africa. If one looks at the index, one could take almost all seventeen chapters and, with a few exceptions, there is hardly a single chapter which the auditor and his staff must not look at from A to Z when the books of a large company are being audited. When an audit has been done, and the auditors firm has issued a certificate, it is a fact that every living being in South Africa depends on that certificate, if it has been certified as being true and correct. In the light of that people negotiate large business transactions and take-overs. Millions of rand are prejudiced. The whole Stock Exchange rests on the genuineness and truth of that. It is, of course, very important for this Bill to give guidance to such persons and to protect and support them.</p>

<p>But with the amendments that are being proposed, this Bill is now almost as important to directors as to auditors. I am very glad that the days when people were merely &#x201C;used&#x201D; as directors are passed. Their names were used. The person concerned <span class="col_6445-6446" refersTo="page_0290"/>was perhaps a person who knew nothing of the Companies Act, of accounting or of the affairs of the company. He was then simply &#x201C;used&#x201D; by someone behind the scenes who told him everything that had to be done. I am very glad those days have passed. A director must now be knowledgeable if he is serving on a board of directors and he must ensure that that business is sound. Because this is so important, I wonder whether there could not be some or other form of training in that connection, whether the hon. the Minister, whether in co-operation with the Minister of National Education or the universities, could not publish an abridged publication, a manual or a summary which could serve the directors as concise source of study to bring them up to date with the provisions of the new Companies Act as it will be in future. It is not easy for anyone, particularly a layman, to study this colossal piece of legislation. It cannot simply be done overnight. The hon. member for Parktown said that it took him seven days to study and understand it; but I am telling you, Sir, that it takes one much longer to really understand it and to be able to implement it in practice. Seven days is too short a period. People who are in the professions, whatever work they may be doing, do not have the time at their disposal to go through the entire Bill. Therefore it would perhaps also be a good thing for us to do something so as not to set traps for the directors in the provisions applicable to them, but to help them to find the right road, so that they can study a good Bill and quickly be <i>au fait</i> with it. There is no excuse for them not to study the entire Act. They must do so. But, Sir, I think it would be a good thing to make something available to them as an introduction. I do not know whether the department could do so. I do not think so. Therefore I am just asking that we investigate the matter further.</p>

<p>Then I just want to say in conclusion that when this Bill comes into operation on 1st January next year, the Minister must please not hesitate to come to this House quickly with any amendments if they are thought to be necessary. If necessary, that standing advisory committee must publish an interim report in good time, even before the Bill comes into operation, so that the hon. the Minister can come along next year, in good time, with essential, fitting and good legislation which would be of benefit to the country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with what the previous speakers have said in connection with this Bill. However, I want to express the opinion that not seven days, but 40 days and 40 nights, are necessary to understand anything about it.</p>

<p>In a capitalistic state like the Republic of South Africa we cannot, indeed, overemphasize the importance of the company in modern economy, because all the confidence, locally and abroad, with respect to investment, depends upon the integrity of the company, on the integrity of the directors who serve that company and on the integrity of the officers who are in the service of that company. In law it is said, as we also mentioned the other day, that the criminal procedure that is applied in any country is, indeed, the criterion in terms of which the civilization of a people is measured. I want to draw a comparison and say that, economically speaking, it is the company, and its formation and establishment, which form the core of a country&#x2019;s activities because, from the nature of the case, millions and millions of rand in capital are controlled by it. Particularly a country like South Africa, with its diversity, with its gold mines, etc., must be able to compete satisfactorily at this level with similar institutions, companies and others in the rest of the world. We can probably say with conviction that in South Africa the days of the one-man business are irrevocably past, that we are now moving, no longer even in the sphere of the partnership, but in the sphere of the big syndicate. It has, indeed, become the age in which big capital, the syndicate, the big company, have become the important factors in our whole economic set-up. The various mergers and set-ups which there are today attest to this fact. That is why I believe that it is correct for it to be simplified in legal language to that extent in the Bill so that it will be less complicated and so that the layman can also have confidence in it, and not only the layman, but also the general public, because members of the public invest their money, take part in the venture and take a chance. I therefore believe that it is also essential for the ordinary man in the street to be able to promote the aims and the functions of the company, as being envisaged by the Bill and as pictured for the future. Today this no longer applies only to the bit capitalist, to the big businessman; it is a sphere we all move in, i.e. the farmer, the solicitor, <span class="col_6447-6448" refersTo="page_0291"/>or whoever comes across this in ordinary everyday life. For that reason it is a good thing for it to be ordered in a very good and suitable manner. I think the contribution of the company to the economy and the national revenue of the country is probably almost incalculable and must definitely be astronomical. It is still escallating and we can probably hold out the prospect of the registration of companies in a country like South Africa still continuing to increase in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>It is clear that this Act, which we want replace by the Bill which is before us, has already existed since the year 1909, except for the substantial amendments introduced in this connection in the year 1926. It is actually surprising that in South Africa, throughout these years, we have still been able to meet the requirements set by the present-day community with this old-fashioned legislation of 1909, compact and obscure as it is in a language we almost do not speak and understand any longer. It is actually more than essential for us to have, as we now have here, a more efficient measure to adapt to our present circumstances, and for that reason we welcome this measure. I believe that it contains important new provisions. We have in mind, in particular, the provisions relating to the registration of private companies and the fact that this even makes it possible to have just one single shareholder now. I think this is nothing but complete common sense. The hon. member for Sunnyside mentioned the problems we have had in the past, in this connection, and it is true that the provisions and wording of the old Act were, in fact, only there for the sake of appearance, because persons A and B, a man and his wife, would for example form a company thereby to comply with the provisions of the Act while A, in actual fact, had sole authority in the company. I therefore believe that this is a provision which is completely sensible and which would also make a considerable contribution towards facilitating the administration of this type of company.</p>

<p>We then wish to acknowledge immediately that since we are dealing here with an extremely complicated matter such as this, and since we are now holding out the prospect of this measure, we have probably not reached the end of legislation which we shall have to pass in that connection in this House. We believe that in future we shall still have to make provision for many amendments which we may regard as essential from personal experience of this and as a result of the recommendations of the proposed standing advisory committee, which is a very sensible idea, I think it is correct that in future we could possibly even implement the recommendations of the minority report in some or other way.</p>

<p>Thus I also believe that we have certainly not said the last word in connection with the provisions about and in respect of the relations between holding and subsidiary companies, as was also quoted by the hon. member for Sunnyside. &#x201C;Controlling&#x201D; and &#x201C;controlled&#x201D; companies are accepted by us. We also accept the principle that a subsidiary may not be a member of its holding company. We think this is a very sound principle which is, in truth, going to avoid the measure of manipulation and eliminate malpractices which are now possible, particularly if we think of the undesirable nature of these cross-shareholding companies and circular-shareholding companies. In that connection we could have problems, and I accept this. Thus company A can, for example, be a subsidiary in the holding company of B, but B can again also be a subsidiary of A. This is a vicious circle which could, in my estimation take place, and I do not even want to try to intimate to this House how one could sort that position out and how one is going to solve the problem. It makes me think that the position I find myself in if my fishing line gets tangled up there at the fishing waters is about the same position one could be in if something like this were to happen. It would be very difficult to disentangle it. But I think it is right that we should try to control such a position, that we should limit these activities and that we should also make this matter comprehensible to the ordinary person entering upon such a venture and to the ordinary shareholder who has an interest in such a company. Thus, too, I think that the reports which the liquidator must furnish in terms of clause 400, particularly in respect of the offences committed by directors and officers, is a desirable and sensible regulation. I accept the fact that it is possibly a difficult task which is being placed on the shoulders of the liquidator, but I think it will nevertheless be a very handy and serviceable provision, one that ought to be <span class="col_6449-6450" refersTo="page_0292"/>welcomed. Our experience of the past actually indicates that some of the liquidators were, in many respects, more bent on putting things in order, recovering and collecting what could possibly be got out of the matter without further concerning themselves very much with other related aspects as provided for here. Thus I believe, too, that the provisions of the Insolvency Act could not perhaps, at this stage, be implemented in any other way, and I think that it is correct that it is being done here on a <i>mutatis mutandis</i> basis. We have in mind, too, that it could perhaps even be changed in the future. I have heard criticism from certain bodies to the effect that the emphasis is being placed here on a narrowly delimited, bureaucratic administration. However, I do not think one of us in this House believes that; I do not think that is so. On the contrary; I think this was the result of a very thorough investigation into the old-fashioned shortcomings and flaws in the old Act, and that this contains a great deal which is going to make the position, in respect of company legislation, more orderly, more efficient, simpler and more streamlined. We welcome the provisions in many respects. In that connection I am specifically thinking of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine which is going to be settled here and embodied in this legislation, according to the provisions of clause 36. As a result of the old dispensation the public suffered a great deal of damage. I am referring to the doctrine which provides that if a company were to exceed its powers, the public could not in such a case, in terms of the existing Act, recover its losses because of the plea that the directors exceeded their powers <i>ultra vires.</i> This caused some people to suffer great damage. I am thinking in that connection, for example, of companies who negotiated colossal transactions, for example property companies who operated on a large scale and carried out and concluded transactions for which they were in no way qualified in terms of their memorandum of association, something which resulted in the public as such suffering a great deal of damage. I therefore think that these measures are, indeed, contained here as a protection for the public.</p>

<p>Provisions that we also welcome are those of clause 38, which are aimed at exposing malpractices such as the manipulation of advances and financing for the purchase of a company&#x2019;s own shares, except in cases where this is their business. But I want to say that this provision is perhaps not yet completely watertight because, in some respects, circumvention could still possibly take place in that connection. We could imagine circumstances that could perhaps make this possible. However, I think that this is a step in the right direction and that it is, in particular, a matter which the standing advisory committee could perhaps improve upon and extend further.</p>

<p>The simplification of the memorandum of association as the chief objective, as contained in the Bill now, and the single objective in terms of the provisions being embodied in clause 33, is a good provision in my opinion. It eliminates quite a bit of redundancy. The provisions of clause 266, which deal with the appointment of a <i>curator ad litem</i> when there has been alleged wrongful actions or acts on the part of directors, I also regard as a good measure. In the past we have had the problem of some of the directors obtaining and expropriating powers by virtually unlawful means, powers which at times virtually bordered on the criminal. The aggrieved persons had little recourse to check or prevent this. The only procedure they could adopt in that connection was to submit to the courts a motion which was sometimes based on insufficient knowledge and, as a result, could not make the grade. Otherwise they were dependent upon applying for the liquidation of the company. I think that the present procedure, according to which this is being eliminated and in terms of which the opportunity is being created for the appointment of a <i>curator,</i> improves the position a great deal.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to point to an aspect which I want to focus attention upon. I do not know whether provision has specifically been made for that in this Bill. I am referring to the legal-illegal actions that take place in private companies in terms of White and non-White groups, where Whites, in particular, give their names to companies which are apparently White companies, but which are controlled <span class="col_6451-6452" refersTo="page_0293"/>by other groups. I want to accept that this is an illegal practice. I also accept that it is a very difficult practice to expose, but I also believe that it is an evil that <i>must</i> be combated. I also think that this is an idea which the proposed advisory committee could investigate and in connection with which it could possibly think up ways and means for trying to combat this, whether by heavy penalties that are imposed or possibly even by confiscation. That is all I want to say in that connection.</p>

<p>We support this Bill. I think it is good legislation and that it will make an extensive contribution to good legislation in this country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to deal with the point which was dealt with by the hon. member for Ermelo in his concluding remarks. He dealt with what one could almost call the &#x201C;race classification&#x201D; of companies for purposes of certain laws which have to be complied with. I agree with the hon. member that this is a problem which is presented both to the non-Whites, who need the expertise and finance for development in a non-White area, and to Whites, to whom it gives an outlet for genuine investment, who must retain some control over the operation of this company which is classified for various purposes as White or non-White according to the control of the company. It is a problem which must be looked into; it is a very real problem. There are instances where it becomes necessary to move from one place to another. Let us take as an example a manufacturer that has to move from District Six to the industrial area of Bellville South. The only way this manufacturer can do it is to get finance somewhere, and he is usually offered financial assistance by White persons who go into business with him. The result is that the White person ends up by having a majority interest because of his financial holding in it. In order to assist that man they have to get around the law in some way or another. I agree with the hon. member that this is a matter which needs investigation and which poses a problem to the Coloured entrepreneur who tries to develop his business and who needs the finance for it.</p>

<p>I also want to say that I support the remarks which had been made by the hon. member for Sunnyside in connection with the very heavy responsibilities on an auditor in terms of clause 280(2) of this Bill. One wonders how an auditor can ever sign such an affidavit especially during the course of the year unless he has sat down and has done a complete audit before he resigned from his position as auditor of a company. It may well be the intention that that should be so, but this is a matter which requires some consideration.</p>

<p>Generally there is another matter which concerns the hon. the Minister and which certainly concerns the company&#x2019;s office, and that is the enormous growth in the number of private companies in South Africa. One wonders to what extent one can simplify the procedures and the work which is done at the company&#x2019;s office in regard to effecting the registration of these companies. Then there is a practice which occurs more and more and which a business house, a businessman or a bank, adopts as a rule, when dealing with a private company. This private company wants facilities from, say, the bank but the bank is not interested in the accounts of this company. What it is interested in is who the directors are and the signatures of the directors who guarantee the loan that is made available to the private company. More and more people trading with private companies are utilizing that procedure and one wonders whether this burden is not becoming almost intolerable for the company&#x2019;s office and whether they feel that this has been necessary at all. I believe that that is also a general matter which could be looked into.</p>

<p>The point in this Bill which has been welcomed by all is the provision in clause 18 for a standing advisory committee. I have some suggestions to make to the hon. the Minister, suggestions of some detail, but at this stage I do not want to do more than just to mention that I will deal with those details on Monday.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move an amendment to this clause. I must apologize for not being able to give the hon. the Deputy Minister and the House longer notice of this amendment, but I did not know that we would take the Committee Stage of this Bill today; I had thought that we would be going on with the Votes. I wish therefore to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;Act&#x201D;, in line 6, to the end of the clause and to substitute &#x201C; &#x2018;gathering&#x2019; means any assembly, concourse or procession of more than 50 persons for the purpose or on the pretext of considering or preparing any petition, complaint, remonstrance, declaration or other address to the State President or to both Houses or either House of Parliament for alteration of matters of State&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The reason for my introducing this amendment is to try to reduce, to some extent, the ambit of this Bill so as to make the prohibition on gatherings much more limited in extent, and to bring this Bill somewhat in line with the British House of Parliament Act of 1839. During the Second Reading debate the hon. the Deputy Minister and the spokesman of the official Opposition, the hon. member for Durban North, argued that there was not anything very extraordinary about the measure which was being introduced because in fact in Britain there was such a law. I am now trying to reduce the effect of the Bill somewhat in order to bring it more or less into line with the British Act. As regards the other arguments that were used, for instance when reference was made to the dangers that the Langa march of 1960 had presented to Parliament, I pointed out that in fact the Langa procession stopped at the magistrate&#x2019;s court near Caledon Square, which is outside the area proposed by this Bill. All those arguments, such as the argument about allowing the inalienable right of an African or other messenger boy to get in or out of Parliament&#x2014;this was the argument used by the hon. member for Durban North, if one can call it an argument&#x2014;and the discussion of &#x201C;street democracy&#x201D;, of course do not make any sense at all. I am now moving this amendment hoping, as I have said, to limit this Bill in such a way that it may even be acceptable to those hon. members who use the argument that this Bill is so similar to the provisions of the British Act of 1839.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not prepared to accept this amendment. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton refers to 50 people. It can happen very easily that far fewer people with more energy can cause a great deal more trouble. What the hon. member does, is to limit the aims of such a gathering. To my mind I made it quite clear during my Second Reading speech that what we want to limit here, is movement in the streets through Cape Town in the vicinity of the Parliament of South Africa. We want to maintain the dignity of our Parliament. This does not only apply to people, as was indicated by the hon. member in her amendment, who act with a specific purpose in mind; people who, for instance, want to submit petitions, and so forth, to Parliament or the State President. We want to put a stop to rowdiness in the streets around Parliament, which is the symbol of our authority of State. As I have said before, people who demonstrate in the streets close to a parliament aim to try and create anarchy, incite innocent people in the streets, the general public, and to work them up into a state where some kind of confrontation or action can take place. The whole purpose is to be able to make out a case where one did not have a case before; to place the police in a position where people may get hurt so that a hue and cry can be raised on behalf of the demonstrator while nothing would have been said on his behalf in the whole of South Africa before. In those circumstances, Sir, I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from><span class="col_6455-6456" refersTo="page_0295"/>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister is now giving a very different reason for the introduction of this clause from the one which he gave when he introduced the Second Reading. [Interjection.] I listened very attentively to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech, and he certainly did not mention at that stage that this was intended to keep all demonstrations off the streets and so on. He mentioned nothing at all of that kind. The hon. the Deputy Minister was talking about access to Parliament and he pointed out how difficult the position was when there were demonstrations around Parliament. What was specifically at the back of his mind was the protection of Parliament, and that was not only at the back of the mind of the spokesman of the official Opposition but it was very much to the front of his mind when he supported this measure. Sir, this has nothing whatever to do with access to Parliament; and certainly gathering of 50 persons, standing with placards in peaceful, non-violent demonstration, have in no way in the past obstructed access to Parliament and have created no disorder in the streets at all. As I pointed out at the Second Reading, the only disorder that we ever had around Parliament was the police baton charge last year on the steps of the Cathedral, and that was a non-violent, peaceful protest, as was borne out by the courts of law when subsequently people were charged with holding a demonstration and only one person was found guilty on that count, and that was for addressing a meeting without permission, using a megaphone. The hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s arguments today are rather different from the ones that he used on Friday, and we are now getting to the real reason for the introduction of this clause, which is what he admitted, I must say, when he replied to the Second Reading debate and said that this was really aimed only at student demonstrators.</p>

<p>I want to point out that my amendment also tried in some way to limit the absurdly wide definition of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;, as we have it in clause 1 of this Bill. Sir, &#x201C;demonstration&#x201D; is defined in the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> as &#x201C;an outward exhibition, an exhibition of opinion on political or other questions&#x201D;. If, for example, a pedestrian should knock somebody down and make a demonstration, that would fall within the meaning of the word &#x201C;demonstration&#x201D;, which in itself is not defined in this clause; only the word &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; is defined as meaning &#x201C;more than 50 persons&#x201D;, which, as I say, is the position in terms of the British Act, which hon. members here were so keen to put forward as an example of what was done in other democratic countries.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that he has in mind demonstrations which might in some way disturb the peace. I would say that in that case he ought in some way to define this in the law. At present there is a very vague and general definition, and I must say that the definition of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; is even wider than that of &#x201C;demonstration&#x201D;, because any assembly of any number of persons is prohibited, irrespective of its purpose. If a meeting of people is to constitute a &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;, presumably there has to be a common purpose, and as I understand our law it must be a meeting of more than two persons. But, Sir, under this Bill a &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;, with a common purpose, will fall within the definition. All gatherings are forbidden, and in the list of exceptions that we have in clause 2 there is no mention of any private gatherings of people. What we have excepted are divine services, funeral processions, official functions, and so on. The definition of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; is therefore extremely vague, and I believe that the amendment which I have moved will somehow get rid of this vagueness and the wide implications of the Bill by prohibiting only a specific gathering, that is to say, a gathering of more than 50 persons for the specific purpose of petitioning Parliament or of coming to Parliament for any particular reason, and this is exactly what the British Act does as well. It prohibits a gathering of more than 50 persons&#x2014;it does not say a gathering of more than one person&#x2014;and it only prevents such gatherings if they are for the purpose of presenting petitions, etc., to Parliament. That is the object of my amendment.</p>

<p>Sir, the situation in Great Britain is dealt with not only by that Act; it is dealt with in addition by a ruling by the Speaker in the British House of Commons. There are two authorities, governing the situation there&#x2014;one a legislative authority and the other the authority of the House of Commons. Obviously the sessional order from the House of Commons had to be brought in because the legislation passed early in the 19th century in itself was not sufficient, and the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton is merely designed, as I understand it, to bring this legislation into line with the provisions which allowed gatherings of 50 persons or fewer, but which prohibited gatherings of more than 50 persons. The sessional order which they have makes it mandatory for the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police to disperse all gatherings, whether they consist of 50 persons or fewer, and quite obviously, Sir, that is necessary for two reasons: firstly, to enable members of Parliament and also those who have business at Parliament to go about their business, to go to and from the House, and, secondly, to allow Parliament to carry on its business in a calm atmosphere, because without that atmosphere no legislative assembly can properly carry out its functions. As I say, Sir, I rise merely to make the point that the amendment which the hon. member puts forward does not have the effect of equating this Bill with the position which pertains at Westminster.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I did not say that my amendment was going to equate the position here with the position in Britain. I said it would equate the position here with the 1839 Act, which was referred to by the hon. member, and bring the position here more into line with the position in Britain. That is what I said. But, Sir, I am quite prepared to agree with the hon. member that my amendment does not take cognizance of the Speaker&#x2019;s sessional order, nor does this Bill. It takes no cognizance whatever of the Speaker&#x2019;s sessional order. I stated in my Second Reading speech that there was nothing whatever in law or anything else to prevent our Speaker from giving exactly the same instruction, if he wished to do so, to the police to stop any disturbances.</p>

<p>Sir, here is the order which is issued by the British Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is ordered that the Commissioner of Police in the Metropolis do take care that during the session of Parliament &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not out of session, as this Bill does, which prohibits all meetings throughout the year, whether Parliament is sitting or whether Parliament is not sitting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the passages through the streets leading to this House be kept free and open and that no obstructions be permitted to hinder the passage of members to or from this House, and that no disorder be allowed in Westminster Hall &#x2026;</block>

<p>which is in Parliament itself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; during the sitting of Parliament, and that there be no annoyance therein or thereabout and that the Serjeant-at-Arms attending this House do communicate this order to the Commissioner aforesaid.</block>

<p>Sir, I would have no objection whatever if our Speaker wished to issue an injunction that during a session of Parliament, members shall not be prevented from coming in and out of Parliament; that steps may be taken to prevent any disorder, which would disrupt the proceedings of Parliament, and to stop any disorder in the Lobby of this House, which is the nearest approach that I can think of to Westminster Hall. Sir, what on earth the hon. member for Zululand, who has now disappeared into the blue, should have had to say about this in connection with the amendment that I am moving I simply cannot conceive. I said in my Second Reading speech that the Speaker could issue any such injunction. That is an absolutely different matter from prohibiting all out-door meetings within a radius of one mile of Parliament, or more than a mile, I imagine&#x2014;in the whole of the central area of Cape Town&#x2014;and on the city campus of the University of Cape Town, in session and out of session, on days when Parliament is sitting and on days when Parliament is not sitting. That is a completely different situation and one to which I take the greatest exception. Sir, before I complete my third and last comment on this clause, I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister by what right he says that he is going to instruct the <span class="col_6459-6460" refersTo="page_0297"/>police that they need not carry out the law in respect of a certain person. The hon. the Deputy Minister, in his reply to the Second Reading debate&#x2014;when I raised the absurdity of a gathering meaning one or more persons and pointed out that this could even apply to little old Miss Lee, who has been seen very frequently parading around the streets of Cape Town in the vicinity of Parliament, persumably frightening the life out of the hon. member for Durban North, since he has felt so nervous all these years&#x2014;said that this law was not designed for Miss Lee, and he laughed when he said so. I know, of course, that it was not designed for Miss Lee, but in fact it applies to her. He said he would instruct the police not to see this thing which she was doing; to leave Miss Lee alone and not to arrest her. Is the hon. the Deputy Minister not defeating the ends of justice&#x003F; I ask him that, because here is a law which he is placing on the Statute Book and he is telling us in advance that he is going to single certain individuals out and he will see to it that the police take no notice of them. I wonder whether, if I stand outside Parliament with a placard, he will extend the same courtesy to me. [Interjections. Anyway, that is not the point. It is the principle that is at stake here and I believe that no Deputy Minister has the right to come to Parliament and put laws on the Statute Book, which he realizes are absurd, and then by making certain exceptions he hopes to relieve the Government of the embarrassment of having little old Miss Lee carted off to gaol.</p>

<p>I just want to reply to the last accusation levelled by the hon. member for Houghton. The only reason why Miss Gladys Lee&#x2019;s name was dragged into this debate, is because the hon. member wanted to make a sentimental point here in regard to Miss Lee, by suggesting that we are only introducing this legislation to have this old woman of 75 or 80 years arrested. This is a typical far-leftist standpoint and statement and manoeuvre. I then told her quite clearly that I have nothing against this poor old soul who parades around with her placards. I then said that if she is really concerned about Miss Lee, I would ask the police simply to ignore old Miss Lee if she gets the idea into her head to parade with a placard again. Now the hon. member again comes along with a far-leftist manoeuvre and asks now what right I have to violate the legislation&#x003F; Sir, Miss Lee can now take note of the fact that, thanks to the hon. member for Houghton, I withdraw my words. Now I will ask the police also to arrest Miss Lee if she stands there again, and then they must inform her that it is because of the hon. member for Houghton that this is being done.

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I rise in the first place to observe that the hon. member for Zululand is back in his seat. He had to leave urgently for a short moment to receive an urgent &#x2019;phone call, but he is here. Sir, I should like to put this matter in its perspective. The hon. member for Houghton, as one would have expected, has raised this matter in order to make the most capital she can out of a situation in respect of which only one member of this House could possibly not be in agreement and that is she and her supporters outside. When the hon. member says, as she does, that here is a law he&#x2014;pointing at the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police&#x2014;is putting on the Statute Book&#x2014;let me say that this is a law which this House has asked to be placed on the Statute Book, and not only this House but the Other Place also. Parliament as a whole has asked for this law to be placed on the Statute Book. It comes neither from the hon. the Deputy Minister nor from the Opposition, it comes from the Standing Rules and Orders Committee of this House and the equivalent body in the Other Place. When the hon. member cavils at what is in this Bill and cavils about the nature of the demonstrations that may be held, I must say that there is no absolute restriction on the right of protest. There still is the right of protest. It remains. However, you may not have demonstrations in the open air within the prescribed area unless you have permission. The point I wanted to make was that of the open air spaces that there are and that are not public places within the area which is described in the schedule to the Bill, there are two that I know of which might form a place where one might have such meetings of protests. They are the campus at Hiddingh Hall at the top of the Avenue and the Cathedral steps. The Cathedral steps are not a public place but a private place, thus was the whole point of what happened before. There has to be permission from the Dean of the Cathedral, the Very Rev. E. L. King, in order to have a meeting on the steps of the Cathedral. If you have a meeting there, on a <span class="col_6461-6462" refersTo="page_0298"/>private place, in the nature of things you could not possibly have more than 70 odd people without them spilling into the street. So when before you had a meeting there, it attracted a lot of spectators in one of the most congested corners of one of the main arterial outlets of Cape Town. Can the hon. member tell us whether there was any other object in having a meeting on the Cathedral steps other than that it would in fact achieve the very effect it did, namely that you would have a lot of spectators coming around, that you would have the streets congested, that you would have a scene, to put it at its lowest, and that you would have the necessary publicity.</p>

<block name="quote">Protest should be brought home to them right to their gates.</block>

<p>Then she talks in protesting terms about &#x201C;street democracy&#x201D;. The situation postulated by these two newspapers is precisely the situation that we in our Law have since 1911 sought to prevent, a situation which any Parliament would seek to prevent and one which every Parliament in the world has sought to prevent and has indeed taken extraordinary action to prevent. The situation is, in fact, not that one says that people should not have any protest meeting. They may have their protest meetings in all the ways in which they have been held, but now you must have permission for a meeting in the open air on the St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral steps. You must have the permission of the chief magistrate. The necessity for this was illustrated on the Monday after that black Friday, that unfortunate Friday when there was a meeting on the steps of St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral and the events which then occurred. Then the students&#x2014;not the students, but the supporters of the hon. member&#x2014;wanted to have another, similar meeting on the Monday. The most irresponsible act of indiscretion, the most irresponsible decision that was ever taken, was taken by the Very Rev. E. L. King, the Dean of Cape Town, who is responsible for the Cathedral, when he allowed them to have another meeting on those steps. The chief magistrate of Cape Town, in terms of the General Law Further Amendment Act, which we have passed and which deals with processions, may not refuse an application to hold a procession in the open air in public places in Cape Town unless he is satisfied that the maintenance of law and order will be adversely affected if permission is granted. Surely we have seen that the judgment of a person like the chief magistrate of Cape Town is necessary to determine whether or not a gathering should take place if law and order and the maintenance thereof may be affected, by the very fact that until that was passed the decision rested with people like the Very Rev. E. L. King. The position is that you may still have your protest if it will not conflict with law and order. Is there anything unreasonable about that&#x003F; Is there anything unreasonable in protecting the environs of Parliament&#x003F; If my note is correct, the hon. member for Houghton said that the only disturbance we had ever had was the police baton charge on the cathedral steps. That hon. member has been longer in this House than I have been. I was not here in 1960, but was there not another occasion when the whole of the structure, all the buildings of Parliament, were threatened in 1960&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 14, to omit &#x201C;and demonstrations&#x201D;; to add at the end of subsection (1) &#x201C;on any day on which either House of Parliament meets and sits&#x201D;; and in line 23 to omit &#x201C;or demonstration&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Part of this amendment would have been consequential on my first amendment if it had been accepted. The purpose of this amendment is to try and limit this measure as it is going to stand if it is passed unamended. We are now not going to be allowed to have any demonstrations or gatherings of more than one person in an area defined in the schedule, an area which is a very wide area indeed. The area goes well beyond the immediate precincts of Parliament, and I wish to narrow this down to be applicable only on those days on which Parliament is actually sitting. The arguments that hon. members have used about members of Parliament being disturbed in their deliberations and of being prevented from having access to the Houses of Parliament must surely fall away if we limit the prohibition of these meetings to those days when Parliament sits. Then hon. members can come in free and untrammelled, undisturbed by any ladies with placards, or undisturbed by any demonstrating students, undisturbed by anything or anybody. But on the days when Parliament is not sitting, when it does not matter whether or not members are disturbed because they will not be here, the ordinary right of public protest as we have enjoyed it all these years, will obtain. I want to know, if all these arguments about the necessity for having this law are so imperative today, why were they not imperative in the period 1960 to 1973 when, according to the hon. member for Durban North, we had such a difficult time. I would like to remind the hon. member that in 1960 an emergency was declared, which lasted for three months. After that, once the declared emergency had lapsed, until the present time, 1973, it appears that we have all been able to come and go quite peacefully in and out of Parliament undisturbed by the demonstrations which have been taking place. So, I would like to move this amendment in order to limit the application of clause 1, which has already been passed, so that no gatherings or demonstrations within the area defined by the schedule, an area which is very much wider than the precincts of Parliament, shall be allowed only on those days when Parliament is sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not prepared to accept this amendment. If one were to accept it, it would mean that demonstrations would in fact be allowed to take place in this area. It would mean that the prohibition would be limited to those days when the House of Assembly is in session. The Session Committees concerned obviously asked us to extend the period over the whole year. In those circumstances I am not prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a number of points arise both from this clause and from what the hon. member for Houghton has said. Firstly, the hon. member seems to approach this question of protests and demonstrations from the point of view that all demonstrations and protests would be against either the Government or the official Opposition, but not necessarily against the point of view which she supports.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;Come off it&#x201D;. That is not good enough. If she is against the principle of this Bill, she must accept that that position might well arise. We do not accept that point of view. We take the view that the hon. member for Houghton, like anyone else, is entitled to free access to this House to put her point of view. This legislation is designed to allow the hon. member free access here in the same way as it applies to any other member of this House. That is only the one point, the question of access.</p>

<p>The other point is the point made by the hon. member for Durban North, a point which is tended to be ridiculed by the hon. member for Houghton and others. However, it was merely an example to show that a messenger boy has as much right to go about his business and to have free movement in the streets as have the protesters who are obstructing the way. The messenger boy is, of course, merely an illusion for the man in the street. The man in the street&#x2014;and there are far more of them than there are protesters or demonstrators &#x2014;also has a right in this matter. He has the right to go about his business. The trouble these days is that the demonstration is only successful in the eyes of those demonstrating if it hinders and impedes the right of the ordinary man to go about his business. Otherwise it is not a successful demonstration. This, I believe, is the point made by the hon. member for Durban North. People have the right to demonstrate and express their views, but provided they do not obstruct unduly the reciprocal right of the ordinary person, of whom there are far more than there are demonstrators, to go about his business unobstructed as well. As there are within this limited area many places under cover and within the city of Cape Town, many places in the open air where this can be done without obstruction to other citizens, we believe that the Bill is not unreasonable.</p>

<p>A final point is, of course, that, as I have said earlier, Parliament, in order to properly fulfil its functions, requires a calm atmosphere in which to do it, unimpeded by the noise and shouting of demonstrators. A court of law is, in many ways, a similar institution. For those reasons this side of the House gave this particular clause which really embodies the principle of the Bill, its support at the Second Reading.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am surprised to hear the hon. member for Zululand coming with such absurd arguments. I am used to them from the hon. member for Durban North, but, I must say, for the hon. member for Zululand to come with these ridiculous arguments, really surrises me. Could I ask him when a messenger boy has ever been obstructed from going to and from Parliament and carrying out his lawful business&#x003F; I have a messenger who comes backwards and forwards every day and he has never complained. Has the hon. member had any such experience&#x003F;</p>

<p>He asks me whether I would object if there were a meeting outside of persons against me which prohibited me from entering Parliament. Let me tell him, first of all, that there are many people in South Africa who are against the point of view I hold. In all the years that I have been here I have never been obstructed and demonstrations could have taken place; nor has the hon. member for Zululand been obstructed by people who do not happen to agree with his point of view. Has he ever had the slightest difficulty in getting in or out of Parliament&#x003F; Surely he will agree that there are ordinary by-laws, municipal by-laws, under which one could summon the police to remove persons who were obstructing the free passage in public thoroughfares&#x003F; I pointed out during the Second Reading that exactly that happened last year when there were about 50 students demonstrating in Parliament Street. Presumably they were breaking a municipal by-law because, without this tremendously important Bill on the Statute Book, there was a police van there in no time at all. The students were bundled into the police van&#x2014;in fact, they were not obstructing anyone; they were standing on the pavement&#x2014;but, in case they might cause an obstruction, <span class="col_6467-6468" refersTo="page_0301"/>they were bundled into the police van. They were taken off to Caledon Square, or wherever it was, where they were charged under a municipal by-law, after which they paid admissions of guilt for breaking that by-law. It think it is absolute nonsense for the hon. member for Zululand to try to persuade this Committee that unless this clause is put on the Statute Book, members of Parliament and messenger boys are going to be obstructed in going to and from Parliament, and this House will not be able to debate in a calm atmosphere. May I ask what we have been doing all these years&#x003F; Indeed, we have had many highly contentious debates in this Parliament. Over the last 13 years that I have been a member, measure after measure was introduced by the hon. the Prime Minister when he was Minister of Justice. When there were demonstrations and protests, nobody had any difficulty in entering or leaving Parliament, and nobody had any difficulty in putting his or her point of view in this House in as calm an atmosphere as we can have in Parliament. So, I do not know what the hon. member is talking about.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North says that the chief magistrate can always give his permission, unless he is convinced that there might be a serious abrogation of law and order. Well, one has to prove the old <i>mala fides</i> argument, which every lawyer, I would imagine, knows is virtually impossible. If, in the chief magistrate&#x2019;s opinion, the meeting is likely to cause a break in law and order, then, of course, he will forbid the meeting. As I say, there have been very few permits granted since the Processions Act has been on the Statute Book, and I am convinced that exactly the same will happen in this case. I am interested to see that the hon. member is now defending magistrates so fervently. I can remember an occasion when he was furious with the hon. Minister of Justice when the hon. the Minister was considering allowing magistrates on the Bench.</p>

<p>Sir, I am discussing clause 2(2)(e), which provides that any gathering or demonstration for which the chief magistrate of Cape Town has granted permission in writing, such a gathering or demonstration may be held. It was argued by the hon. member for Durban North that chief magistrates would not, in fact, withhold permission for the holding of such meetings unless, in their opinion, there was a serious danger that law and order would be disturbed. But I am trying to show that the hon. member&#x2019;s faith in magistrates seems to vary, depending on which measure he happens to be debating. A little while ago, he was telling the hon. Minister of Justice that regional magistrates should not be allowed on the Bench. Now he is telling us that the chief magistrate would seldom be likely to err when, in his opinion, there is going to be a break in law and order.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 27, and in lines 30 and 31, respectively, to omit &#x201C;or demonstration&#x201D;; to omit all the words after &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;, in line 35, to the end of paragraph (b): in line 38, to omit &#x201C;or demonstration&#x201D;; and to omit paragraph (d).</block>

<p>The reason for my moving these amendments is, for instance, that the second amendment abolishes the restriction on reporting the gathering or demonstration. The Bill goes very far beyond protecting <span class="col_6469-6470" refersTo="page_0302"/>M.P.s in forbidding advertising &#x201C;or in any other manner makes known the proposed gathering or demonstration&#x201D;. The term &#x201C;proposed&#x201D; may, I know, be legally argued in this context; but that depends entirely on the court&#x2019;s interpretation. In other words, must the gathering have taken place, or not before the provisions become operative&#x003F; But that is a legal quibble. I want to ensure that, if a gathering does take place, it can be reported. Otherwise, I believe that this is restricting the freedom of the Press still further. As it is, the freedom of the Press is restricted in South Africa, in that it may not report, for instance, on prison conditions. There are various defence matters and official secrets, etc. on which the Press may also not report. Now we are going still further. If a gathering or demonstration takes place, then, according to clause 3(b), if a newspaper reports on the gathering which, in terms of the Bill could be illegal, it is committing an offence. I believe that is another serious restriction on the reporting of news. It is censorship, in fact, of the very worst kind. I wonder whether the official Opposition is going to agree to this form of censorship. This provision will apply to a demonstration which takes place outside Parliament or even on the Parade ground. Let me point out that the prohibited area includes the Parade ground which, until now, was a prohibited area for two year periods; the prohibition had to be renewed every two years. Now this is a permanent prohibition. If there is an outdoor gathering in the city campus of the University of Cape Town and it is held without the permission of the chief magistrate, and any newspaper reports on that gathering, it is in terms of this clause committing an offence for which there are serious penalties. Therefore I wish to move this amendment in order at least to try to preserve the freedom of the Press to report on those demonstrations which may take place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to amend the Schedule.

It includes, in fact, an enormous area in the centre of Cape Town. I wish to move the following amendment.

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;namely&#x201D; to the end of the Schedule and to substitute &#x201C;Bureau Street from the point where Bureau Street meets Parliament Street; Adderley Street from the point where Bureau Street meets Adderley Street up to the beginning of Government Avenue; Government Avenue from Adderley Street up to Gallery Street; Gallery Street from Government Avenue up to St. John&#x2019;s Street; St. John&#x2019;s Street from Gallery Street up to the point where St. John&#x2019;s Street becomes Plein Street, and thence along Plein Street to Spin Street; and Spin Street to the point where it becomes Bureau Street&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I have a little map here which I have shown to the hon. the Deputy Minister. In short, if I may just tell the House, it in <span class="col_6471-6472" refersTo="page_0303"/>fact includes the exact precincts of Parliament, bounded by Plein Street on the one side and Government Avenue on the other, the street just above the Groote Kerk on the north side and the Art Gallery on the south side. I think that will give hon. members an idea of the area in which the Houses of Parliament stand. It includes Government House and the Archives and Stal Plein. It is the whole area which encompasses Parliament and its immediate environs, and surely this is what hon. members want; they want to be able to get in and out of Parliament; they do not want any noisy demonstrations nearby to disturb their meditations; and they want to know that the buildings of Parliament will be safe from demonstrations consisting of one or more people.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading of the Bill I dealt with various objections I had to the introduction of an amendment to section 17(g) of the original Act, an amendment which did not in my view maintain the principle which I regard as very important for the maintenance of good relations between public servants and the public of South Africa, and for the protection of the Public Service itself.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to draw the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister to the fact that the amendment which appears in clause 3 of the amending Bill and amends section 17(g) of the original Act does not in my view provide an adequate definition of what a public servant should or should not do. The amendment refers to somebody who makes use of his position in the Public Service to promote or to prejudice the interests of any political party. Now, so far as that goes it is perfectly clear, but I believe that it is a provision which it would be very hard to apply. It will be very hard to define, hard to identify and hard to apply. If we were confident that the further amendments to be introduced by my hon. friend in clause 4 of the amending Bill would be accepted, our task would to some extent be facilitated because it does define rather more specifically and more precisely what it is that a public servant should or should not do in the furtherance of the interests of any political party or to the prejudice of the Public Service. I should like to draw to the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister the possibility of a number of incidents arising, incidents which would in fact be prejudicial to the Public Service but which are not defined in either of these amending clauses. Suppose, for example, that a public servant in participating in political activity were to indulge in extravagant heckling. Now, this is something which is not prohibited but if a public servant were seen to be heckling he might be held not to have made a speech, not to have addressed a meeting, but nevertheless to have made, shall we say, no more than rude noises. If he does this and attracts attention to himself it would obviously be prejudicial to the Public Service that he should be seen to be doing such things. He might for example be employed as a chucker-out. If he is employed at a political meeting to chuck out other <span class="col_6473-6474" refersTo="page_0304"/>hecklers, then the fact that a public servant, who enjoys some status in the community, is seen to be lifting people on his shoulders and throwing them through the window, would be most undesirable and could create a very unhappy impression. There is the question of demonstrations. Demonstrations could take various forms. If, for example, a public servant were to take a leading part in a demonstration he would not be infringing any of the provisions which we will deal with under clause 4, but nevertheless he would without question be behaving himself in a manner which would be prejudicial to the status and the prestige of the Public Service. One can also imagine many other situations arising which do not fall under the prohibition in clause 4. Therefore in order to supplement clause 3, in order to achieve the purpose which I am sure we must all, on both sides of the House, have in mind, which is not only to restrict the activities of public servants in the use of their status as public servants in furthering or opposing certain political parties, but also to protect the Public Service against improper behaviour by public servants in the exercise of his function, I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 56, after &#x201C;(g)&#x201D;, to insert &#x201C;engages in political activities in a manner detrimental to the interests of the public service, or&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I do not think the hon. member has read this particular clause with the necessary care. This concerns a person who uses his position in the Public Service to promote or prejudice the interests of any political party. In other words, the tenor of the clause is positive. The official may not make use of his position to do certain things. In other words, it is positive. It therefore goes without saying that if he may not even do the positive, then he will decidedly not be able to do anything negative. It therefore appears to me that if he is not allowed to perform a positive act whereby his position will be prejudiced, he is, on the other hand, unable to use his position to do anything negative as well.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand the problem which has been raised by the hon. member for Rissik, but I do not think it is the correct approach. The provision in the Bill before us is that a public servant may not use his position to further political interests. It is a very circumscribed statement. A person, who is the Secretary for the Interior, for instance, may not use his position to further the political interests of a party, but he may well act in some manner, while he is Secretary for the Interior&#x2014;an indication of which was given by the hon. member for Von Brandis&#x2014;and do something in public or at a public meeting which adversely affects the interests or the status of the Public Service. After all, he is a man who is known, because of his status, as the Secretary for the Interior. I think the two things are different. They are complementary, but the one does not include the other. This provision about using his position as a public servant to further the interests of a political party applies to certain provincial regulations at the present time. An important man can stand up to say that his views are this or that on a political issue. He is known as a gentleman of standing and holding a high position, but he is not using his position to further the interests of a political party. However, it may not be in the interests of the Public Service, that he should, while holding that position, participate in politics.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister was present in the House during the whole of the Second Reading debate which was handled by the hon. the Deputy Minister. The problem with which we are faced in this legislation and which arises from this clause and the subsequent clause is that there is no uniform code of ethics in relation to political activity throughout the Civil Service in its wider sense; that is, those people who are in State employ in various departments and who act for the State in relation to the public. That is the problem which we have. In this Bill we are now dealing with one small section of State employees; that is, those who fall under the definition of &#x201C;Public Service&#x201D;. The hon. the Leader of the House is present and he will know that this Bill excludes the employees of the Railways. It is for that reason why one is trying to find something here which is not going to curtail unnecessarily the right of a public servant as a citizen to exercise his political rights, but at the same time it should be restricted in a manner which we believe is necessary for the sake of the status of the Public Service. That is why we have moved this amendment, the object of which is to provide that a public servant should not act in a manner which is detrimental to the Public Service. One can imagine a large number of persons employed in the Railways who are not in contact with the public. <span class="col_6475-6476" refersTo="page_0305"/>Their work is of a specialized nature within the administration of the Railways and their activity in politics does not affect the public because they do not come into contact with the public in the performance of their ordinary duties. However, vast numbers of the persons employed in the Public Service and for whom we are now legislating, are persons who directly contact the public.</p>

<p>Yes, but I am talking about those members who are not in direct contact with the public to the extent of the public servants for whom we are legislating in this Bill. All that we are trying to find is some code which can be applied right throughout the Public Service. I do not want to anticipate our discussion of the next clause, but I am sure that if the hon. the Minister of the Interior, the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs could get some of their officials together, they would be able to work out a code which I believe is in the interests of the Public Service as a whole in South Africa. I think the amendment moved by the hon. member for Von Brandis is a reasonable one, in that it constitutes the counterpart of what is in the proposed clause. At the same time it does not do something which is detrimental to the Public Service for which the hon. the Minister of the Interior is responsible. I am sure that the hon. the Minister does not want any public servant to act in a manner which could be detrimental to the Public Service.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really do think the hon. members for Green Point and Von Brandis have gone too far. The hon. member for Von Brandis has used words such as &#x201C;chucker-out&#x201D; and &#x201C;hecklers&#x201D; and so on. It is really not in the make-up of our public servants, as we have come to know them throughout the years, to play such roles, in any event, not those servants who support the National Party. That is not how we know them. I do not know what the public servants are like in those hon. members&#x2019; constituencies. When we study clause 3, we see that it is primarily concerned with putting the interests of the Public Service first. The hon. member for Rissik referred to an official who used his position in the Public Service to promote or to prejudice the interests of a political party. I cannot see what a &#x201C;chucker-out&#x201D; and a &#x201C;heckler&#x201D; have to do with that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am unable to accept the amendment. There are two reasons for this in practice. The first is that it will be a difficult task to determine when such a person is prejudicing or not prejudicing the Public Service as such and who is to exercise the deciding authority in that connection. The second reason is that I think in all honesty that the Public Service Act already has a blanket provision which covers the situation in general and which is just as effective as that one could possibly be. I refer to the existing section 17(b) of the Public Service Act. According to that it is very clear that an official will be guilty of misconduct if he&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">does, or causes, or permits to be done or, connives at, any act which is prejudicial to the administration, discipline or efficiency of any department, office or institution of the Government;</block>

<p>If, for instance, a man were to act as a &#x201C;chucker-out&#x201D;, to use the term which has been mentioned, then I think he would be contravening this provision of the existing section 17(b). As I interpret this, he would be committing an act which was in fact prejudicial to the administration, discipline and efficiency of a department or an institution. If that were to be the case, I think that it could be interpreted in this way. I think what the hon. member wants to cover is already covered by section 17 (b) and that is the reason why I feel that we should not confuse the matter any further by means of an amendment to section 17(g). Section 17(g) deals specifically with the one aspect, namely the abuse or the use of his position in the Public Service <span class="col_6477-6478" refersTo="page_0306"/>to promote or prejudice the case of a political party. I think that section 17(b), as it stands at present, constitutes the blanket provision which has the effect which that hon. member seeks to achieve by means of the amendment moved by him. Then, too, I want to say to the hon. member for Green Point that it is impossible to achieve uniformity in this regard because we are dealing with &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, but other countries do not have provincial administrations as we have, which have their own way of doing things. We have provincial administrations, each of which has its own provisions. Then we have the railways which has traditionally been functioning for years on another basis. So, too, there is the Post Office which recently became an autonomous body.

<p>In other words, everyone is considered on merit according to the circles in which he moves. The same argument which applies to the Railways, applies to public servants as well. There may be a difference percentage-wise in respect of the number of officials coming into direct contact with the public in the Railways on the one hand and in the Public Service on the other. The principle is nevertheless the same, whether there is 10% in the one group and 30% in the other. It makes no difference. The fact of the matter is that certain people are in direct contact with the public in both the Railways and the Public Service. The principle is therefore the same under both set of circumstances. In the light of the circumstances and in the light of the facts I fear that I am unable to accept the amendment. I therefore want to request that the clause remains unaltered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister stated two things. One is that he can deal with those particular problems or that they can be dealt with under the existing regulations and the generalized applications thereof, and not necessarily dealing with political activity. What I want to say to him is that in the Second Reading it has been pointed out that these regulations have not been enforced for direct political &#x201C;inmenging&#x201D; in the past. The excuse of the departmental head and the Minister concerned was that disciplinary action was permissive and not a compulsory one. In other words, it may or may not be applied, steps may or may not be taken. The second point is that if he wants to carry out logically what he has just said, namely that there should not be uniformity throughout the Public Service and that the police, the Post Office and others he mentioned should have different regulations, can the hon. the Minister then tell me any reason why the Department of Justice is not in the same position as the police and why it is not going to be dealt with in the same way&#x003F; The Department of Justice is falling under the general provisions of this legislation. That is why I think these matters do. I am disappointed that the hon. the Minister indicated that it was impossible to get uniformity, I believe that it is necessary to have clarity in this regard. We can certainly release a vast number of people in various grades of the Public Service to participate more actively in politics. It has been done in other countries, where they have met and agreed that certain grades could participate more actively. I want to say that I believe, and accept, that the overwhelming majority of our senior public servants exercise this political right with the utmost discretion. Unfortunately one has to legislate for the black sheep in the family as well as the white sheep. As far as the Public Service is concerned, we have no objection to the overwhelming majority taking part in these matters, because as they rise in the Service, they use their discretion, and they use it because of their own initiative. There is no compulsion in that regard. I believe it is necessary to limit the activities of those who do not use their discretion in the way that it should be used.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has used two arguments in reply to my amendment, neither of which, I believe, is entirely valid. The first is that my amendment would be difficult to enforce. I put it to him that the amendment under clause 3 of the amending Bill would be even more difficult to enforce. This amendment asks that two <span class="col_6479-6480" refersTo="page_0307"/>things be proved: Firstly, that there should be prejudice or advantage to a political party and, secondly, that if there is such prejudice or advantage, it must have been caused by the public servant in using his public Service position for that purpose. In other words, not only must the deed be proved, but also the motive. This is a very hard thing to prove, and one wonders who is in fact going to take the trouble to prove it against him. In the case of my amendment there is a much simpler issue to be proved. It has not this double requirement, i.e. that he has to do the deed to advantage or prejudice a political party and be shown to have used his position in the Public Service to achieve that. In the case of my amendment it is merely required that it be shown that he has done something in a political context which has been harmful to the Public Service. It means, simply, that he has behaved himself in a way, whilst conducting political activities, which redounded to the discredit of the Public Service. This is a much easier thing to prove. It is one which is much more easily motivated because the Public Service itself, if it feels itself harmed, would in fact wish to take action against that person. I believe that it is in fact the counterpart to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own amendment in clause 3. I believe it rounds off and completes the picture; it gives greater protection to the Public Service and to the public. That is our only purpose in suggesting this amendment.</p>

<p>As far as the second point is concerned, the hon. the Minister has suggested that the amendment which I have proposed covers a position which was already covered by section 17(b) of the existing Public Service Act. It is difficult to agree with this because section 17(b) obviously contemplates circumstances other than political ones. It was section 17(g) in the original Act which specifically dealt with the political circumstances. Section 17(b) is a matter of general discipline within the Service. It is theoretically possible to apply section 17(b) to a political act of some kind, but section 17(g) in the original Act deals specifically with the political concept of a public servant&#x2019;s activities. If one now looks at section 17(g), as amended, one sees that it deals even more elaborately or at greater length with the political activities of the public servant. It is hardly likely that section 17(b) would be taken as covering political activities. I think section 17(g) as it stands would in fact be regarded as the section which deals specifically and comprehensively with what the public servant may or may not do in a political context. I think this imposes the permissive aspects of it and the limitations of it. I believe that 17(g) must be looked at as the one clause which contemplates the political activities of the public servant. I believe therefore that section 17(g) should be adequate for that purpose. I do not believe, that as it stands now, with or without further amendments in clause 4, which we will discuss presently, that it is adequate for its purpose. I attempted to illustrate, for the information of the hon. member for Pretoria District, that the examples I quoted were obviously not allegations of the sort of thing which public servants might do. They were merely illustrations of the fact that the amendments, as they stand, are inadequate to cover every political contingency which may arise in the political life of a public servant.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member was correct in only one small aspect of his argument, namely that paragraph (g) of the old Act only determines the position of the public servant in respect of his association with a political party. What the hon. member is envisaging in his amendment, is to determine the conduct or actions of such a person in respect of his political associations as well. If the hon. member were to take another look at section 17 of the Act he would see in the definition of &#x201C;misconduct&#x201D; that that would amount to an officer being guilty of misconduct and that he might be dealt with in terms of the provisions of section 18 were he to do certain things. These things are set out in paragraphs (a) to (r). These comprise a number of contraventions of which an official may be guilty. One of the sins mentioned, is that of belonging to a political organization or taking an active part in political matters. Now this particular aspect is simply being changed. Bad conduct is not something which is wrong in one aspect only. It applies everywhere. All the other provisions in respect of bad conduct or the kind of conduct on the part of an officer which does not meet the ideals we set for the Public Service, could come into question. In other words, this does not apply to politics alone. Under no circumstances may an officer be guilty of poor conduct. If the hon. member were to read all those provisions he would note that the <span class="col_6481-6482" refersTo="page_0308"/>Public Service is in fact protected against poor and unfair conduct on the part of an officer. This, therefore, does not imply that when he is guilty of poor conduct in a church council, action will not be taken against him. If, for example he belongs to another association and he acts wrongly there, it is not necessary that there should be a specific provision for that contingency. I think that just like the rest of us, the hon. member does not want an officer to act poorly or wrongly. However, this is sufficiently covered under the definition of &#x201C;misconduct&#x201D;. For that reason it is unnecessary to insert any additional provisions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to direct the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to section 17(i) of the Public Service Act, which contemplates precisely the same thing, and covers it very clearly. Paragraph (i) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">conducts himself in a disgraceful, improper or unbecoming manner &#x2026;</block>

<p>All the examples mentioned by the hon. member could be classified under this provision, if it were to come to that. There is no doubt about this. Therefore my argument remains that I think that the prohibition as such is contained in these provisions. The new paragraph (g) is not really being substituted for section 17(g). Clause 4 of the Bill, in which the political rights of an official or employee are being defined, is really being substituted for section 17(g). The total prohibition is now being lifted, with certain conditions. There is really only one object behind the substitution of section 17(g) and that is to prevent abuse in this respect. But all the other sections covering the whole terrain of misconduct remain unaltered.</p>

<p>It is true that certain departments have more difficult problems to handle than other departments as far as the question of politics is concerned, and from the nature of the case their officials are in a more delicate position than others. It is not a question of unwillingness on my part. This is a practical problem. One cannot lump them all together and prescribe that this must be the position for all officials in the service of the State or the provinces. For that reason we have various Acts, and for that reason specific people are being excluded in this Bill. For that reason the Railways, the Post Office and the provinces, respectively, are covered by other legislation. The powers of the provinces in regard to this matter were allocated to them years ago. By means of this Bill, officials who have been entrusted to the care of the Public Service, are now being accommodated.</p>

<p>Amendment negatived.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the principal Act stands at the moment, members of the Public Service are debarred completely from membership of any political organization. That, Sir, you will appreciate, goes much further than membership of a political party because there are political organizations which do not function as political parties.</p>

<p>This Bill intends to provide that members of the Public Service should be permitted to exercise certain political rights. I want to say that in the Second Reading debate we welcomed the fact that it introduces some certainty into what has been an uncertain position, as a result of the fact that no person has contravened the existing provisions of the Act over the last few years. As the hon. the Minister stated in reply to a question by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, there had been no prosecutions or disciplinary actions because of the contravention of the existing provisions over the last ten years. Yet the hon. the Minister will agree with me that there are public servants who have contravened the provision prohibiting membership of a political party or organization over the last ten years. So, we welcome the introduction here of some certainty. There are the specific do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts, as far as participation in politics is concerned.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what is this provision aimed at&#x003F; As I understand this Bill before us, it is aimed, firstly, at going as far as possible to provide a public servant with the opportunity of expressing his personal political affiliations, becoming associated with those persons who think like him in relation to political matters, and of making some contribution to the thoughts of the political party to which he is affiliated or with which he is in accord.</p>

<p>We now come to the first point whereby, in terms of this clause, public servants are <span class="col_6483-6484" refersTo="page_0309"/>allowed to become members of a lawful political party. Having become a member &#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me&#x2014;he there has the opportunity of assisting in the day to day running of that party. He is particularly also given the opportunity, through his party organization, of assisting to formulate policy and to change policy. He may, for instance, try to bring about a change from &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; to &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; or from &#x201C;verlig&#x201D; to &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;, according to his feelings in that party.</p>

<p>How far do we go after that&#x003F; Because the second basic principle of this clause is that what he is going to do must be done privately and not publicly. Paragraphs (b) and (c) make it quite clear that he may attend a public meeting but that he must sit there quietly and attentively and listen; he must not take any active part in the public meeting. Furthermore, he may not draw up or send out pamphlets, and so on. Where is the dividing line between the opportunities he has for his personal expression of political affiliation as a citizen, and the prohibition upon his acting publicly in that regard&#x003F; The amendments I have placed on the Order Paper attempt to clarify this position.</p>

<p>The suggestion contained in my first amendment is that a public servant should be able to join a political party and that he should be able to serve on a branch and/or constituency committee. There he can have his say and actively participate in party affairs. In other words, paragraph (a) will read that an officer or an employee may &#x201C;be a member and serve on the branch and/or constituency committee of a lawful political party&#x201D;. That is how the proposed section 24A(a) will read.</p>

<p>As far as paragraph (b) is concerned, we accept it as it is printed. This paragraph states that a public servant may &#x201C;attend a public political meeting but may not preside or speak at such a meeting&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c) states that a public servant may not &#x201C;draw up or publish or cause to be published any writing or deliver a public speech to promote or prejudice the interests of any political party&#x201D;.</p>

<p>What I suggest should now be added, relates to what he should do and may not do, having once become a member of a branch or constituency committee. The first leg of my amendment states that a public servant &#x201C;may not hold office in the management of any political party&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister will realize that once a member becomes an office-bearer in a constituency, in a constituency organization of a political party or even in a branch of that organization, his political activities are no longer his personal concern; they then become the concern of the branch or of the constituency. It then becomes a public manifestation of his political activities. I believe that that is undesirable and that it cuts across what was intended by the Bill which is now before us.</p>

<p>The next prohibition which I believe should be incorporated is that a public servant may not &#x201C;canvass for members or funds or for support of any candidate in the interests of any political party&#x201D;. That would eliminate him from direct participation in making contact with the public as a member of a political party. In so far as elections are concerned, it would exclude the public servant, for instance, from getting involved in the municipal elections in Johannesburg, but not from the municipal elections of Pretoria, where such elections are not held on party political lines. Hon. members know that elections in Johannesburg are held on party political lines. There he could not then go and canvass for councillors. He could, however, certainly do so in Cape Town or Pretoria, where the elections are not held on party political lines.</p>

<p>The further paragraph I have suggested should be included in order to provide clarity, so that there can be no question about this. This paragraph, paragraph (f), states that an officer or employee may not &#x201C;use, or permit the use of, the premises of any State department for political purposes&#x201D;. In other words, in terms of this provision one will not be able to have a cosy little branch known as the &#x201C;Department of the Interior branch&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing branch&#x201D; where persons can make use of State department premises or offices for the purposes of political meetings.</p>

<p>I believe that these are reasonable amendments, and we on this side would like to see them introduced into this Bill not for the sake of limitation, but more for the sake of clarity, because a basic principle in the new section proposed here is the separation of the opportunities for private political expression on the part of a public servant on the one hand, and the public expression of political affiliation by such a servant on the other. I trust that the <span class="col_6485-6486" refersTo="page_0310"/>hon. the Minister will accept this amendment for those reasons, and therefore I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 5, to omit &#x201C;management&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;branch and/or constituency committee&#x201D;; and to add the following paragraphs at the end of the proposed section 24A:</block>

<ol>

<li>(d) not hold office in the management of any political party;</li>

<li>(e) not canvass for members or funds or for support of any candidate in the interests of any political party;</li>

<li>(f) not use, or permit the use of, the premises of any State department for political purposes.</li>

<p>Sir, I want to support briefly the arguments of the hon. member for Green Point. In terms of clause 4 as it stands, a public servant is allowed to do certain things. This is the positive side of the amendment contained in this Bill. The first is that he may be a member and serve on the management of a political party; secondly, he may attend political meetings, etc. He is prohibited from doing two things only. The one is that he may not serve as chairman, and the second is that he may not publish, viz. in (b) and (c), he is prohibited from publishing by making speeches or drawing up writings, etc. Sir, an immediate deduction to be made from these prohibiting&#x2014;since he is allowed to do certain things and since only these two prohibitors exist, namely that he may not preside at a meeting nor publish&#x2014;is that he may do anything else which is legal in the execution of his political activities, because there are only these two things which are prohibited. We would have preferred the hon. the Minister to have accepted our first amendment, because then there would have been a general statement which could perhaps have been embodied in a code which could have been drawn up by the heads of departments and which would be intelligible to everyone and which could be applied to all circumstances as they developed. What we have here now is a certain clause which allows certain things to be done and which prohibits only two things in the whole political life of the public servant. Of course, it may be deduced that everything which is not prohibited is in fact allowed, and these include a large number of other activities, some examples of which I mentioned a short time ago. The hon. member for Green Point tried to add a few other prohibitions to those two prohibitions, and the inclusion of those prohibitions would definitely be an improvement. To my way of thinking there are also other possibilities which arise &#x2014;other activities which may, also have to be prohibited in the future. Sir, we still prefer a code; we still prefer a general statement as we would have had if our amendment to clause 3 had been accepted and which would have allowed of such a code being put into operation by, for example, the committee of heads of departments; but the clause as it stands is inadequate and the endeavour of the hon. member for Green Point seeks to eliminate the shortcomings in the clause. I doubt whether they could ever be eliminated adequately simply by stipulating these points, because there are many activities which it is simply impossible to mention in one clause. We would have preferred to have had a code but since it is improbable that our concept of a code will be accepted, I support these additional prohibitions as proposed by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>Sir, he remains an officer-bearer, in my opinion, because from time to time instructions are given to those members to execute certain things in practice, to collect funds, to canvass, or something of this nature. What difference does it make whether the man who does these things does so in his capacity as member of the management or in his capacity as chairman&#x003F; As chairman he would perhaps come into contact with the public less frequently. The ordinary member is the very person who goes from house to house. I think that if we were to accept this amendment we would actually be aggravating the position. But in practice there is only this difference; we on this side of the House are in fact prepared to allow the official to serve on the party management and perform all the duties he would in the normal course of events be given to perform as a member of the management of a party. The Opposition differs from us and therefore their amendment states that he may not hold office in the management of the party. This automatically applies to the next one, (e), too, namely that he may not canvass for members or funds or for support of any candidate of any White political party. If he may serve on the management, then automatically he must do this, as far as I can see, and therefore I am also unable to accept (e). In the case of (f), I once again want to submit for the consideration of the hon. member that in my opinion (f) is already covered in two of the existing provisions. I want to agree that (f) should definitely not be used. We do not want to use the premises of the state departments for any political activities. I agree, but I want to maintain that (f) is fully covered, in the first place, by the provision I have just mentioned, 17(b), which refers to the committing or permitting of, or the conniving at, any act which is prejudicial to the administration, discipline or efficiency of a department, office or institution. The fact that one uses one&#x2019;s office for an official party meeting or something of this nature, is, after all, a contravention of that. But the second reason is even clearer. I refer to section 17(o) which provides that it constitutes misconduct to misappropriate or improperly use any property of the Government under such circumstances that his act does not constitute a criminal offence. If a person were to use an official Government office for a political meeting, I would make the logical deduction from that that he was using it improperly. The office has not been provided for that purpose. Such a person would, for example, make use of the State&#x2019;s electricity and that would constitute improper use of the property of the State. I therefore want to take up the sincere standpoint that in my opinion this is fully covered in (o) and in the blanket clause (b). I want to put it like this only in principle. What the hon. member for Green Point is now trying to say is that we are granting certain powers but withholding others, so that certain things may not be done. That which we deemed necessary to withhold, we withheld. For the rest we believe in the blanket provisions such as the previous one, 17(b) and 17(o) and 17 (h). All these blanket provisions must clarify the matter further. We cannot stipulate the exceptions one by one because one would never be able to do so. One would always forget one or two and we therefore have the blanket concept which we are now inserting into 17(g), viz. &#x201C;using his position in the Public Service&#x201D; to promote or prejudice a party. To me this seems to be a blanket clause which, politically speaking, solves the whole matter and in the light of this I do not think that the amendment can constitute an improvement.</p>

<p>I am very sorry about the Minister&#x2019;s approach but his view of the amendment is a very superficial one. If the hon. the Minister would only read what is in front of him on the Order Paper, he would see that we have no objection to an official of the Public Service being a member of a branch committee or constituency committee. That is clear. But we also go further and say that he must not hold an office in the management of a political party. There is a big difference between membership of the management and of the committee. We say that he must not act as chairman of a branch <span class="col_6489-6490" refersTo="page_0312"/>of a constituency or as treasurer or as secretary. We say that it is clear that in terms of the Bill before us, he cannot act as chairman at a public meeting. Now what may happen&#x003F; Take the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own constituency. There is a public meeting, and, in terms of the Act as it stands, the chairman of his own constituency committee is unable to preside at that meeting. Why then should he be able to act as chairman to do the ordinary work of the constituency&#x003F; Then he must get someone else to do it. That is our problem. What the Minister said is not logical.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. the Minister has not done justice to the amendment in considering it. Does he really want us to accept that it is in the interest of the Public Service of South Africa, the relations between the public Service cannot only become the chairman of a branch in my constituency, but that he can canvass for members&#x003F; If he is allowed to canvass, it means that he can canvass in his own office and he can canvass among his underlings in his office. He can also canvass among his own underlings and in his own department for subscriptions for membership of the Nationalist Party or the United Party. Does the hon. the Minister really think that that is desirable&#x003F; The point is furthermore that he can canvass those people in his office to go to vote for somebody on election day. That is most undesirable. If the hon. the Minister will go not only to the officials in the top grades, but to those in the second and third grades, I guarantee that if he gets 1% of those officials who will stand by that proposition he will be lucky. They do not want it. It embarrasses them. It embarrasses their relationship with their own staff and it embarrasses their relationship with the public.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister explained to me that the proposed subsection (f) of our amendment is not necessary, but if he does not accept subsections (d) and (e) then it will be going out from this Chamber that there is nothing prohibiting officials from acting as office-bearers of any political party, from collecting funds, from canvassing inside and outside their own departments. If his senior officer comes with an instruction to sign a membership card of the Nationalist Party and he says that he is not prepared to sign it, what will happen to him&#x003F; What happens to discipline; what happens to relationships within the Public Service&#x003F; I believe it is a wrong step.</p>

<p>If you want to restrict, as is the spirit of the Bill, the public servant&#x2019;s political activities to his private life, we have no objection and we should like to see that the public servant is given the opportunity to express all the political views he likes, whether in the committee of a branch or that of the constituency. However, when it comes to the public servant&#x2019;s official capacity, there should be no manifestation of what his political views are.</p>

<p>I do think that the hon. the Minister is doing an injustice to a vast number of our public servants, because what did they ask in 1970&#x003F; What did the Public Servants&#x2019; Association ask&#x003F; They only asked that they be permitted to become members of political parties. As the law stands at the moment, they cannot even become members. The hon. the Minister is aware of this position. They cannot become members without transgressing the Public Service Regulations and if they do, disciplinary action can be taken. All they said was that they should like to become members of political parties. I agree that they should be able to express their political views within the confines of the various committees of political parties in order to contribute to the political thinking of South Africa. However, if these other actions are permitted, if they are permitted to hold office, not only as an ordinary member of the management of a constituency or a branch, but also as office-bearers, for example, chairman or treasurer or secretary, then I believe that the Minister must expect to encounter many difficulties. I believe, too, that he can expect a lot of resistance from the ranks of the public servants themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member has apparently failed from the very beginning to understand clause 4, as printed. Apparently he did not quite understand at the Second Reading what we meant by section 24A(a) as proposed by clause 4. In the Afrikaans text this reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">lid wees en in die bestuur dien van &#x2019;n wettige politieke party;</block>

<p>I shall tell the hon. member in my terminology what we mean. I want to give the English version, too, so that there may be no confusion:</p>

<block name="quote">be a member and serve on the management of a lawful political party;</block>

<p><span class="col_6491-6492" refersTo="page_0313"/>This surely means that it is a reference to a public servant who is in the position of being a member of the management. A member of the management has certain duties. To me this simply means that we are hereby granting full political rights to the public servant. That is what they asked for. No public servant is being obliged to do this. No constraint is being exerted upon a public servant to be a member of a political party. The person who does not feel like being a member of a party, need not be one, and the person who wants to join a party, will now have the right to do so and need no longer do so in secret or on the sly, thereby running the risk of being confronted at any time with the fact that he has infringed the Public Service Act. We just want to give the opportunity to be able to do so, to those who want to or can do so. Those who do not want to do so, need not; there is a free choice. We are now giving the public servant, who is just as much a taxpayer and a member of the population as is anyone else, the rights enjoyed by the ordinary John Voter and John Citizen. Why should we restrain the public servants from doing this if it is their right&#x003F; We are giving them the right to do so. I may add that the amendment proposed by the hon. member, that a public servant be prohibited from serving on a management, apparently implies that we on this side of the House and the hon. members on the other side of the House, understand two different things.</p>

I want to state clearly that I am not prepared to give the public servants half a right. We are giving the public servants political rights at their request. All that we are doing, is to prohibit what could cause the State embarrassment.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister commenced his reply by saying that no public servant would be compelled to take part in politics. I accept that, and I am glad to hear him say it, because this is our attitude as well. However, what has been the effect of these prohibitions, in the Act up to now&#x003F; These prohibitions have provided a degree of protection for the public servant who has not wished to take an active part in politics. When any person has said to him: &#x201C;Why do you not come in&#x003F;&#x201D;, or &#x201C;To which political party do you belong&#x003F;&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Which way do you think, politically&#x003F;&#x201D; he has had the protection of saying: &#x201C;Look, I am a public servant, and I have nothing to do with politics.&#x201D; That has been the situation up to now. This has been the protection that has been afforded to him. At the request of the Public Service Association&#x2014;and I have a copy of their resolution of 1970 here&#x2014; the Government has now introduced this legislation to grant them certain political rights. I believe that we are going beyond what the Public Service Association asked for in 1970, as has been pointed out by my hon. friend for Green Point. We are going beyond that; we are taking all that protection away from the public servant. He can no longer claim the protection of the Act, if we accept the amendments to the Act which are now proposed by the hon. the Minister. We take away all the protection he may ever have had. We are now allowing his senior officials to go to the man and say: &#x201C;Here, sign a membership card,&#x201D; and the official cannot say: &#x201C;Look, I do not take part in politics.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course that is the implication of what is happening here! We are taking that protection away from him.</p>

<p>There is yet another aspect of this. The Act as it has been in the past and as we are trying to amend it now, prohibits the currying of favour by a public servant, particularly by the senior officials of the various departments, with their Ministers or their seniors by officiating within the political party which is supported by the senior official and also by the Minister. What better way for a civil servant to advance within a department than to play an active part in working for his Minister&#x003F; I believe one must protect the civil servant from this sort of thing. You must protect him against those people who will use what we are now putting on the Statute Book to act against him.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at <i>Die Staatsamptenaar</i> of April, 1970, in which an editorial was written on the whole question of political rights.

<p>I want to quote from this editorial&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is one of the outstanding attributes of the South African public servant that he can act impartially whatever Government may be in power.</block>

<p>If we recognize the political rights of the civil servant, which we all do, that he should have the full right to cast his vote and to participate privately in politics for himself, this is fine. However, immediately you get to the stage where that civil servant can hold an official position in a political party&#x2014;he might even be the chairman of a province or the chairman of a national congress of a political party&#x2014;can he still continue to serve his masters, to serve the Government in an impartial way&#x003F; This, I think, is the point which my friend, the hon. member for Green Point, was trying to make, namely, allow the man political activity, allow him to be a member of a party by all means, but do not let him get himself into a position where his official position in the party is such that it can impair his judgment within the Service. At the time when I was in the Public Service it was a thing over which we were all extremely proud, namely the fact that we had to serve the Government of the day. Certain civil servants, particularly those of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and the Department of Foreign Affairs have to carry out the policy of a particular political party. Those, I believe, should be apolitical; you cannot do that. It is an extreme view and I accept that it is an extreme view. Therefore we should limit the activity of those particular officials in politics. Let them be members of a political party. Let them have opinions. We do not want to prohibit the civil servants from having political opinions. But I do believe that there should be a limit to the activities which are permitted to them.</p>

<p>We had the example seven or ten days ago. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Finance is unfortunately not here. He said that a teacher should be entitled to propagate for the party of his choice so long as he did not carry his beliefs into the classroom. Now, if you are going to apply this to all civil servants, namely that a civil servant should be entitled to propagate for the party of his choice, how then does an official in the Department of Bantu Administration who supports the Progressive Association or United Party carry out the policy of this Government as a good State servant&#x003F; This is the question which the hon. the Minister must ask himself. Does he agree with this statement by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Finance, namely that a civil servant should be allowed to propagate for a party&#x003F; I think this is in conflict with what the hon. the Minister means. I believe that the hon. the Minister is making this too wide. He is taking the defence away from the civil servant. He is leaving the civil servant open to abuse. In this way we are going to detract from the goodwill which the civil servant has in the eyes of the public.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, but I must reply to this argument. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District really has a poor opinion of the public servant if he maintains that the public servant wants to hide behind the Act in an attempt to justify in this way his evasion of political activities. Prevously, when he was asked to join a political party, he could say, &#x201C;The Act protects me; I may not,&#x201D; and he can still say so. He can still say that he does not want to join. There is nothing to stop him.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Who says so&#x003F; There is no question of that. One need only say that it is against one&#x2019;s principles to discuss <span class="col_6497-6498" refersTo="page_0316"/>one&#x2019;s politics openly with anyone. Hundreds of people say so, and they are not necessarily public servants. Any member of the public can say that he is not prepared to take an active part in politics. He need not say openly where he stands. His business, interests or whatever may cause him not to be able to do this. Nothing on earth can force a public servant to do this if he does not want to. I do not think that the public servants will have a favourable opinion of this hon. member who now wants to create the impression that they have been hiding behind the Public Service Act all these years. According to him they do not really want to take part in politics; however, they do not have the courage to say so themselves, and that is why they are hiding behind the Public Service Act. They can supposedly say that the Act does not make provision for them, and therefore they are hiding behind it. That is the impression the hon. member is trying to create. It is not a question of protection. He says that the Act protected them. The Act now gives him that right. Now he still has his personal right, as an individual, to say, &#x201C;In spite of the fact that the Act provides that I may take part in politics, it is my personal conviction that I do not want to take part openly in politics; I am sorry.&#x201D; Everyone will respect him for that. That is his personal right. This is done by many other people who are not in the Public Service. What is the difference&#x003F; After all, this is his right. We are giving the Public Service the full opportunity.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member said that the highest ideal of the public servant was to serve the Government of the day. I am in full agreement with him. It is his highest ideal to serve the Government of the day. But whether he may exercise political rights or not, the fact remains that the public servant still has a personal opinion. Whether or not he has political franchise or the right to be a member of a political party, he still has a political opinion. Now, at this moment, before this Bill is enacted, he has a political opinion His opinion may differ from that of the Goverment of the day. He may vote against the Government at every election. This has always been his right all along. In what respect will the fact that he is now a member of a political party, suddenly make it impossible for him to do his duty and serve the Government of the day&#x003F; The fact that he is a member of a party as such, only means that he may now do openly what he has always had to do in secret; that is all. Whether he wants to do so confidentially, or wants to remain silent about it or kick up a fuss about it, is his affair; the fact remains that in the light of the present provision, i.e. that they may not become a member of any political party, the public servants have asked &#x201C;at least&#x201D; to be allowed to become members of a political party. That does not mean that that is all they want. I had discussions with the Public Servants&#x2019; Association, and I discussed the whole matter with them fully. I want to say that what I am doing here corresponds with their wishes as expressed to me That is why I am doing it in this way, and that is why I want to give the public servants their full right. As far as I am concerned, there is no need for protecting people against themselves, and still less will it affect their ability to perform their duties properly.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned on Friday, I had indicated that I wished to address certain remarks to the hon. the Minister in connection with the Standing Advisory Committee to be appointed in terms of clause 18 of the Bill. It would appear that this committee is to be established by the hon. the Minister and that it will investigate certain matters of its own volition; it will decide itself to investigate certain matters. It will also investigate matters referred to it by the hon. the Minister. There is no reference in the Bill to the fact that this committee will be utilized to examine contemplated legislation. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could indicate to us whether he regards that as one of the functions of this Standing Advisory Committee. Will it give advice in regard to contemplated amendments to legislation affecting companies and company law&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there is another matter I wish to refer to. I should like to know what is to be done with the report of this particular committee. So far as the Bill is concerned, it states merely that the Standing Advisory Committee &#x201C;may from time to time make recommendations to the Minister&#x201D;. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he might include in this Bill&#x2014;we can debate this more fully at a later stage&#x2014;the provisions which are in a measure which we passed earlier this session, relating to the establishment of the Law Revision Commission. In that measure there is a provision that that commission must present a report annually on the investigations, etc., it has undertaken, and that such a report will be tabled in this House. I think it would indicate to the House what work has been undertaken by the committee, and I trust that at a later stage, when I introduce this amendment in the Committee Stage, we may have a more detailed discussion about this matter.</p>

<p>Before I leave clause 18 and the functioning of this advisory committee, there are three matters in this connection I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister. The first is the question of the constitution of this committee. The clause refers to certain persons who will be appointed, one of whom shall be a judge or a senior advocate, and then it goes on to mention &#x201C;such <i>ex officio</i> and other members&#x201D; as the Minister may from time to time determine. I wonder whether the Minister could give us some indication as to where he is going to find these <i>ex officio</i> members. Does he mean members <i>ex officio</i> solely from the department, or would they, for instance, include <span class="col_6501-6502" refersTo="page_0318"/>such persons as <i>ex officio</i> the chairman of Assocom, the chairman of the Stock Exchange or a person from some organization of that sort&#x003F; Will he consider such persons as <i>ex officio</i> members, or are these to be purely departmental officials&#x003F;</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Parktown has said, we welcome the standing committee, but there is one subsection of clause 18 which I think needs clarification, and that is where the power is given to this committee to call to its assistance &#x201C;suoh person or persons as it may deem necessary to assist it&#x201D;. In other words, it is given the power to call witnesses to come and consult with it, and no doubt to be interrogated. Is it the intention that this should be on a purely voluntary basis&#x003F; In other words, will they merely invite people to assist them&#x003F;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Is that subclause (5)&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Will this take place merely by way of invitation&#x003F; In other words, will there be no question of compulsion or anything of that nature&#x003F; I would assume that that is so, but perhaps the hon. the Minister can deal with this point and indicate what he has in mind.</p>

<p>I find, and have found over the years, considerable difficulty in dealing with a phrase which is so often incorporated in our laws, and that is the phrase &#x201C;directly or indirectly&#x201D;. In this Bill it appears over and over again. It appears in various definitions. It appeas in relation to the control of a company, where the control of so many shares, of a certain percentage of the shareholding &#x201C;directly or indirectly&#x201D;, is of importance. It appears in connection with loans which are forbidden under the Act, &#x201C;directly or indirectly&#x201D;. It appears throughout, in various clauses in this Bill. Sir, I am going to suggest that when we deal with this matter in the Committee Stage we should try to eliminate some of the occasions on which the word &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; is used. I suggest that in some of these clauses, where the term &#x201C;directly or indirectly&#x201D; is used, we should specify what we mean by &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; in the particular connotation in which it is used in that particular clause of the Bill. I do not want to weary the House, or you, Sir, at this stage by going through each of them, but I think this is a drafting phenomenon which unfortunately is repeated over and over in this particular Bill.</p>

<p>Now I come to what I believe is one of the most complicated aspects of the Bill which I think could be greatly simplified. I refer to clauses 32, 33, 34 and 36 dealing with the formation, objects and powers of a company. Sir, if you look at clause 32 you will find that a company must be formed for a lawful purpose; in other words, it must have a purpose which is lawful. When we go to clause 33, we find that the company must have a &#x201C;main object&#x201D;. When we look at one of the subclauses of clause 33, we find that the company must have a &#x201C;main business&#x201D;. I am afraid that by the time one is finished trying to find out what this all means, one is left in a somewhat confused mental state as to what is the &#x201C;main business&#x201D;, the &#x201C;main object&#x201D; and the &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; of a company in the context of this particular clause. For instance, if one forms a company to grow tea, is one&#x2019;s main object to grow tea, or is one&#x2019;s main object to enter into the field of agricultural activities&#x003F; What is the main object, the main purpose&#x003F; I would say that if you ask most people in the world what their main object or their main purpose is in forming companies, they will say that it is to make profits. I think we should try to define in some way what We mean by &#x201C;main purpose&#x201D; and &#x201C;main object&#x201D;. Sir, I want to suggest that this procedure could be very much simplified. I hope the hon. the Minister will have time to discuss this more fully. Clause 33(1) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any company formed in pursuance of section 32 shall have the capacity determined by the main object stated in its memorandum &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then it goes on to say in subclause (2)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the main business actually carried on at any time by a company referred to in subsection (1) falls within the capacity of the company by virtue only of an object ancillary to the main object stated in its memorandum, such main business shall be deemed to be the main object of that company &#x2026;</block>

<p>It seems to me, having regard to the saying clause, clause 36, which deals with acts which are <i>ultra vires,</i> that it would be sufficient if clause 33 merely said that subject to any limitations imposed by this Act and subject to the provisions of section 34, a company formed in pursuance of section 32, i.e. for a lawful purpose, shall be deemed to have unlimited capacity, including <span class="col_6503-6504" refersTo="page_0319"/>the powers set out under Schedule 2, unless there are certain restrictions placed upon it in its own memorandum; in other words, we should simply state that it must be established for a lawful purpose, and no restrictions should be placed upon it in exercising the powers set out under Schedule 2.</p>

<p>Sir, at this stage I do not want to go into the details of the amendments that we propose to place on the Order Paper, but what I am trying to do is to simplify the position. In clause 52, for example, we should merely state that the memorandum of a company shall state the name of the company; that it has limited capacity to trade or to carry on business in terms of section 33, or that it has unlimited capacity, save for the exclusion of certain things which can then be set out in detail. In other words, in the case of a company with unlimited capacity, the memorandum should simply state that it will not be restricted in its activities in any way and that it will be able to exercise all the powers which are set out in Schedule 2. That will avoid this &#x201C;main business&#x201D; and &#x201C;main purpose&#x201D; which are referred to in the Bill at present.</p>

<p>There are one or two other matters I want to deal with. The first is a problem in the administration of companies which I believe will arise from the provisions dealing with special resolutions. Now a special resolution according to the Bill, must be lodged and registered with the Registrar of Companies and will only take effect as from the date of registration. In other words, if a special resolution were to be adopted on the 1st of the month and it were to be finally registered in the companies office on the 23rd of the month, it would be effective from the 23rd. I believe that can lead to complications and difficulties in company management and I can see no reason myself why a special resolution, when it has been registered, should not then become effective retrospectively from the date on which it was passed. I can see no problem in that. There may be some obstacle of which I am not aware, but it seems to be a matter which could well be considered and which would facilitate company administration. If a special resolution is taken, its taking effect will then be suspended until such time as it has been registered.</p>

<p>Talking about special resolutions, I come to the question of loans to directors, which are dealt with in the provisions of section 86<i>bis et seq.</i> of the previous Act. It seems to me that although a great deal has been done in this Bill to tighten up the position, there is still one loophole. The limitation on loans to directors and other officers in this Bill still does not cover the position which has arisen often in the past where money is lent to a private company which is in fact controlled by one or more of the directors of the lending company. I believe that that flaw still exists in this Bill. There still can be a loan from a public company to a private company, on resolution by the directors, where the directors themselves, either all or some of them, may have the full control of the subsidiary company. In that regard I believe that when we deal with clause 37 of the Bill, it will be necessary to add another form of company to which loans cannot be made. Clause 37(1) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No part of the funds of a company shall be employed directly or indirectly in loans to any company which is its controlling company or which is a company controlled by that controlling company &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then I want to suggest that the following words be added, namely &#x201C;or which is a company controlled by any director or directors of the lending company&#x201D;. At the moment, as I read and understand the position, there is a loophole in those provisions and a way around can be found by unscrupulous borrowers. This also has reference to clause 226 of this Bill, which deals with the more direct aspect of loans to directors. I believe there also it is necessary to close that gap and have the same sort of provision which I have suggested for clause 37.</p>

<p>There are general provisions in this Bill which one finds are of value and which I am sure will be most efficacious. One really finds oneself deeply indebted to the work of this commission and the various other persons who contributed to the drawing up of this Bill which is before us. It has gone through the threshing-machine, or through various threshing-machines, before it has come out in the form in which it is today. One hesitates to make suggestions in regard to matters which have been so ably and carefully considered by the various people and bodies concerned. But perhaps those of us in the lesser walks who come across these matters in daily practice, come across things of which the erudite persons in higher positions who deal with company <span class="col_6505-6506" refersTo="page_0320"/>matters and companies legislation may not be aware. Clause 260, for instance, contains a very sound provision about an inspector&#x2019;s rights to call for information and to cause an examination to be made, but I think there is a danger. A person who can be subpoenaed in terms of the Bill to appear before an inspector for interrogation, may find himself in some difficulty if he is not legally advised. I suggest that any person who is summoned to appear before an inspector should be entitled to be accompanied by an attorney with or without counsel. One appreciates that the inspector&#x2019;s interrogation follows virtually the same system, although in a different way, with which we are dealing under the Criminal Procedure Bill, where provision is made for a preliminary interrogation to take place, and it seems that there is no reason why legal representation should not be allowed to a person who is called to attend such an interrogation.</p>

<p>There are two other matters with which I should like to deal in the time left to me. First of all I come to the question of foreign companies requiring or intending to register in South Africa. I refer to clause 335. The hon. the Minister will notice that this clause provides that any foreign company making application for registration under the chapter of the Bill which deals with foreign companies must satisfy the State President as to various points. It must satisfy the State President in regard to the conduct of the business, the nationality of the majority of the directors, and so on. Is it constitutionally correct that we should involve the State President in exercising what merely amounts to an administrative judgment in determining whether or not he is satisfied on certain facts&#x003F; It would seem to me that in clause 335(2) the words &#x201C;State President&#x201D; should be substituted by &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;. If there were to be some argument or public discussion as to whether or not the company was entitled to registration, it would be difficult to involve the State President in such discussion and not the Minister concerned. I can assure the hon. the Minister that we on this side of the House might feel inhibited in making our views known if we were to disagree with any decision of the State President, but we would certainly be able to express our views to the hon. the Minister in that regard if necessary. In any case I do not think it is the correct form in legislation to involve the State President in, as I have said, what seems to me to be an administrative discretion.</p>

<p>There is another word which is being used and to which the hon. member for Parktown referred in connection with the liability of directors in the event of the liquidation or judicial management of companies. I refer to cases where businesses were conducted &#x201C;recklessly&#x201D;. I scratched my head over the weekend to find some other means of expressing this. It does seem to me that one can find legal precedent and a refinement of that expression if one were to say, not that he has conducted his business &#x201C;recklessly&#x201D; but that the business was conducted in a &#x201C;grossly neglible manner&#x201D;. I think there are sufficient court decisions and analyses of that expression, an expression which should have a different connotation and a more definite meaning than the word &#x201C;recklessly&#x201D; which is being used in the Bill. I offer that merely as a suggestion to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Then I want to say, finally, that the more one goes into this Bill and the more one studies it, the more one comes to the following conclusion. As I have said on Friday and I want to say again, one of the early functions of the advisory committee will be to clarify the position of private companies in relation to all the operations of this legislation. Private companies are being frowned upon and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, has socked them up to R50 for licences in an endeavour to dissuade the public from registering these private companies. While it is part of our law, I think it must be looked at not as a procedure to be burdened by unnecessary commissions, but something that can be adopted. It forms so much part of our commercial life in this country that it could well be looked at to see to what extent some of these provisions could be relaxed and perhaps also how they can be directed mainly to the lessening of the involvement of the Registrar of Companies&#x2019; office in the activities of private companies. As the hon. the Minister knows, for the payment of 25c any person is at present entitled to go to a private company&#x2019;s registered office and look at the register. I wonder whether one cannot contemplate another form of getting information without all this burden being placed on the central companies office in Pretoria, e.g. the supply of all the information and the submission of returns which presently have to be rendered by these <span class="col_6507-6508" refersTo="page_0321"/>companies. I believe that that is something that can be considered further.</p>

<p>I want to say again that one appreciates the tremendous volume of work that has gone into this bill which is before us. It is obviously a Bill that can be dealt with more in detail in the Committee Stage and there we can collaborate on the number of amendments which are not touched on this afternoon. I believe however that it is a step forward and a very important step forward in company legislation in South Africa. It will take some time to get used to the new definitions and expressions which are used, but as the hon. member for Parktown has said, this is a Bill which we on this side of the House most certainly support.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by expressing my sincere appreciation for the discussion which has taken place in regard to this Bill. Hon. members will appreciate it when I say that a person requires a great deal of courage simply to open this piece of legislation. It requires courage to begin to study this piece of legislation. It is a very lengthy piece of legislation, of a very complicated and very technical nature. I think we had the proof here that a great deal of study has been devoted to this Bill on both sides of this House. In the first place, the hon. member for Parktown introduced this debate and spoke for almost an hour on the Bill. He went into it in great detail, and I have a feeling that we shall deal with it later during the Committee Stage. It nevertheless affords one an opportunity of discussing the particulars in advance, and then, after thinking matters over a little in that connection, taking a decision in regard to them during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>When I was an articled clerk my principal frequently told me that one should know the basic concepts of the Act, but, he said, what was equally important, and perhaps even more important, was that one should know where to find them. One should know whether it was part of common law, or whether it was statute law, etc. A lawyer in particular must know which book to open when he wants the necessary information on a matter. For that reason I think it is in fact the right approach first to understand the basic concepts of this Bill before us. When we come to the analysis of words, whether it is this word or that word and what its meaning is, as will probably happen many times in the courts after this, one does still have to know where to find the clause. From thence one can then proceed to make the analysis.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to begin with the hon. member for Parktown. He raised various problems here. It is obvious that I will not reply to all of them, but I do want, for the sake of the discussion, to reply to a few of the points. The hon. member referred to a holding company. He mentioned that for the purposes of a holding company provision is now being made for a shareholding of 30%. It seems to me that what the commission had in mind with the creation of a holding company was that that definition should be created for the purposes of disclosure. I think it is in the interests of the shareholder that he should know from time to time what the major and important investments of his company are. For that reason it is provided here that, if it is more than 30%, it has to be disclosed. The percentage could have been anything. I cannot do better than to refer to what the commission itself said with regard to this matter in their report on page 113. They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In terms of our approach the decisive factor is the extent of the financial interest, whether it consists of ordinary shares or preference shares or both.</block>

<p>I think the hon. member also discussed the possibility of whether it should be shares with voting rights or whether it should merely be preference shares to which no voting rights are attached. If the approach is the disclosure of the interest, the question of whether these are shares with voting rights are attached. If the approach is the disclosure of the interest, the question of whether these are shares with voting rights or shares without voting rights is not of such great importance. I continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6509-6510" refersTo="page_0322"/>In other words we have in mind expressing the financial interests as a percentage of the issued capital of the second company. For practical purposes the existing yardstick is the holding of more than 50% of the shares (equity) in the second company. It has already been said that we consider this provision to be inadequate. It would seem that 45%, 35% and even 30% represents financial interests of substance justifying disclosure of information. As soon as the figure drops below 30 we begin to have doubts.</block>

<p>Then the report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have come to the conclusion that the figure of 30% is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. Our recommendation below will thus be to the effect that a company which holds not less than 30% of the issued capital of another company becomes that company&#x2019;s holding company which in turn becomes its subsidiary.</block>

<p>As I have said, this is as I see the philosophy behind it, and I cannot really improve on the elucidation of the commission itself.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown, the hon. member for Vryburg, and others, referred to the standing advisory committee for which provision is being made in clause 18. Various opinions were expressed on who should be members of this standing advisory committee. The hon. member for Green Point referred to the members who would serve on it in an official capacity, and at this stage I should like to give an indication of how I think the committee should be constituted&#x2014;I am not saying &#x201C;will be&#x201D;, for I do not want to commit myself to that at this stage. I should like hon. members to realize this. The Bill itself provides that the chairman of the committee shall be a judge or a senior advocate. Then there shall be, or it is desirable that there shall be, representatives on this committee of the following bodies: the Committee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange; the Council of the Bar of South Africa; the Association of Law Societies of the Republic of South Africa; the National Council of Chartered Accountants; the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut; the Association of Chambers of Commerce; the Federation of Steel and Engineering Industries; the Association of Trust Companies; the Chamber of Mines and the Shareholders&#x2019; Association of South Africa; and, in an official capacity, the Chief Master, the Registrar of Financial Institutions, the Attorney-General or a person from the office of the Attorney-General appointed by the Secretary for Justice, and finally, an officer of the Commercial Branch nominated by the Commissioner of Police. In general outlines a committee of this nature ought to meet the requirements we advocate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sunnyside asked whether consideration should be given to the possibility of the Standing Committee on Income Tax having representation on this committee. At present I am not convinced that there is any connection between the two, or that this would necessarily serve a useful purpose. However, I do not want to commit myself to the constitution I have just suggested. We shall consider it at a later stage, before it is finally instituted.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked why we remain so committed to the minimum of seven members for a public company. I then told him it was because the figure seven is so frequently used in the Bible. Perhaps there is another good reason as well. The old purified National Party began with a membership of seven, and subsequently achieved very great success. It is, after all, traditional, and whether it is six, seven or eight does not really make any difference. We shall probably adhere to the seven.</p>

<p>The hon. member discussed the combination of professions. At the moment it is being provided that if there is a partnership of more than 20 persons, they have to be converted into a company except in regard to a composition of professions. The entire matter is still under consideration at present. The hon. member for Jeppes also referred to this matter. I do not think it is necessary for us to discuss this any further at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to clause 38, i.e. the clause which prohibits the lending of money to persons by a company to purchase shares in the same company. The clause provides further, in subsection (1), that this is the case except where the lending of money is the main business of the company. The hon. member felt that we should perhaps say &#x201C;except where the lending of money, <i>inter alia</i>&#x201D;, is the business of the company. I am afraid that if we were to do this, we would emasculate this clause to such an extent that very little of it would remain. I just want to read out to the hon. <span class="col_6511-6512" refersTo="page_0323"/>member, for the purposes of our discussion, what the commission said in regard to this matter. It appears in the supplementary report on page 31. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the view of the commission that the exception in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 86<i>bis</i> &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here the old Act is being referred to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is capable of too wide an interpretation, as it may be argued that almost all companies can lend money in the ordinary course of their businesses. The commission believes that the exception should be limited to a company whose main business is the lending of money.</block>

<p>One can spend a long time debating this matter. Here it has been stated very briefly and concisely. Personally I think, however, that I have to agree with the standpoint of the commission. If this is not done, one is going to deprive the clause of all its value.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to clause 39 and then asked what the position would be in the case of take-over. Clause 39 provides that a subsidiary may not have shares in the holding or in the controlling company. He objected and said that provision ought to be made for a period which has to elapse before this takes place. I then gave some thought to this matter and asked myself a question. Since the Bill now provides that the subsidiary may not possess such shares, what is going to happen if a take-over occurs such as the one referred to here&#x003F; It goes without saying that the take-over cannot occur immediately, and I think it would be fair to conclude&#x2014;I have no doubt that the court will arrive at the same conclusion&#x2014;that the subsidiary will get rid of those shares in the holding company within a reasonable time. But I think this is one of the matters to which the standing advisory committee could give consideration in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to a defensive name, and asked what it really was. As I see it, it is a name for a company which one wants to reserve for oneself. Clause 43(2) on page 32, provides that such a name may be registered in the office of the Registrar of Companies on payment of an annual registration fee. Then the name remains reserved in this way, as it were, as the name of a company which one need not register, at a later stage.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 76 the hon. member said that insurance companies should also be exempted from the provision which reads that the premium account should be added to the share account for the purpose of determining the capital account. I think this is something which could be considered. At the moment I cannot really think of any good reason why this should not be the case. It is something we could discuss, and which the standing committee as well could probably investigate.</p>

<p>The hon. member then referred to an &#x201C;offer for sale&#x201D;. He asked &#x201C;What constitutes an offer of sale&#x003F;&#x201D;. To my mind an offer of sale is such a simple expression that I doubt whether it is really necessary to give a definition of it. It simply means that one offers a person something at a certain price. That is more or less the meaning in this clause. But what I do want to tell the hon. member is that basically it is precisely the same as the provision in the existing section 80<i>bis.</i> In other words, there is not really any change. It appears that in the past, apart from the other provisions which do in fact give an indication of what it is, it was there all the time. As far as I know no problems have really cropped up in this regard. Nevertheless, it is also something which we could discuss at a later stage.</p>

<p>I come now to clause 186. As regards the notice of meetings, the hon. member thought that the period of 21 days, for which the legislation makes provision, should be extended. This is a debatable point. But I want to point out to the hon. member again that the period has always been 21 days and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs will agree with me that our postal service has improved during the past few years, has it not&#x003F; Consequently, if we could get along with a period of 21 days in the past, it will probably be an adequate period now as well. It is an argument to say that these people may perhaps go on holiday for a month, and that one should perhaps make it a longer period. I am quite open to conviction on that score, but that has been the provision up to now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point referred here a moment ago to &#x201C;recklessly&#x201D; in clause 424, to which I also wanted to refer. I would say &#x201C;recklessly&#x201D; is far stronger than &#x201C;negligently&#x201D;; not only must there be an element of deliberate carelessness, but something more than carelessness. I think that we could discuss during the Committee Stage whether we should not moderate this word a little, but in any case <span class="col_6513-6514" refersTo="page_0324"/>I think that we should let it stand over for the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member also referred to Schedule IV. He asked to which companies Schedule IV would be applicable. Schedule IV is, together with the rest of the legislation, being put into effect on 1st January, 1974. I consequently think that it is correct to argue that Schedule IV will be applicable to all companies whose financial year ends after 1st January, 1974. But the hon. member should note that provision is also being made in clause 17(1) for the amendment of Schedule IV by proclamation, and in that case of course there are other factors which come into play, but for the purposes of this measure as it is going to be promulgated and put into effect, I should say that Schedule IV will be applicable to all companies whose financial year ends after 1st January, 1974.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Vryburg discussed the standing advisory committee in particular. I have already replied in full to this. The hon. member for Jeppes also referred to the standing advisory committee. It is an innovation in this legislation which, as it seems to me, is accepted by everyone. The hon. member for Jeppes referred in addition to directors&#x2019; position of trust in regard to members of the company. Sir, our common law already provides that directors are placed in a position of trust and that they should not conceal the information they have at their disposal, but should make it available to interested parties in the company, but in clause 229 and the clauses following we have now tried to lay down specific provisions, and I do not think that we have any problems in that connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the penalties for which provision is being made in clause 178, and said that the penalties were exceptionally heavy. Perhaps I could quote to him what the commission said in regard to the question of penalties, for here one finds the motivation for the provisions of this clause. The commission states, on page 13 of the main report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have previously referred to the general complaint about the lack of enforcement of the provisions of the Act. It has been indicated that wherever possible and justified we are recommending the introduction of substantial automatic penalties. As has been pointed out there will still remain a large number of contraventions of lesser importance in respect of which enforcement will remain unsatisfactory (unless they are coupled with more serious offences in any prosecution) but we believe, in the light of our overall recommendations, that the significance of these minor offences will be somewhat reduced. Following this line of reasoning we are recommending a sharp increase of the additional fees or penalties payable under section 219 <i>bis</i> in respect of the late lodging of returns and notices. We believe that the penalties imposed by this section are no longer realistic, as is illustrated by the following example: If the prescribed fee is say R1 (most of the prescribed fees do not exceed R1) a delay of more than one year will involve a penalty of only R3.</block>

<p>Sir, this is quite unrealistic and ridiculous, and the commission has now proposed heavy penalties. I admit that these are heavy penalties, but I also think that to make certain that these statutory provisions are complied with, as we should like them to be, we should simply reconcile ourselves to the heavy penalties which are being recommended here. The hon. member said that the liability of members should remain limited. But on that score I do not think we understand one another very clearly, or perhaps the hon. member is under a different impression which I do not understand. On that score it is no longer liability of members because we are now providing in this legislation that partially paid-up shares may no longer be issued. A shareholder is liable only for the fully paid-up shares he purchases. In the past it was possible to make a partial payment only, and for that reason it was necessary to provide that he would liable, and that his liability would be limited to the purchase price of his shares, in other words that he should pay only the balance of the purchase price of the shares. Those circumstances can no longer occur, and consequently it would seem to me that it is no longer necessary to make provision in the articles that the liability of members shall be limited. The hon. member also referred to professional partnerships, and so on.</p>

<p>I have furnished the hon. member for Sunnyside with a partial reply in regard to the Standing Committee on Income Tax, which he felt should have representation on this standing advisory committee. The hon. member also referred to the question of copies of documents for lodgment upon the registration of a company. It is now being <span class="col_6515-6516" refersTo="page_0325"/>provided that they should be certified by a notary (public). The hon. member feels that this should not be the case. Sir, this is actually a centuries old system of authentication, i.e. by a notary (public). To tell the truth it is the highest and most valuable form of authentication. It has always been done in this way in the past in the case of a properly certified copy, so that there can be no doubt. It is a most responsible person who does authentication, and consequently I think we should continue with this practice. If there are any snags we should try to eliminate them in another place.</p>

<p>The hon. member also discussed the position when an auditor retires as auditor of a company, and resigns. In clause 280 provision is being made for him to deliver an affidavit stating that he is not aware of any irregularity in the affairs of the company. I went into this matter, and considered it. We attach tremendous value to the auditors of a company. It is of great value and importance that when an auditor withdraws from the activities of a company, there should be a certificate on which we may place great reliance. Over and above all the other considerations which I know are applicable to an auditor, an affidavit implies that one may be charged with perjury if one deliberately makes a false affidavit. Therefore, it appears on the surface to me to be a desirable provision, but we can reconsider this a little further, and perhaps discuss it further during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo touched on a problem here. He said that companies which are sometimes controlled or owned by non-Whites, make use of certain facilities to which they are not entitled. That is a problem which we have. What is in fact being done now in this legislation is that although we could not previously require the banks, where they had nominated companies, to disclose the actual holders of the shares, this can be done now. A bank may now be required&#x2014;this was not previously the case&#x2014;to acquire the information in regard to the shareholders in a nominated company. Consequently I do not think there is any problem, owing to the definition in this Bill, in establishing who the shareholders of a company are. But we have other problems, particularly in regard to land tenure, as raised by the hon. member for Ermelo. I think it is more a matter for the Department of Community Development to find means of solving these problems. But I must in all sincerity say that I still see certain deficiencies, particularly in so far as this may be applicable to external companies. In any case we cannot investigate the shareholding of an external company, as the Act stands at present. I think this is something which we will still have to investigate carefully and for which we will also perhaps have to call upon the services of this standing advisory committee.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also referred to the standing advisory committee, in regard to which I have already replied. The hon. member asked whether they have to help with legislation. Sir, I think this is pre-eminently what we have to achieve with the functions of this standing advisory committee, i.e. that this committee should say to us: Look, there are deficiencies in the Bill; this loophole should be eliminated and those restrictions should be relaxed a little and other matters should be made a little easier. On the basis of their recommendations we will then probably introduce amending legislation in this House. The hon. member also referred to subclause (5). I expect that the standing advisory committee may appoint a subcommittee under subclause 5 to investigate a specially specified section of the matters affecting the Companies Act, and then to return to this standing advisory committee.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should imagine so. If the committee wants to make use of outside experts, I would expect them to be able to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member discussed the objects of a company. He referred to clauses 32 and 33. My time is very limited and I cannot go into this in detail, but it ought to be mentioned that clause 32 provides that the object of a company shall be lawful. The objects of a company are then dealt with further in clause 33. I cannot deal with the matter raised by the hon. member better than to refer to page 30 of the main report (R.P. 45&#x2014;1970) where this matter is dealt with very carefully&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The main object will determine the capacity of the company. Logically the main object will identify the general type of economic enterprise which the company is to engage in and the specific purpose of the incorporators may either <span class="col_6517-6518" refersTo="page_0326"/>coincide with the general type of business or it may constitute a specific business being a part or falling within that general type of economic enterprise. (E.g. the purpose may be to carry on business as an investment and financing company; the main object would be stated in similar terms. The purpose may be to manufacture roofing tiles; the main object would be to engage in the ceramics industry in all its aspects. The purpose may be to grow maize; the main object would be to engage in agriculture in all its aspects; or it may be to conduct a general dealer&#x2019;s business where the main object could be phrased as follows&#x2014;to carry on the business of a general dealer and to engage in retail trade in any way.)</block>

<p>A requirement to the effect that the main object of the company should be stated will not preclude the statement of a number of general types of economic enterprise. The intention is not to restrict the right of incorporators to set up a company with very wide and extensive capacity. But it must be said that the ideal position &#x2026;</p>

<p>I regard this as being important, and I repeat&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the ideal position would be to have a main object stating the one general type of business directly related to the business actually to be carried on by the company (coupled with unrestricted ancillary object and plenary powers) because then the directors would have to consult shareholders before changing to a completely new type of business.</block>

<p>In other words, the idea here is that there is no limitation on the powers of a company as far as third parties are concerned. Therefore we have now disposed of that matter. A company mentions its main object in its memorandum of association, and everything which it may perhaps still engage in, but there is a special relationship between shareholders, directors and the company. That special relationship continues to exist throughout. If the company consequently wishes to decide at a certain stage that over and above all those things for which provision is being made in its memorandum of association, it wants to engage in something entirely different, it must consult its shareholders in this regard. I know there is an idea that something like this should be eliminated, and that the certificate should be left completely open, as the hon. member put it here, but I still think that for the present it would quite probably be the best to allow that relationship between shareholders, directors and the company in respect of the objects to continue.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised other matters of importance. <i>Inter alia,</i> he referred to clause 335 in regard to the provision that the State President shall be satisfied for the purpose of the registration of an external company. The hon. member also mentioned the matter of loans to directors, which is a very interesting subject. I should like to go into this again before this matter is debated further during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I think that certain of the minor, specific points could be dealt with effectively during the Committee Stage, and I do not think that for the purpose of this discussion it is necessary to go into them any further.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The adjustments to the Post Office Act for which this measure makes provision, cover a variety of subjects. Some amendments are required for introducing new arrangements for which there is a need in practice, whilst others are mainly required for domestic and administrative reasons. I shall deal with the various subjects in the sequence of the clauses of the Bill.</p>

<p>Clauses 1 and 2 relate to the manner in which alterations in rates on foreign postal articles, telegrams, etc., are to be approved. These adjustments are of a purely administrative nature. We regularly and comparatively frequently have to alter our foreign rates, and this does not result from alterations in the rates of the South African Post Office, but purely from alterations in the fees charged by foreign postal administrations. The rate which we are levying hereon, <span class="col_6519-6520" refersTo="page_0327"/>for instance, a letter destined for a foreign country, is made up of a part charged by the South African Post Office for handling the letter, plus a part charged for their work by those foreign postal administrations which must also handle that letter. The part which accrues to the foreign postal administrations and which we charge as part of the postage when the letter is posted here, is paid over to those foreign postal administrations. The South African Post Office is bound by international conventions and agreements to adjust the foreign rates charged by it whenever alterations in the rates of foreign administrations give rise to their share of the fees collected by us being altered. Since such alterations are, practically speaking, beyond our control, clause 2 seeks to authorize the Postmaster-General, in the interests of administrative efficiency, to make those alterations whenever they are required, without having to obtain the formal approval of the State President, or the Minister in every case.</p>

<p>The subject of clause 3 is the issuing of postage stamps, the imposition of fines in respect of insufficiently prepaid postal articles, the methods by which the prepayment of postage on postal articles may be indicated and the transmission, without payment, of reading-matter for the blind. An important object of clause 3 is to leave the existing position in regard to the postage stamps of South-West Africa undisturbed when the Post Office Ordinance of South-West Africa is repealed, as proposed in clause 19. It will therefore, when the Post Office Act of the Republic replaces the existing Post Office Ordinance in South-West Africa, remain a statutory requirement that special postage stamps be issued for use in the Territory. After the proposed statutory amendment the postage stamps of the Republic will also remain invalid in South-West Africa, and <i>vice versa.</i></p>

<p>The statutory adjustments envisaged by clause 3 in regard to the payment of postage on postal articles are mainly of a domestic nature. They seek to legalize specifically existing arrangements concerning: (a) the collection, by way of the so-called integrity system, of fines on postal articles on which the postage has not been prepaid. In terms of this system the Post Office may deliver such a postal article at once, along with a card on which the addressee may then affix the fine in postage stamps and post it back to the Post Office. This amendment also arranges for the rate of fines, as is done in the case of other postal rates, to be prescribed by regulation; (b) the use of postage franking machines and approved printed wording on postal articles in order to indicate that postage on them has been prepaid; and (c) the established use of accepting reading-matter for the blind for transmission by post without payment of postage.</p>

<p>The next subject is the amendment of the existing arrangements in regard to the registration of newspapers with the Post Office for transmission at the special rate for publishers. Clauses 4 and 5 deal with this matter. The existing section 16 of the Act furnishes the definition of a newspaper which may be registered with the Post Office, and of a permissible supplement to it. As I said during my Budget Speech in the House in March, the reason for the existence of a preferential rate for publishers&#x2019; newspapers is the social value of newspapers and periodicals. The rate is only &#x00BD;c per copy for a mass up to 250 grammes, and lc per copy up to 500 grammes. For ordinary printed matter the rate for a mass of 250 grammes is 5c, and for one of 500 grammes, 6c. On ordinary printed matter of which the mass is up to 50 grammes, the printed-matter rate is 3c. A practice which has become increasingly prevalent in the course of time, is that of transmitting purely advertising matter at the extremely low rate for publishers&#x2019; newspapers by having it accepted as supplements to newspapers and periodicals, or by having publications which in fact consist of nothing but advertising matter registered as newspapers. It has become necessary to limit this practice.</p>

<p>On purely advertising matter which does not in actual fact form part of a <i>bona fide</i> newspaper, it ought to be possible to charge the higher rate which is applicable to ordinary printed matter.</p>

<p>The existing definition of a newspaper and a supplement in the Act makes it difficult to combat practices which in fact amount to an abuse of the low publisher&#x2019;s rate. Furthermore, as the definition has been incorporated in the Act, it cannot be readily adjusted so as to keep pace with the developments in the newspaper and printing trade.</p>

<p>The only object of the registration of a newspaper with the Post Office in terms of the Post Office Act, is to have it recognized for transmission at the special low <span class="col_6521-6522" refersTo="page_0328"/>rate for publishers&#x2019; newspapers. However, this rate may be prescribed by regulation, which does to a large extent remove the sense of the definition of a newspaper having to be incorporated in the Act. In order to place the whole matter on a workable basis, clauses 4 and 5 seek to remove the definition of a newspaper which may be registered, and of a supplement thereto, and to provide that such newspapers and supplements may be defined by regulation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now come to the subject of undeliverable mail and its treatment, with which clauses 7, 8 and 9 are concerned.</p>

<p>The Act at present requires that all undeliverable mail, including valueless open articles, should be sent to the Returned Letter Office in Cape Town for destruction or return to the senders. Considerable amounts of fruitless work and transport are involved in dealing in this manner with the millions of items of open mail annually that cannot be delivered and are obviously of little or no value or importance. The amendment proposed in clause 7 is intended to permit of such items being disposed of at the larger post offices.</p>

<p>No change is proposed to the existing requirement that all undeliverable letters should be sent to the Returned Letter Office for treatment. In view, however, of the large amount of labour involved in returning to the senders undeliverable letters opened in the Returned Letter Office, it is proposed that the Post Office should be empowered, except in cases where the letters appear to be valuable or important, to have them destroyed. Clause 8 contains this enabling provision.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment to the Act prescribes that the disposal in this manner of letters of little value or importance, should be governed by regulations that must stipulate a minimum period for which such letters should be kept and the requirements to be met in disposing of them.</p>

<p>Section 32 of the Act, the repeal of which is proposed in clause 9 of the Bill, is a provision enabling the Post Office to destroy or otherwise dispose of postal articles, other than letters or parcels, that are undelivered and appear to be of little value or importance. The section refers to <i>undelivered</i> articles, as distinct from <i>undeliverable</i> ones, and has given rise to problems of interpretation. It is rendered superfluous by the proposed amended section 25 dealt with in clause 7.</p>

<p>The Post Office sayings Bank is the subject of the next four clauses, Nos. 10 to 13. The department is at present busy with preparations for computerizing the Post Office sayings Bank. It is expected that the changeover to the computerized system will commence during the course of the next two months, but it will probably take more than 18 months to transfer all existing accounts to the new system.</p>

<p>It is proposed, mainly upon completion of the computerization of the bank, to introduce various changes aimed at making the facilities of the bank more attractive to the public. The proposed changes are in accordance with recommendations by an interdepartmental committee on State investment media that were accepted last year by the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Clauses 10 to 13 deal with those aspects of the proposed changes that require amendments to the Act. They are&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the payment of interest on ordinary deposits in the sayings Bank on daily balances instead of on a monthly basis, and the calculation of such interest on a minimum amount of R1 or a multiple of R1 instead of a minimum of R2 or a multiple of R2 as at present;</li>

<li>(b) the issuing of a single sayings Bank certificate, in any multiple of R100 and up to the existing legal maximum of R20 000, to cover the amount which an investor wishes to invest in sayings Bank certificates at any one time. At present separate certificates of R200 each must always be issued. I may mention here that sayings Bank certificates are fixed deposits in the Post Office sayings Bank and bear a higher rate of interest than ordinary deposits in the bank;</li>

<li>(c) the direct repayment by cheque on demand of sayings Bank certificates that are six months old or older, instead of repayment through the medium of the ordinary sayings Bank account of the depositor;</li>

<li>(d) the fixing of a minimum investment period of six months for sayings Bank certificates. To certificates repaid <span class="col_6523-6524" refersTo="page_0329"/>sooner, the interest rate for ordinary deposits in the sayings Bank will be applied;</li>

<li>(e) the calculation of interest on a sayings Bank certificate on daily balance instead of on a monthly basis, and from the date of investment instead of the first day of the following month as is done at present if a certificate is issued after the second day of a month; and</li>

<li>(f) the payment of interest on sayings Bank certificates at six-monthly intervals reckoned from the dates of issue of the individual certificates, instead of on the fixed dates 1st January and 1st July which apply at present.</li>

</ol>

<p>One of the proposed changes, namely the calculation of interest on ordinary sayings Bank deposits on a minimum amount of R1 or a multiple of R1 instead of R2 or a multiple of R2, is to apply retrospectively from 1st April this year. Clause 10(2) makes provision for this.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, clause 14 deals with the provision of telephone conduit-pipes in large buildings, and on private premises in areas where both telephone services and electricity supply are provided by way of underground cable. As far as conduit-pipes in buildings are concerned, it has for many years been standing practice at large places for the builders of large buildings to install in the buildings concerned the necessary pipes for telephone services during construction. This does not involve dwelling-houses, but buildings such as blocks of offices and flats. The Post Office is notified through the local authorities of the proposed construction of such buildings, and indicates on the plans for such buildings details of the conduit-pipes required for telephone services. Some builders of large buildings do not meet the requirements of the Post Office in every respect, which often results, subsequently, in problems being experienced in connection with the provision of telephone services and in such buildings being damaged and spoilt. The proposed new section 80A of the Act, which is being inserted by clause 14, seeks to give statutory recognition to the existing arrangements. It will also enable the Post Office, where necessary, to refuse to provide telephone services in such buildings until such time as the requirements have been met, or to recover the extra cost involved in providing telephone services where the requirements have not been met.</p>

<p>In the proposed new section 80B of the Act, which is also dealt with by clause 14, local authorities are authorized to install in townships where electricity for houses and other buildings is provided by way of underground cables, telephone conduit-pipes in the same excavations, i.e. along with the electricity supply lines on private premises. Such townships would then have no unsightly and less effective overhead wires, and both conduit-pipes would then, in an economic manner, be laid in one ditch. It is being proposed that the owners of the properties should bear the cost of the telephone conduit-pipes from the street boundary to the house or other building as part of the cost of the electricity supply lines. This arrangement is considered to be fair because the owners are getting the benefit of a more reliable telephone service, and also of the lack of overhead wires across their property and in their neighbourhood. This way of installing telephone conduit-pipes also enhances the value of the house or other buildings. These proposals are being supported by the United Municipal Executive and the Association of Municipal Electrical Undertakings.</p>

<p>Clause 15 deals with the cost of the deviation of a telegraph line passing over private property when this is done at the request of the occupier of that property. As the Act reads at present, the Post Office may only bear such costs when the deviation is necessary because the line interferes with any building about to be erected on that property. It often happens that an occupier requests a deviation for another reason which justifies accommodation being shown in regard to the cost of the deviation, such as making it possible for him to use the property more effectively. This amendment seeks to authorize the Postmaster-General to approve in such cases of the Post Office bearing the whole or any part of the cost of effecting that deviation.</p>

<p>In clause 16 an amendment to the Act is proposed with a view to combating malpractices in regard to private telephone and telex directories. Such private directories are usually directories for business purposes which are published for profit from the sale of listings and advertisements appearing in it. The activities of some publishers of these directories have been causing problems for <span class="col_6525-6526" refersTo="page_0330"/>years, because their business methods are not always honourable and often mislead the public. In spite of repeated radio and Press statements and articles in the <i>Post Office Bulletin</i> in which the department dissociates itself from these private directories, some publishers are still succeeding in giving telephone subscribers the impression that their directories are official, and complaints are continually being received from telephone subscribers who have been misled into buying listings in these directories.</p>

<p>As a rule the publishers of private directories make use of the expressions &#x201C;Telephone Directory&#x201D;, &#x201C;Telex Directory&#x201D;, &#x201C;Yellow Page Directory&#x201D; or &#x201C;Yellow Pages&#x201D; in order to create the impression that their publications have been sanctioned officially. In the proposed statutory amendment it is therefore being made an offence to make in this manner unauthorized use of such an expression in connection with a publication.</p>

<p>The amendment proposed in section 17 seeks, firstly, to authorize the Post Office to deal sympathetically with persons who accidentally and without being negligent damage telegraph lines, cables or apparatus, i.e. as far as the recovery from them of the cost of repairs is concerned.</p>

<p>As the Act reads at present, any person who causes such damage has to pay for it in full, irrespective of whether he was negligent. Many cases are found where it would be fair to show accommodation.</p>

<p>Secondly, the amendment seeks to exempt divisional councils specifically, in cases where their employees have not been negligent, from the obligation of paying for damage to telegraph lines arising from their road works.</p>

<p>This arrangement is necessary in order to place divisional councils in the same position in this regard as are the provincial administrations. Roadworks, which are the responsibility of divisional councils in the Cape Province, are mainly works which in other provinces would have been the responsibility of the provincial administrations.</p>

<p>I referred earlier on to the application in South-West Africa of the Post Office Act of the Republic and the repeal of the Post Office Ordinance of the Territory, which are envisaged by clauses 18 and 19.</p>

<p>The Post Office Ordinance of South-West Africa is identical in every important respect with the Post Office Act of the Republic. In terms of the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969, the Post Office Ordinance of the Territory has been administered by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs since 1st April, 1969. It is desirable for it to be repealed now and to be substituted by the Post Office Act.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate further at this stage on the details of the Bill. I trust that it will receive the support of both sides of this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we recognize that it is necessary for the basic Acts of certain departments to be amended from time to time. The Post Office Act is one of the basic Acts of the Department of Posts, and it becomes necessary from time to time to introduce amendments, and so we recognize the necessity for a Bill such as this. Sir, as you know, a Bill sometimes contains good provisions; it sometimes contains provisions that are not so controversial, and it sometimes contains provisions that are highly controversial. This Bill is no exception to this rule. However, since it is a Bill which can more profitably be discussed in the Committee Stage, we shall elaborate on the particular clauses at that stage. Perhaps I should just make a few remarks on what the hon. the Minister has told us up to now. Firstly, among the clauses we regard as uncontroversial, there are, <i>inter alia,</i> the following:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2020;The first one is in clause 2, which provides that the international fees and the tariffs can now be changed by the Postmaster-General on account of the international difficulties and the international agreements which necessitate such a change in the principal Act. I think that the proposal in clause 3 in regard to the use of franking machines will introduce an improvement in the system of using these machines. There have been complaints in the past, particularly about not being able to pre-pay the postage in many cases where material is sent through bulk postage, through franking machines.</block>

<p>Sir, in connection with the changes proposed in clauses 10 and 13 in regard to the Post Office sayings bank, I believe that they are also unexceptionable. As a matter of fact, the proposal that deposits in the sayings bank should carry interest from the date on which the money is placed in the sayings bank until the date on which the money is withdrawn, is actually something <span class="col_6527-6528" refersTo="page_0331"/>for which we on this side of the House have been pleading for a long time. In particular my colleague, the hon. member for Parktown, has pointed to the necessity for doing this instead of having the money lying without interest until the end of the month in the sayings bank and only then earnings interest. But I am rather sorry that it had to take computerizing of the sayings bank before this very necessary and obvious change was introduced. I am always dubious when I hear the word &#x201C;computerizing&#x201D; mentioned by the hon. the Minister in this regard because we have seen what computers have done to certain other departments and we know what they have done to banks in this country, and I only hope that when computers are introduced and applied to the sayings bank we will find that the computers will at least be able to compete with the human beings who have been doing pretty well up to now in their place. I am not one of the George Orwell people, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>*As far as clause 14 is concerned, it is not a very important clause and we agree that the Post Office must be able to request the installation of special pipes, etc., in new buildings. There is just one small question. The hon. the Minister referred to pipes for telephone lines or telephone services all the time, while this Bill refers to &#x201C;telecommunication services&#x201D; and then defines &#x201C;telecommunication services&#x201D; as &#x201C;telegraph services&#x201D;. Is it correct terminology, then, to refer to telephone services if one actually means telegraph services&#x003F; This is not very clear to me, for I see that according to the definition in the Bill they refer to &#x201C;telegraph services&#x201D; in these pipes, while the hon. the Minister mentioned that they were meant for telephone services.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 15, too, are acceptable, i.e. that the Post Office may decide to bear the cost when a telegraph line, etc., has to be altered as a result of problems experienced by private people.</p>

<p>Clause 16 deals with the prohibition on the unauthorized use of words such as &#x201C;post office&#x201D; and other terms.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I suppose there have been quite a number of cases where people have tried to imitate the Post Office and issue their own directories or lists of telephone numbers and addresses and gained quite a large amount of advertising in the process, advertising which to a certain extent should have accrued to the yellow pages of our ordinary telephone directory. But I am accepting the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in this regard.</p>

<p>*I should say the best clause in this Bill is the one which provides that reading matter intended for the blind may in future be transmitted by the Post Office without payment of postage. The hon. the Minister will probably remember that when we were discussing tariffs during the Budget debate this year, I pointed out that in Rhodesia it had been the practice for years to transmit reading matter for the blind by post free of charge. I hope that remark of mine may have contributed to the earlier introduction of this very good arrangement.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister probably sees, there is not much that is contentious in this Bill. We regard it as being essentially a Bill for the Committee Stage and we shall support its Second Reading.</p>

<p>However, there is one clause that worries me a little, or rather two clauses, and they are clauses 4 and 5.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This can be a controversial matter. It deals with the alteration of the method of registering a newspaper at the G.P.O., or by the Postmaster-General as it is known nowadays. This was a right, and a very valued right, of newspapers, monthlies, weeklies, etc., and newspapers were protected by the definition in the original Act itself, which laid down what a newspaper could be. It set out very clearly that a newspaper was any publication consisting wholly or in great part of political or other news or articles relating thereto, or to other current topics, with or without advertisements and with or without engravings, etc. There was a clear definition of what a newspaper was and if it complied with the Act, then that newspaper had the right to be registered and to make use of this special tariff, the low tariffs of postage of half a cent for 250 grammes, instead of five cents for the same weight. Now, this was a great concession to newspapers and they rightly regarded it as one of their very important and basic rights <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Post Office. Now, however, the hon. the Minister is coming with the proposal to do away with this definition and that he be given the power to make regulations on his own, defining what a newspaper is. In other words, instead of enjoying the protection of this Act in the future, it could very well be that newspapers and periodicals will not <span class="col_6529-6530" refersTo="page_0332"/>have that protection, because the hon. the Minister will now be able to make regulations arbitrarily and to decide what a newspaper is and what type of publication will have the protection of the Post Office Act. Let me mention a possibility which may arise. Take the periodical <i>Scope</i> for instance. This periodical fell foul of the Publications Board on several occasions. Afterwards <i>Scope</i> went to the court and its publications were declared legal and they could be distributed. Theoretically the hon. the Minister could, under the regulations which he can promulgate, come with a provision saying that any publication which has on three occasions during the previous year or so been declared to be an undesirable publication shall for a period of twelve months or two years forfeit the right of having this cheap postage by being registered as a newspaper, because the hon. the Minister will in such a case refuse to register that publication as a newspaper. This may sound like seeing bogeys where there are none.</p>

<p>*It may sound like chasing up hares, but these are things that could be done, and I should like to have an assurance from the hon. the Minister about what could happen, and even then I still think that it is not right for us to give these great powers in this connection, in terms of which it will be possible to lay down by regulation when a newspaper is not a newspaper. If it is found that a newspaper is not a newspaper, such a paper will not benefit by the special tariffs.</p>

<p>As I have said, it is a matter we can discuss more profitably in the Committee Stage. We approve of the Second Reading, but we have fairly strong reservations in regard to that clause in particular, while there are a few other matters, too, that we shall raise in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Orange Grove said that his side of the House has no objection to the Second Reading of this Bill, although he did have certain doubts which he did not explain further, but reserved for further debate and argument during the Committee Stage. It was very pleasant for us to learn that the hon. member for Orange Grove did not want to oppose the principle of this measure as a whole. It is the Opposition&#x2019;s custom to make a big fuss about any small matter, but I think the reason why the hon. member for Orange Grove did not see his way clear to adopting that custom, lies in the fact that this Bill, seen from an administrative point of view, is of great value for the efficient working of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It was very clear from the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister that there are hitches here and there which are a bit bothersome when certain matters must be carried out.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly welcome this legislation because it gives us a clear description of certain arrangements that are being made with respect to our internal service and in respect of the international service dealing with the fixing of rates for the transmission of postal articles. It is being stated quite clearly here that the Postmaster-General may collect the amounts. He can fix rates in relation to those rates obtaining in the countries to which the postal articles are being sent. I am mentioning this merely to point out that these fees and these rates are subject, in each instance, to the approval of the State President on the recommendation of the hon. the Minister. On the other hand, the legislation makes it quite clear that an appeal can be made to the Minister, so that he has the final say as to whether the actions of the Postmaster-General are to be invalidated or approved. The rates collected in this way must also be published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> I think hon. members will see that the whole spirit of this Bill is one of acting very fairly and correctly and that the levies being imposed on these postal articles will at all times be open to Parliament&#x2019;s inspection.</p>

<p>Just in passing, the hon. member for Orange Grove referred to a very praiseworthy provision in this legislation. He referred to the free delivery and transmission of reading matter, etc., to the blind. I just want to add that I welcome this; I think the whole House welcomes it. Yet it is not clear to me whether these postal articles must, in fact, be in braille. If possible only postal articles in braille must qualify for free transmission. If postal articles in ordinary writing, such as letters, etc., are to be delivered, it would be difficult for the Postmaster-General to determine whether this would really be solely for the benefit and convenience of the blind. Since I support this measure so strongly, I want to make it absolutely water-tight so that it cannot or will not be abused. This can be done by making it solely applicable to articles printed in braille.</p>

<p><span class="col_6531-6532" refersTo="page_0333"/>The hon. member referred to the deletion of section 16 of Act 44 of 1958&#x2014;we can call it the principal Act. In section 16 of that Act there is a comprehensive description of &#x201C;newspaper&#x201D;. The Postmaster-General will, it is true, now have the right to determine in future what postal articles are too indecent or improper for delivery. If one were to read section 16 of the principal Act, one would see that whatever is incorporated in the new legislation will make no difference at all to the description of the principal Act. I just want to quote one short paragraph from this Act. I am referring to section 16(2), which refers to publications&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any publication consisting wholly or in great part of matter similar to that of a newspaper or of advertisements printed on a sheet or sheets or a piece or pieces of paper or consisting wholly or in part of engravings, prints or lithographs or any other sort of picture illustrative of articles in the newspaper or in such publication, shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a supplement to a newspaper&#x2026;</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I have just quoted section 16 of the principal Act which is now being deleted by clause 4. It is true that in this Bill there is no description of what a newspaper is. Those of us who have all the newspapers open to our inspection today, and who can form a judgment in that connection, will see that no description in the new legislation can in the least influence the position, because in terms of the description in the section I have just quoted, there was sufficient opportunity for the inclusion of photographs, other publications such as advertisements, etc., without it having been possible for the Postmaster-General or the relevant Minister to have had them for inspection. It is a good thing that the Postmaster-General is now being given those powers to judge whether a publication is indecent and improper, whether it be <i>Scope,</i> as the hon. member said, one of the present dailies, or whatever the case may be. I have only one problem as far as that is concerned. For the present I have no problems, because I know what the attitudes to life are of members on this side, of the Minister and of the Postmaster-General. My problem relates to what would happen&#x2014;and I hope it does not ever happen&#x2014;if the Postmaster-General were to belong to an ultra-liberalistic element and then had to pass judgment, in terms of the provisions of this legislation, about what is objectionable and what may not be published. I am glad that, under the present circumstances, I can trust the present Postmaster-General and the hon. the Minister fully as far as passing judgment is concerned. But I also trust that this matter can be arranged by way of regulation so that there will, to a certain extent, be guidance for the Postmaster-General with respect to the judgment that must be passed about this kind of matter. I think it would be very beneficial to sound judgment if such a guide could be placed at the disposal of the Postmaster-General. We know that these days it is not only objectionable reading matter that is transmitted by post, but that we are living in a period in which other articles, which I do not need to mention here, are also transmitted by post. I think the Postmaster-General can take action under those circumstances, because he has also obtained the powers to take immediate action when he thinks that an article is objectionable or improper. For that reason I am saying that I fully welcome this provision. I have already said that in this case we trust the sound judgment of the Postmaster-General. For that reason the old section&#x2019;s description of a newspaper is virtually superfluous under these circumstances. The Postmaster-General must use his discretion, and then there is also still the possibility of appeal to the Minister with respect to these matters.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F; Would you then, for example, not regard <i>Scope</i> as a newspaper if, say, it were to have been found to be indecent by the Publications Board a few times&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>In no way does this concern <i>Scope&#x2019;s</i> status as a publication or newspaper. It does not necessarily have to be a newspaper; it can be any publication that is transmitted by post. What is involved here is the content of the particular magazine, newspaper or whatever, that has to be transmitted. This is a matter of the content and not the publication as such. I think it would be a very good thing&#x2014;I want to mention this for what it is worth&#x2014; for an accepted norm to be made applicable according to which the Postmaster-General <span class="col_6533-6534" refersTo="page_0334"/>could form his judgment. It would be there for the purpose of guidance. I do not know whether he would need it; perhaps he may need it. I do think it would be beneficial if such a norm were laid down concerning what the cross-sectional conservative Afrikaner&#x2019;s philosophy of life is and what fits in with that. That view can be applied as a norm according to which action must be taken.</p>

<p>Another measure in this Bill which I welcome, is that relating to the delivery of postal articles which have insufficient stamps or no stamps at all. In a previous debate it was made clear here that this obligation of honesty had stood the test for a year and that at least 70% of the persons, to whom these postage-due cards were posted, reacted favourably and sent along the necessary amount with a view to releasing these postal articles. Unfortunately there are still 30% of the people who did not comply. I think that in respect of that 30%, who did not pay the fines, other methods must be found to compel them to do so.</p>

<p>Further I do not want to react to this matter. The rest of the Bill is as good as one could possibly have imagined. It is beneficial to the good administration of the Post Office. We want to express our appreciation to the Postmaster-General and his officials, and to the hon. the Minister in particular, for this legislation which he has brought before the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. House for the good reception they have given this measure. I should like to reply to a few of the questions that were asked here. I shall begin with the hon. member for Orange Grove, who raised the question of the calculation of daily interest in respect of the sayings bank, and actually blamed us for having had to wait for the computer before we could implement a good United Party plea here. Actually it is not because we have only now become convinced of that, that we have only now been able to do this; the problem was that the heaps of accounts we have had, simply made it impossible to handle this scheme without available manpower. You know, there are about 1,6 million sayings bank accounts. This is a colossal number of accounts, and it was simply beyond human capability to manage the calculation of daily interest in respect of so many accounts. Now, with the advent of the computer, we are able to do so. That is actually the reason why this could not be done previously.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me a question in connection with the description of &#x201C;telegraph services&#x201D;. He asked how this term could also include telephones. According to definition the term &#x201C;telegraph&#x201D; also includes &#x201C;telephone&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The concern which the hon. member expressed in connection with our newspapers, is actually unfounded. We are very sympathetic to our newspapers. We appreciate the value of our newspaper services. If one just thinks of the steps we took with respect to the latest postage rates, to which I referred a while ago, to meet our newspapers half way, I think that it does bear witness to our sympathy. As I said a while ago in my Second Reading speech, only one cent has to be paid in the case of a newspaper weighing up to 500 grammes&#x2014;those are normally the Sunday newspapers&#x2014;while the charges for ordinary printed matter of 500 grammes, is 6 cents. Actually the Post Office is losing a tremendous amount on the transmission of newspapers through the post, but that is one of the social services that we furnish, and this surely bears witness to our sympathetic attitude. However, if people abuse one&#x2019;s kindness, as is the case in respect of several bodies that use these newspapers as an advertising medium for all kinds of pamphlets, brochures, etc., to which the ordinary rates for printed matter are applicable, one does feel that one must be able to handle these people firmly. The best way in which this can be done, is to have these articles described by way of regulation. This proposal, i.e. to have them described by way of regulation, is therefore not aimed at the newspapers, so as to afford them less protection; the intention is simply, in this connection, to be sufficiently strict with those people who abuse one&#x2019;s kindness.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Harrismith referred to the question of the blind, to which the hon. member for Orange Grove also referred. Those hon. members asked questions in connection with braille, and in reply I want to confirm that material which is addressed in braille will have this assistance. We are aware of the fact that there are investigations being instituted in order to design a new type of writing for the blind, and if a more modern kind of writing than braille can be designed, we shall of course give the same assistance.</p>

<p><span class="col_6535-6536" refersTo="page_0335"/>The hon. member also raised the problem of what norm should be employed in determining offensiveness, and he referred to the task resting with the Postmaster-General. That is a real problem. In the days when I was Deputy Minister of the Interior and was entrusted with the task of going, all alone, into a cinema to view films subsequent to an appeal, to determine whether they were objectionable and morally subversive, I realized what a difficult task it is. There is not a specific instruction for the Department of the Interior either. I do not know whether my colleague already has such an instruction these days according to which it can be determined whether a publication is taboo or not. One must simply project the sound judgment in any average, decent South African, whether in respect of a film or in respect of reading matter, in order to be able to determine eventually whether a publication is objectionable or not. Fortunately the Post Office has always had a Postmaster-General with that sound judgment. I therefore do not think we need have any doubts about the implementation of that provision.</p>

<p>With these few words I again thank hon. members very much for the good reception this measure has been given.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As will be observed from the long title, the proposed legislation is aimed mainly at facilitating the administration of the existing Act by the Department of Police and at deleting obsolete provisions. In brief, the amendments amount to the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The definition of &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; in <i>clause</i> 1 is amended by substituting &#x201C;Minister of Police&#x201D; for &#x201C;Minister of Justice&#x201D;. I may mention here that I am not quite sure whether the Department of Police has to administer the Act. Finality will be reached in the next few days concerning the question of whether it should not be transferred to the Department of Sport and Recreation. If this happens, I shall introduce the necessary amendment in the Other Place.</block>

<p>The amendment of section 4 of the principal Act which is proposed in <i>clause</i> 2 involves a slight change in regard to the appointment of national boards. In terms of the existing provision the national boards consist of five persons, one of whom is appointed and designated as chairman by the Minister, and the other four who are appointed by the Minister from nominations received by him on invitation. If the Minister has not received the nominations invited by him within the period he stated, he may appoint any person whom he considers suitable to be a member of the board. These last four members are usually, but not necessarily, the chairmen of the four provincial boards. The proposed amendment has the effect that the Minister may now appoint two persons, one of whom he shall designate as chairman. With the appointment of the other person it is now being envisaged that the Minister may appoint a member of the South African Police to represent the department by which the Act is administered. Although it is not specifically provided that this shall be the case, this is what it will amount to in practice. The procedure in regard to the appointment of the other members of the board remains unchanged. As I have already indicated, this amendment creates the opportunity to appoint a member of the South African Police as a member of the national board. This is a shortcoming which exists in the present Act, and it is now being set right.</p>

<p>In <i>clause</i> 3 the proviso to subsection (1) of section 5 is extended by inserting a further provision, viz. (f), in terms of which the Minister is granted the power to remove from his office any member of the board if in the opinion of the Minister there exists any sufficient reason, other than those which have already been provided for, which renders such member unsuitable to remain a member of the board. The Minister already has the power to remove a member of the board from his office under certain circumstances, for example, if he is of unsound mind, if his estate is sequestrated, if he is convicted, and so on. However, other causes, too, may arise, such as when a member, although he attends the meetings regularly, shows no interest in the efficient administration of the sport concerned, or makes <span class="col_6537-6538" refersTo="page_0336"/>no contribution to the promotion of its interests. Persons who take so little interest in boxing and wrestling should therefore not serve on a board any longer, and it should be possible to remove them.</p>

<p><i>Clause 4:</i> This clause amends section 9 of the principal Act in order to remove the doubt that may exist concerning the responsibility of the Minister in regard to making regulations in terms of the Act. As the Act reads at the moment, the board may, with the approval of the Minister, make regulations. This wording is felt to be undesirable. If the amendment is accepted, the provision will read that the Minister may make regulations. Of course, this will only be done after consultation with the board, as is further provided.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 5: This amendment involves a slight change in regard to the appointment of members of provincial boxing and wrestling control boards. Briefly it amounts to the Minister being given the power to appoint as members of provincial boards suitable persons other than those nominated by the boards. Apart from the chairman of a provincial board the Minister is at present obliged to appoint every other member of the board from one of two persons nominated by the board, if nominations are received within the period allowed by the Minister. If nominations are not received within this period, the Minister may appoint anyone he considers to be suitable. So the dilemma is that where a board, for the sake of argument, nominates two unfit persons for appointment, the Minister is bound to appoint one of these two, in spite of their unfitness. The Minister has no option. The proposed legislation is aimed at eliminating this undesirable situation. This does not mean that if the amendment is accepted the Minister will arbitrarily appoint persons other than those nominated by the boards. The appointment will still be made from nominations by the boards, but the provision serves as a safety-valve for cases where the Minister is satisfied that the persons nominated are not fit to serve on the boards. The amendment will also be an incentive to the boards to nominate only absolutely competent persons and persons who have the interests of these sports at heart. Boxing and wrestling are important branches of sport and the boxers and wrestlers, as well as boxing and wrestling supporters, are entitled to have its administration handled by competent and dedicated persons at all times.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 6: A new section 21A is being inserted, in terms of which the participation of women in boxing and wrestling tournaments is expressly prohibited. The new provision speaks for itself. Mr. Speaker, the proposed prohibition on participation by women in boxing and wrestling&#x2014;this does not apply to hon. members&#x2019; wrestling and boxing matches at home&#x2014;is being introduced at the request of the National Wrestling Control Board. The latter received an application from a promotor to bring lady wrestlers from America to the Republic, to take part in wrestling tournaments here. The National Board refused the application and requested that it should also be expressly prohibited in the Act. According to the board participation by women is indecent. It is the custom to cover the floor of a wrestling ring with a smooth layer of mud. The contestants are dressed in bathing costumes. As a result of their wrestling, sliding, grabbing at each other and falling down on the smooth surface it does not take long before they are half naked, to the great amusement of the spectators, of course. This kind of thing certainly conflicts with the morals and norms of the South African people.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 7: Paragraph (i) is being inserted in section 23 to provide for a penalty provision in respect of the new section 21A and to bring the fines into line with our present monetary system.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 8: Paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 25 are hereby deleted because they have become superfluous. They really refer to South-West Africa.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 9 contains the short title.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House are going to support the Second Reading of this amending Bill. The Bill aims firstly at the tightening of boxing and wrestling control throughout South Africa. It will also put the ultimate control of boxing and wrestling into the hands of the Minister. In terms of this legislation the Minister will appoint members of two boards of control, for boxing and wrestling. When we read the Bill we are very pleased to see that the Minister will be given greater discretion in dismissing unsuitable members from the boards. The Bill also doubles the fines in respect of offences against the Act. The really important part of the Bill, of course&#x2014;and I am being quite serious&#x2014;is the prohibition of females from taking part in boxing or wrestling <span class="col_6539-6540" refersTo="page_0337"/>contests in South Africa. We know that we are living in the so-called age of &#x201C;women&#x2019;s lib&#x201D;, but I am quite sure that even the staunchest supporters of &#x201C;women&#x2019;s lib&#x201D; will agree that to allow females to take part in boxing and wrestling is taking &#x201C;women&#x2019;s lib&#x201D; a bit too far. I say this advisedly because I have seen this type of exhibition on television overseas, and I want to say it will be a sorry day indeed for South Africa if this type of exhibition is allowed to take place in our country. I am very pleased indeed to see that the legislation is being tightened up, because, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has already said, applications have in fact been made to promote this type of exhibition in South Africa.</p>

<p>When we come to the Amendment regarding boxing, I want to say that it has been my unfortunate experience to be at boxing matches where on two occasions young South Africans who have taken part have actually died as the result of the boxing matches. I want to say that in these particular cases no blame attached to any particular person, either to the promoters or to the board of control. But what I saw there brought home to me the fact that you can never have tight enough control in a sport like professional boxing. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that normally we on this side of the House would take the strongest exception to giving any Minister the power to appoint members to control a particular sport, but we accept it in this particular case because professional boxing is such a very rugged and difficult sport. In this particular case you can only have adequate control if you have boards of control and you have on those boards of control the right type of person. I want to say that I agree that in this particular case it is right that the Minister himself should have a big say in the appointment of people who serve on the national board and also on the provincial boards, and also that he should have the right at any stage to dismiss any person whom he believes has not functioned properly as a member of that board. The Bill, as we see it, can only do the sports of boxing and wrestling, which are both very good sports, good, and therefore we on this side of the House welcome this amending Bill and give it our full support.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>We all know that the hon. the Minister is as a Minister really an old hand, but nevertheless as Minister of the Interior he is in fact a new broom, and I sincerely hope that he will act as a new broom when it comes to one aspect of his department, namely the Public Service, and bring about certain changes which we believe are essential and which are in fact long overdue. In the first place, I wish to urge the hon. the Minister to allow the Public Service Commission to delegate more powers to officers in State departments. I am aware of the fact that this is something which has been happening in recent years. During recent years the Public Service Commission has been delegating some of its powers. In fact, I think in its report for 1972 it is mentioned that this procedure of delegation of powers to State departments has brought about greater functional efficiency. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to continue with this because after all the powers which have been delegated up to now are in fact very limited powers. I feel that he can increase those powers without running the risk that these departments will demand their autonomy from the Public Service Commission. The procedure of delegation of powers within the framework of the Public Service Commission is something which can work in respect of certain State departments. However, there are certain departments where this system is of no avail. Here I refer in particular to the education departments. It is quite all right as far as the administrative sections of the education departments are concerned, but when you are dealing with the professional sections of these departments, then I feel there is only one way open and that is the complete separation from the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>This is something which I raised with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor and the reply I received was that it could not be done. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor said that the major objection was that once teachers were allowed to be separated from <span class="col_6541-6542" refersTo="page_0338"/>the Public Service Commission, other professional groups would demand the same. I feel that I cannot accept this as a real objection; to me it sounds more like an excuse. I believe that it is up to every single professional group to argue its case in the light of its own particular problems. It will then be the task of the hon. the Minister or that of the Public Service Commission to decide.</p>

<p>As a professional group, teachers suffer under a particular disadvantage which one does not find in other professional groups. I refer to the fact that there are no uniform professional qualifications for teachers. A person can become a teacher after having studied for two, three or four years. A graduate or a non-graduate can become a teacher. We find in fact something like six different categories of professionally qualified teachers. I am not going to go into this matter; I am merely going to say that I accept this as a reality. I am not opposed to the fact that we have these various categories although I believe that some of them can be abolished. The fact remains, however, that we start off having different categories of professionally qualified people in the same profession.</p>

<p>This of course necessitates different salary scales. There is also another principle involved and that is the necessity for the grading of different schools. All told, you find a situation where you have some forty different salary scales on the progression table. These are grouped together within eleven promotional steps. It is inevitable that anomalies and inconsistencies result from illogical groupings. These things give rise to dissatisfaction and sometimes they force teachers to conduct public campaigns in order to seek improvement in their conditions of service. I am afraid that as long as these things are happening the professional status of teachers will be harmed. I am quite convinced that as long as they have to operate within the framework of the Public Service Commission one will continue to have illogical post structures and salary scales.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. the Minister is going to say that in 99% of the cases the Public Service Commission is in fact only acting on the recommendations of the educational heads who in turn are acting on the recommendations of various advisory committees. I believe that is true, but the recommendations which these bodies make to the Public Service Commission are, in fact, inhibited, because those recommendations have to be made within a certain framework and as a result those bodies are obliged to make illogical recommendations. They have no option. It is like the hon. the Prime Minister asking his Economic Advisory Council to make certain projections, but at the same time he instructs the council to make those projections within the framework of an economic growth rate of 5,5% or 5,75%. Obviously this is the type of thing which they have to do within a framework predetermined by the Public Service Commission where it is inevitable that one has a system of equation of posts.</p>

<p>I want to proceed to another aspect. It concerns the relationship between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Immigration. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to streamline the procedure whenever a person applies for extension of his temporary residence permit, with the view to getting greater co-operation between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Immigration. I refer here to a particular situation. I refer to a person who has a temporary permit and who has applied to the Immigration Selection Board to become a permanent resident but whose application has been rejected. Obviously he will then appeal against the rejection of his application. Before the Immigration Selection Board can consider his new application, the person must provide them with proof that he is in possession of a valid residence permit. This is where the whole trouble starts. Such a person normally goes to the local police station, fills in a form and sends off his passport. In a case which had come to my notice a person applied for an extension of his permit but was notified only two or three months after his original permit had expired that he had received an extension of his permit. In this particular case the permit expired at the end of November but the person was eventually informed in January that the Department of the Interior has agreed to extend his permit till the end of February. In other words, it was extended for a period of three months. It is only at that stage that the Immigration Selection Board can seriously consider his reapplication for a permanent residence permit. The point I want to make is that it should surely be possible for the Department of the Interior to inform the Immigration Selection Board as a matter of routine that such an application is under consideration and that they can go ahead considering this person&#x2019;s application for a <span class="col_6543-6544" refersTo="page_0339"/>permanent residence permit on its merits. I have seen cases where once the date of a temporary permit had expired the person concerned was placed in an invidious position. The last thing such a person wants to be is to be unemployed because then he has no chance with the Immigration Selection Board. But because he is not in possession of a valid permit, you find that employers are sometimes reluctant to keep such a person in their employment. The employers feel that they are in fact employing a person who should legally not be in the country. All the employee can tell him is that his temporary permit is expiring at the end of February, March, April or even May and then the employer starts to panic and eventually it has a tremendous effect on the person concerned. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to commence with I should like to convey to the hon. the Minister and the Government, on behalf of the officials in my constituency and the officials throughout the country, our appreciation for the concession which has been made in respect of the 100% housing loan scheme by increasing the limit from R15 000 to R20 000. This enables many more officials to make use of this scheme. I want to assure the hon. the Minister that this is greatly appreciated. With respect to the interest subsidy paid on such loans, the position is unfortunately such that there are a few officials who have obtained a house at some other place by way of a legacy or by some other means, or who have inherited a farm on which there is a dilapidated old house. Now in terms of the rules of the interest subsidy scheme, the interest subsidy that has been paid out to such persons is being reclaimed at 8&#x00BD;% interest. This has already caused considerable bitterness amongst a certain group of officials. I should very much like to ask the Minister whether such a matter could be handled with the utmost circumspection by departmental heads because it unnecessarily penalizes innocent people and causes them financial problems.</p>

<p>In respect of the housing loan scheme, there is a further aspect I want to mention. In and around Pretoria, just on the city boundary, in the smallholding areas&#x2014;these are not the smallholding areas which are slums, these are the lovelier and more developed areas where fine dwellings are springing up on the smallholdings, dwellings for which mortgage bond loans are available from building societies&#x2014;the interest subsidy is not being granted. It is only a wire fence that separates the city boundary from these smallholding areas, and the one official comes into consideration for the interest subsidy, but the other does not. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to grant the interest subsidy to an official, wherever he may be living, if he has a building society loan, even if it is in the smallholding area beyond the municipal boundary, because otherwise this is not fair. I also want to lodge a plea again for the lower ranks in the Public Service, those who do not have enough to buy a house and who therefore have to fall back on flats where they must keep large families. I am again lodging a plea with the Government to see whether we cannot also make a plan to grant these people, who cannot yet buy a house, a rent subsidy, or whatever the case may be, so that the burden is not as disproportionately distributed as it is at present.</p>

<p>With the turbulence on our country&#x2019;s borders, another problem crops up. Our officials of the Departments of Bantu Affairs, Customs and Excise, and others, are periodically serving in the border areas where, <i>inter alia,</i> terrorist operations are in progress. It is a fact that those relevant officials must depend solely on the ordinary travel and subsistence allowances, even though some of their possessions are burnt to the ground. I think there was one case where an official lost possessions to the value of more than R3 800. No fixed formula exists for compensation to these officials on the border. I am requesting that these officials should not be compensated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, as is being done at present, but that these officials should be paid according to a fixed formula when they suffer any losses.</p>

<p>I want to come to the question of pensions. It happens every day that&#x2014;and all our colleagues will attest to the fact, colleagues on this side of the House and some of the smart colleagues on that side of the House, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana excluded&#x2014;two or three years after officials have retired on pension, they find themselves faced with insurmountable problems. Then one is faced with the situation that these officials did not know what they were letting themselves in for upon retirement as far as the acceptance of a gratuity or otherwise was concerned. I want to request that the departments uniformly point out to all officials, before they retire, the <span class="col_6545-6546" refersTo="page_0340"/>consequences attendant upon acceptance of a pension and a gratuity so that they are very clear about what they are letting themselves in for. In respect of our Government officials on session duty, it is interesting to note that in the parliamentary residential town, Acacia Park, there are at present 1 072 people who are accommodated in 233 houses, while those who are unmarried live in 159 flats. There are 290 married couples and 91 unmarried persons, the majority of whom are officials. The rental for these houses varies from R33 to R62 while that of the flats varies from R44 to R28 per month.</p>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that the session allowance of officials on parliamentary duty is at present R6 for married persons and R3-50 for unmarried persons. In contrast to this the travel and subsistence allowances for ordinary officials vary from R11 to R7 in the lower ranks. There has recently been an increase here. Since these officials have had to pay a 10% increase on housing this year while on session duty in Cape Town, I want to ask that their session allowances be adjusted. Officials who are serving in Cape Town for the parliamentary session have expenses which they would not otherwise have had. If I am permitted to elaborate further on this, I just want to point out that these officials have particular problems. I know of one family last year which had five children in five different schools. There is the greater expenditure in respect of high school children who have to live in hostels. These people do not come here of their own free will. They are sent here by their employer, the State. They do good service for the State. I should like to ask, in the interests of this large number of officials, and with a view to the increasing cost of living, that the Government take another look at the session allowances that are being paid, particularly those in the lower paid ranks, say, up to administrative officers. I think that the merits of the case justify further careful consideration of this matter by the Government.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the few moments before the debate adjourns, I want to take the opportunity of replying to one or two of the attacks made from the Opposition side. In the first place, however, I first want to say thank you to the chairman of the United Party&#x2019;s Interior group for his few words congratulating me on my appointment as Minister of the Interior. I immediately want to assure him that I regard this Vote, as it is administered at present, with all the implications involved, as an extremely important Vote in the whole Public Service. The Interior Vote is most intimately concerned with the lives of everyone from the cradle to the grave. One is continually dealing with human situations and human problems. One is dealing, for example, with the position of race classification which, from the nature of the case, is a delicate matter which one does not like to interfere with if it is not necessary, specifically because it makes such severe and drastic inroads into the lives of people. The Vote is concerned with the whole question of the admission of people into the country and with passports allowing them to go overseas, all personal, intimate matters. With a view to this it is my point of departure and my policy that all these matters be handled with great sympathy and humanity.</p>

<p>I shall in all respects be humane in my approach to and handling of the difficult questions which this department has an abundance of. From the humane point of view I should also like to view the other side of the matter. As far as it is possible in practice, I should like to cause the least possible friction, human pain and sorrow. Having said that, I immediately want to tell the hon. member that I must not be misinterpreted in the sense of having said I am reluctant to implement the policy as laid down by the Government from day to day for the protection of certain rights that we have. My statements must not be interpreted to mean that in the implementation of the laws that may be embody certain problems I shall, for the sake of being humane or for the sake of avoiding problems, not implement the laws as contained in the Statute Book or that I shall be lax in implementing them. On the contrary, it will be my duty to carry out, with humanity, the policy and the principles of the Government in this department. That is how I see my task, and that is how I see the task of this department in its approach as a whole.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, I want to devote, on this occasion, a few seconds to my predecessor in this portfolio, whom I <span class="col_6547-6548" refersTo="page_0341"/>succeeded during the recess and who was still handling this Vote last year. I am speaking of the hon. Mr. Theo Gerdener. He served for a period as Minister of the Interior. He did excellent work. He acquitted himself very well of his task and, perhaps under difficult circumstances at times, furnished excellent service. Since he has decided, in the meantime, to retire and to venture into another field, we want to wish him every success on the new course he has taken and on the new task he has taken upon himself. I want to express great thanks and appreciation to him for what he has meant to this department and for what he achieved here in the execution of his duties. Wherever I go, I find that the foundations have thoroughly and firmly been laid and that one can successfully build on them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point put a few questions to me which I should like to reply to at once. In the first place he asked me whether I am going to furnish reasons for the refusal of passports. I now want to tell the hon. member at once that I can and will only do so if it is in South Africa&#x2019;s interests to furnish the reasons. But we must also remember very clearly that at times it is not in the interests of the applicant to furnish reasons either. The hon. member will recall that a while ago a question was put to me by the hon. member for Houghton in connection with a person who was refused a visa. When I was asked whether I would furnish reasons for the refusal in that case, I said &#x201C;no&#x201D;. When she asked why not, my reply was: &#x201C;It is not in the applicant&#x2019;s interest for me to do so.&#x201D; If the hon. member wants to know this in confidence, I shall give him the information, but I am not prepared, in the interests of the applicant, to divulge those reasons. It would, in actual fact, adversely affect the person himself. I cannot, for example, tell the world that someone cannot afford a trip abroad and that I therefore have to refuse him a passport. It is not in his interests. Neither can I say that he is trying to flee as a result of a criminal offence before he has been brought before a court. That is, of course, a reason for refusing a passport. I am, in fact, prepared to do what my predecessor did. I want to refer the hon. member to Hansard (Vol. 34, col. 8770), where this same matter was raised, and where my predecessor gave broad, comprehensive and general reasons why a passport could be refused.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I should very much like to have examples. If he gave reasons in all cases, I should like to know how this was possible in any case. But as I have said, it is frequently not in the interests of either person himself, or the country, for us to give reasons for refusing passports.</p>

<p>Then there is just one further matter that I want to deal with quickly&#x2014;in two shakes, Sir, if I may. The hon. member requested that there should be an appeal body to reconsider the refusal of passports. I just want to tell him at once that the issuing and granting of passports are exclusively the right of the executive authority, i.e. the government of the day. It is unthinkable for the Government, after having refused a passport, to allow an appeal to a body which could exert pressure on the Government or could decide that such a passport should, in fact, be granted. It sounds completely unrealistic to me; because the fact that our Government issues a passport does not mean that it is only providing a person with a travel document. It means, at the same time&#x2014;this is written on the passport&#x2014;that the Government requests the government, in whose area the holder of the passport is travelling, to offer him every possible assistance. The Government also accepts responsibility for such a person. If the Government consequently has reasons for refusing a passport, it cannot allow a private outside body, whatever it may be, to prescribe to it that it should in fact issue the passport, despite the reasons that gave rise to the refusal.

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that I have to introduce this motion, but I am afraid I have no alternative. There is a lot of work to be done and, if at all possible, I would like to adjourn Parliament on the 16th June. There are a number of reasons for this, Sir. One of the reasons is not that I personally am anxious to get away. As far as I am concerned, it makes no difference whether Parliament adjourns in the second, third or fourth week of June. You see, Sir, in those days when I still hunted big game, I wanted to get away as soon as possible in June. When the leaves turned brown and the cold winter winds started blowing, I became restless. I would take out my big rifles and clean and fondle them, and I could not wait for the day when my Landrover pointed to the north and I would journey to the far-off hunting fields to hunt elephant, lion and buffalo. But now, Sir, I have put away my big rifles and I have deteriorated from an elephant hunter to a buck hunter, so there is no inducement to me to get away early. One of the main reasons why I think that Parliament should adjourn on the 16th June, if possible, is that some hon. members and a number of officials still have children at school being accommodated at school hostels, and as the schools break up in some provinces on the 15th, 20th and 22nd June, these parents would like to be back when their children come home.</p>

<p>Sir, the number of sitting hours from now until the 15th June amounts to 120. The time still required for financial <span class="col_6551-6552" refersTo="page_0343"/>measures amounts to 90 hours. Then there are the following Bills, apart from those on the Order Paper, that must be passed: The Miners Phthisis Bill and the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, which are both before Select Committees; the General Law Amendment Bill, the Finance Bill, the Pensions Bills, the Native Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Amendment Bill, the Homelands Consolidation Proposals (North Cape, Natal and Transvaal) and the Bill to give effect to the Schlebusch Commission&#x2019;s recommendations in regard to the Standing Committee on State Security. Some other Bills may be introduced, but the House will only deal with them if they are non-contentious and do not take up much time.</p>

<p>I know, of course, Mr. Speaker, that the Opposition is going to oppose this motion, and I do not blame them. As a matter of fact, if I had been in the Opposition benches I would have done the same. But I want to anticipate some of their arguments. I will, of course, be reproached for adjourning the House early on some occasions before the recess, and it will probably be argued that if that had not happened and if Bills had been introduced timeously, this motion would have been unnecessary.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, let us examine the position to see whether there is any substance in this argument. I would like hon. members to take out their pencils and to do some arithmetic. The number of sitting hours lost through early adjournments before the recess amounted to 14&#x00BD; hours. That included 1&#x00BD; hours for early adjournments during the No-confidence Debate. If the Criminal Procedure Bill had been introduced timeously, what would the position have been&#x003F; When this Bill was introduced, I discussed a possible time-table with the Opposition Whips, and I was informed by the Whips that the Opposition required 13 hours, plus the time taken up by the Minister&#x2019;s reply, for the Second Reading; 50 to 75 hours for the Committee Stage; three hours for the Third Reading, plus the time taken up by the Minister&#x2019;s reply, a total of a minimum of 68 hours and a possible maximum of 93 hours. The House has already spent 21 hours in discussing the Criminal Procedure Bill. Add these 21 hours to the hours lost before the recess as a result of early adjournments, namely 144, and we arrive at a total of 354 hours, so if I had decided to go ahead with this Bill during this session, there would still have been left approximately 324 hours or 574 hours for debate this session. Hon. members will see, therefore, that we are much better off than we would have been if this Bill had been introduced earlier and if I had decided to go through with it during this session. [Interjections.] Then, of course, Sir, we will have the argument again that this is a case of legislating by exhaustion. Let me take back the minds of hon. members, who were here in those days, to the position before 1965, before the amended hours were introduced in this House. In those days the House sat on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, three nights a week. Very often the 10.30 p.m. adjournment rule was suspended; the House sat until the early hours of the morning, and occasionally there were all-night sittings from a quarter past two in the afternoon until nine or ten o&#x2019;clock the next morning. Every session a motion was introduced and passed by the House for additional sitting hours towards the end of the session; it was a regular feature in those days. We have had no late-night sittings or all-night sittings since 1965. In addition to that, Parliament now assembles one week later than Parliament assembled before 1965. Parliament used to assemble on the third Friday in January; now we assemble on the fourth Friday in January, or the first Friday in February. But, Sir, the most significant is that from 1958 to 1963 the sitting hours per session averaged 625 hours, whereas the average sitting hours from 1965 until 1972 amounted to only 507. In other words, Parliament has been sitting 118 hours less per session since 1965 than it did before 1965.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>That is because the rules were changed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not only a question of the changing of the rules. There are many other reasons that I could mention as to why Parliament has been sitting less hours per session since 1965. Sir, hon. members also have the privilege now of discussing a matter of importance, with the permission of the Speaker, during the last half-hour of every sitting day. In other words, hon. members are much better off now than they were before 1965 in regard to the length of the session, so that argument about legislating by exhaustion holds no water at all.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, the third argument, of course, will be that a promise was made that there <span class="col_6553-6554" refersTo="page_0344"/>would be no extra sitting hours after the introduction of the amended sitting hours. I have no knowledge of such a promise; there is no record of such a promise. As a matter of fact, Mr. Sauer, who was then Leader of the House, was the chairman of the committee that dealt with the amended hours. In 1965, while he was still Leader of the House, a motion was introduced to provide for 43 hours and 49 minutes extra sitting time for that session. So if a promise was made, Mr. Sauer, having been chairman of that committee, would certainly not have introduced such a motion providing for additional sitting time amounting to 43 hours in the 1965 session.</p>

<p>Sir, I trust that I have convinced hon. members that I am not acting unreasonably. I can assure them that I like sitting additional hours just as little as they do but there is a lot of work to be done and that work must be completed before the end of the session, and therefore I propose this motion.</p>

<p>I indicated, that we would oppose the motion because we would not accept these long hours. The Minister has referred to the Select Committee on the Rules. I served on that committee. There was an equal number of Government and Opposition members serving on that committee. As the Minister rightly says, Mr. Sauer was the chairman. The general understanding at the end of a series of meetings was that the new rules would cut down the long hours of Parliament. We not only cut down the hours of sitting but we also cut down the time during which members could speak. Before those rules were passed a member could speak for 40 minutes and when he had spoken for 40 minutes he could get an extension of time. Today the position is that only the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition get unlimited time, plus the Minister introducing a Bill. We have cut down a lot of talking in the House and we should be able to get through the work in time. The Minister indicated in the beginning of this session that he had a list of proposed Bills for the session but unfortunately he has been let down either by his Cabinet or by his staff because some of those Bills have not come forward yet, although some of the Bills that still have to come forward are what the Minister calls &#x201C;non-contentious Bills&#x201D;. I think the decision as to what is contentious and what is non-contentious lies in the hands of the Opposition and not in the hands of the Government. Where there has been a Bill which was not controversial we have not wasted time, but time was certainly wasted in the beginning of the session when we had several early adjournments. But there is certainly no need to accept this resolution. The Minister can carry on for another week or two and get through the business. It is his own fault and I am sorry that I cannot commend him as I did last year. Last year I commended the hon. the Minister because he introduced his Bills early; throughout the session there was good contact between the Whips, as there has been this session. The Minister indicated the date on which he wished to end the session; we worked out a suitable time schedule and we kept to our part of the bargain and the Government kept theirs. Therefore it was my privilege last year to compliment the Minister for having arranged the session in an orderly manner and I am sorry that he has now fallen from grace. It is quite clear that he has fallen from grace because he is reminiscing now about the good old days when he could go hunting. But today he is in no hurry and obviously he must be concerned about this otherwise he would not have taken such a long time to explain his reasons for moving this motion, if he had no doubts as to the correctness of his case. For those reasons we do not propose to support this motion nor will we adopt delaying tactics after today except of course when the occasion justifies it. We are not going to be bound to talk less on any Bills on the Order Paper than we have to. We hope that between now and the end of the session all outstanding Bills will be disposed of. It is not fair to the Opposition to come here with a technical Bill and expect it to be rushed through. That is one of the reasons why this Criminal Procedure Bill is not being proceeded with and must be delayed. Had that Bill been given to us in the beginning of the session we probably would have had it out of the way by now. Sir, the Opposition will co-operate in future if it is in the interest of Parliament but we do not intend granting the Minister any concessions if it is not in the public interest. For that reason we oppose this motion and will vote against it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I fully want to support the previous speaker. I also shared in the good old days which the hon. the Minister spoke of, during the first few years I was here. In those days there were also early adjournments. Then it was said that we must adjourn early because legislation was not ready to be placed before the House. This year we adjourned early on more occasions than in any year since I have been here. To tell the truth, the Other Place has almost been in recess more than in session. That is an indication of how little work has gone through. Our session began very late this year. We convened on 2nd February and we began with the actual business of the House on 5th February. This is virtually a week later than in previous years. We nevertheless had to adjourn early from time to time, and on the occasion of those early adjournments we protested and warned the hon. the Minister. We were then scornfully referred to as &#x201C;work fiends&#x201D;. We were never work fiends; never more so than the hon. the Minister himself. However, we foresaw the situation we are now in and we issued a warning. The reason why we are in this situation is because the hon. the Leader of the House has apparently lost control over the hon. Ministers who have to prepare the legislation. [Interjections.] There was a time when they heeded the cracking of the whip, but now they take no notice of him; they leave him in the lurch. That is why we have landed up in this position.</p>

<p>Just look how the hon. the Leader of the House is struggling to get them going! The productivity at the beginning of a session is far too low. With this tight programme that is now coming into operation, the House cannot do its work properly. If the hon. the Minister had announced this programme, which he announced today, at the beginning of the session, we would have thought that it had to be a long session. We have only a month left in which to get through this work. The hon. the Leader of the House mentioned &#x201C;legislation by exhaustion&#x201D;. It is half-baked &#x201C;legislation by exhaustion&#x201D; because it cannot be otherwise. There is still a mass of work to be done, The hon. the Leader of the House is at present the member with the longest period of service in this House, and he should guard the dignity of the House. I am sure he wants to do that. He surely does not want us to be simply a rubber stamp. He would surely not want us simply to let Bills go through because certain people are in a hurry. He mentioned the school holidays. What he said is quite true, but the work of this House is more important than the school holidays. [Interjections.] It is much more important that this work be done properly. At this late stage I want to advocate to the hon. the Minister that he withdraw this proposal. What does it matter if we remain here a week longer, or even up to the end of June&#x003F; It would make no difference, and those who have children at school can, in fact, make other arrangements. We must not allow the dignity of the House to be undermined by such haste.</p>

<p>I think that that was quite an achievement, but it was mainly due to the fact that, as always, there was very good co-operation between the two sides of the House. I had the heartiest support and co-operation from the Opposition, as I always get as a matter of fact, but we had less work to do and less legislation. That accounted for the fact that we could adjourn Parliament without any additional working hours. The hon. member has said, quite rightly, that since the Standing Orders have been amended to provide for the present sitting hours, the speeches have become shorter; some other improvements too have been effected. I think he will agree with me that since then Parliament is much more efficient than it was before. I think it was to the general advantage of the House that those changes were brought about.</p>

I have already said that only 13 sitting hours were thereby lost, apart from the 1&#x00BD; hours that were lost with the earlier adjournment during the discussion of the motion of no confidence. It is therefore nothing extraordinary. In the days before I agreed to have one additional day given to the discussion of the motion of no confidence, we always adjourned at about half-past two on the Monday afternoon. The hon. member knows this to be the case. It was even the case this year, and the custom was introduced as far back as 1965. The hon. member also said that I have lost control over the Ministers. I do not have any control over my colleagues. The only person who has any control over them is the hon. the Prime Minister. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>As I have said, I do not have any control over my colleagues, and as I have frequently explained to the hon. Whips, there are very good reasons why Bills are frequently not submitted immediately or within a reasonable period of time. There is a long procedure that must be employed. There are frequently bottlenecks as far as the legal advisers are concerned. All these problems crop up. That is why a Bill cannot always be submitted in time. I can give hon. members the assurance that my colleagues sitting here are all very anxious to submit their Bills as quickly as it is feasible to do. From the nature of the case, the quicker a Bill is discussed, the quicker we can get it off our backs and the more pleasant it is for the Minister concerned. <span class="col_6559-6560" refersTo="page_0347"/>That is the reason. In respect of the work that must be done, I am afraid there is no alternative; the House is compelled to sit these additional hours.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have come to the Third Reading of this Bill which originated in the Select Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. I think it is important in view of the controversy that raged over it that a junior member of the Standing Rules and Orders Committee should try to put the matter in the correct perspective. One thing that the opponents of this Bill should realize, and that my hon. friend, the member for Houghton should realize, is that this is not a Government measure, nor is it an Opposition measure; it is a parliamentary measure. It is a measure that originated in your office, Sir, and it comes to Parliament via the Standing Rules and Orders Committee. Anybody who opposed it is not opposing the Government or the United Party, but is opposing Parliament, because this Bill is sponsored by Parliament. It has the authority and the imperium of <span class="col_6561-6562" refersTo="page_0348"/>Parliament behind it. I am therefore not surprised that people who oppose this Bill have had to indulge in the most remarkable extravagances and have had to exaggerate their case almost beyond recognition. It is necessary that we should appreciate what this Bill is about. I cannot see in this Bill, as one would gather from the writings in some of the newspapers and some of the speeches of one Member of Parliament, that there is now a general invasion against the right to protest and demonstrate, or even a general prohibition or a ban upon what is commonly known as street democracy. All that happens, is that there is an attempt to ensure that whatever demonstrations take place in the vicinity of Parliament, provided they are legitimate, will be orderly and controlled. I do not think that anybody with any respect for the institution of Parliament can object to that.</p>

<p>I think the area involved is probably 0.001% of the total area of South Africa. It is hardly a square mile, and there are 400 000 square miles of South Africa&#x2019;s territory where this right is not affected in any way. It is related specifically and particularly to the Houses of Parliament and to the protection of the procedures and activities of Parliament.</p>

<p>The cardinal fact about this Bill, we should realize, is that it does not ban street protests. Street protests can take place with the permission of the Chief Magistrate of Cape Town, as always. I think that most of us have sufficient confidence in the man who holds the office of Chief Magistrate in Cape Town to know that he will not prohibit any gatherings, demonstrations and public meetings, unless he has cause to be concerned about the maintenance of law and order and unless he has cause to believe that the dignity and the activities of Parliament may be adversely affected as a result.</p>

<p>Why should this prohibition be effective all the year round, when in Britain it is limited to the days upon which Parliament sits and in Belgium it is limited to the period during which Parliament is in session&#x003F; For the very simple reason that we have in South Africa something that is missing in Britain and in Belgium, namely people who would like to exploit every possibility to try to convince their own supporters and the world outside that we are a police state and that we deny democratic rights to the people who participate in the functions of Parliament. If we did not provide for this prohibition to be operative all the year round, it would mean that every year when the enactment is repeated, whether by regulation under an enabling act of Parliament, or by some police order as in Britain, one would find that the agitation we are experiencing at the moment would be repeated. Year after year there would be an attempt to discredit democracy as it exists in South Africa in the eyes of the world. I feel that we as a responsible Parliament have to take action to prevent this annual recurrence of irresponsible propaganda against our desire to maintain the dignity and the function of Parliament. There is irresponsible propaganda against this measure, against Parliament, and against the attempt of Parliament to preserve its orderly functioning and its own dignity and reputation.</p>

<p>Now I want to remind you, Sir, of a speech made in this House yesterday on clause 3 of this Bill, when my friend, the hon. member for Houghton, waxed wrathful over this clause, and suggested that a newspaper would not be allowed to report a demonstration held within the precincts of Parliament, nor mention the fact that a demonstration would take place in defiance of a refusal by the Chief Magistrate to give permission. I would, if I may, remind you, Sir, of the words, the extravagance and completely unjustified allegations of the hon. member for Houghton. She said:</p>

<block name="quote">The term may, I know, be legally argued in this context, for that depends entirely on the court&#x2019;s interpretation. In other words, must the gathering have taken place or not before the prohibition becomes operative&#x003F; But that is a legal quibble.</block>

<p>A very important point to her is a legal quibble. She goes on, with uncontrolled irresponsibility, to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to ensure that if a gathering does take place, it can be reported, otherwise I believe that this is restricting the freedom of the Press still further.</block>

<p>Every person who visits South Africa, Sir, and who is as critical of the Government as I am, says that what amazes them is how free the Press of South Africa, is. I challenge any responsible newspaper to say that in any essential field the Press is not free in South Africa. But she says: &#x201C;As it is, the freedom of the Press is restricted <span class="col_6563-6564" refersTo="page_0349"/>in South Africa &#x2026;" In which respect, Sir&#x003F; I want you to see, Sir, the sort of allegation this hon. member makes when she says that the freedom of the Press is restricted in South Africa. When she has to substantiate it what does she say&#x003F; She continues: &#x2026; in that they may not report on prison conditions.&#x201D; Full stop! Sir, I think the Press should be allowed to report on prison conditions, but it is such a limited restriction on the freedom of the Press that, although I may disagree with it, I would be dishonest &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Please, I am trying to make my own speech. [Interjections.] There are various defence measures and official secrets, etc., on which the Press may not report. Sir, I believe that the mother of democracies is the United Kingdom, Great Britain, the Parliament at Westminster. They have an Official Secrets Act; they have a Defence of the Realm Act which imposes similar restrictions to those which we have in South Africa. But again, nobody can argue that the Press in the United Kingdom or the Press in South Africa is not free. The criticisms that have been directed against this Government by the Press exceed anything that a responsible Opposition in Parliament could offer. I have never known them to be limited. I have never known them to be restrained. I have never known them in any way to be denied that freedom, even to be irresponsible. But this is the sort of nonsense we have from the hon. member for Houghton. She says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now we are going still further. If a gathering or demonstration takes place, according to clause 3(b), if a newspaper reports on the gathering which, in terms of the Bill could be illegal, it is committing an offence. I believe that is another serious restriction on the reporting of news. It is censorship, in fact, of the very worst kind. I wonder whether the official Opposition is going to agree to this form of censorship.</block>

<p>The official Opposition, Sir, would not agree with this form of censorship if it existed. What is more important, the official Opposition agrees that the hon. member for Houghton is talking nonsense. Sir, let me read to you clause 3(b) of this Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who &#x2026; prints, publishes, distributes or in any manner whatsoever circulates a notice convening or organizing a proposed gathering or demonstration or advertises or in any other manner makes known the proposed gathering or demonstration &#x2026; shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding R300 &#x2026;</block>

<p>May I say in passing, Sir, that we do not even prescribe a minimum punishment as they do in Belgium; we only prescribe a maximum. The court could be satisfied merely to caution people who transgress against this measure. Sir, where in this clause do you see any prohibition on the Press to report that such a meeting is to take place, that a magistrate has banned it or that, in spite of the banning by the magistrate, some irresponsible person is going to hold a meeting in any case&#x003F; Where do you find anything in this clause that says that if that meeting is held in spite of the banning, the Press may not report on that fact&#x003F; You may as well say that the Press may not report any crime. Of course, if people break the law, the Press can report it. Where does the hon. member for Houghton find anything to substantiate this charge that the freedom of the Press is being attacked because people are not allowed to demonstrate in a small square mile surrounding the Houses of Parliament&#x003F; Obviously, Sir, the courts would have to take into consideration the subjective approach of the person who makes the report. Obviously, if somebody publicized such a meeting with the intention of attracting people to it, it would be a crime, but equally obviously, if the Press factually reported the fact that certain people intend to conduct an illegal activity, they would be entitled to do so because by giving that information, instead of advertising the meeting, they would be warning people against attending it and taking part in an illegal activity. But the hon. member for Houghton does not see that <span class="col_6565-6566" refersTo="page_0350"/>because she is prejudiced, and for the sake of her prejudice she is willing to ignore the facts and even the very terms of the Bill before her. Sir, I think people should take notice of that. I think that in assessing the value and the weight of the opposition of the hon. member for Houghton to this Bill, we should consider the attitude of the hon. member for Houghton to the Parliament of South Africa. She is a Member of the Parliament of South Africa, and it is on record, Sir, that on occasions I have, in the face of criticism, defended her rights as a Member of the Parliament of South Africa.</p>

<p>I shall listen to her with great attention, because I am satisfied that she will continue to confirm what I am saying about her at this moment. The difficulty with the hon. member for Houghton, Sir, is that her roots in South Africa are very shallow indeed. She is a member of this Parliament; she is in this Parliament, but she is not of this Parliament. She does not identify herself with the democratic institutions of South Africa as they exist, and she takes every opportunity to discredit the institution of Parliament and its membership. When, Sir, by agreement, after careful consideration, even with the support of a judicial commission&#x2014;and she is an advocate of judicial commissions, if I am not mistaken&#x2014;we decided, for example, that the time had come to reconsider the emoluments of members of Parliament, she alone held out&#x2014;the great, courageous Joan of Arc on the white charger&#x2014;and then when, in spite of her opposition, those increased emoluments were granted, she accepted the increase. Sir, she is a member of Parliament, but I do not know of one instance where she has sought a seat on a Select Committee of Parliament. But she reserves the right to damn and to condemn the activities of Select Committees of Parliament, even to the extent of making statements about their procedure; even to the extent of suggesting that Select Committees are interested in things that do not concern them yet she, as a member of Parliament, has the fullest right to attend any session of any Select Committee of Parliament and to determine what actually happens at those Select Committees, but she never does that. However, she reserves the right, in ignorance, or with the authority of ignorance, to criticize the activities of our Select Committees and of Parliament. Sir, her approach to Parliament is flippant. Her approach to Parliament, as her attitude towards this Bills shows, is always superficial and, above all, it is grossly impertinent and grossly arrogant. Quite recently a Select Committee appointed by this House &#x2014;against the vote of our side of the House, but appointed by this House&#x2014;was converted into a commission and it produced a report, the third report of the Schlebusch Commission.</p>

<p>It has a lot to do with the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude to Parliament, which is the point we are discussing. This third report of the Schlebusch Commission contains something like 180 to 200 pages of scientific evidence by prominent scientists, by religious leaders on South Africa and was tabled in this House, I think, on the 25th April, and the hon. member stood up and this is what she said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About 10 minutes ago &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want to emphasize that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I was presented with the third interim report of the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organizations.</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. E. G. Malan: And have you read it already&#x003F;</block>

If one reads the introductory paragraphs and the conclusion, one gets a fair idea of what is in this report. As far as I am concerned, and I may change my mind after a more detailed study of this report, I would say that this is a half-baked analysis of pseudo-psychological nonsense.</block>

<p>After a ten minute glance at it that is her attitude to a parliamentary institution, and since then other people who have had more time than ten minutes, like the Archbishop of Cape Town and the Archbishop of Johannesburg, leaders of the Methodist Church and leaders of the Unitarian Church, and the Society of South African Psychiatrists have found that this was not a lot of half-baked nonsense but something which requires urgent attention. But that is the superficial, the flippant and the irresponsible approach of the hon. member for Houghton towards Parliament and the work and the functions of Parliament. I would appeal to the people of South Africa to see the hon. member in her conduct. She is a very fine woman in many respects but her conduct as a member of Parliament is that of a person who wants to be in Parliament but who refuses to identify herself with a South African institution like Parliament. I appeal to the people of South Africa to assess her judgment in the light of that fact.</p>

<p>The hon. member himself has said a lot of things in Parliament which he should have withdrawn, but we will leave that to one side. But I simply want to say I have not changed my line at all about the third interim report of this Schlebusch Commission. [Interjections.] In fact, the same comment which I levelled against it at the time I would level against it again today if that were the matter under discussion, but it is not. I intend to get back to the Bill which we are discussing, but I would like to say this to the hon. member that I will certainly not go along with this House, the Government and the official Opposition, in collaborating on Bills &#x2014;no matter what kind of Bills they are&#x2014; of which I disapprove, and that may be Bills to increase members&#x2019; salaries, Bills which abrogate the rule of law or Bills like the one we are considering today, and including Bills on which hon. members are now co-operating in regard to the so-called internal security which now apparently extends as far as the wild goings-on at Wilgespruit in 1970. I am not interested in supporting such issues. I will oppose everything in this House that comes up which I feel deserves opposing, and in so doing I am not, I would inform the hon. member for Yeoville, representing myself but I am representing all enlightened opinion in South Africa. [Interjections.] The hon. member devoted himself to a personal tirade against me, and I do not blame him because I must say I have given him a pretty hot time over the last few months, in Parliament and out of Parliament, and I intend to continue doing so. He is quite entitled to retaliate and I do not take umbrage at that at all.</p>

<p>He devoted the rest of his discussion this afternoon to clause 3 of the Bill and my condemnation of that clause about which I stated that there was certainly a question of legal doubt. It was <span class="col_6569-6570" refersTo="page_0352"/>open to different legal interpretations. I want to tell the hon. member that I have taken counsel&#x2019;s opinion and the opinion that I have taken differs indeed considerably from the opinion which he pronounced this afternoon as far as advertising a proposed meeting is concerned. There is very considerable doubt as to whether or not the Press would in fact legally be entitled to do so. No one has argued about the general so-called freedom of the Press in South Africa, but it is by no means unlimited. There are various limitations on the freedom of the Press. I stated yesterday, and I repeat today, that this Bill could be a further extension of those limitations.</p>

<p>I am not going to counter the arguments which he used about the Chief Magistrate and his wisdom because I did that yesterday in replying to the hon. member for Durban North. I should like to point out, however, that absolutely nothing has happened during the Committee Stage of the Bill or during the Second Reading debate which has in any way caused me to alter my original assessment of this measure. On the contrary, I am absolutely strengthened in my determination to oppose this measure. I intend to move the same amendment at the Third Reading that I moved at the Second Reading. I am not interested in whether this Bill emanated from the Standing Orders Committee of this House. As far as I am concerned this is a measure which has been brought to the floor of Parliament and which has been introduced by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police as a member of the Government and not as a member of the Standing Orders Committee. I stand here as a member of the Opposition and I am going to oppose this Bill again and therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>All the arguments to which I listened both at the Second Reading and the Committee Stage of this Bill have made it patently clear to me that, in fact, this Bill really has very little to do with protecting the rights, privileges and safety of Parliament, which in any case, as I have pointed out, have to my mind never been threatened. At lunch-time today there was another demonstration on the Cathedral steps. I wonder whether any members of Parliament felt themselves unduly threatened by this &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; or nervous perhaps, like the hon. member for Durban North, of entering the precincts of Parliament just because there were a dozen ladies of the Black Sash demonstrating at the gates of Parliament near the Avenue&#x003F; I do not believe that any member of Parliament has ever felt threatened, and had members in fact felt threatened, I am sure that we would have heard about this Bill long ago. I want to point out that members of Parliament are already protected by municipal by-laws which give them protection against any persons loitering or persons who obstruct access to Parliament. I should also like to point out that section 10(3)(h) of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act lays down that Parliament may summarily punish any person who, while Parliament is sitting, creates or joins in any disturbance in Parliament or in the vicinity of Parliament whereby the proceedings of Parliament are or are likely to be interrupted.</p>

<p>This Bill has nothing to do with the inalienable right of the messenger boy of the hon. member for Durban North. I might tell the hon. member that if he did feel threatened in any way, he could also have recourse to section 10(3)(e) of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act. That would give him some protection as an individual. I give him this bit of legal advice <i>pro Deo.</i> The Bill, in fact, has nothing to do with messenger boys. It has nothing to do really with protection of Members of Parliament. What it has to do with, is what the hon. the Deputy Minister freely and frankly admitted during the Second Reading debate and that is the prevention of student demonstrations.</p>

<p>I am quoting the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s own words. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Maar natuurlik is dit teen die studente.</block>

<p><span class="col_6571-6572" refersTo="page_0353"/>This Bill has to do with student demonstrations, and student demonstrations only. And I believe it has to do with the further suppression of freedom of assembly, of speech and of public protest in South Africa. I do not want to repeat the arguments which I have already used to show that there are many and considerable differences between this Bill and the relevant Act which was passed in Britain&#x2014;I said in 1839 but I actually meant 1817: There were two legislative measures in Great Britain in this context, namely in 1839 and 1817, but the 1817 one is really the relevant Act. I moved an amendment yesterday in the Committee Stage in order to try to bring this more in line with British practice since Britain is always being quoted as the mother of Parliaments and the mother of democracy. I moved the amendments to bring this Bill more in line with the 1817 British Act, but, of course, all those amendments were defeated. I want to point out that in any case in Great Britain permission to hold meetings within the one-mile radius of Westminster is very frequently granted, whether or not Parliament is sitting. Will that be the case here&#x003F; I wonder. I very much doubt if the Chief Magistrate of Cape Town would ever dare to go against the advice of the police who invariably will rule that there is a danger of disturbance of law and order, as indeed any meeting may be a danger to law and order if one takes it to its extremes. Only two examples were given in the debate of other countries which have measures such as this. The one was Great Britain and the other was Belgium. Yet, in the course of his speech, the hon. member for Durban North said that every Parliament in the world had taken steps to prevent this. What does he mean by that&#x003F; Does he mean countries behind the Iron Curtain&#x003F; I would like to know what other examples can be given. Let me tell the House that in the greatest and certainly the largest democracy in the Western world, the United States, demonstrations are held outside the White House practically every day and demonstrations are very frequently held right on the steps of the Capitol Buildings, that is where the Congress and the Senate sit.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand asked whether I would have any objection if a demonstration were held by persons with views differing from my own. To that I said &#x201C;No&#x201D; by way of interjection yesterday. I want to repeat most strongly today that my reply to that is &#x201C;Of course not&#x201D;, because I believe that to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest and to voice views which may differ from my own are the very fabric of democracy I would have hoped that hon. members on both sides of this House would agree with me. I would like to remind hon. members of the words of Mr. Justice Black, that it cannot be too often repeated that freedom of speech, Press, petition and assembly must be accorded to the ideas we hate or sooner or later they will be denied to the ideas that we cherish. I may hate the ideas of people demonstrating against me but I would never for one moment deny them the right to express those ideas by way of demonstration or gathering.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Certainly, as long as it is non-violent. The hon. member for Zululand, who I might say evinced very touching concern for my safety and access to Parliament yesterday, equated the messenger boy with the man in the street and he defended the right of the man in the street to go about his business. In other words, he was not concerned with the man in the street coming to and from Parliament or parliamentarians having access to this House. He was concerned with the right &#x201C;of the man in the street to go about his business&#x201D;. I am quoting his own words. What am I to understand by that&#x003F; Is he now pleading for the prohibition of all open-air meetings&#x003F; Because he knows perfectly well that this measure is confined as it is to a certain radius from our Parliament. What about the right of the man in the street elsewhere&#x003F; What about the man in the street of Pretoria or Johannesburg or in any other centre, for that matter, of South Africa&#x003F; What on earth was the relevance of an argument like that&#x003F; What about the right of provincial councils to sit safely and the right of their messenger boys to come and go without being obstructed in anyway&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s most extraordinary reaction to the remarks I made about Miss Gladys Lee. I raised the example of Miss Gladys Lee in order, of course, to highlight the patent absurdity of having a measure of this kind which defines a demonstration as consisting of one or more persons. I pointed out to the hon. <span class="col_6573-6574" refersTo="page_0354"/>the Minister that therefore Miss Gladys Lee demonstrating on her own, as she frequently does, falls within the purview of the Act. The hon. the Minister said: &#x201C;Die arme ou tannie,&#x201D; or words to that effect, &#x201C;Of course, this was not aimed against her&#x201D;, which I agree it was not, but nevertheless she falls within the purview of this Bill. He then said that he would request the police not to see Miss Gladys Lee when she was protesting. I pointed out that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reaction was utterly illegal; that he was making a blatantly illegal suggestion. He was, in fact, suggesting that the police should ignore a measure which he himself was putting on the Statute Book. I said that he was no doubt doing that in order to save the Government from the embarrassment of having to arrest Miss Lee. When I pointed this out to the hon. the Minister, he called it &#x201C;verlinkse maneuver&#x201D;&#x2014;a very good expression. In other words, it is apparently only the &#x201C;far left&#x201D; that wants the law obeyed once it is on the Statute Book. What a silly remark! I can tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that his second reaction was a &#x201C;far right reaction&#x201D;, when he spitefully said that in that event he would cancel the instruction or request that he was going to give to the police and that he was not going to tell them that they ought to arrest Miss Gladys Lee. He added that it would be my fault if they did that&#x2014;it could not of course be ascribed to the measure that he had put on the Statute Book! I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is not his business as a deputy Minister to instruct or request the police in carrying out the law. That is not his function at all. His function is just to see that the laws that he puts on the Statute Book are not made so ridiculous that he himself has to run about seeing that they are not implemented fully. Surely, that is obviously the point. It is certainly not his function as a Deputy Minister to make suggestions to the police and then withdraw them when someone points out that he has made a blatantly illegal suggestion.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that I wonder whether it is generally appreciated by the hon. member for Yeoville who, unlike me, is part and parcel of this House, of Standing Committees, Select Committees and commissions of inquiry, and whether it is generally known by this House how severe the penalties are for infringing this measure. They go very far beyond the penalties that are laid down in clause 3 of the Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill lays down that any person who shall be guilty of an offence, shall be&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding R300 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment.</block>

<p>In point of fact, if one examines the law a little more closely, should anybody offend and be convicted in terms of this law by holding a gathering on demonstration of protest in the defined area without the permission of the Chief Magistrate, he or she will be liable to prosecution under the very stringent penalties laid down by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, No. 8 of 1953. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with that. Section 1 of this Act says that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever any person is convicted of any offence which is proved to have been committed by way of protest or in support of any campaign against any law or in support of any campaign for the repeal or modification of any law, or the variation or limitation of the application or administration of any law, the court convicting him may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law contained, sentence him to</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) a fine not exceeding R600; or</li>

<li>(b) imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years; or</li>

<li>(c) a whipping not exceeding ten strokes.</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, anyone convicted of taking part in an unlawful gathering or procession is not only subject to the penalties of the actual Bill we are examining today, but further could in fact be found guilty under section 1 of the &#x201C;Whipping Bill&#x201D;, as it was commonly known at the time. I may add that the penalties can include any variation; in other words, a whipping and a fine, a whipping or imprisonment, or imprisonment and a fine. I would like to point out too that this Bill not only prohibits all gatherings in the open air within the defined area throughout the entire year. It says nothing about public places in the open air. It goes much further therefore in some respects than the Riotous Assemblies Act, because it also prohibits open air meetings on private property within the defined area. That would include <span class="col_6575-6576" refersTo="page_0355"/>the Cathedral steps and the Cathedral garden and the city campus of the University of Cape Town. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister would be as frank as he was in admitting that this measure was largely against students demonstrating and admit that one of the purposes of this Bill is to avoid a confrontation with the church about the use of the private property of the Cathedral, which is within the vicinity of Parliament. It is much easier to forbid all open air meetings whether they are held on private property or whether they are held on public property. When the United Party used to have huge open air rallies and was proud of them as one of the major means of persuading the electorate to use its power at the ballot box to try to change the Government, open air meetings were not considered &#x201C;street democracy&#x201D; in those days. Open air meetings were held by the United Party from the days&#x2014;and that is long enough ago, heaven knows&#x2014;when I still was a member of the United Party. There were open air meetings to try to persuade the electorate to change their minds. We did not talk about street democracy in those days. I wonder whether the hon. member for Green Point, who spoke on this Bill at a previous stage, and the hon. member for Gardens, realize that if they want to hold election meetings, or any sort of meetings for that matter, in any outdoor area, within the defined area, they would have to get the permission of the Chief Magistrate, even to hold an election meeting.</p>

<p>There are other considerations which apply when one sets out to defend democracy in the 20th century.</p>

<p>It is very simple and very tempting, particularly amidst the increasing strains of the 20th century and the complexities of modern life to be able to rule a straight line between right and wrong, between positive and negative, between good and evil, between the democratic society and the authoritarian society. It is particularly tempting to do so if one&#x2019;s own instincts are wholly on the side of the traditional freedoms and the full enjoyment of civil liberties and if one&#x2019;s fears and suspicions have been aroused over the years by the cruelties and barbarities of fascist and communistic systems. It is even more tempting when one has no responsibility for the maintenance of public order, no real part to play in the eternal conflict between the preservation of human freedoms and the self-discipline which alone can preserve those freedoms, to pose in shining armour as the sole champion of liberty and to take a stand on unqualified principles. We envy the hon. lady the intellectual luxury she enjoys. In fact, Sir, it is not as simple as that.</p>

<p>Every modern State, every Western country, is at grips with a fundamental dilemma. It is a feature of modern society and the nightmare of modern Statecraft that the sources of anarchy, Communism, terrorism and change by violence or paralysis by the abuse of freedom, have grown more prolific and subtle with the passing of each year. If they flourish and succeed, democracy will die. If they are allowed, by battening on democracy and by exploiting the civil liberties it cherishes, to achieve their purposes, we shall stand condemned before history as naive fools who acquiesced tamely in their own destruction.</p>

<p><span class="col_6577-6578" refersTo="page_0356"/>The hon. lady may protest that the contingency is so remote as not to need to be taken seriously. This may well seem so at times, until yet another plot is discovered in Australia, Canada or South Africa, or as recently happened in West Germany. In the final count-down, the struggle continues and will continue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our civil liberties, as we know them, are the product of a long defiance against tyranny, the final reward handed down to us by the efforts of heroes and martyrs through centuries of political struggle. In the parliamentary democracy that we enjoy, is that democracy so vulnerable that it has to be dismantled in order to protect it against the depredations of these outside forces&#x003F; If we dismantle our liberties in order to defend our liberties, who stands to gain and who stands to lose&#x003F; If we believe that the State is the servant of the people, why then must the people curtail their liberties in order to defend the State&#x003F; These are the questions we have to consider. This is the other side of the coin, and this is how one of the great dilemmas of our society arises. It is the paradox which every modern civilized State is trying to resolve. How are we to keep the democratic heritage if, in order to safeguard it, we must sacrifice part of it to keep the barbarian at our gates&#x003F; It is not a simple matter to resolve, either in the domestic or in the international community.</p>

<p>We have seen in recent years the outbreak of a new form of violence against peaceful existence on this planet. We have seen the phenomenon of hijacking, of piracy in the air and of terrorism.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>It is intolerable that this threat should continue. Now, Sir, attempts have been made at the United Nations to deal with this particular threat. The international community has been set the task to try to resolve this particular threat. What it has done, is to try to do this by, in fact, withdrawing an ancient right, the ancient right of asylum, which has been created over the centuries and which is granted to people who are accused of political activities, political terrorism if you like, against the Governments of their day. It is precisely because certain countries give protection to the hijackers that the very countries which created the right of political asylum have had to seek to limit it. They have had to seek to limit it, because the countries which give protection to the terrorists are countries which claim that those very terrorists are freedom fighters and deserving of protection as political fighters in their own countries. I make this point to illustrate that even in the international community those Western countries which over the past centuries have set up the right of asylum and protected it, are the countries which now, in defence of certain civilized principles, are having to seek to curtail those very rights in order that the freedom of international transport may be guaranteed. In their domestic situation these very same countries, these Western countries, these civilized countries, are facing the same difficulties; they are being confronted by the same unhappy choice between the preservation of hard-won liberties and the restriction of certain of those liberties in order that democracy itself may be protected. It is a cruel dilemma in which we are placed, and one not solved by the parrot-like repetition of the slogans of the Left or of the Right.</p>

<p>There are fundamental guide-lines, basic principles, by which one may chart one&#x2019;s course through this very difficult area. Will the restriction of certain liberties do less harm than the harm which may otherwise result&#x003F; That is one guide-line. How to preserve the greatest good for the greatest number; that is another. It is easier to state the principles than to draw precise boundaries. This is the difficulty we have before us today; not the question whether Parliament should be protected or whether its dignity should be protected, but how the rule should be defined and where the boundaries should be drawn. We know that in this country we may face troubled times before we finally work out a just and universally accepted solution to the problems of our diverse and complex country. How do we preserve, through these times, the principles, the rights, the liberties, which we must eventually bequeath to all our people&#x003F; Can we bequeath the right of Parliament if, meanwhile, we hesitate to protect it&#x003F; Can we bequeath impartial courts of justice if we fail to use the very severe laws which now defend their authority, their independence and their dignity&#x003F; Can we bequeath the rights of free speech, of free association and free assembly if we stand ready to surrender them to the mob&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_6579-6580" refersTo="page_0357"/>In the particular law we are considering today, it is proposed that the right of free assembly, specifically that of gathering and demonstrating in the open air in a defined area, should be subject to a permit. All other assemblies remain lawful. The purpose of the permit is to ensure that any gathering which does take place in this area in these conditions, will be a peaceful one, in which case it also will be lawful. That is all that is essentially contained in this Bill. We serve notice now that we shall be the first to protest if the provisions of this law are unreasonably administered. This is a parliamentary measure and, as we see it, it is essentially a discretionary measure. All gatherings are still in fact permitted, with one proviso, and that is that in the case of certain open-air meetings&#x2014;that is to say those not exempted by clause 2&#x2014;a permit is required at the discretion of a judicial officer, the Chief Magistrate of Cape Town. This is therefore a discretionary power within a precise and limited scope. It is on this understanding that it became an agreed measure of Parliament. We shall continue to subject the administration of this measure to constant scrutiny, and I believe that the hon. the Minister would expect no less. We shall not be silent if it is employed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. We shall not acquiesce if, as happened yesterday, the Deputy Minister withdraws an exemption previously granted merely because the hon. member for Houghton had succeeded in irritating him in some way. Sir, that is most capricious action, I agree.</p>

<p>We do not believe that this kind of law should be administered in a capricious manner by a Minister acting on the basis of whether or not he has taken umbrage at a remark made to him. This Bill confers reserve powers for employment in the protection of Parliament where necessary. If Parliament is not in session, the permissive discretion can obviously be far more liberally interpreted than when Parliament is in session. We shall support the Minister if he employs the powers that Parliament has given him in a fair and reasonable manner, with due regard to the freedoms and rights of private citizens, for the justifiable protection of Parliament. We shall not support the hon. the Minister if he administers this law capriciously, unpredictably, partially and with no visible purpose other than to avoid inconvenience and embarrassment to the Government. The Bill we have before us, Sir, is not a Bill for the comfort of the Government; it is a Bill to protect the safety and dignity of Parliament. We therefore support it.</p>

Is that correct&#x003F; I can predict even at this early stage that she is going to be hauled over the coals by her friends for having called those people terrorists. I can predict that now. The hon. member referred to the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act, and referred to section 10(3)(h) of that Act, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<li>(h) While Parliament is sitting, creating or joining in any disturbance in Parliament or in the vicinity of Parliament, whereby the proceedings of Parliament are or are likely to be interrupted.</li>

<p>The hon. member said that we had this Act which we could fall back on, and that we did not need this Bill. But what the hon. member forgot is that in terms of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act, the trouble must already have started. That is precisely what we want to avoid. We want to prevent trouble ever developing at any time in future. We have enough legislation to put a stop to this kind of thing once it has begun.

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The words &#x201C;or likely to be&#x201D; refer to a situation which is already in progress, and which could possibly disturb the business of Parliament. But this is a situation which is already in progress; it is not any future situation, vent here with this Bill is a situation which could, even in future, disturb Parliament in its work. That is the reply. The hon. member for Houghton accused me of being opposed to the students. I can tell her candidly that I have nothing against the students as students, but it remains a fact that the disturbance which occurred here in the vicinity of Parliament was one caused by students, and for that reason this Bill is aimed as much at students as at any other demonstrators who would possibly want to demonstrate. But she need not think that I shall run away from this because these are students, and that I will not say that it was students who caused a disturbance here last time. That is true. It was students, and for that reason this Bill is aimed at putting a stop to student demonstrations of that kind. There is no doubt about that, and let the hon. member understand this now. This has to do with student demonstrations, and other kinds of demonstrators as well. It includes student demonstrators. Sir, the hon. member for Houghton who is constantly making a speech while I am speaking, was concerned about the Press. She said, and I am quoting her words from Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6583-6584" refersTo="page_0359"/>Now we are going still further. If a gathering or demonstration takes place then according to clause 3(b) if a newspaper reports on the gathering which in terms of the Bill could be illegal, then it is committing an offence. I believe that is another serious restriction on the recording of news.</block>

<p>That statement is obviously in error, and I hope the hon. member has now had time to ask her law advisers, who advise her in regard to this matter, and has found out that she made a fool of herself when she made this statement. Because, the words of the Bill are quite clear. They read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who prints, publishes, distributes or, in any manner whatsoever, circulates a notice convening or organizing the proposed gathering or demonstration or advertises or in any other manner makes known the proposed gathering or demonstration &#x2026;</block>

<p>But this entire situation is qualified by the constant use of the words &#x201C;proposed gathering&#x201D;. It means a future gathering, in regard to which an agitation may not be launched. Should it be launched in a newspaper, it is unlawful. Should it be advertised in a newspaper, it is unlawful. But if a demonstration were to be held, and newspapers were to report those facts, it cannot of course be regarded as a contravention. This statement the hon. member is now making, that the newspapers will supposedly not be able to report any demonstrations which occur, is therefore an incorrect statement and a distorted image of what is stated in the Bill.</p>

<p>I think that is about all I have to reply to. However, I also want to say to the hon. member, just to dispose of the question of Miss Lee finally, that since she has now accused me, and read me a moral lesson on how I should run the department and do my work as Deputy Minister, I do have advisers, who are quite good enough, on this side of the House. Her kind of advice I do not need at all. That I can tell her right now.</p>

Whether it was a Deputy Minister or someone in the street who told them that they should simply look the other way, does not make any difference.

The hon. member then began to become terribly legal and juristic, for she apparently received some or other legal advice that I was not entitled to say that a person could contravene an Act, and that the police should not take cognizance of that. My reply to that&#x2014;with this I am coming to the hon. member for Von Brandis as well&#x2014;was that if the hon. member for Houghton felt that way, I would withdraw my request to the police. I would not then make such a request to the police and if they then arrested the old woman, the police would have to understand that the hon. member for Houghton had requested me to make certain that Miss Lee was arrested, for it was the hon. member who was eager to see the Act being applied as it should be applied. If that elderly lady is arrested, it will consequently be the hon. member&#x2019;s fault. That is all I have to say on this point.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Von Brandis that when I act in a humane and courteous manner, it is not necessary for a member of the Opposition to want to chide me about this. Does the hon. member for Von Brandis want that old lady to be arrested&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now come to the Third Reading of this Bill and as we have indicated earlier, we welcome the administrative aspects of this Bill which cover various aspects of the Public Service. I must, however, utilize this occasion to draw attention to one aspect which perhaps has not been fully canvassed during the previous discussions on this Bill. I refer to the introduction by this Bill of a schedule containing a list of departments from which non-White officers and employees in the Public Service can be transferred to non-White authorities. That in effect means that we have now introduced into the Act certain specified departments in which non-Whites who are employed as officers and employees in the Public Service of the Republic can now be transferred to continue their work in the Public Service under non-White authorities. Hon. members will notice that the Third Schedule as inserted by clause 7 refers to certain departments where this can now be done. The departments named are the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, the Department of Bantu Education, the Department of Forestry, the Department of Health, the Department of Prisons and the Department of the South African Police. These transfers will, of course, be subject to certain safeguards. Firstly, the transfers will be made on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission, and secondly, they can only be made with the consent of the non-White officer or employee concerned. We on this side of the House hope that this opportunity for training non-White public servants will be speeded up in so far as the Public Service of South Africa is concerned in order that those non-Whites who can now be transferred to non-white authorities to continue their work in the Public Service with those authorities, will be able to play a greater part in the administration of the affairs which are of intimate concern to themselves and in their own interests. As has been recently announced by the hon. the Minister of Defence, I trust that this provision and the application of this provision to these departments will not only raise the grades and the positions to which non-Whites can now aspire in the Service, albeit not in the Public Service of the Republic then in the Public Service of the non-White authorities, and that they will be encouraged to enter in greater numbers into the Public Service for the benefit, firstly of obtaining the training within the Public Service of the Republic generally, and, secondly, to be able to fulfil responsibility as trained and qualified persons in the various departments of the non-White authorities. Personally, one welcomes the departments that are mentioned, but I do want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that serious consideration be given to the inclusion of two further departments, i.e. the Departments of Justice and of Social Welfare and Pensions. I believe that if there is an increased tempo in the training and equipping of non-Whites through the experience we obtained in our own Public Service, it will help considerably in dealing with the problems of their own people.</p>

<p>During the course of this debate we have all concentrated on the question of the participation of the civil servant in politics. We on this side of the House would have wished that certain amendments could be introduced to this legislation&#x2014;we introduced these amendments during the Committee Stage&#x2014;before it became law. Although those amendments have not been accepted, I think the air has been cleared considerably in the discussion that took place across the floor of this House, and for that reason we will not oppose the Third Reading of this Bill, despite the fact that those amendments have not been accepted.</p>

<p><span class="col_6587-6588" refersTo="page_0361"/>I feel I should analyse just one or two aspects which have now evolved from the debate. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will agree with my assessment of the position as it now exists. Firstly, the Bill we have before us at the Third Reading clears away the ambiguity and uncertainty in the Public Service which arose from the non-enforcement of the present provisions of the law, namely the present prohibition on the membership of political parties by public servants. That has been honoured in the breach both by the public servant and by the heads of government departments. Secondly, I believe that the Bill before us indicates, both from the terms of the Bill and the discussions which have taken place, that whilst public servants may become members of political parties and may participate in the management of those parties, this Bill is not an open sesame to public servants to demonstrate their political affiliations openly and publicly within and without their departments. In other words, these provisions in the Bill still remain. The hon. the Minister was good enough, in the Committee Stage to refer to one of the provisions of an amendment moved by the hon. member for Von Brandis. There is an existing provision in the law as it stands which prohibits actions which would injure the reputation and standing of the Public Service. Many a senior public servant believes that open, public manifestation of political affiliations, one way or the other, would be such an act so far as the Public Service is concerned. Here, particularly, I believe that the question of the dividing line between the public and private activities of the public servant with regard to his political affiliation is essential and is determined by the maintenance of an impartiality of public servants towards the public they serve and especially towards their fellow civil servants with whom they work, who should neither be penalized nor be in a more favourable position, be they juniors of the officer concerned, because of their political affiliation. No public servant should feel that his position is detrimentally affected nor that he is likely to receive promotion merely because of his political affiliation. I think that that is an essential requirement for a harmonious Public Service.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House, and I am sure that all hon. members in this House, have every confidence that these standards, which are necessary with this innovation, the permission of overt membership of political parties, will be maintained by the overwhelming majority of public servants. I believe that the public servants themselves, through their own organizations and by exercising their own discipline, will react and react unfavourably where a public servant transgresses the spirit and the letter of this Bill by letting the enthusiasm for his political convictions exceed his discretion as to where he expresses that enthusiasm and where he co-operates. The hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister indicated to me at the Second Reading that they did not feel that it was the responsibility or the Government to take steps with a view to codifying in some way what political activities can be undertaken not only within the Public Service as defined restrictively in the particular Bill before us, but also in the wider sphere of all public servants and of all servants of State departments. The hon. the Deputy Minister indicated that he did not feel that that was an obligation of the Department of the Interior. I would like to utilize this opportunity to make an appeal to the Public Service Association, the Post Office Staff Association and the Railways artisans and staff associations to take the initiative themselves to ensure that there is a uniform attitude and approach throughout the Service. I believe that this would avoid possible misunderstanding when a man is transferred from one department to another who is perhaps not aware of the differences applicable to his political activities. I believe it is an ideal worth striving for. It is an ideal that has been achieved in other countries and I think it is an ideal which would give to the Public Service an added lustre of impartiality, an added lustre of service to the State as a whole, whilst at the same time affording public servants an opportunity of exercising their own democratic rights of belonging to and supporting the political party of their choice.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Green Point raised two points in this Third Reading debate, in the first place the question of the schedule which is being added to the Act, and the way in which it is being done. I assume that the hon. the Deputy Minister who took charge of the Second Reading because I could not be here&#x2014;I am grateful for his doing so&#x2014;has already furnished the reasons for our doing it in that way. At present it is being done by way of proclamation in the <i>Gazette,</i> which does not <span class="col_6589-6590" refersTo="page_0362"/>form part of the Act, and consequently it can very easily escape the attention of the eye because it is from time to time announced by various Government departments. This Third Schedule means that one now has it included in the Act, and that one has to keep it constantly up to date. It will still be done by way of proclamation by the State President in the <i>Gazette,</i> but then it will of course have to be inserted in the Third Schedule so that we will be able to know from time to time what departments are being affected. I want to say to the hon. member at once that as the development in the homelands proceeds, and as we from time to time adopt the resolutions that certain powers may be transferred, and as it becomes necessary for officials to be transferred to homeland governments, more departments will be added.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The same situation will probably apply there. The two departments which he mentioned, namely the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Justice will of course receive the necessary attention when the time for that is ripe.</p>

<p>In regard to the political rights I want to say at once that officials are now being granted the right, and the hon. member gave credit for this and quite rightly so, to exercise their basic political rights, and are now no longer contravening the Public Service Act in that respect. One need no longer connive at their continuing their activities, and pretend that nothing was happening. I think it is also better for the officials themselves. In fact, numerous officials have at times discussed this matter with me personally and have said: &#x201C;We take exception to the fact that when we become members of political parties we are charged with misconduct.&#x201D; We are now affording the public servant the full political civil rights which any citizen of South Africa has and can receive. I feel it is justified and necessary that an official should receive these rights. I want to say immediately that this measure now confers on them the right to do so. However, I have such confidence in our officials that I know that they will use their discretion and that they will not create unnecessary embarrassment and will not take advantage of their position and suddenly get out of hand. I know our officials, and I have the highest regard for them. I know that they will handle this matter with good judgment, and that they will of course not create embarrassment for the Public Service, or anyone else for that matter. On the contrary; there is a very clear provision to the effect that if they take advantage of their position, it will be possible to take steps against them. In the second place, if they really create an embarrassment for the Public Service, through any action whatsoever, or if they use buildings or property belonging to the Public Service for political activities and purposes, they are contravening the provisions of the Act as it reads at present. For that reason I think that we need have no doubts whatsoever in regard to this matter. The hon. member also put a question in regard to their behaviour towards the public. Of course an official is not expected to cram his political convictions down the throat of a member of the public. He is there to serve the public and for that reason the name of this sector is the Public Service&#x2014;it is there to serve the public of South Africa, regardless of to what political party those specific members of the public belong with whom they are dealing. I think we have the highest praise for our officials for their handling of matters of this nature. During all the years I have been here, and previously too, I received no complaints in regard to the handling of the public by officials on a political level. The high standards of objectivity will be retained; I am convinced of that.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of codification, I want to say to the hon. member at once that I do not think it is incumbent on us to codify what we now understand under political rights which they may and may not avail themselves of, and to specify in detail what may and may not be done.</p>

<p>We have furnished the general guide lines, but it varies from one department to another. Some departments are, politically speaking, far more delicate departments than others. Certain departments have this problem and I want to mention an example immediately. I cannot imagine a magistrate of a certain town participating actively and publicly in political <span class="col_6591-6592" refersTo="page_0363"/>matters tonight, and sitting on the bench tomorrow, giving a judgment between two people. That would be politically misinterpreted. But I know that our people have enough experience not to take advantage of their position in this regard. Therefore I want to say to the hon. member at once that the codification as such cannot be done by us. If the public servants wish to do so themselves, it is their affair. But even now I want to admit honestly that I do not hold out much hope of a specific codification system being introduced.</p>

<p>I am grateful that the Opposition supported this measure during the Third Reading stage, although they voted against certain provisions during the Committee Stage. This illustrates to us that we have made quite considerable progress along the political road in South Africa. In conclusion I just wanted to tell the story of the two officials who in 1948 were sitting in the office where they had both worked together for many years. When the final results were known and it was realized that there had been a change in Government, the United Party official asked the National Party official: &#x201C;and what are you going to do with us U.P. officials&#x003F;&#x201D; The National Party official then said: &#x201C;Man, probably the same you have been doing to us all these years.&#x201D; To which the United Party official replied: &#x201C;Woe is us, under those circumstances.&#x201D; Those were the products of the war years; let us not revive old disputes now. I do not think the Opposition has a very good past history as far as this is concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, I am pleased that the Bill has now been piloted through its final stage and I want to tell the officials on behalf of the House and the Government that we hope, know, believe and trust that they will make full and correct use of these rights and powers which are now being conferred on them and, that no embarrassment is going to be created for us. We do not begrudge them the right as citizens of South Africa also to have political rights.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I indicated during the Second Reading debate, we have no objection to this clause in principle. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister, however, whether it was really necessary to exclude his formal permission for changes in international tariffs. After all, any action by the Postmaster-General should actually imply his formal permission. Was it really necessary to exclude it in this instance&#x003F; About the clause itself, I can say that it is a good thing to see that we in South Africa are adhering, on our side, to the international postal conventions and that we are trying to do our duty in regard to this important international means of communication. It has been said that, with all the troubles, political or otherwise, in this world, there are only three issues of agreement among all the nations of the world. The first one is the Red Cross, the second one the control of light-houses, and the third the control of the postal services between the different nations. I am glad to see that we are doing our duty as a country in regard to this matter. My only problem is whether it is really necessary to exclude the Minister&#x2019;s formal permission as in any case, I take it, he will be responsible for anything that the Postmaster-General does.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is necessary to draw a distinction between the internal and foreign services and to have other provisions apply in the various cases because, in actual fact, we are merely the victims of rates abroad. These are levied without consulting us. We must merely take note of the fact and implement it. That is why it is not necessary to adopt the same procedures in respect of foreign services as in respect of internal services.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we do not have any objection to this clause either. I hope that when the new fines are determined for persons who transmit postal articles without sufficient postage stamps being attached, the hon. the Minister will be long-suffering enough and not make the fines much more than twice the amount levied in the past. The hon. the Minister says he is now also giving effect in legislation to the integrity system which was introduced at some time or other. I think that system has been greeted with general satisfaction <span class="col_6593-6594" refersTo="page_0364"/>and even appreciation by a large percentage of the public. It is applicable when someone accidentally posts a letter without the correct postage and the Post Office then decides&#x2014;I hope I am right now&#x2014;to deliver the letter in any case and then to send the writer a note subsequently stating: &#x201C;We have now delivered the letter. You requested, for example, that the postal article be sent by airmail. We have done so. You have paid too little. Would you now please pay us the correct postage.&#x201D; The last part of this clause makes provision for reading matter for the blind to be transmitted free of charge now. This provision meets with our approval. I think that the hon. member for Umbilo, who has throughout the years shown great interest in this, will also want to say a few words in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are very grateful that this legislation makes provision for the continuation of the concession allowing blind persons to transmit their braille post free of charge. But now there is another cause for concern in these institutions, and that is the question as to whether the concession that existed, i.e. that tape recordings may be transmitted free of charge, will continue to exist. There are three bodies who provide these tape recordings to the blind, i.e. the School for the Blind at Worcester, the South African Library for the Blind and Tape Aid for the Blind in Durban. These bodies furnish a very great service to our blind readers, and for that reason I want to ask the hon. the Minister to clear this matter up for us. I should like to know whether this concession, which did exist, will continue to exist.</p>

<p>If I am also permitted to go further, Sir, I want to point out that individual blind persons also write to each other in braille. They have the concession allowing them to transmit these braille postal articles free of charge. There are several blind persons who correspond with each other by means of tape recordings. I wondered whether the hon. the Minister would consider also granting this concession to those blind people who correspond in this way by means of tape recordings so that they may transmit their tape recordings free of charge.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the hon. member for Worcester in his plea to the hon. the Minister regarding the proposed section 13 (5)(e), which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Reading matter for the blind may be accepted for transmission by post without payment of postage.</block>

<p>It is a fact that there are a number of persons, particularly newly-blinded persons, who find it extremely difficult to master braille. Consequently the only &#x201C;reading matter&#x201D; that is available to them consists of tape recordings. There are societies in Durban such as Tape Aids for the Blind which render a tremendous service to these people. I refer particularly to older persons who have become blind during the latter part of their lives and who find it impossible to learn and to read braille. It would appear that these people might be at a disadvantage, unless the hon. the Minister can give us an indication that his interpretation of &#x201C;reading matter&#x201D;, referred to in this clause, includes matter for those persons who are almost fully and entirely dependent upon tapes. These persons and the tape aid societies correspond with each other by means of tape recordings, and in many instances they have been successful in recording books on tapes. These blind persons have very little in the way of recreation and find it difficult to keep in touch with others; consequently they appreciate this means of communication.</p>

<p>I would also like the hon. the Minister to give us some indication of how this particular concession is to be administered. Reference is made merely to &#x201C;reading matter for the blind&#x201D;, and I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would indicate how he intends to administer this particular concession. Obviously there are persons who are registered as blind persons and who are receiving social benefits. These persons can produce evidence to show that they are classified as blind persons. There is, however, other general reading matter which is transmitted between blind persons, and it will be necessary for them to have clarity in regard to the administration of this particular concession. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to assisting these people. I know that this concession is greatly appreciated by these persons who are so afflicted.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove, I want to give the assurance that as far as this integrity system is concerned, we do not intend to increase the fine. This is working very well. As I have already said on a previous <span class="col_6595-6596" refersTo="page_0365"/>occasion, we have actually achieved 70% success, which is quite encouraging.</p>

<p>In relation to the matter which the hon. members for Worcester and Umbilo raised, I want to inform the House that tape recordings of this nature, which are intended for the blind, can also be transmitted free of charge. These articles qualify fully for that. The tape recordings, or sound recording reading-matter, is, in fact, transmitted free of charge. Because this is so important a matter, affecting so many people, I think it would be a good thing if I quoted, for the sake of the record, the regulations relating to this. These regulations were issued in 1965, and I take it that there are not many people who have them in their possession. Therefore it will be a good thing if they could be brought to people&#x2019;s attention by means of Hansard. Section 10 of the regulations deals with &#x201C;reading-matter for the blind&#x2014;articles accepted for free transmission and conditions&#x201D;. Regulation No. 40 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Letters in writing used by the blind and plates bearing characters of the writing used by the blind may also be sent as literature for the blind. The same applies to sound recordings &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>These sound recordings relate to the matter to which the hon. members for Worcester and Umbilo referred. I continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and the special paper intended solely for the use of the blind, provided they are sent by or addressed to an officially recognized institution for the blind.</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) Literature for the blind shall be forwarded free of charge by surface mail provided that such articles&#x2014;</li></ol>

<ol>

<li>(a) bear on the outside the indication &#x201C;Literature for blind,&#x201D; and the name and address of the sender;</li>

<li>(b) are posted either without a cover or in a cover open at both ends which can easily be removed for the purpose of examination; and</li>

<li>(c) do not exceed seven kg in weight or the maximum dimension prescribed for letters in Schedule A of these regulations.</li>

</ol>

<p>That is the relevant regulation, and from that hon. members can deduce that this facility is, in fact, definitely available to the blind.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F; I should like to know if individual blind people are also getting this concession in respect of the transmission of tape recordings to each other when they are corresponding. There are such groups of blind persons who have tape recordings made and who then send them to their friends. The concession to which the hon. the Minister has just referred, relates to official bodies&#x2014;such as a library&#x2014;which transmit tape recordings, but does this concession also apply to individual blind persons when they correspond with their friends by means of a tape recording&#x003F; Can they also make use of this free transmission&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause and clause 5 are the two clauses on which we on this side of the House have very great reservations. We believe that the repeal of section 16 of the principal Act can lead to interference with the rights of newspapers which have been registered in the past.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I think the hon. member is now speaking to clause 5.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, I am speaking to clause 4, which repeals section 16, and section 16 lays down when a newspaper can be registered, and that section is being repealed here. I know it is very difficult to distinguish between the two clauses and I shall do my best to confine myself to the actual implications of the two different clauses. Clause 4 itself, through the repeal of section 16, seeks to remove the <span class="col_6597-6598" refersTo="page_0366"/>present definition of a newspaper for the purpose of having it registered at the G.P.O. or by the Postmaster-General as a newspaper. It is a special type of definition of a newspaper; it is a special case in which it is used under the present Act. The existing legislation, as the hon. the Minister explained at the Second Reading, gave newspapers the right to very low postage tariffs as a service to society on account of the importance of newspapers to the public. Sir, we agreed in the past to this principle, which is now being removed to a certain extent by the deletion of section 16. Let us first of all see what this section says so that we can realize what we are now being asked to repeal. This section says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any publication consisting, wholly or in great part, of political or other news or of articles relating thereto or to other current topics shall be deemed to be a newspaper &#x2026;,</block>

<p>if it appears at intervals of less than a month and if it contains a date and all that sort of thing. This is a special definition of a newspaper, and if a newspaper or a publication complies with this definition then it is entitled to special postal rates. A newspaper which felt aggrieved because these special postal rates were withheld from it could always rely on section 16 and say, &#x201C;This is the definition of a newspaper in the law; we fall within it.&#x201D; Sir, we must realize that this definition is a wide one. It does not only affect the daily Press. It affects weeklies and periodicals and, for instance, church publications.</p>

<p>*It affects publications of cultural interest and all kinds of publications and papers, as long as they appear once per month or more frequently. It is therefore an arbitrary definition of a newspaper which includes a great number of periodicals, and this arbitrary definition, which we now want to repeal, has been a protection not only to newspapers, but also to all those other papers.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, the second part of the definition of a newspaper which is now to be repealed is this: Any publication consisting of matter similar to that of a newspaper but which is also printed on sheets or pieces of paper and which is contained in the newspaper, can be deemed to be a supplement to a newspaper, and as such that supplement can enjoy the same facility of lower postal tariffs as the newspaper itself. In other words, a newspaper containing a supplement could rely on this section and say: &#x201C;Here is the definition of a newspaper; this is our protection; we need not actually be newspapers; we can be periodicals or broadsheets or anything of that nature, as long as we fall within this particular definition of a newspaper.&#x201D; Now, Sir, the danger is that if we repeal this particular section, then something else has to be substituted, for it. Just in passing, Sir, we know that in the next clause the hon. the Minister will be given arbitrary powers to define what a newspaper is. My objection is that section 16, which is safeguarding the interests of newspapers at the moment, is being repealed. I regard this as a totally unsatisfactory position.</p>

<p>Sir, apart from newspapers, there have been dozens and dozens of small publications which have been relying on this safeguard which is now to be removed without their knowing what the hon. the Minister is going to put in its place; but I shall deal with that when we come to the next clause. I say, therefore, that this is not only a case of what the Newspaper Press Union thinks. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has had any representations from the Newspaper Press Union about this. To me this is a factor which does affect the freedom of the Press. The Newspaper Press Union probably has a stronger Lobby in Parliament than any other organization, and I am rather surprised at the rather cavalier way in which this Lobby has treated what might be a serious infringement of their rights. However, I merely mention that in passing. We have had representations from smaller periodicals who are concerned about what might happen to them should this particular safeguard that they have at present be removed. I feel very seriously about this, and so do we all on this side of the House. We feel that it might give the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs powers with regard to censorship and powers with regard to restricting the freedom of speech indirectly, which could be misused by him, where we already have so many provisions in our laws of a similar nature which, as the hon. the Minister knows, we on this side of the House disapprove of most strongly.</p>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>The effect of section 16 of the Act, as it reads at present, is that a definition is being given of that papers can be registered as newspapers. <span class="col_6599-6600" refersTo="page_0367"/>The only real purpose of that is to give them this important special rate. We realize that this is a very important privilege, not so much for the dailies as for certain magazines, weeklies and monthlies, which would run aground if they did not have this special rate. Therefore we believe this to be an extremely important clause. But this side of the House can quite see that there are or were malpractices in connection with this matter and that certain people, for example, despatched articles which were nothing but mere advertisements, without any newsworthiness, and that they sent these as newspapers or as supplements to a newspaper which qualified for the same low rate. One can find no fault with the fact that the hon. the Minister wants to ensure that this type of malpractice does not take place, and therefore wants to change the definition. But because the provision in section 16 is so important a provision, and in particular because it also affects the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket in the sense that the Post Office is transporting this material at so low a rate that it must obviously influence the economic structure of the Post Office as such, there is also that interest which we must look after, and not only that of the magazines. We must also look after the interests of the Post Office as such, as see how the definition would affect the whole matter and how many are dispatched. It appears, according to the annual report of the Post Office, that the Post Office is transporting less and less of this type of post annually. One wonders whether it is uneconomical or whether people are no longer interested. But for that reason we prefer that definition to remain in the Act. If it has to be changed, let the Act be changed so that this extremely important matter can be discussed in this House and so that we may know to what purpose each change in the definition is being affected. At present this is being done by regulation, which means that, from the nature of the case, we are of course not entitled to discuss it before it is put into operation, but, in actual fact, only after it comes into effect. Therefore our basic disagreement is not that we necessarily want the definition to remain exactly as it is. We can find no fault with the fact that the hon. the Minister wants to change the definition to prevent malpractices. But we prefer the definition to remain in the Act and not to be changed periodically by way of regulation, because we believe it is an important privilege and that this House should discuss it before it is introduced.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>The deletion of this provision is, of course, necessary because the next section replaces it, and the reason why this definition is being deleted in the Act is because it is too wide. The hon. member for Orange Grove has elaborated on that very fluently and said that it is a wide definition and that it offers protection for so many abuses that we simply cannot close our eves to this any longer. You know, Sir, this concession the Post Office makes to newspapers for their transmission at lower rates than printed matter, is a valuable one. Yesterday I mentioned the example of it costing one cent for the transmission of a newspaper weighing up to 500 grammes. The Sunday newspapers fall into that class. But printed matter of 500 grammes costs six cents. From that can be deduced how great a concession is being made to newspapers by virtue of the fact that they are being allowed to be transmitted at this low rate. This works out to an annual loss for the Post Office of the tremendous amount of R3,5 million as a result of this concession to newspapers. If we had had that R3,5 million, the Post Office&#x2019;s deficit over the past year would have been considerably less. This is a very big concession which the Post Office is making by virtue of having lost R3,5 million over the past year in order to have newspapers, such as dailies and Sunday newspapers, transmitted more cheaply. I therefore think that the Post Office has every right to ensure that this concession is used as it was intended to be used. Since we now have ample proof of the abuse of this wide definition which hon. members are so eager to retain, that this definition, which is so wide that one could turn a wagon and a span of oxen within its limits, lends itself to abuses, I fear that we cannot retain it any longer. Unfortunately one must constantly have legislation passed to curtail people who abuse a concession. That is what we are trying to do in this case. For that reason I fear that I cannot but have this wide definition deleted and have it substituted by the provision appearing in the following clause.</p>

<p>Something of that nature would be too inflexible in the light of the tendencies we constantly detect in people to use every loophole that appears. It is very clear that loopholes were found in this definition, and it is now being abused. We cannot handle this situation by way of a definition. However, the hon. member need not fear that we shall not handle this matter with the necessary goodwill. If the Post Office loses R3,5 million per year as a result of a service, it is surely proof of its goodwill towards the newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister argues that the deletion of section 16 is necessary because of the misuse of the definition of &#x201C;newspaper&#x201D;. He says it is being replaced by the new clause 5. I do not think the hon. the Minister can argue that, because clause 5 is singularly lacking in a definition. However, we shall deal with that when we come to it. If there have been abuses of the provisions of section 16, then why does the hon. the Minister not simply amend section 16(3). Section 16(3) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The regulations may modify the provisions of this section so far as they apply to a supplement which consists wholly of engravings, prints, lithographs or other pictures illustrative of articles in the newspaper.</block>

<p>It was not necessary to delete the entire definition of a &#x201C;newspaper&#x201D;; just a simple amendment to section 16(3) would have done it. Newspapers are not going to have any protection at all if section 16 is repealed as clause 4 of the Bill seeks to do. We ask ourselves if clause 4 is accepted, what protection will any newspaper have. I do not want to anticipate arguments that we are going to advance when we discuss the next clause, but it is quite clear that newspapers and other periodicals will be placed in an impossible position. How are they going to find out whether they comply with Post Office regulations or not&#x003F; The hon. the Minister was wrong, when he said that clause 5 of the Bill was going to do precisely this. This is not the case. We believe that it is absolutely essential that some defence should be accorded newspapers and other publications. Even assuming that there have been abuses, is that good enough reason to delete all definitions of newspapers&#x003F; Surely not. Surely that will simply call for wider provisions and for regulations to be made, regulations that would appear in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and regulations that would be seen by the publishers. We can concede that it is probable that there have been abuses, but that is no reason to strip away all the defences that publications have. I believe that the hon. the Minister should look at this again and that he should try to ascertain in all seriousness whether he is doing the right thing by removing entirely any definition of a newspaper and in effect leaving it merely to the discretion of the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Kensington made the statement that clause 5 of the Bill which is at present before us, gives no definition of a newspaper or a publication appearing in section 16 of the present Act, Act No. 44 of 1958. Section 16 of the principal Act is being repealed by clause 4 of the Bill. I now want to put a question to the hon. member. If one reads section 16 of the principal Act, it gives no definition of what a newspaper or a publication is. Section 16 only provides&#x2014;and I raised this during the Second Reading debate of this Bill&#x2014; what newspapers and publications relate to this article. No definition is supplied concerning what the nature of the content of that specific publication must be. That is why I am saying that section 16 of the principal Act gives no definition of a newspaper or a publication. In clause 5 of the Bill, which is replacing section 17 of the principal Act, it is clearly stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Postmaster-General may &#x2026; any publication which complies with the prescribed requirements &#x2026;</block>

<p>I now want to ask hon. members this question: What are the prescribed requirements which must be met&#x003F; If hon. members look, in Act 44 of 1958, at the definition of a &#x201C;provision&#x201D;, they would see that it generally refers to a provision in terms of the Act or in terms of a regulation which is made and which is related to the content of the Act. When reference is made to prescribed requirements which must be met, this refers to the regulations made by the Postmaster-General and published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<p>While the old legislation refers only to a publication or a newspaper, without qualifying what the content of a newspaper or publication must generally or specifically <span class="col_6603-6604" refersTo="page_0369"/>be, we cannot argue in this House about its offering a definition in the particular section of the principal Act. I put it to hon. members that clause 5 meets the requirements in the same way as section 16 did in the old Act. For that reason I cannot understand why the Opposition wants to retain section 16 of the old Act, since it gives no clear definition. I have a very strong suspicion that the hon. gentlemen do not want the Postmaster-General to have that discretionary power to register a newspaper when it is placed before him for registration. So it would appear to me if I am to make deductions in respect of the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude. The acceptance of clause 5 &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, since the Opposition is now criticizing the implementation of this concession, I wish to quote to them an old Boer adage for their consideration: One does not look a gift horse in the mouth. We are giving this concession to the newspapers of South Africa and it is costing us, as I have told hon. members, R3,5 million per year. That is a colossal concession if we take into consideration what it costs an institution like the Post Office, which is a business undertaking that must ensure that its accounts tally. What has now occurred, alas, is that there are some of these newspaper companies, now receiving this concession, who are going beyond the intention of this definition and of this legislation and who stuff those newspapers of theirs full of a lot of advertising material which would otherwise have had to be sent at the higher printing material rate.</p>

<p>While the Post Office would therefore have been able to obtain a great deal more money from that, we do not even get the revenue from that advertising material because the material is rolled into the newspapers and not dispatched separately. This leads to a complete loss as far as the Post Office is concerned, which is unfair. What I really find strange about the Opposition, is that they carry on here a great deal about the protection which the newspapers must receive, but the protection which the Post Office must obtain in this connection they remain completely silent about. Our task in this House is surely to see to it that the newspapers are protected, that the public is protected, but then at least that the Post Office is also protected. The deletion of this measure and its replacement by the next clause is essential to protect the Post Office against people who abuse this R3,5 million concession.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we appreciate the problem the hon. the Minister has. We appreciate too that the Post Office has sustained a considerable loss in affording newspapers this privilege, if you want to call it that, which is something which is really enjoyed not by the newspapers but by the reading public anyway. They are the ones who benefit because they save that much more. We also appreciate the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s point that advertising material which should rightly have been sent at the normal postage rate, might well have been included in newspapers as a supplement.</p>

<p>Where we challenge the hon. the Minister is in the way he is setting out to cure the situation. Does he feel it is right, just because there have been some abuses, to withdraw the protection all publications had&#x003F; We want to know exactly how newspapers are going to be defined and what newspapers will have to comply with. That should all be in the Act. I do not agree with the hon. member for Harrismith when he says that the present clause 16 is not a definition. To me it is a very good definition for the purposes of the Post Office. If anything should have been done, the hon. the Minister should not have wanted <span class="col_6605-6606" refersTo="page_0370"/>to delete section 16. He should rather have amended it as we have already suggested to him. He is going about this in entirely the wrong way. But anyway, we believe that section 16 should remain and it is an attitude we are going to stand by.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to reiterate that we are not withdrawing any concessions. This is not a withdrawal of a concession we have granted to newspapers in South Africa. It is merely that we are seeing to it that we get better machinery in order to implement this concession. We will of course continue with the concession. I think if I were to give notice here today that we will withdraw this concession and that newspapers will in future have to pay the same rates as are applicable to other printed matter, the Opposition and other people in the country would have had reason to object. Then they could have accused me of withdrawing a concession. But this is not a case of withdrawing a concession at all. We are continuing with this concession, but we are merely seeing to it that we have the necessary machinery in order to implement it for the purpose for which it is intended.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister will recall that in my previous turn to speak I already referred to the dilemma of the Post Office. Because it has such an important effect on the Post Office, we feel that that definition, which is going to affect the whole matter, should be in the Act so that it can be discussed here in the House before it is implemented. I want to ask the hon. the Minister this: When he drew up this Bill, he must surely have had an idea, which he must still have, of what the malpractices are which he wants to prevent and eliminate. If he knows what the malpractices are, he must surely have an idea of how he wants to prevent them. Whether he is going to give a definition of a newspaper in the Act, or whether he is going to give it in a regulation, the fact remains he must give a definition.</p>

<p>I can now ask the hon. the Minister whether he has such a definition. Can he make clear to us what his plan is at the moment, what he is going to do when this measure comes into operation, when it is accepted by the House&#x003F; What definition of a newspaper is going to be given&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister were to give us this, it would immediately put a stop to a lot of arguments. If he has already got to the stage of coming before the House with legislation, he must surely have an idea of what he is going to replace the deleted definition with. We would be glad if the hon. the Minister could now tell us what idea he has in respect of a new definition.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member would be able to form a very good idea of the way in which we are going to implement this in future if he sees it against the background of all our conduct in the past. He would then see that our conduct has borne testimony to our goodwill towards the newspapers of South Africa. That is why a change in the procedure, in the machinery, which we are implementing here, is not a cancellation or a deletion of that arrangement. Hon. members therefore have the assurance that we shall continue to offer our newspapers that necessary concession, but at the same time, however, we want to continue taking such action, not by way of a wide definition, but by way of regulations which we can change from time to time if abuses were to occur, that the objects of this legislation are carried out. That is the intention of this provision and the succeeding one.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a moment ago we removed from the Post Office Act the safeguard given to newspapers and other publications that they will be defined as newspapers and given the advantage of special tariffs. Under this particular clause, we are going to discuss what the hon. the Minister wants to substitute for section 16 which we have just repealed. Sir, I am indeed alarmed at the extremely wide powers that the hon. the Minister is demanding for himself in this regard. The important words in the proposed new section 17 read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Postmaster-General may &#x2026; register as a newspaper any publication which complies with the prescribed requirements &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x201C;Any publication which complies with the prescribed requirements&#x201D;&#x2014;that and nothing else. I submit to you, Sir, and to this Committee that this is an extremely wide definition; that it gives the hon. the Minister extremely wide powers. He can now make regulations, and under those regulations he can decide what publications, whether they be newspapers or other printed matter, can be registered as a newspaper and can receive this special concession with regard to postal rates. On the other hand, he can also decide which publications to remove, and it is here that I fear that we may be giving the hon. the Minister powers which amount to a new form of censorship. Sir, let me make one thing clear. The old section already empowered the hon. the Minister to remove from the post any publication which contained indecent or obscene matter. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>In that respect, Sir, I am <i>ad idem</i> with the hon. member for Harrismith; I agree that that provision should be retained, but here we are not amending that provision relating to obscene and undesirable literature. That was contained in the old Act and it is remaining in this Bill and I am not objecting to that. I am only referring to this because the hon. member for Harrismith referred to it during the Second Reading debate. But what I am alluding to are these wide powers which are now being granted to the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to decide which publications can be registered as newspapers. Sir, with this Government&#x2019;s record with regard to publications and censorship, etc., one can use one&#x2019;s imagination, possibly with profit, to prophesy what can happen, no matter how strongly the hon. the Minister may protest that it will not <span class="col_6609-6610" refersTo="page_0372"/>happen. Let me mention a few examples of what could possibly happen. Let us suppose that the hon. the Minister arbitrarily promulgates a regulation to the effect that any publication which has been declared objectionable by the Publications Board in respect of two or more issues during a period of 12 months shall not be entitled to be registered as a newspaper. The Minister is empowered to introduce such a regulation under this particular clause. Sir, that would be a dangerous form of censorship. The hon. the Minister will deny most vehemently that he will do it, but he could, for instance, under these regulations, which will now be under his sole control, say that any publication which is not published in either of the official languages shall not be registered as a newspaper. He will deny that he has any such plans but I ask: &#x201C;Why give him the power by way of regulation to do this sort of thing&#x003F;&#x201D; He might decide arbitrarily that any publication which is published at longer intervals than, say, a fortnight, can no longer be registered in future. At present a publication which appears monthly can be registered as a newspaper, and let me just repeat that it is not an ordinary newspaper that is mentioned here, but any publication. Take <i>Paratus,</i> an excellent publication, which is registered at the Post Office as a newspaper.</p>

<p>*The hon. the Minister may, for instance, exclude a publication such as this one, or other monthlies, from the privileges in the future. Once again he will tell me, No, he is not going to do so; he does not intend working in that direction. But our attitude on this side of the House is not to grant the hon. the Minister such wide powers.</p>

<p>I may just mention in passing that we are also concerned about the words &#x201C;prescribed requirements&#x201D;. We believe that this could be phrased much more effectively by referring to the regulations which have to appear in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> In that regard, the hon. member for Kensington will propose an amendment. What makes me particularly concerned about the powers which we now want to grant the hon. the Minister here, is the speech made by the hon. member for Harrismith. You will recall, Sir, that I said the Minister might have the power now to ban a monthly or a weekly publication such as <i>Scope</i> for certain periods, just because two of its issues might have been banned by Mr. Jannie Kruger&#x2019;s Publications Board. That possibility exists. The Minister will say that he has no such thing in mind, but the hon. member for Harrismith did talk about it. He went so far as to say that the Minister had to have the right to be able to ban a publication such as <i>Scope</i> by way of regulations, and he asked for special norms to be laid down in those regulations. What norms&#x003F; Norms of censorship&#x003F; Norms which he considers to be seemly for a newspaper or for a publication&#x003F; That has never been the idea under the old Act, but now we are granting these most dangerous powers to the hon. the Minister today, and that is what we are taking very strong objection to.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 40, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;shall, by regulation in the <i>Gazette,</i> determine the conditions upon which a publication may be registered as a newspaper, and shall&#x201D;; in line 42, after &#x201C;may&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;so&#x201D;; in line 45, to omit &#x201C;requirements&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;regulations&#x201D;; and in line 46, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;shall&#x201D;.</block>

<p>If one looks at clause 5, which is a replacement for the present section 17, one sees that there has been a complete switch in emphasis here. This bears out what we have already said not only about this clause but also about clause 4. You see, Sir, section 17 says that the Postmaster-General shall cause a register to be kept of publications falling under the requirements of section 16. Those are the definitions which we have just repealed, and then it says that the proprietor, printer or publisher of such publication may on payment of the prescribed fee register the publication as a newspaper. In other words, the Postmaster-General is required to keep a register, because it says that the proprietor, printer or publisher may get registration if he wants it. But what is the position under clause 5 of the Bill&#x003F; It now says that the Postmaster-General &#x201C;may register&#x201D;. There is no protection at all given to the person who wants to register. It says that the Postmaster-General may register on conditions laid down by him. Here is a complete switch about, a complete reversal of the old attitude as we have it in the present Act. However, it goes further than that. Our problem, especially now that the <span class="col_6611-6612" refersTo="page_0373"/>definition clause has been removed from the Act, is to try to find out from the hon. the Minister what exactly is going to be regarded as a newspaper in terms of the Act. We have heard his problems, but we have not heard anything from him to suggest how he is going to meet the problems of newspaper proprietors or publishers. It is all very well for him to say that this will be administered in a fair spirit, but I suggest that a fair spirit is not good enough. What we need and what the newspaper proprietors need is some clear setting out of exactly what is to be regarded as a newspaper and what conditions are going to apply to the registration of such a newspaper. This is precisely what my amendment sets out to do. My amendment seeks to establish that the Postmaster-General must, by regulation in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> determine the conditions upon which a publication may be registered. This is little enough to ask; in other words, a publisher must know what requirements he has to meet. If he has met those requirements, it follows that he should then be entitled to registration. Once he is entitled to registration, he must then have the benefit of the cheaper Post Office rates. This is a logical consequence. It is very difficult to see why it should be otherwise and indeed it is difficult to see how the hon. the Minister can argue otherwise.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise, in the first place, to react to what was said by the hon. member for Orange Grove when he referred to what I had said in a previous speech in regard to the position of the publication <i>Scope.</i> I made it very clear that the point at issue was the contents of that publication, and that if its contents qualified for not being banned, that publication would not be banned.</p>

<p>Then we also have to deal with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington. Before coming to that amendment, however, I want to refer further to the hon. member for Orange Grove, who said that the hon. the Minister was appropriating certain wide powers to himself. That is definitely not the case, for if the hon. the Minister or the Postmaster-General makes any regulations in regard to this matter, such regulations must first meet with the necessary approval of the Postmaster-General, the Minister and the State President. That is the procedure which is being followed. The hon. the Minister acts on behalf of the Government. For that reason the hon. member has no reason to fear that wide powers will be appropriated by the hon. the Minister to himself. The hon. member mentioned another so-called case when he said that the hon. the Minister could make regulations by which a publication or a periodical would be forced to appear in both languages. I do not think that argument needs any further attention, for South Africa is definitely a bilingual country. This Government has been upholding that principle to a greater extent than any United Party Government would ever be able to do. For that reason I say that that is nothing but a specious argument.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington has now moved an amendment to this clause. The suspicion I expressed in a previous speech, now appears to be true. By moving that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in clause 5, which replaces section 17 of the principal Act, be substituted by &#x201C;shall&#x201D;, the hon. member intimated very clearly that the wording of the clause, as it reads at present, confers too wide a discretionary power upon the Postmaster-General. They want the Postmaster-General to be obliged to do this; hence the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. By doing so they have shown that they have some misgivings about the Postmaster-General and the hon. the Minister, and that they think they will not be able to judge when they should take these steps and when they should not. I repeat: My suspicion appears to be true. My suspicion is that the real amendment that has been moved here, is nothing but a motion of no confidence in the Postmaster-General and the hon. the Minister. I hope the hon. the Minister will reject it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Harrismith has really delivered himself now of a specious argument in this House. It is extremely simple to understand what the hon. member for Kensington envisages by the amendment he moved here. The basis of sound legislation is, surely, that there should be security of justice in the country. In order to bring about security of justice, it is essential for the people affected by it to know what the statutory position is. That is what the amendment of the hon. member for Kensington seeks to do. It provides that that definition and those requirements which the Postmaster-General wants to lay down&#x2014;it is entirely within his discretion to lay them down&#x2014;and which are to be met by a publisher or a newspaper <span class="col_6613-6614" refersTo="page_0374"/>before that publication may be registered as a newspaper, shall be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> so that everybody may read them. If that is done, any person who wants a publication to be registered as a newspaper will know that he has to comply with these or those requirements. This is merely done to ensure that those requirements will in fact be published and that the Postmaster-General, in laying down those requirements, will make known what they are. What these requirements are to be, is being left completely to his discretion.</p>

<p>Then we come to the second object of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington. Once the Postmaster-General has exercised his discretion in laying down the requirements for a newspaper, the person whose publication complies with the requirements is entitled to having that publication registered as a newspaper. We must, in other words, not have the position for which the present wording makes provision. In terms of the present wording the Postmaster-General may lay down requirements, and when one complies with the requirements, the Postmaster-General still has a discretion to determine whether or not one may register the publication as a newspaper. We believe, however, that when a person&#x2019;s publication complies with the requirements, the Postmaster-General must register the publication. Then one is entitled to being registered, for then one will have complied with the predetermined requirements. That is the reason why, in terms of the amendment, the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; should be substituted by the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. If that is not done, there will be no security of justice and then it will be possible to discriminate on an improper basis. I am not saying that the Postmaster-General will do this, but I do say that this could happen. Why should we grant him another discretion&#x003F; He already has a discretion to lay down the requirements. The requirements are left completely to his discretion, but if a person complies with those requirements, he is entitled to being registered. Then there is no further discretion that can be exercised. That person should then feel that since he has done his best and has done everything in his power to meet those requirements, he is entitled to being registered. That is the object of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington. I hope with all my heart that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accepting this amendment, for I believe that it can only be to the advantage of the Post Office, the publishers and the general public in South Africa.</p>

<p>That is true; it was contained in the old Act, too. It certainly is nice that we are now reaching such unanimity on the matter! I hope that we shall be able to reach the same degree of unanimity on the next matter. The next matter is in connection with the discretionary power which the Postmaster-General ought to have in order that he may determine in this regard what may be registered and what may not be registered. Since we have already decided that the previous provision should be omitted, this provision must take its place. In other words, it must now be possible to define by regulation what a newspaper is. The hon. member for Kensington wanted to know what a newspaper really was. He said I had not stated clearly what a newspaper was. The obvious thing is, after all, that for the purposes of drafting the regulation the Postmaster-General will use the old definition as a basis. The old definition, as it reads at present, will certainly be regarded as an important starting-point. But in drafting those regulations, the Postmaster-General will definitely have regard to the abuses which occurred and which obliged us to introduce this amendment today. Therefore, this old provision <span class="col_6615-6616" refersTo="page_0375"/>will most definitely apply in the whole formulation of a regulation relating to what is a newspaper and what is not. The advantage of the regulation is that it may be changed from time to time, as circumstances may require. If abuses of the regulation should occur, the Postmaster-General should have the right to change it. He can only do so if it has not been incorporated in the Act and if there is flexibility in respect of this matter. The sole intention here is therefore to give the Postmaster-General more flexibility in order that he may implement the intention of the Act properly. For that reason I fear that I cannot accept these amendments which were moved by the hon. member for Kensington.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should nevertheless like to submit a plea to the hon. the Minister in this regard. No drastic restrictions are being placed on him by this amendment. All we ask in this amendment is that when the hon. the Minister lays down regulations on what will be considered to be a newspaper for these particular purposes, he should publish those regulations in the <i>Government Gazette</i> so that people who wish to apply for a particular newspaper to be registered, may transmit their mail at a lower rate. They should at least know where they will be able to find the regulations. We should just like to have certainty in this regard. Mention is made here of prescribed requirements, but where are they prescribed&#x003F; They are prescribed by the Postmaster-General. But this is not the usual terminology used in legislation; reference is made to regulations in legislation, regulations which will appear in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> That is why we want that assurance from the hon. the Minister. I know that he has the power to make regulations in terms of section 2, 3 or 4 of the principal Act. He has the right to make regulations in regard to things which are now going to appear in the Act, but it is not binding on him to make regulations in this regard.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I regard it as almost incomprehensible that the hon. the Minister does not want to accept a very simple and normal amendment asking him: &#x201C;Now look, you are going to have regulations and you are going to have rules saying what will be regarded as a newspaper in future. Why don&#x2019;t you lay down in the law that those regulations must be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> so that everyone can know what they are&#x003F;&#x201D; Then indeed people will be able to see that his intentions are honourable in this regard and that they are not aimed at certain specific types of newspapers.</p>

<p>*The request we are making here is such a simple one, namely, just publish it in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> What is wrong with that request&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to join the hon. member for Orange Gover in asking the hon. the Minister if he will perhaps reconsider his attitude. We can fully appreciate what he wants to do. He has said that he wants to give the Postmaster-General discretionary powers to determine which publications can be registered in terms of the Post Office Act. Let us go along with this. All that we are asking in this amendment is for the Postmaster-General to tell the public what regulations he is going to formulate and what the public has to comply with. We are not so very far apart; it is only a question of approach. Indeed, I think the hon. member for Harrismith got things entirely wrong when he talked a little while ago about &#x201C;may&#x201D; and &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. If he goes to the present Act he will see that section 17 makes it obligatory for the Postmaster-General to register a publication that complies with the regulations. That is the position at the moment. Section 17(1) states that the Postmaster-General shall cause a register to be kept and that the proprietor, printer or publisher of such a publication may, upon payment of the prescribed fee, register such a publication. In other words, the person is entitled to register it. Where the proposed amendment to section 17 represents a fairly drastic departure is that the Postmaster-General is now given the discretion as to whether or not he must register an individual publication. We suggest that this is wrong. What we want to suggest to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I am sure he will agree with us that this is the right way to go about it&#x2014;is that the regulation should be published in the <i>Gazette.</i> If it is found that these regulations are being circumvented, the regulations can be changed, as long as the public and the publishers know what the regulations are. Then we go to the next stage and say that once a person has complied with the regulations, he is entitled to registration. Once he is entitled to registration, he is entitled to the concessions. It is <span class="col_6617-6618" refersTo="page_0376"/>a simple sequence where the Postmaster-General sets out what he requires, and once these requirements are complied with the people concerned have the benefit of these concessions. It is the simplest thing in the world. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to look again at this to see if he will not accept it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what the hon. members are asking for is going to be done; in other words, these regulations are going to be published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> That is the way we initially had it in our draft Bill; that is the way the Bill read originally. Then the legal draftsmen changed it and defined it the way it is printed here. I have now taken the opinion of the legal draftsmen on this matter, merely so as to have confirmation and to give hon. members the assurance that what they are asking for will happen. The law advisers have confirmed that this term &#x201C;prescribed requirements&#x201D;&#x2014;these are the two words they have been talking about&#x2014; means &#x201C;prescribed by regulation&#x201D;. The regulations will be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> with the approval of the State President. Precisely what the hon. members are asking for now, is therefore going to happen. The definition of those terms, as set out in the regulation, will be published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and this will be effected under the provision in which the expression &#x201C;prescribed requirements&#x201D; is found in this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad we have come this far with the hon. the Minister but we are still worried about the wording of clause 5. In the first place, although the new section 17(1) refers to &#x201C;prescribed requirements&#x201D;, and it has now been said that it will appear in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> there is nothing in the Bill demanding it. By our amendment we are only seeking to ensure that the new Post Office Act lays down in law a procedure to be followed, which I believe is reasonable. I hesitate to say that we do not appreciate what the hon. the Minister has said, and we do believe that these requirements will be gazetted. But we still feel that this Post Office Act must set out very clearly what the law says and what the entitlements of people are.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just explain our standpoint to the hon. the Minister&#x003F; We are pleased that the Minister and the Postmaster-General intend having these regulations published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> etc. But our further objection still stands, namely that this is merely a permissive power which he will have. He may do it, and we feel rather strongly that it should be laid down that he must do it under all circumstances. For that reason we have decided that the amendment will still be put.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 6 contains the same provisions in regard to foreign periodicals and newspapers as did section 16 in regard to local newspapers, but as section 16 has been repealed, section 18 of the original Act has virtually no meaning and is therefore suspended in mid-air, and therefore we cannot object to the repeal of section 18, but our objections in general to the principle still hold good.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this particular clause empowers the Postmaster-General that any postal article which in his opinion is of little value or importance can be destroyed or disposed of in some or other manner. Now this goes a little further in regard to the definition of the type of article that can be opened and can be considered, etc., by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. In the past there was a provision in section 25 that any postal article could be sent to the returned letter office and be dealt with in the manner prescribed provided that any article which bears on the outside the name and address of the sender may on application be returned to him or delivered to him directly. It does seem to me that this is going a little further than in the past, where the hon. the Minister will now in terms of this clause be able actually to read the correspondence which has been opened at the returned letter office. In the past, if a letter came to the returned letter office and if it had the address of the sender at the back, the letter would be sent to the person who sent the letter at that particular address and if there was any money in it, they would try to find out how they could get that money returned, but the contents of that letter itself were the basic criterion. However, now the hon. Minister can decide whether a letter is of value or whether it is not of value. That means that he can now really thoroughly read every word in that letter, and I do not like this provision. I would like to have the assurance from the hon. the Minister that this will not give further rights to the Post Office to peruse private correspondence.</p>

<p>Clause 16:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in terms of clause 16 the hon. the Minister now takes the power to declare the unauthorized use of the words &#x201C;Post Office&#x201D;, &#x201C;mail&#x201D;, &#x201C;yellow pages&#x201D;, &#x201C;directory&#x201D;, &#x201C;telex directory&#x201D; and &#x201C;telephone directory&#x201D; to be an offence. We agree with the basic principle contained in this provision. It is not right that any body or person, any independent company, etc., should be able to abuse Government facilities by giving out <span class="col_6621-6622" refersTo="page_0378"/>that that particular printed matter or book or directory published by him is actually semi-official, or that it should seem to be semi-official. Of course, this is absolutely wrong and we do not want this to happen. But there may in fact be cases where one may find an address book containing telephone numbers or some kind of directory and where the main object of that address book or directory is not to give out that it does in fact seek to infringe the rights of the Post Office and that it is an imitation of something published by the Post Office. Here, too, we just want the hon. the Minister to assure us once again that he will act cautiously in this case. We agree that he should in fact be given the right to see to it that the rights of the Post Office are not abused. However, one finds that publications which do in fact contain addresses and telephone numbers are often published, and we just want to have the assurance that they will not be punished under this particular clause.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I merely rise to ask why a provision affecting divisional councils has been inserted whilst such a provision does not apply to provincial councils as well. Is there any specific reason for having done it in this way&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this provision is being included because we already have a similar provision which applies to provincial councils. In the Cape Province the divisional councils are in many respects doing the work of a provincial council, and that is why we felt that this provision had to be inserted in order that divisional councils might be granted the same rights which provincial councils have.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal with the definition of &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D;. In terms of the definition in the Bill a &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D; means, <i>inter alia,</i> a company which directly or indirectly has power enabling it to control another company. What is worrying me in this definition is the use of the word &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;, because of the difficulty of interpreting and circumscribing what is meant by that word. The word &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; is also used in the definition of a &#x201C;controlled company&#x201D; and I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 15 and 19, page 4, to omit &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;through or together with a controlled or subsidiary or sub-subsidiary company&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I believe that if those words were included in the Bill, there can be no doubt whatsoever as to the manner in which the control should be exercised. The Bill would then contain in the definition of &#x201C;controlled company&#x201D; as well as in the definition of &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D; the provision that the control should be exercised directly or in the manner specified in my amendment. The word &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; is used frequently in this Bill. During the Second Reading I mentioned the fact that there would be the problem of interpretation. I believe that where we can eliminate the very problem of interpretation it is desirable to do so. This is one of the instances and that is why I have moved my amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I support the hon. member for Green Point in his amendment. We discussed this matter at the Second Reading at some length. We are all perturbed at the use of the word &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; because its connotation is really not known to anybody. I think it would improve the Bill considerably if this amendment were accepted.</p>

<p>I want to pass on and move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6623-6624" refersTo="page_0379"/>In lines 22, page 6, and 26 and 33, page 8, respectively, after &#x201C;issued&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;equity&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I believe that here a fundamental issue is involved. It deals with the definition of &#x201C;holding company&#x201D;, &#x201C;subsidiary company&#x201D; and &#x201C;wholly owned subsidiary&#x201D;. A holding company is defined as a company which has 30% of the issued shares of another company, a subsidiary company as a company 30% of the shares of which are held by a holding company and a wholly owned subsidiary as a company where all the shares of the subsidiary are held by the holding company. I admit that the commission&#x2019;s report deals with the provisions for issued shares and not equity shares. The commission supports the use of the issued shares and not the equity shares. The hon. the Minister dealt with this matter in the Second Reading debate. I must say that every single representation that has been made to us and I make bold to say that every single representation that has been made to the hon, the Minister, every article that has appeared by a financial editor and every article that has appeared in any financial newspaper queried the use of issued shares and not equity capital. This is the case because &#x201C;issued share&#x201D; in the actual operation of a business is a meaningless phrase. Where you have a company with a large preferent capital, the ordinary shareholder and those responsible for the running of the company are absolutely unconcerned with that preferent capital as long as the preferent dividend is paid and the preferent share has no vote. Preferent shareholders are not really a factor in the administration of a holding company, a subsidiary company or a wholly owned subsidiary in the commercial sense of the term. While it is perfectly true that the commission dealt with the pros and cons of the matter and that it came to the conclusion that we should not deal with equities but with shares, I say with all respect that I think they were wrong in this case. I believe that the practical application of these three types of companies depends on the power to control. You do not have that power to control when you include all the different classes of shares. For that reason I have moved this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (c) of the definition of &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D;. I would like to ask him whether these two sub-paragraphs are in any way explanatory of the term &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;. I am not terribly sure whether they are or are not, although it could well be so. The objective of the amendment is to try to define a little more clearly what &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; could possibly mean, because it might mean a considerable host of powers and in perusing particularly paragraph (c) (ii), which is rather involved, but also paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition, one wonders whether they are indirectly or merely, <i>inter alia,</i> part of the powers which enable the term &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D; to be applied to a company holding these powers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it would be unwise if we were to accept these two amendments at this stage. I think that these amendments are ones which one would prefer to refer to the advisory committee for consideration in the light of the discussion which has taken place here. In the first instance I want to refer to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point. We are talking here about &#x201C;directly&#x201D; and &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;. What he seeks to do here, is to give a definition of &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;. He does this by saying that the words &#x201C;through or together with a controlled or subsidiary or sub-subsidiary company&#x201D; should be substituted for that word. I presume that a sub-subsidiary company is a subsidiary of a subsidiary. It could not really be anything else. I want to say that the definition which he has tried to give of &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; is probably as close as it could be to what I think it should be. My problem at this stage is that as soon as one mentions certain things in an attempt to define something, then that means that everything which one does not mention, is excluded; it is therefore quite possible that the intention was, and that it is desirable that the intention must be that the term &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; should include also other matters or interests which would be excluded by the definition of the hon. member for Green Point, and since I am of the opinion that it is desirable to consider whether there should be a definition of &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D;, I think that it would be unwise to do so now in this way and that we should rather leave the term &#x201C;indirectly&#x201D; as it is.</p>

<p>I want to say at this stage that I am <span class="col_6625-6626" refersTo="page_0380"/>going to accept several of the proposed amendments but there are also some, such as this one, in regard to which I think it would be wiser to refer it to the advisory committee. The hon. member&#x2019;s amendment relates to &#x201C;equity shares&#x201D;. He wants equity shares to be inserted where we mention &#x201C;issued shares&#x201D; only. I think that the hon. member&#x2019;s approach in regard to this consideration differs substantially from the approach of the commission. The commission&#x2019;s approach in regard to this &#x201C;controlling company&#x201D; has regard to financial interests. It deals with financial interests and not actual control through shareholdings. I therefore think that it would be wrong to insert &#x201C;equity shares&#x201D; here, when this should be related to financial interest and not to the right to vote which one obtains through the shares in question. In reply to the Second Reading debate yesterday I referred here to the commission&#x2019;s attitude as set out on page 114 of the commission&#x2019;s report. I do not want to repeat that here, but it is very clear that the commission had financial interest in mind. Since financial interest is not only related to equity shares, it would therefore, according to the argument of the commission, be wrong to make it equity shares. They therefore kept themselves to issued shares and I think that for the present we should rather leave it at that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I welcome the Minister&#x2019;s suggestion so far as my amendment is concerned, namely that this matter should go to the advisory committee. I think it is a reasonable suggestion on his part and on the basis that that will be done I want to withdraw my amendment with the leave of the Committee.</p>

<p>When one comes to the other amendment, the one moved by the hon. member for Parktown, one sees that it is in an entirely different category. What is a holding of preferent shares&#x003F; A holding of preferent shares is a fixed investment at a fixed rate of interest by the person who invests in those preferent shares. That person has no say in the management of the company. It might well be that a company holds 50% of the total issue of shares of a company while at the same time it has no say whatsoever in the management of that company. One can imagine this with property companies, for example, where there might well be the existence of a substantial preferent share issue which is taken up by an investment company purely as an investment with a fixed rate of interest attached to those preference shares and as long as that interest is paid they are not concerned with the running of that company. A preferent share may in fact be a secured and not merely an ordinary unsecured preferent share. It could be well-secured by means of mortgage. Because of that holding and because of that investment the company that owns such a holding of preferent shares equalling 50% or more of the total nominal value of the share issue of that company, must then go through all the procedures of being a controlling company, although that has nothing to do with the company. It does not have a director on the board of that company, it has no say in the management of that company, but it must then go through the obligations of a controlling company, consolidate the accounts and attend to all those matters which flow from being a controlling company. For that reason I believe that the amendment of the hon. member for Parktown is a very important one. It is a very important one and if this Bill is promulgated in the form this clause is now I am sure there will be a large number of companies which will suddenly find that they will have to consolidate into their own accounts companies in which they merely have a fixed investment by way of a preferent shareholding. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will consider again the amendment of the hon. member for Parktown.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to quote again the small piece I read out yesterday, regarding the attitude of the commission in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In terms of our approach the decisive factor is the extent of the financial interest whether it consists of ordinary shares or preference shares or both. In other words, we have in mind expressing the financial interest as a percentage of the issued capital of the second company.</block>

<p>If this is the approach, one cannot limit oneself to equity shares but must take issued shares into account so as to tie up with the matter of financial interest.

<p>This amendment would appear to me to correct a fault in the Bill which, as I said at the Second Reading, provides in the next clause for the setting up of a standing advisory committee. In this clause this standing advisory committee is ignored. In terms of this clause, the State President may, by proclamation in the <i>Gazette,</i> from time to time amend or add to the provisions of the schedules to this Act. Sir, the schedules to this Act are amongst the most important provisions of the Bill. They are schedules which are going to cause a great deal of trouble to a great number of people. It would seem to us that there should be no amendments introduced haphazardly, by the decision of whom I do not quite know, because the State President acts on the advice, I presume, of the Minister. So the Minister will decide what the changes should be. Sir, what is the purpose of this standing advisory committee&#x003F; Surely the standing advisory committee is a body that should consider any changes to Table A, Table B and the third and the fourth schedules. The fourth schedule, for example, which deals with the accounting provision of the Bill, the annual report, and so on, is a vital schedule, and one would think that there will be no amendment to this schedule unless it has been recommended by the standing advisory committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment. If one takes its interpretation far enough, it amounts to this advisory committee eventually having to take over our work, because the hon. member wants all that is provided for in clause 17 to be done only on the recommendation of the advisory committee. In other words, if the advisory committee should not recommend it, it could not be done. I think this would destroy completely the object aimed at in this clause. The hon. member&#x2019;s amendment expressly provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the recommendation of the standing advisory committee referred to in section 18.</block>

<p>In other words, nothing could be done without the recommendation of the advisory committee. I really cannot accept the amendment. The advisory committee is being established to investigate matters referred to it in connection with the Companies Act and to make recommendations in this regard. After all, the recommendations made by them are referred to the responsible Minister, who then, by virtue of his position as Minister of Economic Affairs, has to take decisions to implement the recommendations of the advisory committee. We can most certainly not be prevented from taking steps that have not been recommended by the advisory committee. Consequently I do not think that I can accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 18:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this important standing committee, which is being appointed under this Bill, lies somewhere in status, I would say, between a commission such as the Law Revision Commission and a departmental or interdepartmental advisory committee. The chairman <span class="col_6629-6630" refersTo="page_0382"/>is to be a judge or a senior advocate. As the hon. the Minister has indicated, it is to consist of representatives of organized industry, such as the Federated Chamber of Industries, and of representatives of organized commerce and of the Stock Exchange, and it will also have on it senior State officials who are involved in the administration of the Companies Act. Then, Sir, it is to have a subcommittee dealing with Stock Exchange matters and it can appoint other subcommittees. It seems important to us that the recommendations of such a committee, not being in the position of a departmental or interdepartmental committee, should be submitted to Parliament; that Parliament should be entitled to know what has been undertaken by that committee, what its recommendations are and the motivation for any recommendation that it makes. I therefore wish to move the amendment as printed in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following subsections at the end of the Clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(7) The standing advisory committee shall annually not later than the first day of March submit to the Minister a report on all its activities during the previous year.</li>

<li>(8) The report referred to in subsection (7) shall be laid upon the Table in the Senate and the House of Assembly within fourteen days after it was submitted to the Minister, if Parliament is then in session, or, if Parliament is not then in session, within fourteen days after the commencement of its next ensuing session.</li>

</ol>

<p>Sir, I do not think that this is an unreasonable request. If there are to be changes in legislation, then it is as well that the whole country should be advised by way of reports from this committee as to why these changes are recommended, and since this committee will be representative of a wide spectrum of our economic life in the Republic, I think the public should also be entitled to be advised why the Minister has not followed the advice of that advisory committee if such an occasion should arise. For those reasons I move the amendments which appear in my name on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>Sir, while we are now dealing with clause 18, may I just say that I gave an indication to the House yesterday of the bodies that should in my opinion be represented on this advisory committee. I did not mention the Federated Chamber of Industries on that occasion, and I have already had the reaction to that. Sir, it was an error, and I just want to tell this Committee, while this clause is under discussion, that the Federated Chamber of Industries should also be represented on this advisory committee.</p>

<p>Sir, I think the hon. member for Green Point is going a little too far when he refers to what is envisaged with this advisory committee. After all, it is purely an advisory committee. I think that if he investigates the reports that are tabled here, he will come to the conclusion that there is not really a similar body, that I can think of, the report of which is tabled. It is true that there are many boards with administrative duties which report on their activities during the year in a report that is tabled here, but they are not advisory committees like this proposed advisory committee. Sir, I should like to draw the hon. member&#x2019;s attention to clause 11. Clause 11 provides for an annual report by the Registrar and then it provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Registrar shall in every calendar year submit to the Minister a report containing such information concerning the registration of companies of each type, their authorized capital or numbers of shares &#x2026; and all other matters as the Minister may direct; and the Minister shall table the report in the Senate and the House of Assembly.</block>

<p>In other words, the Registrar submits a report to the Minister, which is then tabled and in which we shall obviously refer to recommendations and activities of this advisory committee as well. I honestly think that this annual report can and will meet the needs envisaged by the hon. member for Green Point, and then it will not be necessary for the advisory committee itself to table an annual report through me.</p>

<p>I accept what the hon. the Minister has said and I assume that he will use section 11 for purposes of seeing that the activities of this committee are reported to the House. But the position which I think is not met is that a report <span class="col_6631-6632" refersTo="page_0383"/>can come from this advisory committee to the Minister, who is for the time being in charge of this particular portfolio, and can be pigeon-holed. The public would know nothing about it and the members who have served on that committee and have given of their time&#x2014;and they are busy people, businessmen and industrialists &#x2014;would like to know that what they do report on and their findings will see the light of day and will be made available to the House. That is not obligatory under the Constitution at present. I believe that is wrong. The wording I have used here was taken from the Law Commission Bill which we passed this session and which provides that it must report its activities and that its report must be laid on the Table. While I concede that this particular advisory committee has not been constituted by special legislation, as the Law Revision Commission was, it has a status very much the same. It has the same basis of persons directly involved in the effect of our company laws, and these persons have to work in high positions and important positions dealing with our company laws and they express community interests, with the interests of the different departments of commerce and industry. These recommendations and their deliberations I believe should be tabled in Parliament. The Minister has said that he feels it is covered by section 11, but we would like to see that it is made an obligatory duty.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the amendment of the hon. member for Green Point for two reasons. First of all, this is a very important committee. It may be only an advisory committee, but it is a standing committee and it is under the chairmanship of a judge. This indicates immediately how important this committee is regarded in terms of this Bill. It is not very often that we appoint committees where you are able to get a judge as the chairman, or a senior advocate. That is Point No. 1. But Point No. 2 is that I think the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reference to section 11 is exactly the opposite to what he tells us, because section 11 provides for a statistical report by the Registrar of Companies, in regard to the number of companies registered, their authorized capital, the number of shares, the number of windings up, the number under judicial management, etc. It is a typical departmental report giving statistical information. If I were the Minister I would say that my obligation here is to see that statistics referring to companies are placed before the House. But it does not link up with the type of report one would expect to get in terms of section 18, and I think it is absolutely essential that this report should be tabled, because the hon. member for Green Point hit the nail on the head when he said it is not only the legislation that is brought to the House that the House should know about; what is more important is the legislation recommended by the advisory committee which the Government in its wisdom decides not to proceed with. We have had numerous cases in this House where the recommendations of commissions have not been accepted by the Government. We have pressed them year after year sometimes, until finally some of the recommendations are put into effect. I think it would be in the interest of the smooth working of this Act if that report of the committee were placed before the House.</p>

<p>While one should like to have the activities of the advisory committee brought to the notice of the House, it seems to me that the amendment of the hon. member does not take into account the provisions of clause 18(6). This reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Registrar shall be responsible for the administration of the standing advisory committee and the standing sub-committees.</block>

<p>Since this is an important function of the Registrar, one would have expected a provision dealing with the activities of the standing committee to be included under clause 11, which the committee has already dealt with. So I wonder whether we could not ask the hon. the Minister to consider providing in clause 11 that when the Registrar reports in terms of clause 18, he shall also report in full on the activities of the advisory committee. Provision can also be made under clause 11 for the matter mentioned by the hon. member for Parktown.</p>

<p>If I may reply to the question of the hon. member for Green Point, I want to point out that this would amount to a duplication of activities. <span class="col_6633-6634" refersTo="page_0384"/>The administrative official is none other than the Registrar, and for that reason it would be desirable if a co-ordination of activities could be obtained. Since there is already an obligation to report on all activities, I cannot see why this one facet of the activities should be singled out to be brought directly to the notice of Parliament. So it seems to me as if this should really fall under clause 11.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is quite an interesting suggestion which the hon. member for Bloemfontein West has made, but I do not know whether it necessarily complies with what we have asked. It should be borne in mind that this is an extremely important committee. We have precedents in our legislation and in our general governmental administration of other advisory committees to various departments. As the hon. the Minister has said, the commission of inquiry recommended the appointment of such a committee. The appointment of such a committee has not only been welcomed in parliamentary circles, but also in outside circles as a most important contribution on this most vital and important subject which plays such a great part in the whole of the economic life of the country. In other legislation establishing advisory committees provision is made that their reports should be laid upon the Table of the House. An example which is almost comparable is that of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council whereon a report is issued annually to the House. Comment is made on it by the Prime Minister. It is an important contributing factor in discussions of the finance and economic affairs of the country. I do not think that that council was established by means of legislation, but it is indicative of the value of this type of advisory committee to the workings of Parliament.</p>

<p>In this case we have a much more important aspect and that is that it deals with legislation which grows with the times and which undergoes changes with changing conditions. In Britain they have a standing committee on their Companies Act. I think the Lord Cohen Committee existed for years and there was also the Jenkins Committee. Such committees are constantly supervising the development of company life in Britain and reports are constantly tabled. We do not want to differ with the hon. the Minister in the sense that we want him to be bound completely by the recommendations in these reports, but we do feel that this would be a very important contribution in this particular matter. That is why we ask the hon. the Minister that this report should be tabled. We are not looking for opportunities to impose further obligations, but we should like him to bear in mind the very valuable contribution which can be made in Parliament in this important aspect of our economic life.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the suggestion made here by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West merits the consideration of the hon. the Minister. However, I do not agree with the amendment proposed by the hon. members of the Opposition. I do not think that the idea of the Law Revision Committee is comparable with the situation created by this clause. I do not believe that this idea of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council can be seen in the same light and context as this standing advisory committee at all. I think that this committee is something quite different. If the task of this standing advisory committee had been comparable with the task of other committees, one would have found that this committee had a much wider task. This committee has a wider task in that it is going to advise on a continuous basis. This committee is going to supervise matters in an attempt to iron out practical problems. The committee is going to be engaged in drafting regulations and it is going to consider proposals submitted to it by persons and bodies. Consequently the task of this committee, as laid down very clearly in the Bill and as stated by the hon. the Minister at the Second Reading, is only to make and submit recommendations to the Minister. In other words, this committee will advise the hon. the Minister in respect of such matters as are referred to it, and specific provision is accordingly made to this effect. Consequently I think it is an open question&#x2014;I do not agree with it&#x2014; whether a report can in fact be drawn up and whether it should be done in this public manner. The question is whether it should be tabled and even whether it can be tabled. I say this because it implies so many other aspects which it would not be possible, in my opinion, to incorporate in a report on a formal basis. I refer again to the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister, in which the powers of this committee are clearly defined. The powers <span class="col_6635-6636" refersTo="page_0385"/>of this committee are to consider and report on the desirability of future legislation. In other words, it is of a purely advisory nature. For that reason I think it would be quite fitting to incorporate such a report in an official report to this House.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is not much I can add to what has been said here, especially after what has been said by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West. The hon. member drew the attention of the House to clause 18(6), in terms of which the administration of this advisory committee is placed in the hands of the Registrar. Under these circumstances I think we may agree that the report tabled every year by the Minister of Economic Affairs shall include a detailed report on the activities of the advisory committee. In addition we may agree that the advisory committee shall consider the matter itself. The advisory committee will probably have a lot of work to do this year and next year and particularly in the first few years after the commencement of this legislation, but it is hoped that the volume of work will subsequently be decreased. Then the advisory committee itself will be able to determine, in the light of its activities, whether it is desirable for a separate report to be submitted. For the present I fear that there would be some duplication and I also fear that it would entail a waste of money. Under the present circumstances I should prefer us to be content with the clause as it reads at the moment.</p>

<p>Amendment negatived (Official Opposition dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 30:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendments&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 18, to omit &#x201C;profession which is&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;professions which are&#x201D;; and in line 20, to omit &#x201C;profession&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;professions and/or combinations of such professions&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister has done a very good job with clause 30 and I do not want him to spoil it, but to improve it. I think it is accepted today that professional bodies keep very strict control over their own members. Yet we are experiencing a development in this modern economic world of ours where these large partnerships are being established. We now have the right, in terms of the Bill, to have large partnerships of accountants, of lawyers, of engineers and of members of any profession to which the hon. the Minister agrees. However, there is another development taking place. I mentioned one example of it in the Second Reading, namely the case of chartered surveyors, architects and engineers. Where you have a big building complex such as the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg, you must have different professions associated together to perform the task of getting that building erected. In such an instance one might well have a partnership of more than 20 people, but they would be barred in terms of this clause. There is another development taking place in the accountancy profession. Accountants are now going in for management. In management they are associating themselves with engineers, efficiency experts, etc. Again you are getting partnerships created which the profession itself allows&#x2014;and this is the important thing. As a chartered accountant, I am not permitted to go into a partnership with anybody else except a chartered accountant, unless the rules of the society concerned so permits. The same applies in the case of the hon. the Minister who is a lawyer, and in the case of an engineer. I think it would be a good thing if we were to broaden this to take care of this modern trend, which is growing rapidly, where different professions are being associated together in a single project.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have considered this proposal very carefully and I must say that I feel inclined to accept it. But I still have some doubt as to whether this should be accepted and whether it would not have been desirable first to investigate the matter a little more fully. I am told that there is not the slightest possibility, for the present, at any rate, of there being an association of professions exceeding the number of 20. What the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal amounts to is that it does not have to be only one profession, but that it may be an association of several professions. The proposal made by him is a fundamental one. I then asked myself what might flow from this, because I felt inclined to say that we should first consult <span class="col_6637-6638" refersTo="page_0386"/>the various professions to see whether any real need existed for this. I came to the conclusion that there was in fact a safety-valve contained in this clause. There is a safety-valve in the sense that it has to be approved by the Minister in any case. This is a very important safety-valve, which would in any case be able to prevent any danger which might result from this. Moreover, even if we were to provide for the plural &#x201C;professions&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;profession&#x201D;, and they did not want this to be so, they would simply not make use of it. If any dangers may arise from this, there is still the safety-valve in that the Minister has to approve the matter. Consequently I believe that it may in fact be possible in the future, particularly in view of the growing association of the various professions, as indicated by the hon. member. In the circumstances, with something of a question mark still hanging over it, I am prepared to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 33:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the difficulty arises, and I think it has led to a considerable number of representations which both the hon. the Minister and we have received in connection with the interpretation and clarification of clause 33 read with clause 34 and with clause 52(1) of the Bill. I wonder whether some of the difficulties have not arisen because of the difference between the English and Afrikaans text, because there is no identical wording to coincide. For example, in the English text of the Bill we find that a company can be formed in terms of clause 32 of the Bill for a &#x201C;lawful purpose&#x201D;. In the Afrikaans text it is for a &#x201C;wettige doel&#x201D;. In clause 33(1) we do not have the phrase &#x201C;main purpose&#x201D; but the phrase &#x201C;main object&#x201D;, a differentiation between &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; and &#x201C;object&#x201D;, whereas in the Afrikaans text we have &#x201C;hoofdoelstelling&#x201D;. When we go further we find the phrase &#x201C;main business&#x201D; which in the Afrikaans becomes &#x201C;hoofbesigheid&#x201D;. Looking at the English text, I think there is a variation in the emphasis to what is meant as against what is expressed in the Afrikaans text. It is the same as the difficulty we have in translating &#x201C;volk&#x201D;, i.e. whether it should be &#x201C;race&#x201D; or &#x201C;nation&#x201D;. We have this differentiation between &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; and &#x201C;object&#x201D; and in the Afrikaans text it is &#x201C;doel&#x201D;. When one studies the dictionary in connection with this one finds that there is no difference between the two really. If there is a difference between them in the English language it is very difficult to define. One therefore has firstly this particular difficulty which arises in that way. If one says for what &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; a company is formed and what its &#x201C;main object&#x201D; is, one wonders what it would be in regard to a number of existing companies which are registered with a wide variety of activities. In this clause it is required that these companies should define what is their main object. I think the only one that would cover that main object would be that it is to make a profit, because it is so wide. In the drafting of this clause I feel that one should rather have said what a company&#x2019;s capacity is and what it is able to do. In terms of clause 32, of which we have already approved, a company must have a lawful purpose.</p>

<p>We now come to the second condition, namely what its main purpose is. The only purpose I can see for a company to do this is so that the general public can have some indication of what the company is all about in order to decide whether or not to invest in such a company. But every company that offers shares must present a prospectus. Every company that desires to offer shares for subscription must issue a prospectus. That prospectus is a disclosure of the full intention of the company and what business it intends to take up. Is it necessary that that particular circumscribed description of its activities should be in its memorandum and its articles and that it must state what its main object and main business is&#x003F; When one looks at some of the companies that have been registered one finds that it is almost impossible to determine what the main business of any company is. It is for that reason that I think one should simplify this clause. I do not claim authorship for the suggestion that I have here and for this amendment; it is an amendment from a very high legal source.</p>

<p>I am referring to the one which the hon. the Minister no doubt is aware of himself. Of all the suggestions that have come to us this one seems to me to be a practical one. In other words, we want it to read:</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the limitations imposed by this Act and to the provisions of section <span class="col_6639-6640" refersTo="page_0387"/>34 a company formed in pursuance of section 32 &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is, for a lawful purpose&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall be deemed to have unlimited capacities, including the powers stated in Schedule 2 of this Act: Provided that an association not for gain shall have only such objects and powers as are specifically stated in its memorandum, and unlimited objects ancillary to such specially mentioned objects.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, the formulation of this provision meets also with what is contained in clause 36; because the drafters of this Bill, I believe, have anticipated the problems of establishing whether the actions of the company are strictly within the boundaries of the main object or main business. For that reason they have drafted clause 36, namely to ensure that nothing which is done outside the ambit of its powers, according to its memorandum, are necessarily <i>ultra vires,</i> so far as operations are concerned. If that is so, if acting outside what is stated, is not to be <i>ultra vires,</i> why ask for these limitations to be applied in an attempt to circumscribe what the activities and the main business and objects of a company should be&#x003F; I believe, therefore, that this clause, as it is drafted here, would need the consequential amendments to clause 34, which will be dealt with, and which I cannot deal with at this stage.</p>

<p>It was argued by the hon. the Minister that subscribers would be protected against the use of the company&#x2019;s funds for more than the one main object. But, Sir, it will not only not be achieved, but I believe it is rather stretching one&#x2019;s imagination to believe that, by merely stating the main object, that will be achieved. If a company states its main object, it is not going to limit itself to one particular type of activity. It will state that main object in the widest possible form that will be acceptable to the Registrar of Companies. If it can do that, in terms of Schedule 2 it will have powers to do anything necessary to achieve that particular object as stated. The shareholders will receive no protection in that the utilization of their money is limited to one particular activity, because if the operations of that company are contained in the last provision of Schedule 2, there is a wide discretion as to what can be done. Provision is made for matters incidental and necessary for the achievement of the first object. For that reason I hope the hon. the Minister will accept this very much more simplified statement of capacity, so far as a company is concerned.</p>
