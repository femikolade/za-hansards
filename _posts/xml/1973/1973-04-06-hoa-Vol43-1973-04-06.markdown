<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when the debate terminated last evening, the hon. member for Piketberg, in the course of his speech, severely criticized the hon. member for Johannesburg North for recommending that as a matter of urgent national importance <span class="col_4239-4240" refersTo="page_0673"/>wage increases should be given to the non-White workers in this country. The hon. member for Piketberg saw fit to criticize what I regard as a highly responsible speech, drawing the attention of the country to matters that need urgent attention. In the course of his speech the hon. member said that we on this side of the House only see one side of the picture. He almost inferred that we were quite irresponsible in recommending that higher wages should be paid without a commensurate increase in productivity. Sir, I would like to ask the hon. member for Piketberg whether he realizes that in recent times there has been such an escalation in the cost of living that apart from any other factor, the question of increasing the pay of the poorer people is a matter of urgent necessity. Sir, when we look at the figures to see what happened to the cost of living last year, we see that there was an increase of up to 25% in the price of many foodstuffs. Those items which showed the biggest increase in price&#x2014;items like meat, bread, milk and butter&#x2014;are items which the poorer people simply cannot afford to go without, and if they do not get an increase in their wages it simply means they have to make do with less. Already we know from figures that have been given to us that there are many people in South Africa living below the poverty datum line, and if they are not given an increase in wages, it means that they are going to live even further below the poverty datum line, and if that situation arises, then it must surely have a very drastic effect on the output of these people. What is worse, Sir, is this: It is not only the output of the worker that is affected, but it is the ability of these people&#x2019;s children who have to attend schools and who are inadequately fed that is even more severely affected. Their ability to assimilate what is provided by way of education is very drastically affected.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will recall that many times in this House we on this side have recommended that school-feeding schemes should be instituted and that they should be supported by the State, for this very reason that the families are not receiving sufficiently high wages to feed their families adequately. I think it is a fact that many Bantu and Coloured children attending school today do not have a sufficiently balanced diet to enable them to assimilate what they are taught at school.</p>

<p>As far as this question of the poverty datum line is concerned, I wonder if the hon. member for Piketberg is aware of the figures taken out in the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area by the Port Elizabeth University and published in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times,</i> in which it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">African families in Uitenhage and Despatch currently need R76-23 per month, 18,49% more than the R64-41 they needed in November, 1971.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member for Piketberg: If provision is not made for this escalating cost of living, as is proved by these figures, how must these people live&#x003F;</p>

<p>I have no objection to that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that he has no objection to that. Sir, he criticized the hon. member for Johannesburg North for only dealing with one side of the problem. I think it is generally known that the one thing that we on this side of the House have raised in almost every debate, ever since I have been in this House, is this question of productivity. The hon. member says that we did not raise that aspect of the problem, namely that there must be an increase in productivity if you want to pay increased wages. But, Sir, we have raised this matter time and time again. In fact, if we had to change our name, which will never happen, we could well be called the Productivity Party, because this is the thing which we have emphasized time and time again. Way back in 1964&#x2014;and I refer hon. members opposite to Hansard No. 21&#x2014;my hon. leader made an accurate forecast of what he anticipated the manpower shortage in South Africa would be at about this time. There he indicated that there would be a shortage of skilled labour in the region of 30 000 to 34 000 workers, and subsequent to that he came forward with a well-motivated programme, which he called a crash training programme, and what was the reaction from that side of the House&#x003F; All they said was &#x201C;Crash, crash, crash&#x201D;; that was the response to a very responsible recommendation. Sir, if I look at the results of the recent election at Umhlatuzana, then I think it is obvious that the &#x201C;crash&#x201D; applies to this Government, and I think from the point of view of the interests of South Africa, the quicker that crash comes the better.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, let me also say this for the edification of the hon. member for Piketberg. In 1969 the hon. member for Hillbrow came forward with a Manpower Training Bill, in which he made far-reaching recommendations as to how we should set about training the available manpower in South Africa. Sir, what was the Government&#x2019;s response&#x003F; They voted against it; they would not even consider it. My answer to the hon. member for Piketberg is that this side of the House recognizes that productivity is a vitally important matter at this stage. It recognizes that increased wages must go hand in hand with increased productivity, but at the same time I think the hon. member for Piketberg will agree that in the present situation of escalating costs, it is highly desirable that something should be done immediately to pay the non-Whites a decent level of remuneration.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I would like to refer to some of the many problems which face the agricultural industry. I find it extraordinary that at this time one can read a report like the following in the newspapers. I have a cutting here from the <i>Argus</i> of the 3rd April, which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The chairman of the Dairy Board, Mr. A. J. Basson, and the assistant manager, Mr. F. A. Peters, were visiting New Zealand to discuss South Africa&#x2019;s relationship with the country and the problems arising out of Britain joining the Common Market.</block>

<p>Then it goes on to say that they would discuss potential markets in Africa generally with the officials there, and then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are buying a fair amount of cheese from New Zealand at the moment and we may buy milk powder. South Africa expected to import about 5 000 tons of cheddar cheese from New Zealand this year.</block>

<p>Reference is also made to the fact that they might decide to buy some butter. Now, if one listens to the hon. members opposite and to their glowing reports about our agricultural industry, then I want to ask the hon. the Minister why it is necessary that we should be importing vital foodstuffs at this stage.</p>

<p>Because there is a Nationalist Government in power.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I realize there are problems of drought and other restricting influences, but if at this stage in our history, with a population of approximately 20 million people, we are importing essential foodstuffs, what will the position be when that population grows to 40 million&#x003F; How does the hon. the Minister anticipate that he will ever be able to meet that problem&#x003F; It is for this reason that we on this side of the House have consistently recommended that there should be established here an advisory planning council for agriculture. We realize the problems of agriculture. Sir, you and I both realize that we have a difficult climate. We do not have a country with a high rainfall and a great deal of fertile land. That is all the more reason why we should apply ourselves more diligently and plan more carefully for the future to see that we are able to meet the targets that we set up. This is not happening in our department today. I think these are matters to which the hon. the Minister must give very serious consideration.</p>

<p>Referring to the speech made by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad in this debate, the hon. member posed certain questions on the agricultural industry. I want to say that the hon. member was very wise. He said he decided to ask himself some questions about agriculture. But I must say he made quite sure that the questions he posed himself were so simple that he would have the capacity to answer them. He asked whether agriculture was fulfilling its role and whether the farmers were fulfilling their role, and he answered that in the affirmative. But I want to say a word or two about how we on this side of the House see agriculture and its future role.</p>

<p>We believe that agriculture has acquired a completely new significance in the last 10 or 15 years right throughout the world, but nowhere more so than in South Africa. Sir, gone are the days when farming was merely a way of life for the odd 100 000 or 90 000, or now perhaps only 80 000, farmers in South Africa. Gone are the days when farming was a profession and when it could be looked upon just as another way of life. The population explosion throughout the world&#x2014;and South Africa has not been missed out&#x2014;has brought about a transformation and today every <span class="col_4243-4244" refersTo="page_0675"/>citizen has a stake in the agricultural industry. When we discuss agriculture we are not thinking just of the interest of the farmers of the platteland; we are also thinking about the interest of every single citizen of South Africa. In the first place, this transformation lies in the fact that everybody has a stake in agriculture and I believe that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture is the most important Minister in the whole of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Hear, hear!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>He has an important duty. He has to feed the people of South Africa. If he does not provide the grub, the army of the hon. the Minister of Defence cannot move. I think this is what the people are beginning to realize today. There is a realization by the average citizen that the quality and the quantity of the food they are able to buy and the price they have to pay for it depends on how efficiently this Minister does his job. I think that that fact is dawning on the average citizen and I hope that the members of the Press will in future when we discuss agriculture, be here, and that this House will not be empty of members. That often happens because people think we are discussing only the interests of 80 000 farmers. But we are discussing the wellbeing and the interests of every citizen in South Africa: the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu. It is for this reason that we of the United Party pay particular attention to the problems affecting agriculture. When hon. members opposite say that because we do not have so many representatives on the platteland we are not capable of dealing with agricultural problems, I reject that with contempt. We are as interested in the problems of agriculture as anybody has ever been in South Africa. I was surprised at the haste with which the hon. member for Colesberg was ushered into this House. We naturally welcome him very much but it almost gave me the impression as if the hon. members representing agriculture on the opposite side of this House felt that they needed a little reinforcement in the face of the onslaught the United Party was making on them.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Wolmaransstad referred to a meeting which he called in his constituency, a meeting to which 3 000 farmers flocked. We on this side of the House have no objection to the hon. the Minister having as much dialogue as he can with the farmers of South Africa. We believe that is the right thing. The farmers like to meet the Minister and to discuss their problems with him. But what gave rise to this meeting, Sir&#x003F; It was the fact that 3 000 farmers were uncertain about what this Government was going to do to assist them with the problems they were facing as the result of a serious drought. They were deeply concerned. There had not been sufficient rain. They were not able to plant. They did not know what agterskot they were going to get for their mealies. They were in dire distress. They did not know what the Minister&#x2019;s blueprint was in respect of drought assistance when droughts strike certain areas. That is why they came. I say that if this agricultural department was properly planned, the farmers knew what to expect and if the blueprint was there it would not have been necessary to have a meeting of 3 000 farmers. The hon. the Minister said the agterskot had been decided and that he had announced it. I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us what that agterskot in fact is, because we never saw it in the Press and we believe that had he announced it, it would have been given great prominence in the Press. We hope to get it from him when he replies to this debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I say that if ever this Minister had a golden opportunity to regain some of the lost ground in agriculture, lost due to the department&#x2019;s unwillingness to introduce long-term forward planning into the administration of agriculture in South Africa, then that opportunity was lost during the recent drought.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about this drought. It is a subject which neither you nor I, Sir, like and I think you will agree with me, Sir, that the right time to plan for a drought is when you are having lots of rain because then you have time to manoeuvre. Do not wait until the pressure of the drought is so bad that you can no longer make plans to alleviate the situation. We are grateful that we have had these good rains, and I think the country generally is flourishing from that point of view <span class="col_4245-4246" refersTo="page_0676"/>at present. However, now is the time to discuss it and I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that the handling of the drought situation during the recent drought left a great deal to be desired. The hon. the Minister should know, and I hope his department was aware of the fact that for months the country was being ravaged by one of the most serious droughts. This recent one was one of the most serious droughts that we have ever experienced. Early in January this year certain areas in the Karoo&#x2014;I am talking of the area about which I know&#x2014;applied to be declared drought-stricken in order to get those concessions which the Government gives when a district is declared drought-stricken. This application was handled by the very machinery that this hon. the Minister had created, the very machinery that his department had set up. The investigations were carried out by the extension officer. A survey was made in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s mandate by a Government-nominated soil conservation committee. The director of the region investigated the situation. They made a recommendation that certain districts should be declared drought-stricken. What was the reply&#x003F; In spite of this extensive survey, the application was turned down because the department said that the country was merely suffering from a seasonal drought. I cannot believe that a department can be so out of touch with reality as to give a reply that the country is suffering from a seasonal drought when, in fact, it was suffering from one of the worst droughts in the history of agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>When we talk about the question of drought and the assistance that the Government should give, we are not only interested in the farmers. If timeous steps are not taken to alleviate the problem of drought, to get fodder from those places where fodder is plentiful to those places where fodder is in short supply, it means stock are going to die. What happened&#x003F; I believe that hundreds of stock died in this recent drought, stock that should never have died had timeous action been taken. At this time when every lamb should be saved, where every sheep should be saved, we cannot afford that the lack of proper co-ordination should allow sheep to die. This does affect the housewife. My hon. colleague said that in the butcher shops in Long Street you could not find a sheep carcass, that mutton was not available. However, the situation will get worse if we do not take timeous action to alleviate the effects of drought and to save those sheep that will die if action is not taken.</p>

<p>It is now included.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that it is now included, but why was it not included at the time&#x003F; Why do we have to make representations first&#x003F; It is the duty of this hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department to encourage people to use the right kind of feedstuffs. Mr. Speaker, there is a tremendous volume of low-grade wheat that could be an excellent stockfeed, if it could only be got to the farmer. There has thus far been no recommendation from the department that all this wheat must be used and turned into red meat to feed the people in Cape Town. They just leave the matter and much of the wheat eventually is wasted. Low-grade wheat is excellent feedstuff but it is not on the list. Why should these things be taking place in, as we are told by hon. members on the other side, a very well-administered department&#x003F;</p>

<p>Another problem arises. If the hon. the Minister does not see that we are getting the optimum utilization of all available feedstuff in South Africa, it means very often that many of the livestock that are <span class="col_4247-4248" refersTo="page_0677"/>in fact marketed, are marketed in poor condition. What happened in the drought&#x003F; Hundreds and hundreds of our sheep that were in no fit condition to be slaughtered were sent to the abattoirs. We might well have had a repetition of the situation which was pointed out by the hon. member for East London North a year or two ago of cats on the hook, something which drew headlines all over South Africa.</p>

<p>Cats&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>If that hon. member, who knows more about the fishing industry, would like to know what &#x201C;cats on the hook&#x201D; is, it is an under-nourished sheep which was slaughtered when only half fat. When this happens, hundreds and hundreds of tons of meat are wasted. This is the sort of thing in which the housewife of South Africa is interested, and that is why she is interested today in this hon. Minister&#x2019;s department.</p>

<p>I now want to refer also to the speech made by the hon. member for Bethal. He raised some very interesting subjects in his speech. Some of these are matters which have been raised by us on this side of the House time and time again. He raised the important factor of agricultural finances. If any one single factor is vitally important for the well-being of our agricultural industry, it is a sound financing organization to finance the industry. By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that sufficient progress has been made in this particular field. I think the methods by which we finance agriculture in South Africa are antiquated and out of date. We have been saying that the time has arrived when we need a central agricultural financing organization to bring under one umbrella the functions of both the Department of Agriculture Credit and Land Tenure and the Land Bank. I hope that this matter will receive the urgent attention of the Minister and that he will give us some indication of how he intends tackling this problem in the future. Here I would like to have the attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance, because this is a very important point. I want to support the hon. member for Bethal when he says that a tremendous amount of the capital generated by the agricultural industry is flowing out of the industry. It is invested in building societies and other sectors of the economy. We believe and I think the hon. member for Bethal too, that this capital should be induced to the Land Bank by making certain special tax concessions for that capital which farmers have available to invest. If this capital is taken up by the Land Bank on a tax-free basis it will not only help the farming community but it will also help the Land Bank to finance agriculture more efficiently in the future.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Chief Whip said I was to have 10 minutes only, but I should like to tell the hon. member for Walmer that he mentioned a number of things with which I agree. I am pleased he emphasized the importance of agriculture and the fact that the consumer and the producer should not be regarded separately. We must make a joint attempt, that is, the city-dweller and the country-dweller, to be able to provide food for a growing population. However, the hon. member mentioned a few things with which I am unable to agree.</p>

<p>He is the champion of soil conservation. On a previous occasion I told that hon. member that if all the farmers were to adopt that attitude of protecting the soil, things would go well with us. He spoke of 15 districts which could not obtain listing as distress areas. I perused the papers personally. The extension officer said that applications for areas to be listed as distress areas were not justified as there was no distress on farms on which conservation farming was being practised. How are we ever going to impress soil conservation on our farmers&#x003F; The drought had only been in progress for a short time when applications for areas to be listed as distress areas were received. But there are farmers who practise conservation farming who tell one straight out that because they farm according to directives, they have no problems. After all, it would not boost the cause of conservation farming if one were to approve every application for an area to be listed as a distress area.</p>

<p>The hundreds of sheep which supposedly died according to the hon. member, I have never heard of.</p>

<p>Yes, there was a loss of condition but that sheep died is not something which has been brought to our attention. I would be obliged if the hon. <span class="col_4249-4250" refersTo="page_0678"/>member would tell me on which farms it occurred so that I may determine to what extent it happened. This creates a false impression of the Department of Agriculture allegedly allowing sheep to die at a time when there was a shortage of mutton without any action being taken by the Department. I know nothing about it. I should like to have more facts in this regard.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the planning advisory council referred to by the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for Walmer from time to time. In the first place I want to ask them who is to serve on this advisory council.

<p>They will have to undertake long-term planning for me. Let us look at the position of butter. The hon. member for Walmer asked me why Albert Basson went overseas to import cheese and powdered milk. It is a fact. It had to be imported because there was a drought. We are self-sufficient when we are blessed with good rains. The hon. member referred to the man who lived under the breadline. Now I want to say straight out that I do not believe in praising a man at his grave. I am very sorry a man such as Dr. Diederichs has to grow old and cannot remain Minister of Finance for all times so that agriculture may always receive the treatment it is receiving at the present time. I have never yet approached him with a reasonable request on behalf of the farmer which he has refused. Have hon. members looked at the Budget&#x003F; Food subsidies alone amount to R85 million. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town vented his spleen and cried, &#x201C;A scrap of meat costs one a fortune!&#x201D; But in the next breath he said, &#x201C;Increase the floor price of meat!&#x201D; Imagine! On the one hand he says that meat is expensive, while on the other he says that the floor price of meat should be increased.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us take another look at the Budget. The subsidy on dairy products alone amounts to R10,9 million. The subsidy on wheat is R31 million.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the price of bread and said that it was a disgrace that the price of brown bread should be increased by 2 cents. I told hon. members explicitly that if the price of bread were not increased, the subsidy would have amounted to R52 million this year. The consumption increases continually. An increase of one cent per loaf means R15 million. Seventy per cent of our people use white bread. The Bantu eat white bread. Now the price of white bread is going to be the same as that of brown bread. Can I not get that into that hon. member&#x2019;s head&#x003F; If we were to leave the subsidy as it is, it would amount to more than R100 million within three years. Then hon. members say that we must reduce taxes. Surely one cannot run a business in this way. It would be a stupid Minister of Finance indeed who would allow subsidies to increase continually and reduce taxes at the same time. After all, he cannot allow our children to inherit a bankrupt estate. One must be practical.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the meeting at Wolmaransstad. If a member of Parliament telephoned me and said he required something, that he, in fact, had a pressing need, we should remember that not one of us on either side of the House had created that need. It was as late as January and at that time not a single mealie seed had been planted. The farmers only wanted to meet me. Should I have said that I was unable to come&#x003F; Now the hon. member says that the farmers are worried because there is no blueprint. How can we draw up a blueprint with the aid of that planning advisory council and ensure that Wolmaransstad will get the necessary rain in the future&#x003F; One cannot draw up a blueprint for agriculture. Those 3 000 farmers were not angry with me. They asked me what we were going to do and I told them <span class="col_4251-4252" refersTo="page_0679"/>explicitly that the mealie price would be announced on 15th April. I also told them that if funds were available, we should give consideration to an emergency payment and that the new price would be adjusted depending on the position with regard to the cost of living. Yesterday the hon. member pleaded for a higher mealie price. It is very easy to sit over there and say that the mealie price has to be increased. The mealie price has its effect on the dairy industry, broilers and meat. It has its effect on everything.</p>

<p>In the next sentence the hon. member went on to say that food prices were rising.</p>

<p>There is no more pleasant thing in the world than to be a member of the Opposition. One can cry out for a higher mealie price and if the price of broilers rises one is still not in trouble. One must approach these matters realistically.</p>

<p>Those farmers of Wolmaransstad had replies to all their questions to the extent that it was possible for me to reply to them. They assembled there in an atmosphere of peace and quiet. Ten members of Parliament were present. They are people who take a real interest in the lives of their voters. We did not talk politics there. It was a decent group of farmers. I do not believe they could ever vote U.P. In that spirit we departed and they were told that the Minister of Finance would make R25 million available to the co-operatives to finance them. During the drought in 1968 R25 million was also made available to them. I can tell hon. members that only R314 000 of that amount is still outstanding. The farmer pays that money back as soon as he has a year of good rains. But the hon. member need not feel bad about the fact that we met the farmers at Wolmaransstad. The hon. member need not reproach me about that.</p>

<p>When we deal with my Vote we shall reply to these things one by one. I have been asked to state my policy for the agricultural industry. We shall discuss that in detail. However, I can tell you now what my policy is for the future. We must have a happy farming community, one that can put heart and soul into the matter of production. The member for Walmer is correct when he says that farming has become a business. Today it is a fine art to make the grade and to be able to make a success of agriculture. One requires a businessman in agriculture. He must have a sympathetic Government, a Government which can help him and which can lend a hand when circumstances beyond his control land him in financial difficulties. He must have a love of the soil in order to protect it so that our children, too, may one day provide food for a growing population. Will hon. members help me by letting me have the names of people who may serve on that planning advisory council so as to enable me to draw up a blueprint and so that we shall no longer have problems with droughts in the future, although I do not know whether this will be practicable. In any event, we shall give our full attention to the matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>In reading the book <i>Five Hundred Years of South African History,</i> I find one golden thread running through it, and that is that in our history over the past 500 years certain basic and indispensable concepts have been laid down. I do not want to mention all of them; I just want to mention those which I want to discuss today. The one which stands out, is that we in South Africa have developed an unparalleled and incomparable loyalty and feeling of respect towards our leaders. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, Sir De Villiers Graaff, is sitting over there. I differ radically with him and we shall never understand each other as far as basic standpoints on certain questions are concerned. We are irreconcilable as far as that is concerned, but allow me to say that although he is my political enemy, a total political enemy as far as basic political concepts are concerned, I have the highest respect for him as the leader of the United Party, the position he holds. I am not being a hypocrite when I say this. Similarly, our people also differed with the late Gen. Smuts in the field of politics, but wherever one goes in the country, one can hear that far above the political differences there is a finely interwoven feeling towards him. This is an interwoven characteristic which our people have acquired over the 500 years of its history, namely the appreciation we have for our leaders, the respect and the regard with which our leaders have been treated by friend and foe. Sir, this did not come about just like that. The things which a people does and the characteristics whith in a people which crystallize to the surface, are associated with centuries and centuries of sacrifice, elimination and sifting, and eventually those valuable characteristics crystallize out.</p>

<p>Sir, we stand here today on Van Riebeeck Day, and I can say with pride that our population in South Africa has not abandoned that basic, valuable, built-in component in our view of life and of the world. In order to destroy a people, certain steps must be taken. I want to read to you 14 steps which must be taken in order to destroy a people, because this links up with what I want to say: (1) Ridicule all references to its spiritual properties; (2) encourage disregard of any form of authority by urging people to obey their own impulses in the name of freedom; (3) make it difficult for wrong-doers to be found guilty and punished for crimes against society; (4) sow seeds of mistrust of law-officers, whether they are the local police or the security police; (5) import enormous quantities of drugs and put them within reach of the youth of the country; (6) divide the ethnic groups of the country against each other and incite each group to revolt; (7) remove all control over entertainment so that sexual licentiousness at its coarsest may be presented; (8) present perversion as something sensational and exciting; (9) defile the youth of the country by allowing pornography, indecency and immorality to run riot without fear of prosecution; (10) encourage subverters to stage disorderly processions, to stir up riots and damage property; (11) shun discussions on loyalty, responsibility, patriotism, duty and sacrifice in order to confirm the right to have differences of opinion; (12) convince minority elements that justice cannot be obtained through the ordinary processes of law, but through revolution; (13) establish a gulf between parent and child by encouraging them to mistrust each other&#x2019;s institutions; and (14) lull the intellectual leaders into the conviction that communism and permissiveness present no threat, that not all acts of permissiveness are an inherent component of decay. The quickest way to destroy a people, is by permitting these 14 things which I have mentioned here, or some of them.</p>

<p>Sir, in considering what is going on among our students today, I ask myself why there should be such a world of difference between the approximately 80 000 students at our universities and the approximately <span class="col_4255-4256" refersTo="page_0681"/>30 000 students at our technical colleges for advanced education. Sir, from the ranks of our technical high schools and colleges for advanced education, with approximately 35 000 students, we have not had one single sign of disquiet. The unrest and the things which are causing us concern are found in and come from our ordinary academic institutions.</p>

<block name="quote">It is the chance of good career opportunities for their children that provides the appeal of higher education for working class parents. It is noteworthy that while working class students are grossly under-represented in traditional academic institutions, they are found in much larger proportions in the technological universities and in the colleges of technology. Furthermore, it is in precisely these institutions where the sons of the working classes are that student revolt has been almost entirely absent in Britain.</block>

Sir, who are the students who are the ringleaders in pornography and who are the ringleaders with their leftist movements&#x003F; They are not to be found in the medical faculties, nor in the engineering faculties, but chiefly in the social sciences.</p>

<p>Sir, I know what the reply will be. The reply will be that the man in the social sciences is more alert and more awake to political events, but that is not the reason. Sir, I made a random test. I saw numerous professors and lecturers, from all the universities, and with two exceptions their opinion was generally that there was still too much of a holiday atmosphere at universities and that too little work was being done in certain faculties. Sir, idleness, the unorganized nature of programmes, unfilled work programmes, are one of the basic reasons why these alarming things have been coming from certain quarters within our universities.

<p>Now I say to you, Sir, that these publications are filthy and criminal. If these were individual publications, it would have been well and good, but last year we had a snap debate here and we referred to these phenomena. What <span class="col_4257-4258" refersTo="page_0682"/>I have here in my hand, is last week&#x2019;s. All of them are last week&#x2019;s; only one of them is last year&#x2019;s. These are proof of a sustained offence against our order of life and Christian order in South Africa which we have established in this fatherland over a period of 500 years. They are the products of plunderers of our hard-won norms which through the centuries have been built and woven into our existence as civilized beings within the framework of a Christian ordering. This is an open defiance of the existing official order.</p>

<p>Sir, the official order in our fatherland is not maintained chiefly through laws and courts and prisons. Our official order is an interwoven product in which decency, sobriety, the ethical relationships between fellow countrymen and between subject and leader are essential components, components we cannot do without. Who are these people who write these things&#x003F; They are a group of young whippersnappers who have become too big for their boots. They are irresponsible, immature, pathetic products. Of what&#x003F; Of a gross lack of strict, orderly education in their homes. [Interjection.] But they are also the products of a lack of discipline at our ordinary schools and, if I have to apportion accusations, I may also say that they are the direct product of a total lack of discipline at our university institutions. But it is even more than this&#x2014;and we have evidence of it. They are the products of a group of cowardly people who hide behind the students and make use of the safety afforded them by the university campus and the status of a university. By protecting the status they obtain through the university, they are hiding behind these students. They are the product of the self-appointed crusaders, such as the hon. member for Houghton, who is not present although I asked her to be present.</p>

<p>In referring to self-appointed crusaders, I want to add that she has never once stood up here to say one single word against these plunderers of our moral order. She has never done so. In their election campaign this was advertised boldly&#x2014;this was given to me by Capt. Jack Basson, the hon. member for Sea Point:</p>

<block name="quote">In reply to another question, Mrs. Suzman said a Progressive Government would allow the Communist Party to operate in South Africa &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then this tail is added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as long as it obeys the law and does not disrupt or cause violence</block>

<p>The self-appointed crusaders, this Progressive Party! I want to say at once that the vast majority of students at our universities are decent young people. After all, we cannot allow these irresponsible plunderers and those hiding behind them to have their way. We have, after all, an order which we must maintain in our fatherland. We pointed this out during that snap debate. We resisted this process of pollution. When the hon. member for Houghton put it to us that this was a general world phenomenon, we told her that foreign recipes could not holus-bolus be accepted here in South Africa. We made it clear that our civilization did not only consist of stone and steel constructions, but that other solid, interwoven assets and concepts were present in our civilization assets and concepts which will for ever remain valid for us. We said that we could not be measured in terms of our deeds, but in terms of what we believe in. That is our first criterion.</p>

<p>We pointed out that we were not dealing here with isolated cases. We pointed out that our people were deeply resentful because the person of our leader was being involved in the most repulsive, vulgar way. We held out the prospect that at some time or other there would have to be a confrontation between those people and us&#x2014;we as decent people who know what it means to live in an ordered, decent State and who are committed to the preservation of perpetual values. We pointed out that for three years the hon. the Minister of National Education had to reply, at congress after congress of the Nationalist Party, to draft resolutions urging that action be taken. The State and the Government were reasonable. The Government, through its Minister, asked repeatedly that these universities and educational institutions put their own house in order. This reasonableness was not a sign of weakness. It was asked in all earnest&#x2014;I repeat this&#x2014;that they put their own house in order. I want to read what the hon. the Minister said during that snap debate. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4259-4260" refersTo="page_0683"/>If we think we can dismiss this matter by uttering a few disapproving words about the front page of that <i>Wits Student,</i> we are making a big mistake.</block>

<p>If it has ever been necessary to have a full-scale debate in this House on this phenomenon, then it is now. The Minister was very serious when he took up this matter with the principal of the University of the Witwatersrand. He stated in this House that we would no longer tolerate this defamation of our fatherland and could no longer put up with this disparagement of our image. Hear what that publication had to say last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Nazi Germany 6 million Jews died, and in South Africa countless Blacks have died and are still dying because of the dictates of Christian Nationalism.</block>

<p>Sir, the person who tells me that he will allow this and comes with the excuse that these are irresponsible or immature student pranks, must not talk to me. We do not consult or carry on a dialogue with each other. That person is attacking the foundations of our country and betraying the history which has been built up in South Africa over 500 years. The book I have here in my hand contains a description of suffering, but also of glorious triumphs. In the concluding chapter the writer says that there is hope and confidence for South Africa; the 500 years of history proves this to us.</p>

<p>What is clear to us now&#x003F; It is clear that the principal of the University of the Witwatersrand is too weak and incompetent to fulfil his task.</p>

<p>I say it, Sir, He cannot maintain authority. When <i>Hoofstad</i> had an interview with him on 28th April, 1972, they asked him this question (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Does this mean that any action may be taken, disciplinary or otherwise&#x003F;</block>

<p>Hear what he replied (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any form of authority is unacceptable to the young people. To interfere, would be a big mistake.</block>

<p>Sir, it costs our taxpayers approximately R1 000 per annum to keep a student at that university. In this respect the University of the Witwatersrand costs us up to R7 million per annum, and then the principal says that any form of authority would be a mistake. He is a democrat and therefore he ought to know, to gauge and to sense that we have no confidence in him. The duty of a democrat is to lay down his position if he feels that he has lost the confidence of the authorities, who finance him and his institution. If he has any sense of decency in him, he will resign his post and make room for a more capable man.</p>

<p>One thing is clear to us; we have come to the point of confrontation, to the point where these students must be examined strictly. My colleague the member for Algoa came forward with a brilliant idea in a speech he made before the Parliamentary Society in Durban. In broad outline I want to submit it here for consideration. He said that the authorities had to enter into an agreement with every student, so that it might be a matter between the student and the authorities when the authorities acted on information obtained from the university authorities to the effect that certain students were abusing their position, and so that the authorities might have access to the results achieved by those students. The Van Wyk-De Vries Report will shortly be submitted to the Minister in its entirety. I can just say that I look forward with confidence to that report. I express my heartfelt desire that publications such as the <i>Wits Student</i> should be banned immediately. It may not be published. It appears under the cloak of freedom. I do not have the time to read all of it, but I want to quote from a speech by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who was such a lively fellow last night. On 6th February, 1953, he made a speech in this House and said&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was my intention to return, in these last hours of the Budget debate, to the Budget itself, to the proposals of the hon. the Minister of Finance and to some of the problems those proposals are going <span class="col_4261-4262" refersTo="page_0684"/>to create, both for the Government and for South Africa, but before doing that I should like to respond to one or two speeches which have preceded mine. The one was made by the hon. member for Carletonville, who has just sat down. He made it clear that although our political opinions were irreconcilable, we could nevertheless disagree in a civilized manner. I want to tell him that I am in the position this morning that I do want to disagree with him in a civilized manner. I agree with him that it is impossible to try to defend filth, immorality, pornography and even indecency in the name of freedom. With that we agree. I recollect that I appealed a year ago to the leaders and to those who were responsible for our large universities in South Africa to see to it that those under their care were not seduced and used by other people for purposes they did not understand. I stand by that. But I feel that we should not be in too great a hurry to judge young people if they sometimes make use of those freedoms granted to them at the universities in an irresponsible manner. In the course of years I have found that even those people have become some of the most responsible people in the community. The hon. member availed himself of this opportunity to attack the principal of the University of the Witwatersrand, and I wonder whether this is the place to make such an attack. I wonder whether the Government itself does not speak through its representatives on the university council when they think fit.</p>

<p>Now I also want to address a few words to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. My trouble with him is that he agrees with the Opposition to such an extent, particularly when it comes to agricultural affairs, that I do not know why he is not sitting on this side of the House. I do not know why he is so afraid of a long-term planning council for agriculture. Why should he be afraid&#x003F; Does he really think they would give him the sort of advice he spoke of today&#x003F; Who is he going to appoint if he expects something of that kind&#x003F; No, Sir, it is quite clear that South Africa needs a planning council for agriculture which could advise him on long-term planning. I do not think we shall find a solution to our problems in South Africa before the hon. the Minister recognizes this and co-operates to institute such a council.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to come back to the Budget and the proposals of the hon. the Minister and the effect they are going to have and the problems they are going to create for South Africa. I think if one evaluates the Budget proposals of the hon. gentleman, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that what he has done is to take a calculated gamble. He is taking a calculated gamble to try and achieve economic growth which I know he expected and hoped for after two devaluations, but which did not ensue despite his best hopes and his best intentions. The background against which he is introducing his Budget is rather a dismal one. Real economic growth for 1970-&#x2019;71 has been of the order of 4% per annum, the lowest since Sharpeville. In 1972 even that 4% was not achieved and the figure was probably nearer 3%. The inflationary factor over those three years must have been of the order of 20%. What happened&#x003F; As a result entrepreneurs became nervous, unemployment began to appear and industrial capacity was not fully employed. I know that there was a change towards the end of 1972, when industrial activity seemed to improve. It came especially because of the growth in income of farming and mining due to the demand for food overseas and the increase in the price of gold. But there was marked consumer resistance at that time, and that consumer resistance was against the rising prices which resulted in a decrease in consumption. In spite of that the cost of production rose, particularly that of mining and agriculture and in secondary industry. In other words, cost inflation upset the hopes of both the economists and the Government itself. Now the hon. the Minister has set out to encourage growth, to stimulate growth, and I believe he is doing it in the full knowledge that what he is going to do is going to be inflationary. I believe he is doing it in that full knowledge. On Loan and Revenue Accounts alone he is budgeting for a deficit of R407 million. He is hoping to wipe that out by drawing on the accumulated Stabilization Account and appropriating R264 million from the current surplus. What have been his chief stimulants to economic recovery and from what concessions is it expected that he will get his best results&#x003F; When you look at the list I am afraid you cannot help coming to the conclusion that they are not very impressive, because what is he going to do&#x003F; There is a reduction in transfer duty, a 5% reduction in sales tax on selected household <span class="col_4263-4264" refersTo="page_0685"/>goods, there is a cut in the personal income tax surcharge from 20% to 10%, there are export concessions including specially reduced rail tariffs and State assistance, there is an increase in investment allowances on plant and machinery, and there is assistance to farming via the Land Bank for which the Minister is so grateful although he has not yet made up his mind at what price he is going to fix the price of mealies for the year. Then there are also concessions to the mining industry. In other words, what he has done is that he has introduced a mildly reflationary Budget. One hopes that these measures will succeed in stimulating growth.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Inflationary. But one must be deeply concerned at the prospect of the steeply rising living costs which are going to hit hard, and are going to hit hard at the ordinary man in the street, all those who have fixed incomes, and particularly our lowest paid workers, our Black workers, with all the explosive potential that it holds for South Africa. Already we hear of ominous acceleration in the rise of farm production costs which is going to lead to increases in the price of foodstuffs, which again hold serious political and social consequences for the nation, and already anxious inquiries are being made as to where the money is going to come from to pay for the increased wages being granted not only by the Government, but also by industry, to non-Whites, in many cases in very deserving circumstances, being granted very often to non-Whites when increase in productivity is going to be slow because of lack of training and where increases in wages have all too often resulted in the cutting back of the non-White labour complement of the industries concerned.</p>

<p>When you look at the situation you cannot help being impressed by the wisdom of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council in advising a year ago the three objectives for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget. It advised that what should be striven for is an improvement in the balance of payments, an acceleration in the rate of economic growth and the curbing of inflation. Then followed the significant words. Of course, at that stage they were aware that it would be difficult to achieve these objectives &#x201C;simultaneously&#x201D; and that they were &#x201C;mutually contradictory&#x201D;. Of course they are not necessarily mutually contradictory, but where they are applied by the wrong people and in the wrong environment they will be mutually contradictory. Even though the hon. the Minister seems to believe that he can apply them without that being so, I am afraid that the council&#x2019;s fears are going to be vindicated. It is going to be not only difficult but it is going to be impossible for this Government to achieve all three simultaneously. I think they are to be proved to be mutually contradictory. When you listen to the speeches which have been made, not only by the hon. the Minister but also by other hon. members on that side of the House since Monday, you are overwhelmed by the plethora of unsubstantiated generalities which have been used to try to justify the situation at the present time. We heard from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall devote particular attention to the growth prospect in our economy and to any factors which inhibit the growth rate.</block>

<p>Then came the very cursory examination of the inhibiting factors. I could have given him a list and I could have headed my list with the loss of immigrants over years and years in the past under this Government. I would have included failure to train our labour force despite demands from this side of the House for years and years on end. I would have listed the Physical Planning Act and its inhibiting effect on growth in our most productive areas. I would have listed the diversion of resources of capital and labour and material to the border areas. I would have listed the stop-go policies directed by the total absence of consistent aims for economic growth. How can it be different with this hon. gentleman&#x003F; Was he not the man who told us that he was prepared to bend the economy to suit his ideological ends&#x003F; These factors alone are going to make growth without severe inflation very difficult of attainment indeed. There was something else the Minister said. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Effective action against the present rising tendency of prices is particularly difficult since this trend is largely due to unavoidable cost factors.</block>

<p>What are these unavoidable cost factors and who is responsible for them&#x003F; The first <span class="col_4265-4266" refersTo="page_0686"/>of these unavoidable cost factors I would list is the high cost of labour which is the inevitable result of the Government&#x2019;s restrictive labour policy, lacking in foresight and planning over the years. I would list other high costs of production such as the great wallop of extra costs on petrol in the form of taxes and the South African Railways&#x2019;s profit on pipelines and the transport of petrol. I would list the high rail rates that run through the production cost line like a swelling pipe and I would list the exorbitant Post Office charges. A year or two ago I spoke in the debate on the Budget and I spoke of the experience in Australia where these very factors were so caught up in the cost-of-production machine that the Budget had the opposite effect from what the Government of the day had expected.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there are the high costs now of devaluation and the effect that they are having on our imports. These costs are unavoidable under the policies of this Government, and they are going to make the attainment of growth while curbing inflation impossible. Then one can add the sales tax, apparently another unavoidable cost factor which increases the cost appreciably more at the consumer&#x2019;s end than at the manufacturer&#x2019;s end.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister made a third statement:</p>

<block name="quote">By means of price control the Government sees to it that unjustified price rises are as far as possible prevented.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>As far as possible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, &#x201C;as far as possible&#x201D;. I think my first comment would be that in the places where price control is most needed, namely in the Black townships in our urban areas, it tends to be least effectively applied. I should like to say secondly that it is repeatedly nullified by appeals from producers of controlled commodities to raise the controlled price. What is happening&#x003F; The Minister of Agriculture has to accede. Milk is up, bread is up, butter is up, meat is up, and now we see that inevitably the price of maize is going to rise as well. Only last week Dr. Diederichs said that there was good reason to expect that the rate of inflation would before long decline. Will it, Sir&#x003F; What is the Minister of Agriculture going to do about the price of maize&#x003F; I think the hon. the Minister of Finance must have been joking when he said that the rate of inflation was likely to decline. I see the hon. the Minister of Agriculture behind him, smiling happily to himself because he is about to raise the price of one of the staple food products of one of the greatest portions of the population of South Africa. I know he cannot avoid it under this Government. Of course he cannot, because he is paying for wrong policies over the years. That is the trouble.</p>

<p>Then we had another gem from the Minister of Finance: &#x201C;The public can assist by buying judiciously.&#x201D; Really, Sir, does the hon. gentleman think that the housewives today are not universally price conscious and price wise&#x003F; I fear there is very little they can do to make their money go as far as it did, because of the unavoidability of inflation under the policies of the present Government. The public is hardhit because the cost of living is eroding their standard of living. I believe that the ordinary man in the street is disappointed with this Budget and with what it has done for him.</p>

<p>There was a rather sad comment on the results of the Umhlatuzana by-election. It came from the leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal, the hon. Senator Horwood. One is accustomed to the Nationalist Party making excuses, but this hon. gentleman has a reputation as an economist. What did he say&#x003F; &#x201C;The United Party fought on bread-and-butter matters and that is very hard to counter.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Yes, Sir, under this Government and with this Budget it is very hard to counter indeed. Then we had the hon. member for Paarl saying that the Minister was not St. Nicholas. &#x201C;Hy is nie Vader Krismis nie,&#x201D; he said. Well, that is quite true. He cannot create gifts out of nothing.</p>

<p>It is quite true; he cannot create gifts out of nothing as St. Nicholas could. But he did have a choice in this Budget. He had a choice, to stimulate investment growth, either of putting more into the consumers pocket or of putting more, in a more direct fashion, into the businessman&#x2019;s pocket. I believe he should and could have put more into the consumer&#x2019;s pocket. He would thereby have stimulated economic growth as well.</p>

<p>And inflation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. gentleman is faced with inflation anyway. Nothing he is doing is stopping inflation. Sir, where are we&#x003F; Is it necessary that the Blacks should continue to pay income tax at the level that they do&#x003F; Should the level at which they pay tax not be raised&#x003F; Why is it that the level at which they pay is so much lower than for other people&#x003F; Sir, he could have done a lot more about reducing transfer fees. He could have done a lot more about reducing deposits for the building of houses. He could have done a lot more about investigating ways and means of increasing subsidies to the local authorities so that the burden of assessment rates in the big cities is not as bad as it is. I think he could have done a lot more about sales tax. I think he could have introduced a national contributory pension scheme. Sir, he made some very welcome remarks when he spoke of the improvements in pensions payable to State employees and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that the benefits which are now being provided will ensure a carefree old age for our officialdom and their widows and, what is more, allow them to retain their sense of independence.</block>

<p>Surely, Sir, that carefree and independent old age should not be reserved only for State employees and for the employees of those companies wealthy enough to afford good pension schemes. Why, Sir, are we still being deprived of a national contributory pension scheme, and why are our people faced with a lack of independence and a penurious old age on the old-age pensions being paid by this Government at the present time&#x003F; What inducement is there in this Budget for anybody to save, under the present inflationary conditions in South Africa&#x003F; I know that people are being encouraged to save to buy a house, but by the time they have done the saving, probably the deposit will have gone up very much higher. Sir, I am not unaware of the problems facing the hon. the Minister. He has got to plan for growth and he has to ward off inflation, but he has got to do it after 25 years of the implementation of the policies of this Government; that is what is hanging around his neck. I think the hon. member for Maitland described brilliantly the losing battle that the Government is fighting to retain its ideology in the face of the economic realities of South Africa today. Sir, at the gun-point of a shockingly low growth performance of about 3% over the past year and an inflation rate of possibly 8% for the present year, Government ideology has been breached and a white flag, recognizing interdependence between Black and White, has appeared over the ramparts of the castle of separate development. And what is the white flag, Sir&#x003F; Blacks are to be trained in urban areas to do skilled and semi-skilled work. You see, Sir, the Government is awakening from its self-imposed hypnosis that South Africa can have both separation and growth. Sir, a negative <i>per capita</i> growth rate is something that no Government can risk for long, and with the present inflation, the present low growth rate and our vigorous population growth, the Government is faced with real difficulty. You will remember, Sir, that the Government was going to re-draw the political map of South Africa. Industries were going to mushroom in the border areas; established cities were going to divest themselves of their Black industrial workers. You will remember, Sir, that the two hon. Ministers here spoke about computers and about automation and labour-saving devices, which were going to take the place of that labour. The industries were going to chum out jobs at competitive prices and find the money to develop industries in the border areas and to develop the Black homelands as well. Well, as you know, Sir, that just has not happened. Industrialists are not being drawn into those border areas in anything like the numbers or to the extent that this Government hoped for. People feel more and more uncertain and unhappy because the final arbiter in how they are treated is not the question of the effect on the economy, not economic considerations, but the ideological considerations of this Government. With that as a guide-line the training of Black labour in the areas where it is most needed and most effective has been sadly neglected. Now, what have we got&#x003F; What has the result been&#x003F; The result has been a shortage of labour, the key factor in the pipeline of inflation, low productivity and inefficiency, bitter frustration on the part of the Blacks over the wages they have been allowed to earn and the way they have been forced to live, which frustration has exploded now in strike action on an unprecedented scale.</p>

<p><span class="col_4269-4270" refersTo="page_0688"/>They are asking for better conditions. Sir, the hon. the Minister of Finance has finally accepted defeat, apparently, in this battle to pit the race policies of his Government against economic reality. He knows that the favourable balance of payments he has got, amounting to millions of rands, the millions he is spending to encourage exporters, to stimulate investment, to improve output and productivity, are all going to go up in inflationary smoke unless he can get the padlock off the door locking out better trained labour, and unless he can do it quickly. Now he has made a tentative move in the right direction. Sir, what about the 25 years that have been wasted&#x003F; And how far is he going to be allowed to go&#x003F; Once before the hon. gentleman made a statement in a Budget speech and hardly had he made it than we had reaction from the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. What is going to happen on this occasion&#x003F; We have already had the Minister of Labour, it would seem, in conflict with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The Minister of Posts and Telegraphs is training Black workers in White areas for skilled work in his Post Office and it does not look as if they are going to be used only in Black areas. I wonder how that dispute is going to be resolved. I wonder whether the Minister of Finance is going to win this time. Last time he lost. But I think the time has come for us to have some clear statement from someone, with undisputed authority to speak, on what the Government is going to do, how far it is going to go and how soon it is going to get on with the job of getting labour trained for purposes which are so essential for the country. In fact, we need a different approach. A different approach will not be new to this side of the House. We have been pleading for it for years. But it will be very different for that side of the House. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I see little joy for the wage earner in 1973. The unavoidable cost factors which the hon. the Minister has spoken about as being inevitable under the administration of his Government, are going to give him a hard time. I see little joy for investors because they still have no certainty of exactly what is meant by that fateful sentence, that fateful sentence in the Budget speech of the hon. the Minister. I believe the Government is aware of the problems facing us. In fact, I believe it is more aware of them than it has ever been before. I think it has accepted now that rising costs are here to stay and that trying to contain inflation by limiting consumption has failed utterly. It is quite clear that it is prepared to accept further inflation for the sake of economic growth in the hope that the result will be a net increase in the <i>per capita</i> income of the people. But it is a gamble, and if it fails we are going to see inflation such as we have never seen before in the history of South Africa. But if it succeeds, and I hope it will, it is going to create new problems for this Government because inflation in South Africa is not just an economic problem; it is a political problem of very serious dimensions.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what does all this mean&#x003F; I believe that, first of all, the inevitable result of the inflation which will follow on this Budget is that it will hit the people with fixed incomes excessively hard and that speedy relief for them will have to be in the pipeline. Then there is a second factor, a second set of problems. These are the problems with which the workers, particularly the low-paid Black workers, will be faced, because their problems are going to make them more restive and they are going to force us all to rethink our attitudes to their presence in our midst. I do not believe that South Africa is ever going to be able to return to the mentality which prevailed before the Durban strikes and those that followed. In this regard the Government is badly placed to make adjustments, either in the socio-economic sphere or in the political sphere, and both are going to have to be made, both in the socio-economic sphere and in the political sphere. The trouble with the Government is that it still regards the Black workers in our midst as temporary sojourners. That is an approach which made men like Chief Mathala, Chief Minister of Lebowa in the Northern Transvaal, describe this as the joke of the century. This is a report on what he said when he spoke on the 15th November last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Close on 7 000 well-wishers listened attentively as Chief Mathala told the audience that Africans in urban areas are often said to be temporary sojourners in such areas. This was misleading. Urban Africans were as much in permanent residence in these areas as their counterparts were in the homelands. People who thought Africans were temporary sojourners in White areas were <span class="col_4271-4272" refersTo="page_0689"/>giving us the joke of the century, said the Chief Minister.</block>

<p>It is quite clear that a new approach is necessary. We on this side of the House have outlined what our approach is to the urban Bantu. We have outlined it under the new circumstances which are developing, circumstances which will have to take account of the fact that the Black worker who is to be trained to become a skilled or semi-skilled worker in industry is going to be with us to a much greater degree of permanency than in the past. It is not going to be so easy to move him back to the Reserves and do without him from time to time. That is why we plan a vastly changed approach to this section of the community as was outlined by the hon. member for Transkei in the speech which he made. We recognize, above all, the vital importance that these people should have a stake in the maintenance of law and order in their own areas, their own urban townships. We have indicated how we believe that stake could be built up and what we believe ought to be done. We have said very clearly that we wanted to make it possible for them to acquire freehold title to their homes in the urban townships. We wanted them to enjoy undisturbed family life. We wanted to foster actively the emergence of a responsible stable class of Bantu town-dweller. In practical effect we committed ourselves to various other matters with which the hon. member dealt.</p>

<p>I do not believe that you can have a satisfied, stable labour force unless regard is had to those very issues. I want to ask the hon. members on the other side of the House whether they are now prepared to abolish job reservation and to undertake to protect workers by ensuring that no changes will be effected in the labour pattern without consultation with and the cooperation of the trade unions concerned, and by applying the principle of the rate for the job to avoid unfair competition, something which is not happening today. There is completely unfair competition between the wage rates in border industries and other areas in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to ask them secondly whether they are prepared to arrange for training, control and the necessary safeguards for the efficient utilization of skilled and unskilled labourers, because if they are not prepared to get on with the job of training labour, and training it rapidly, then they are never going to get the growth which is vital to South Africa and they are going to be faced with unprecedented inflation in the country.</p>

<p>There is a third problem with which they are faced and this is the question of employer/employee labour relations. I want to ask them if they are prepared to arrange for the collective representation of Bantu labour in a manner to be determined after consultation with existing trade unions and organized management. Because, if they do not, they are going to be faced with unhappiness, unsettlement, restivenesss and more and more strikes throughout South Africa. It is no answer to me to say that those strikes are illegal. Everybody knows that they are illegal, but they are taking place, and the result has been higher wages in many areas.</p>

<p>I take it a little further. Are they prepared to make elementary education available to all Bantu children&#x003F; Are they prepared to provide secondary and technical education facilities for the urban Bantu in the White areas&#x003F; These are all points that have to be dealt with. Are they prepared to bring about changes in movement control which will allow the wife of a Bantu worker to join him, provided he is in permanent employment and in a position to support the family, and accommodation is available&#x003F; In many cases that is refused today. Why&#x003F; Are they prepared to restore the spirit of section 10 of the Bantu Urban Areas Act of 1945, which accepts that if a Bantu enters a prescribed area on certain terms he has rights of permanent residence as in the past&#x003F; If they do not, they are going to be faced with more uncertainty, more difficulties and more troubles building up for them, and they are not going to develop that stake in the maintenance of law and order.</p>

<p>Then there is something else they have to look at. They are going to have to look at the sort of amenities they make available for these people, not only as regards the Bantu in the urban townships, but also the urban Bantu employed in the White areas and living with their employers or on their premises. We on this side of the House have been committed not only to provide separate amenities for each race; we have been committed also to make arrangements so that individuals of different races can enjoy certain amenities together. I have said to the hon. the Prime Minister before that it is a disgrace that <span class="col_4273-4274" refersTo="page_0690"/>there is not a restaurant in certain towns where a civilized White man and a civilized Black man can sit down to discuss things around a table. I have indicated that as far as we are concerned, we believe that where there are public amenities, those amenities should not only be separate for the different races, but that there should be an area of choice, amenities available to both to be enjoyed by those who wish to enjoy them. I believe this may be one of the ways in which we can create very much better race relations. But one thing is quite certain, and that is that the present state of affairs introduced by this Government cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>There are certain essentials, which I have outlined. But, Sir, unless change comes and comes very quickly, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget is going to be even a bigger failure than some of us anticipated. I have said that the Government is badly placed in the socio-economic field. But the result of more permanent Black workers living in White areas, more highly trained workers, people with permanent employment and higher living standards, is going to create political problems for the Government as well, political problems in respect of which they are not very well situated at the present time. What is going to happen&#x003F; After everything possible and impossible has been done to implement Government policy, they are going to find themselves in the end with a residual position, which will have to be solved, or we will not have continued peace and prosperity in South Africa. They are going to be faced with Whites in the White areas in the four provinces governed by this Parliament through provincial councils with ever decreasing powers. They will probably have eight or nine Bantu homeland areas. I wonder how many of them are going to accept independence. A number of them are already indicating that they are not going to. The hon. the Prime Minister has indicated that the present position will continue. For how long&#x003F; Does he think he will continue to satisfy them in this way&#x003F; Already he is being told that, on the terms the Government is offering, certain homelands will not accept independence. What will his position be as the years go by and he is stuck with those people&#x003F; What is he, in any case, going to do about the Coloureds who, with very limited political rights, are developing fast in the socio-economic field an playing an ever bigger role in the economic life of South Africa&#x003F; What is he going to do about the Indian community&#x003F; He is faced with troubles there of exactly the same kind. How does the Government propose to deal with this situation which is going to be accentuated by this very industrial development which the hon. the Minister is hoping to promote with his Budget&#x003F;</p>

<p>What is he going to do about the Bantu permanently settled in the urban areas&#x003F; We have our answers. We have given our answer on many occasions. We protect the position of the more advanced groups by making this Parliament the regulator. We give the various groups legislative assemblies so that they can, in a large measure, control their own affairs. We create a federal body to decide, to advise and to help in matters of common interest. What has the hon. the Prime Minister to offer&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, wait a moment. The hon. member for Maitland is one of my intimate friends. He took part in this debate, but is not in his seat at the moment. I, as Whip, have stood up to say that we on this side of the House know that he is a clever member, that he is an excellent parliamentarian, much better than the one who has just interrupted me. Even though we disagree with one another, we are nevertheless a Christian people with Christian orientated parties, and I therefore say on behalf of this side of the House, as I have also said to the Chief Whip on that side of the House, that we are glad to hear that there has been some improvement in the hon. member for Maitland&#x2019;s condition and we hope that in the next debate he will be back in the House again. Though I was greeted with laughter when I stood up, I want to say at once that I know how to conduct myself in showing respect for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I have an exceptional amount of respect for him. I shall come back to him in a moment. I know that the hon. the Minister of Finance will deal with the financial and other matters which he raised. I briefly want to say that as far as I am concerned this debate is a wonderful debate. It was not my intention to take part in it, but I am now doing so, for a certain reason, in fact. There were a few highlights in this debate. One of the fine moments, which struck me, was the excellent contribution the hon. member for Green Point made. Why do I say that he made a fine contribution&#x003F; Is today, 6th April, not the day on which Van Riebeeck came to this country 321 years ago&#x003F; After 321 years, we have here a Christian nation with a Christian make-up, and do we not owe a great deal of thanks to the Scottish ministers&#x003F; When I see how the hon. member for Green Point fought for State security and for the maintenance of this Christian state I see in him a true descendant of the Andrew Murrays to whom I want to pay tribute today. That is why I am glad the hon. member acted in that way.</p>

<p>*I want to mention a few other moments. It is a very good thing that the hon. member for North Rand is walking out. His conduct towards me was worse than mine towards the hon. the Leader of the Opposition or any others. There was also another fine moment I experienced in the 30 years I have been in this House. It is such a fine thing that both sides of the House are so deeply concerned about the youth of South Africa, whether they be English or Afrikaans speaking students. As the lawmakers of this country, both sides of the House have displayed affection and love for their children. Those children are the future of our people, not so&#x003F; I also witnessed a fine moment when an English-speaking person on this side of the House, who was the principal of a university, spoke of the cancer gnawing at the inner strength of our youth. There was absolute silence on both sides of the House when he spoke. This was a fine thing, as far as I am concerned, because it was the first time in the 30 years I have been in this House that an English speaking Member of Parliament on this side of the House, delivered by English speaking South Africans, was not discredited while making a speech. I found it to be a wonderful moment. The speeches of most English speaking members, who spoke previously, were so differently received. I have found it to be one of the fine moments in this Budget debate that the Opposition conducted themselves in that fashion even though differences do exist.</p>

<p>Another fine highlight was this: Since today is 6th April, the day on which this Christian State came into being &#x2026;</p>

<p>That Heavenly Architect, in his inexhaustible creative power, established a diversity of nations, and we as a people, as we sit on both sides of the House, and forming a part of the nation, are a God-willed people with a calling to fulfil.

<p>I want to tell the hon. member, who is now trying to distract my attention, that his party conducted itself well. I can almost say at the moment I love the hon. member for Yeoville, who is sitting and staring at me like that &#x2026; [Interjections.] The Commandment states, of course, that I should love my neighbour, even though he is frequently unlovable. The hon. member is a scintillating politician and we like him. But do hon. member know when I like him most&#x003F; It was when he loyally stood by the Schlebusch Commission, as did Mr. Murray, the hon. member for Green Point. The hon. member for Yeoville did not deserve to be pelted with tomatoes. They did not dirty the hon. member because he displayed a fine, clean and generous attitude in the interests of South Africa. I do not want to dwell on this for long, but as far as State security is concerned, we must be fair on this day. Are we not a Christian state&#x003F; What is the elementary function of any well-ordered Government in any civilized state&#x003F; I think it is to maintain law and order, not so&#x003F; What is the minimum requirement the individual can set the State. It is that that State will at least guarantee his life, his freedom and his possessions. And the State, which we represent here as the lawmakers of the country, can also demand something of individuals and students. If we must guarantee their freedom and their lives, and give them education, we may surely also demand that they co-operate to ensure the security and the freedom of a Christian democratic State. That is the delicate balance that existed and the background against which this whole discussion took place. The freedom of the individual and the security of the State are inseparably bound together. What happens to the freedom of the State and this Christian country if the State&#x2019;s freedom is overthrown&#x003F; That is why I have found it a highlight that both sides of the House have conducted themselves in this fashion. I do not want to elaborate on this any further.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall withdraw those words, but it is not fair of that hon. member to interrupt me in that way while I am making a serious speech. We respect the hon. member for Parktown not only in the House; but also in his everyday dealings he is one of the most respected members because he can speak with authority on economic matters. The other day he used the concept which <span class="col_4279-4280" refersTo="page_0693"/>made an impression on the House. He said he expected the Minister of Finance and the Government of the country, if they were worth their salt, to accept those things from the Opposition side which are correct. He means that an exchange of ideas should take place here and that lucidity and clarity should result. In the exchange of ideas in a democratic system, the views of the Opposition must be accepted when they are correct. The hon. member does not only speak with authority about the economy, but it seems to me that as far as ethical concepts are concerned, he is also completely correct. If one is right, it is good, but it is bad when one is wrong. Let us today subject this concept to a test. It is exactly a quarter of a century since this United Party Opposition, which I respect, ruled South Africa for the last time. If they do not act correctly and relinquish their wrong and unacceptable relations politics, they will never again rule South Africa. That party is a party with a great deal of experience. For 30 years I knew that party and its great leader, Field Marshal Smuts. I also know the present leader, Sir Div, who is now staring at me like that. It is a party with fine leaders. I am not speaking of Harry Schwarz now, because he is truly no leader. That United Party has experienced a great deal, and it was once a ruling party with 107 members. It was a party that stood at the peak of popularity during the war years. I did not begrudge them that. If such a party has a wrong policy, and does not do the ethically correct thing mentioned by the hon. member for Parktown, the Opposition benches wait for such a party. Since this Opposition party, the once strong party, is still, after 25 years, clinging convulsively to a wrong relations policy, they have only the grave waiting for them. It is only logical that a party that must choose between right and wrong and adopts a middle course, half wrong and half right, will never reach its destination. It cannot reach a goal. That hon. member for Hillbrow, who is now sitting there in his bench like someone sitting under a juniper tree and meditating, is deeply concerned about the goal.</p>

<p>I do not want to attack the Leader of the Opposition. But I want to tell him that I have frequently listened to him, and listened to him with the utmost attention. I have been doing so for years. As far as this comprehensive and complex Colour question is concerned, the Leader of the Opposition has always said, &#x201C;No, not integration, and not apartheid either.&#x201D; There is another road, the middle road or mean. Is it not strange that after 25 years this Opposition has not yet learned the lesson and that it truly wants to try to bring about a change of government in South Africa with a &#x201C;middle-of-the-road policy&#x201D;. To follow, at this stage in South Africa&#x2019;s history, the dangerous middle course between these two clashing, contradictory and irreconcilable policies in South Africa, is to be moving down the road to the grave. One cannot reach such a goal. I shall tell you why. Hon. members will say that I have already heard a great deal about dual loyalty. The word &#x201C;loyalty&#x201D; is a fine word as far as I am concerned. Hon. members say they were loyal during the war years. Yes, that is correct. I congratulate you on your loyalty and your faithfulness. But there is something I cannot understand. How can I congratulate a person when he is loyal to the death to a wrong policy, yes a policy that will lead to the grave&#x003F; That is the difficulty. That is the lesson these people do not want to learn.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Hillbrow. When the hon. member for Hillbrow came here as a member of the House of Assembly, I was one of his greatest admirers. His maiden speech was a scintillating speech. In the lobbies we congratulated him. But, Sir, I like Parliament and I do not want a person&#x2019;s development to deviate. I want him to become a wonderful parliamentarian. Every time the hon. member spoke I sat and watched him. In that first speech of his he showed what a scientist he is, and what do we find now&#x003F; He speaks of the relations question; he speaks of a world that is changing. He wants us to solve this relations question. But if one wants to do so one must approach the question scientifically. He speaks of the transplanting of a Black heart into the body of a White man by medical science. Sir, there are many sciences. Sociology is also a science, and if one has a relations policy it must stand the test of science. I am asking that hon. member: Show me a policy that has only a basis and a course, without an eventual goal. Why is he fighting against that goal&#x003F; Why do hon. members on that side not think out their policy&#x003F; Why do they not <span class="col_4281-4282" refersTo="page_0694"/>tell South Africa: &#x201C;That is the basis of our policy; that is its course and that is our eventual object&#x201D;&#x003F; Sir, do you know what the trouble is&#x003F; That party has always advocated a certain direction in their policy; they have always been loyal to that, a wrong direction. The only thing they change is their so-called policy. Sir, the hon. member for Yeoville is now sitting and thinking seriously, and I know he is not thinking of Harry Schwarz; he is now listening to me. Here I have the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard.</p>

<p>Sir, that is correct. That hon. member is a wonderful, scintillating member. I believe in the theory of evolution, according to which a monkey develops into a person, but now I see a man who is changing back into a monkey. Since the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Mooi River are wanting to have a joke with me, I want to tell them this: A joke is fine, a scintillating sense of humour is fine, but a joker in the wrong sense is like a skunk in the right sense. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I have used that expression, but the hon. member did act somewhat malodorously towards me. I could not help thinking of a little animal endowed with that wonderful, perfect characteristic which is not exactly odorous. Sir, I want to come back to the subject. I shall not dwell on that hon. member for long, because I find he is becoming very monotonous and boring because he is bothering me. The hon. member shouted out here: &#x201C;Verandering (change)!&#x201D; Sir, I have seen changes in 30 years. I saw how a powerful United Party changed overnight, and that party has now been sitting in the Opposition benches for 25 years, but the hon. member was not referring to that change. The hon. member for Hillbrow speaks of &#x201C;change&#x201D;, of changes. We know, surely, that we are living in a changing world. The world is round; there is a circle of changes, but they must be changes for the good. It is no use saying that there are changes, and that changes must come, if they do not want to change the direction advocated in their policy. They only change their policy, but it remains the same thing; it is still the same baby, there is only a different shawl. That is the trouble. [Laughter.] Yes, I am glad to see that the hon. member is laughing. &#x201C;A smile worth while is the smile you smile when you don&#x2019;t want to smile.&#x201D; That is what is wrong with the hon. member. Sir, we on this side have taken change into account. We have seen changes coming. But this is not only happening here with us; there are changes throughout the world, and South Africa is part of that world. The hon. member for Hillbrow, I myself and everyone are part of a changing world. This changing world will develop. It is a developing world. I do not believe in a theory of degeneration according to which everything only regresses. Although the United Party has regressed a great deal, at least they are beginning to grow again now. Sir, I believe in development. The world is developing. I do not blame anyone for the fact that there are international organizations. After the Second World War I still remember General Smuts once pointing here in the House to the changes that were coming in a changing world. He was deeply upset. After the last World War nationalism came to the fore. There was colonialism, and discrimination was regarded as something evil. I do not even want to mention all those trends. We saw those changes. Changes are challenges. We did not evade the challenge. We came along with a dynamic policy of development along individual lines as an answer to the challenge of change. Sir, our policy is a scientific policy. It is embodied in the 1948 manifesto. Now hon. members are saying we have changed it.</p>

<p>Say what the policy was in 1948.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>In 1948 it was our policy, and after 25 years of National Government under Dr. Malan, Mr. Strijdom, Dr. Verwoerd and the present Prime Minister, the fundamental basis of the policy of separate development is still intact. After all, we do not change our policy every other day. That is why we are sitting here. But let me first come back to &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;. Do you know what the difficulty is&#x003F; This &#x201C;White rule&#x201D;&#x2014;this was said by General Smuts and others. They did not do what the liberalists and the progressives like the hon. member for Houghton are now doing. I also knew a liberalist in this House, a scintillating politician and a good Afrikaner. I am now going to read what he said. I want you to listen, and then to speak again about &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;. I hope the hon. member will now keep quiet and just open his mouth when he yawns. It is such a pity that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is absent. I really have my eye on him. I want to quote this because it also has a bearing on him. Listen, the person speaking here is one who was highly respected in this House, a man with a brilliant mind. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is an unhappy fact that there is the feeling outside South Africa that the European South African is deliberately unfair to his non-European fellow-citizen. That is not the case. There is a fundamental desire in the minds of our people to act justly towards the non-European. In general, our record in our dealings with the Native peoples of our land is a good one. The fact of the continued survival in increasing numbers of the Black men in South Africa in contrast with what has happened in other countries where men of different colours have met, shows that there has been an essential humanity in the attitude of the White men towards the Black in this land.</block>

<p>Sir, that was a liberalist one had respect for&#x2014;&#x201C;Give every man a fair deal&#x201D;! Does the hon. member for Yeoville agree with me that Mr. Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr was a liberalist&#x003F; I also attacked him on his political inclinations, but he was honest and sincere, one of the best Parliamentarians ever in this House. But what does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout say&#x003F; What a contrast! The small band of liberalists we have today are a different kind of liberalist. They are so pink, so ultra-liberalistic. It is terrible the way they throw tomatoes, and the hon. member knows I am now speaking the truth. Sir, I want to come back and state very clearly that the National Party&#x2019;s policy is a scientific one. The basis of our partys&#x2019; policy is embodied in the 1948 manifesto, and from its basis it has taken its course, resulting in the determination and implementation of that policy up to its eventual consequences. The hon. member spoke of change. What change must come about&#x003F; That is what the world wants. Even if it takes 50 or 100 years&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said it would perhaps be long after our death&#x2014;but the world will develop and eventually exist as an interaction of independent, self-determining Black states, Whites states and Yellow states. We saw that change coming, that change which is taking place in the world. We saw that international organizations were asking for that international maturity. The eventual goal and the all-embracing objects of the policy of separate development are to lead the Bantu and everyone along that course of development and to so realize their potentialities that we shall lead them to spiritual emancipation. Yes, we also want to make them economically stronger. That course of development must lead to political independence and international maturity. That is morality. That is the answer to the changes taking place in the world.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, just prior to the lunch adjournment we had a speech from the hon. the Chief Whip on the Government side, which one found amusing at times. But one must immediately react by saying that the speech had very little, if anything, to do with the Budget which is now being considered by the House. My hon. leader made reference to very important matters and problems facing South Africa and none of these questions were answered in any way by the Chief Whip on the other side. He did indicate that the hon. the Minister of Finance would possibly reply to some of these points. However, one would have thought that perhaps the hon. member for Brits would have given some attention to a very important aspect concerning this Budget and that is the question of relief to the poor and to the lower income groups. When one looks at the amendment which was moved to this motion by the hon. member for Parktown, one sees that one of the reasons why we decline to pass the Second Reading of this Appropriation Bill is that inadequate relief is provided for the lower income groups and the less privileged sections of our people. It is significant that not a single member on that side of the House has made any effort to refute that vitally important leg of the amendment. It is a matter which has been left almost entirely out of the debate by members opposite, if it has not been completely ignored by them. I, this afternoon, wish to refer to some aspects of this matter concerning the lower income group and the poorer sections of our community.</p>

<p>When one considers the surpluses that are available to the hon. the Minister of Finance and when one studies his Second Reading speech, one can only be appalled at the fact that only a minute amount is being allocated for the relief of the poorer sections of our community. I believe it is a tragedy when a country fails to recognize the debt of gratitude that it owes its senior citizens and pioneers. The hon. the Chief Whip referred to pioneers; he referred to some of the history of South Africa, but he did not, I believe, mention the fact that today is the last occasion when the people outside will be able to enjoy, recognize and honour Van Riebeeck Day, this important day in the history of South Africa, as a public holiday. When one looks at the debt of gratitude that we owe this section of the community, one would think that it would <span class="col_4287-4288" refersTo="page_0697"/>be a duty of the Government of the day to see to it that that debt of gratitude was paid, and paid in full.</p>

<p>This Budget fails in many respects. But as far as bringing relief to the poorer sections of the community is concerned, I think it is tragic that the hon. the Minister of Finance has been able to allocate, as far as concessions to the social pensioners are concerned&#x2014;who constitute perhaps the poorest section amongst all the pensioners of South Africa&#x2014;a sum of only R11 million for this financial year. The hon. the Minister said that an increase of 10% was being given to pensioners, such as civil pensioners and, of course, social pensioners. But, Sir, we must take into account that this increase takes effect only during the last six months of this financial year. Consequently the increase, as far as White social pensioners are concerned, amounts to R24 for each pensioner for this particular year. That represents only a 5% increase during this financial year. It would appear that in terms of the proposals of the hon. the Minister, the poorest section, the section which requires relief most of all, will have to wait the longest to receive such relief.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport, in the course of his Budget, announced increases for Railway pensioners. There was to be a consolidation and an increase of 10%, effective from 1st April, 1973. I commend the fact that the hon. the Minister of Transport has seen fit to provide relief for those persons from 1st April. In other words, those Railway pensioners receive immediate relief. What do we find in the case of the social pensioner&#x003F; The social pensioner must wait until 1st October. Indeed, by the time he actually receives that relief, it will be towards the end of October. One might say, therefore, that he will have to wait a period of approximately seven months before he receives any of this relief that the hon. the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget speech.</p>

<p>The last increase was also in October, last year. Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions is in the House, because I want to refer to the position last year. Last year the pensioners were told that the increase would take effect from 1st October, for a specific reason, and that was so that adjustments could be made to the means test. This was the reason that was put forward as to why the increase could not be granted from 1st April. There have been increases in the past which came into effect from 1st April.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Well, it is a precedent. I have not checked to see how many times this has happened, but I think we are dealing with a specific and urgent problem relating to the poorer sections of the community. Because this was done only once before, it does not mean to say that therefore the Government is not going to do it again. Last year it was said that an adjustment to the means test had caused the delay. I found that there had been no automatic adjustment in the case of those social pensioners not receiving maximum amounts. One would have thought that during that period of six months when adjustments had to be made, this would have been one of the adjustments. But when I wrote to the department and inquired about these adjustments relating to the means test, the reply was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is desired to inform you that it has not been found possible to review all social pensions automatically. Cases which are brought to light are assessed and pensions are increased from 1st October, 1972.</block>

<p>So the reason for the delay which was advanced last year was that there was a revision of the means test. However, it appears from the correspondence I have had with the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions that such relief was not afforded automatically. So, what actual adjustments took place during that period remains a mystery. In terms of the Budget proposals now before us the Minister of Finance indicated that there would be no change in the means test. Consequently there is to be no change in the means test as far as the Whites are concerned. An overdue adjustment of the means test for Coloureds and Indians is to come about. This is long overdue, when one takes into account the adjustments that have been made in respect of White social pensioners. The Minister clearly indicated that there was to be no alteration of the means test as far as the Whites were concerned. So, Sir, it appears that this group <span class="col_4289-4290" refersTo="page_0698"/>which so urgently requires financial assistance, is to be the one that will have to wait until 1st October.</p>

<p>As far as the civil pensioners are concerned, we welcome the concessions that have been announced. They were actually announced before the Budget by the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions when he made a public statement announcing the consolidation of the various funds. The civil pensioners are to have their increase from 1st July, this year. Consequently we have the situation where relief is being afforded to three groups of pensioners, namely the Railway pensioners from 1st April, the civil pensioners from 1st July and the social pensioners only from 1st October, This year. I therefore appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance to reconsider the position. Surely, with the surpluses which are available and with the transfer of large sums to the Stabilization Account, it would be possible for the Minister of Finance to allow a full R22 million concession for the financial year instead of making provision for a concession of only half that amount, R11 million, for this coming financial year.</p>

<p>I do appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance to reconsider the position as far as this aspect is concerned. I do so, Sir, on behalf of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, because he has said from time to time that we cannot do enough for these old people. He is in the position where he has sincere sympathy for these people, but he is entirely in the hands of the Minister of Finance. That is why I am making this appeal this afternoon to the Minister of Finance to make a larger sum available to the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions so that that increase can be made effective from 1st April, this year.</p>

<p>Sir, we have already had a debate this year in regard to the position of pensioners and the introduction of a national contributory pension scheme. I do not at this stage wish to repeat the arguments that were raised during the course of that debate. However, I do feel that it is not out of place once again to bring to the notice of the House and of the country the severe hardships that are being experienced by these old people in South Africa at the present time. People of all racial groups find that they are unable to be economically employed any longer, and then find that the ravages of inflation and the steep rise in the cost of living have made their position almost untenable. These people are then having to rely on the support of welfare organizations and other persons who might be able to assist them in various ways. There are persons who are fortunate enough to have children who can assist them. The Government has said on many occasions that children should assist their aged parents in time of need. We agree, of course, that that is the ideal; but in the hard reality of the position, particularly with the increase in the cost of living today, these people find it virtually impossible to render sufficient assistance to those aged parents, due to the fact that their own financial position is aggravated by the present rate of inflation. So these people are facing indeed a very bleak six months. Even at the end of the six months, when they do receive the little increase that has been accorded to them, the cost of living and the erosion of their capital and whole financial position will be such that they will virtually be no better off at all.</p>

<p>A number of people have made provision for their old age. I believe that it is quite tragic to consider the circumstances of many of these people who paid into pension funds, are receiving small pensions and find that they are completely unable to come out on those pensions and to maintain any decent sort of standard of living. Others have made provision by saving money. They invested money. What has happened to that money&#x003F; It is gradually becoming less and less in its purchasing power. Many of them have had to use that capital to a great extent, and so have entered that vicious financial circle of having to utilize and live on capital, and thus reducing the income to supplement the inadequate pension. Their capital begins to drop and they eventually reach a situation where they have virtually nothing.</p>

<p>I want to repeat a plea which was made during the course of the debate on a private motion dealing with pensions, a plea for the consideration of a special allowance and special assistance for those people who have incomes or assets below a certain figure. I suggested that the Government should take into account the free income allowed of R42 per month per person or R9 800 as far as assets are concerned. Persons who are in a financial position below that level should be entitled to receive some extra financial help. I hope that the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions will give this matter further consideration. His Deputy Minister has clearly stated that it is impossible for a person to live on R41 per month. Indeed, he is on record as saying <span class="col_4291-4292" refersTo="page_0699"/>that even if they had R61 per month, it would be impossible for them to live on that amount in the light of the financial position now of the country. These people can only look to the Minister of Finance for relief. I believe that the Minister of Finance has let these people down to a great extent as far as this Budget is concerned. If the people cannot expect greater alleviation when there are surpluses, what will the position be when there are large deficits&#x003F; I do believe that the position is such that this requires urgent attention.</p>

<p>The other point is that there is to be no change in the means test. Here we have a position where there are various anomalies which I hope to have the opportunity of raising again when the Vote of the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions comes under discussion. But I would just like to say now that these anomalies exist, and it is a great pity that evidently no attempt during this financial year is to be made to eliminate any of those anomalies. As my hon. leader has said in the House this morning, one of the ways that many anomalies could be eliminated would be the introduction of a national contributory pension scheme which will bring about the complete abolition of a means test. The position of many of these people, who, as I have said, rely on charity to some extent, will place a tremendous strain on the financial resources of the registered welfare organizations. The Government and this side of the House have a common outlook on welfare services, namely that the welfare services should be shared between the community and the Government. I include the churches and the welfare organizations in such services. However, many of these organizations are facing serious financial difficulties as a result of escalating costs. Consequently it is a pity that except for one group catering for the children where increases are to be made as far as the <i>per capita</i> subsidy is concerned, a very welcome and indeed very necessary increase to these organizations, there appears to be no further alleviation as far as these welfare organizations are concerned in their unending battle to bring some assistance and relief to these people. In view of the fact that the relief is such that it remains inadequate as is clearly indicated in the amendment moved by the hon. member for Parktown, namely that these welfare organizations are going to find a great financial strain placed on them because of a deteriorating financial position as far as these people are concerned.</p>

<p>There are other aspects which I would like to discuss with the Minister of Finance, aspects which are related to the subject which I am now discussing. The attitude of the Government is that they should encourage children to give greater financial assistance to aged parents or disabled persons who are unable to care for themselves. I believe the hon. the Minister of Finance should assist Government policy in bringing about this situation and review the abatement position whereby a person can claim an abatement on the basis of a person being dependent. If you look at the present position you will find that where a person is being partly supported by the taxpayer up to the extent of R80 that that person can claim an abatement of R80. Where a person is totally dependent upon a taxpayer and amount is R200. In terms of the present value of money, surely the hon. the Minister of Finance should review these unrealistic figures that are provided for in the abatement. I do hope the hon. the Minister of Finance will give consideration to this particular aspect, because the Government has said that it is the duty of children to take a greater responsibility in supporting these people. I believe that the present amount allowed as an abatement is inadequate to meet these needs and it might have an effect on the assistance given to these people.</p>

<p>The other aspect is related to the position of welfare organizations and the difficulties that many of them are experiencing in remaining solvent. The hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions I am sure is fully aware of the fact that a number of these organizations are presently facing serious financial difficulties. He knows that on occasions they have to go to the department and ask for special relief and special assistance. It is important for these organizations to be able to expand to meet their obligations by having greater financial assistance by the Government. Many of them of course appeal to the public and on many occasions the public of South Africa has responded magnificently. They do come forward and assist them, but I do think that greater incentive should be granted to taxpayers and to companies who wish to make donations to welfare organizations. I therefore ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to give consideration to allowing amounts that are donated to registered welfare organizations and other <span class="col_4293-4294" refersTo="page_0700"/>charitable institutions to be a deductible amount as far as taxable income is concerned. I think this must apply to the individual taxpayer and to the companies. This would create a situation where more persons will become involved in the very necessary community participation in welfare work. If some incentive was granted to the taxpayer and to companies this might spark off that community participation which, as I say, is so vital to our welfare work in South Africa. This plea has been made in the past, but has unfortunately always been rejected. But we as an Opposition has found from time to time that it does pay us to persist with our pleas because to be persistent with these pleas we eventually may reach the ears of the Government who then find it inevitable to adopt some of these suggestions that have been made by this side of the House. This suggestion has been made by others, eminent persons concerned with welfare work such as Mr. Justice J. Steyn, who made this appeal some three years ago, but to date we have had no reaction from the Government in this regard.</p>

<p>Another aspect which is important to the pensioner is the question of taxation on his pension. Many pensioners complain bitterly of the fact that while they are no longer economically employed and they have to live on a reduced income, they are still required to pay tax. The hon. the Minister has made a concession with regard to the over-sixty-year-old taxpayer. On a number of occasions we have pleaded for greater concessions to be made for the taxpayer of this particular age, and particularly for those taxpayers who are receiving pensions. If one looks at the Income Tax Act, one observes that under certain circumstances certain pensions are not included as taxable incomes and are accordingly exempted, such as war disablement pensions, war veterans pensions and miners phthisis pensions. I believe that the hon. the Minister of Finance could assist some of these older people in South Africa who are now dependent on a pension which is becoming less and less in its purchasing power, and afford them some relief in as far as taxation on their pensions is concerned.</p>

<p>Another aspect which I would also like to raise with the hon. the Minister of Finance is that concerning loan levies. We know that the hon. the Minister has repaid two loan levies quite recently: the 1966 loan levy which was repaid just before Christmas and the 1967 loan levy which was repaid on the 1st March. We also know that legislation was passed last year whereby certain persons might apply for a refund of their loan levy should they no longer be liable for income tax. Earlier this session I asked the hon. the Minister of Finance for information in this particular regard. Unfortunately, the hon. the Minister was unable to give me any information as far as this aspect is concerned. However, the hon. the Minister of Finance, in reply to a question of mine on Tuesday, 13th March, 1973, (Questions and Replies, col. 424) said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The amount held in the Loan Levy Account as at 31st December, 1972, was R379 766 269.</block>

<p>The position is that there are people, who have been taxpayers in the past, who have paid this loan levy and have reached an advanced age in some cases. Their living costs have increased because of increased medical costs. Many of these people require these loan levies refunded to them at an earlier date. We hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will bear in mind the repayment of these loan levies, particularly as it affects the older taxpayers who now require this money. I do hope he will give due consideration to this particular aspect.</p>

<p>I have dealt mainly with the position of the White social pensioner and the aged White person. I think that it is a great pity as far as this Budget is concerned, that it appears to be the aim to perpetuate the ratio with regard to the payment of pensions between Whites and non-Whites which has existed for many years. Surely, when one considers the pleas that have been made to close the wage gap between Whites and non-Whites, the Government has the power to narrow the pension gap. The hon. the Minister of Finance merely announced, during the course of his speech, that R4 per month was to be granted to the White social pensioner and that an increase would be granted on the existing ratio to the non-Whites too. This means that they will continue to observe the ratio of 4: 2: 1, which means that the increase to the Coloured and Indian social pensioner will amount to R2 per month from the 1st October while the increase as far as the Bantu social pensioner is concerned, will amount to only R1 per month. I am sure that the hon. the Chief Whip who <span class="col_4295-4296" refersTo="page_0701"/>spoke about the necessity for change in this Christian country and who said that we must recognize the necessity for change, will agree with me that this ratio is something which requires change, and overhaul; it needs to move with the times.</p>

<p>Do we really expect a person who is dependent upon a small income such as a social pension to live on that pension&#x003F; A Coloured and an Indian pensioner only receives an extra R2 per month, while a Bantu social pensioner only receives R1 per month. The bare necessities of life cost so much more today. These persons require food to eat, which costs more; they require shelter, which costs more; and they require clothes, which cost more. In yesterday&#x2019;s newspaper we again saw that an increase in the cost of clothing is expected. Clothing is one of the bare necessities of life. Yet we persist to expect from a particular racial group who will receive only R1 per month more from the 1st October this year, to be satisfied with the Government&#x2019;s appreciation of the work that these pioneers have played in the development of South Africa. Surely the Government is failing dismally in bringing about relief to the poorer section of our community. These people fall under the group covered by the amendment moved by the hon. member for Parktown. This amendment refers to the lowest income group. These people are expected to try to live and exist on this amount. Many of them have no other means of financial support to supplement these meagre amounts. Surely, in times of surpluses, the hon. the Minister of Finance could allow his Government and this country to pay in full the debt of gratitude which it owes to so many of the pioneers of South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>I make haste to explain that in the main this Bill actually serves to grant legal authority for certain administrative actions of the Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It has always been my contention and I have always understood that the functions of the governor and the deputy governors were rather to deal with matters of high policy than to be saddled and involved with the administrative details of the bank.</p>

<p>*In the main these amendments are being effected pursuant to a legal opinion obtained by the bank to the effect that it would be preferable for certain actions undertaken by the bank and its officials to be decreed by legislation. Therefore I want to explain briefly the provisions of this legislation.</p>

<p>In terms of section 8(1) of the principal Act the bank may, subject to the provisions of section 9, in which the conditions are determined, <i>inter alia</i> open credits and issue guarantees. As I have just outlined here, it is therefore incumbent upon the governor or the deputy governors, in terms of the existing legislation, to implement this legislation. That may be done either by way of a delegation of a specific nature or by way of a general delegation. But owing to various circumstances, which I should like to explain, it is not always possible, in view of the restrictive authorisation embodied in the existing legislation in respect of the delegation of powers to the governor or to the deputy governors only, to carry out the functions of the bank effectively and efficiently. Let me mention, for instance, that the governor and his deputy governors are often required, owing to official duties, to <span class="col_4297-4298" refersTo="page_0702"/>be abroad or to travel to distant places, and I therefore think that in respect of the discharge of administrative duties, a strong case can be made out for its having to be possible to appoint other officials to discharge these duties. Sir, as is being provided by section 6<i>bis</i> of the existing Reserve Bank Act, the powers of the board of the bank may in terms of the Act be delegated to the governor or the deputy governors, but only to them. It often happens, as I have already indicated, that these officials, who in my opinion should chiefly be charged with aspects of policy rather than with the administrative functioning of the bank, are in any case not available here to fulfil these functions, and for that reason it is essential that further powers of delegation be conferred upon other officials so that matters requiring urgent attention may be disposed of in the absence of the governor and his deputy governors. Therefore this amendment does in actual fact merely seek to facilitate the administration of the Act, to improve the effective disposal of the business of the bank, and for that reason it is essential in my opinion that officials such as the general managers should also have the right to deputize in terms of authorized delegations in respect of powers which have been entrusted to the bank and which may in the present circumstances only be delegated to the governor and the deputy governor.</p>

<p>Sir, now I am going to refer to clause 2(a) and (b) of this draft legislation. In this regard it should be noted that section 8 of the Act lays down the powers and duties of the bank, and that in terms of section 8 (1)(a) the Reserve Bank may make or cause bank notes to be made and may issue bank notes. That is one of the functions entrusted to the bank so that it may carry out the tasks of the Reserve Bank. In the past these notes were printed in the United Kingdom, but for several reasons it is being deemed preferable that the notes be manufactured locally. The South African Banknote Company was established for this specific purpose, and at present the bank holds the total issued share capital of this company. In order to prevent any legal problems which may result from the establishment and the operations of this company, it is being deemed desirable to amend the Act as envisaged in the new subsection 8(1)(a). Sir, one of the duties of the central banks, and therefore of the Reserve Bank as well, is to ensure that the clearing of claims among banking institutions takes place in an orderly manner. As a result of the tremendous increase in the volume of cheques and other documents which have to be cleared daily, all the members of the clearing office have decided to establish a private company, the Automated Clearing Bureau (Pty.) Ltd. by name, with the object of acquiring on a lease basis the necessary machinery<i>&#x2014;inter alia</i> a computer&#x2014;in order to assist in the processing of the various duties of the clearing office. This company was established on 21st June, 1972. Just as was the case with other banks involved in the activities of the clearing office, the Reserve Bank also had to take up part of the share capital of the company and, secondly, the Reserve Bank, like the other banks, also had to grant loans to the company, loans on which interest is calculated and in respect of which the capital has to be paid back over a specified period. These funds are required <i>inter alia</i> for the normal day-to-day expenditure and for providing the company with the necessary working capital. Each bank&#x2019;s commitment to this company is calculated on the basis of the real volume of work done for it by this institution, and the loan will be paid back from the moneys paid from time to time to the company by its members in respect of the clearing services undertaken by the company on behalf of its members. The proposed subsection 8(1)(aB) and the amended section 8(1)(c) are therefore aimed at authorizing the bank to establish and organize such a clearing system, to take up shares in a company formed for this purpose, and to grant unsecured or uninsured loans to the company. Although this company is at present the only company to which unsecured or uninsured loans have been made by the Reserve Bank, it is considered to be desirable that a more general provision be inserted in the legislation, as envisaged by the amended section 8(1)(c), with a view to possible cases of a similar nature which may occur in the future and which will result in further statutory amendments. I want to make haste at once to give the assurance, which in fact is also embodied in the legislation, that these loans may only be granted with the approval of the Minister of Finance and that this will be done with the greatest measure of circumspection. The principle contained in the proposed section 8(1)(aC), i.e. that the bank may take up shares in companies with limited liability, is no new principle; it already exists. In this regard I must point out that as far back as 1949 the bank was <span class="col_4299-4300" refersTo="page_0703"/>authorized, in terms of the provisions of section 6(1) of the National Finance Corporation Act, Act No. 33 of 1949, to take up shares in this particular corporation, and at present the Reserve Bank holds 10% of the issued capital of the corporation, i.e. R600 000. However, except for the shares that had to be taken up in the South African Banknote Company and the Automated Clearing Bureau (Pty.) Ltd., as I have already explained, one may have the position developing in the future that the bank will also have to take up shares of members in other companies with limited liability for the proper discharge of the duties entrusted to it and for the effective handling of its operations. Therefore the relevant subsection specifically seeks to delegate by law such a power to the bank, to make provision for taking up such shares of members in such companies with limited liability, as it is done in the case of the taking up of shares in other banking institutions, but I want to repeat that this can only be done with the approval of the Treasury.</p>

<p>I shall now refer to clause 2(d) of the Bill. Section 9(c) of the Act provides that the bank may not lend or advance money on mortgage of fixed property or on notarial or other bond or cession thereof except to an officer or employee of the bank for the purpose of enabling him to acquire a dwelling for his own use. However, as section 8 of the Act deals with the actual powers of the bank, I endorse the standpoint that the powers of the bank, as provided for in section 9(c) at present should rather be incorporated specifically with the provisions of section 8 as they could be more appropriately written into that section. As section 8(1)(n) will read, if this Bill is passed, it will in future also be possible for money to be lent to the spouse of an official or employee of the bank. I want to say at once that I have in the meantime given consideration to an extension of the bank&#x2019;s powers to grant loans to the spouse of an employee as well. For various reasons I do not think it fit to proceed with this principle, and I want to notify hon. members now that I shall propose an amendment at the Committee Stage in order to delete this extension in the power of the bank to grant a loan to a spouse of an official.</p>

<p>The proposed subsection 8(1)(o) provides that the bank may alienate immovable property. In this regard I must explain at once that this power to alienate immovable property was not previously provided for in the Act. However, I think hon. members will concede at once that it is actually incompatible that the bank will have the right to acquire immovable property and will, on the other hand, not have the power to alienate it. In the absence of this particular power it happened that the bank wanted to donate certain property to the city council of Pretoria for the purposes of widening a street. The bank subsequently experienced tremendous problems in having the transfer of the property effected. Therefore I think that there cannot be any basic objections to this proposed provision.</p>

<p>The remaining clauses of the Bill are merely of a consequential nature and I do not think they require any further explanation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have no objection to this Bill, but there are one or two points on which we should like to have clarity. In clause 1 of the Bill authority is now given to the board to delegate not only the Governor or to any Deputy-Governor, but to any other officer of the Bank. I think there are three questions here which have to be asked. First of all I should like to know whether the board will retain the responsibility for any of the actions of the person to whom that authority is delegated. This seems to be commonly accepted, but we should like an assurance on that point. The second question is how far down the line this delegation will go. This is a problem we find in many Bills. We should like to say that authority should be delegated to a senior member of the Bank in this case, but apparently there is no way of finding a legal definition of &#x201C;a senior member&#x201D;. Since we have raised this matter three, four or five times, I think it is time the Government gave some thought to finding a definition so that we will know where this delegation stops. The third point I wish to raise is in connection with the statement by the hon. the Deputy Minister that the Deputy-Governor may be away. However, the Bank has three Deputy-Governors. Are they all sent away at the same time&#x003F; I should imagine that it would be rather unusual for the Governor and the three Deputy-Governors not to be in South Africa. However, we do not have a basic objection in this regard. In regard to the proposed subsection (1)(aB), inserted by clause (a), which has as its object the establishment and organization of a clearing <span class="col_4301-4302" refersTo="page_0704"/>system, I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister thinks that this power is wide enough. We know about the on-line system with the computer which is being organized by the banks, but this paragraph gives the Reserve Bank the right to &#x201C;establish and organize&#x201D;. I am not sure whether it includes the right to participate. In other words, if this clearing system is not being established or organized by the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank may not have the right, in terms of this clause, to participate in the scheme. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister may well be advised to consider including the word &#x201C;participate&#x201D; in this clause so that it would read &#x201C;establish and organize or participate in a clearing system&#x201D;. Actually, I do not think the Reserve Bank either established or organized the system, although it might have had something to do with it.</p>

<p>With regard to clause 2(d), I am glad that the hon. the Minister has taken out this right of a spouse to be able to borrow. We saw certain problems that might arise in the event of the spouse of a member of the bank becoming divorced or dying, when there would be the strange position that the loan would be really to the employee, but in fact the bond would be registered against his divorced or deceased wife. Now this provision puts the position right.</p>

<p>I am not altogether at one with the hon. the Deputy Minister on the question of donations. Before we approve of this particular subsection in the Committee Stage, we would like some more information. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that perhaps the Reserve Bank might want to donate a property to the city of Pretoria. I can see no reason whatsoever for the Reserve Bank donating any building to anybody. It is a business institution. It is an organization which has shareholders, makes profits and pays dividends. It seems to me that there is no reason to provide in this Bill for a donation of immovable property by the Reserve Bank. If the unlikely occasion should arise that the Reserve Bank wants to donate one of its properties to somebody, institution, ex-governor or Minister of Finance, whatever the Minister may decide to do, I think he should come specifically to Parliament for that authority. I do not believe that the donation of property forms part of the objects of the Reserve Bank. Subject to those comments we will support the Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have before us here this afternoon a very small Bill, but I wonder whether we all realize its importance. If we consider that this amending Bill deals with the South African Reserve Bank, it is perhaps of importance to take cognizance of the fact that the Reserve Bank may be of greater importance than most of us realize. This Reserve Bank controls, determines, directs and regulates the monetary as well as the credit policy of South Africa. This in itself affects every male and female citizen of this country. The Budget which is presented annually, affects one and all in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Finance this year made available to us the statistical survey for 1973-&#x2019;74 for which we may all be grateful. This survey contains no less than 13 pages of statistics, data, and so forth, taken from the annual report of the Reserve Bank. I would just like to mention one or two of these before returning later to the amendments effected in the Bill. So, for example, I may mention the distribution of the net national income, the gross domestic expenditure, the changes against the previous year in the total supply and use of goods and services, personal income, expenditure and savings, the composition of private consumption expenditure, the gross domestic investment. I could mention many more, such as the balance of payments which we are concerned about every day and which I shall also have something to say about in a moment. Another sub-heading is &#x201C;money and near-money in the hands of private businesses and households&#x201D;. Another paragraph in this report deals with public debt. All these things I have just mentioned just show us how important the Bill before us is.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to point out that the Reserve Bank was established in 1920 when the Currency and Banking Act, Act No. 31 of 1920, was passed. This Bill gave the Reserve Bank the sole right to issue notes for the following 25 years. In 1944 the Minister of Finance, the late Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr, brought into being the South African Reserve Bank Act, Act No. 29 of 1944, and it is perhaps important to note what the then Minister of Finance said. I quote from Hansard, column 5615, of 21st April, 1944&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now, of course, it is customary for a central bank to have the sole right of note issue, and it is not usual for that right to be subject to a time limit such <span class="col_4303-4304" refersTo="page_0705"/>as was imposed in the Act of 1920. Our Reserve Bank, when it was instituted, however, was in the nature of an experimental venture, and that is why this probationary period was provided for in the Currency and Banking Act. I said that our Reserve Bank was in the nature of an experimental venture in the first instance. Perhaps I should explain that. Of course, our Reserve Bank was by no means the first central bank in the world, but it was, one may say, the first central bank of its particular kind. Prior to 1920 central banks existed only in the older states of Europe, and outside Europe in the United States, in Java and in Japan.</block>

<p>We can therefore see that at that stage we had already taken the lead just as this small country of ours has taken the lead in many fields, such as heart transplantations, and so forth. Experiments were made and the venture was perfected, though not completely. I shall likewise indicate later that in this Bill we have a further amendment. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was then no central bank in any of the newer States of Europe; there was no central bank in South America or Central America and there was no central bank in the British Empire or commonwealth except in Great Britain, and generally one may say there was no central bank anywhere in the world in a country which had reached more or less the same stage of economic development as that which the Union had attained in 1920. We in the Union were therefore in 1920 experimenting in establishing in a relatively young and undeveloped country a bank which would at once be the bank of issue for the country and which would also fulfil the role of a central bank as the centre of the monetary and banking system of the country. The constitution therefore of the banks which were in existence at that time in the older countries&#x2014;the Bank of England, for instance, or the central banks in the older countries of Europe&#x2014; the constitutions of those banks were not very helpful to us in laying down the basis on which our own central bank should operate and as a matter of fact in the laying down of the provisions of the Currency and Banking Act in this regard it was to the United States and to Java that reference was chiefly made.</block>

<p>This shows us how we made an experiment at that time which was later perfected completely. By means of this Bill further attempts are being made to improve something which was not perfect at that time. In 1944 the scope of the Act was also extended considerably as we are also endeavouring today to extend the scope of the Reserve Bank by means of this Bill and to create more channels for it. I shall deal with this in greater detail when coming back to the various clauses at a later stage. Adjustments have been made to extend the Act in accordance with the developing concept of the scope of the central bank. In which way the Act has been extended and what has stemmed from that I want to elucidate by quoting further from what Mr. Hofmeyr said at that time. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> with regard to the Reserve Bank (Column 5156)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Holding that position, in addition to the issue of notes, it fulfils the threefold functions of a central bank. It centralizes the cash reserves of the Union. It fixes rates of discount and so exercises a general control over banking operations, and it regulates the amount of currency in accordance with the demands of the country&#x2019;s business. I say that the bank has successfully established its position in the economic life of the Union in the fulfilment of those functions. In view of those facts and in view also of the very high prestige which our South African Reserve Bank has today throughout the world, it is right that we should now regard it as having passed through its period of probation, and grant it its charter without limitation of time for the future.</block>

<p>This shows us how its powers were then extended. In terms of Act No. 29 of 1944, the bank at that time attained the right to print bank notes for all time in the future. We simply could not always have our bank notes printed overseas and elsewhere. It became very necessary that for administrative reasons, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, we should change to a position where a private company would print all the notes. I just want to refer to the three questions put by the hon. member for Parktown. He asked whether the Reserve Bank would be the sole shareholder. As far as I know, this will be the case. He was correct in saying that only the Reserve Bank may issue bank <span class="col_4305-4306" refersTo="page_0706"/>notes. There is no reason whatsoever why any other company should hold shares in the South African Note company. Therefore he can rest assured that everything will be in order.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown also asked another question in connection with the delegation of powers. I think that the question which he asked is a very good question. I asked myself the same question. He asked to what extent the board would accept responsibility for subordinate officials to whom the powers would be delegated. After all, it goes without saying that just as the directors accept responsibility for the governor and the deputy-governors when powers are delegated to them, they must also accept responsibility if, for example, they go one step lower. As the hon. member for Parktown said, it is of course a difficult matter to define exactly who is a senior official and where the line must be drawn. It is true that we live in a time of specialization. Now it may be with the various facets of the bank, as in any other large undertaking, that there will be specialized people in certain fields. Let us assume there are five men who specialize in one field&#x2014;say, arguments&#x2019; sake, in the field of foreign payments&#x2014;and that the third man in that section is the capable man who has first claim to further promotion in the future. He is the man who has made a thorough study of that section. He is conversant with those matters because he has been overseas and he knows what is going on there. He knows exactly what all the answers are, from A to Z. Now it would be difficult for me to tell official No. 1 of the subordinate officials to take part in a conference or to handle certain transactions or matters, and not official No. 3. On account of other circumstances and as a result of certain other rules which applied, official No. 1 reached a position higher than that occupied by official No. 3. Official No. 3 was, however, exceptionally suited to handle that matter. We believe in efficiency and this Budget has also aimed at greater efficiency and productivity. Since this is the case, as far as I am concerned this is the obvious procedure and I shall not find fault in our using official No. 3 to handle this matter on behalf of the Reserve Bank and on behalf of South Africa. The Reserve Bank is in all respects in the service of South Africa. It is therefore in the interests of banking, and in the interests of the private sector, the State and all of us that official No. 3 should handle the transaction. These powers which we are going to grant in terms of this amending legislation are of course only administrative. Without our or anybody else knowing about it the board could have delegated certain powers. Now everything is put very clearly. These people may now act within the law, within their authority and within their powers. However, this indicates to me that if we were to do this, we would achieve greater productivity and would utilize our manpower to better effect than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

<p>In the second place, we are dealing with the training of junior staff. This year&#x2019;s Budget holds out the prospect that much will be done in South Africa to provide employees with in-service and out-of-service training. Through this powers will be delegated to a certain extent, but it will not be done to a large extent and powers will not be irresponsibly delegated either. The powers which are to be delegated will not be substantial, but in this way a junior official will be given the opportunity to receive training so that should it happen that the governor or the deputy-governor is absent or has perhaps died, they will be able to know how to handle matters. Then the junior officials who have had the training, will be experienced and they will know how to handle the matter. At the moment there are a governor and three deputy governors. Anything may happen in this life. An example of what can happen was when the chiefs of the Wool Board were all killed as a result of an aircraft accident. For that reason I say that in any organization it is a very good thing that one&#x2019;s junior people should also be trained. Then there is something else concerning the delegation of powers. Say, for example, a deputation of two men from the Reserve Bank has to be sent to a conference. The board can send one of the deputies and a junior as well because then one has a senior official there while the junior can be trained by taking part in the discussions and by learning to carry responsibility.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown also raised another question when he referred to something which in my opinion is of tremendous importance in the world in which we are living today. He referred to the clearing system in South Africa. We live in the age of the computer. Mankind would never have been able to land on the moon were it not for the computer. Likewise, not much would have been achieved <span class="col_4307-4308" refersTo="page_0707"/>today in the field of banking had use not been made of computers. As far as this matter is concerned, I agree with the hon. member for Parktown. In the future much more use will have to be made of computers. Let us take the airways as an example. Today one walks into an airways office to book a seat. The lady sits at the computer and by employing a few figures and codes she can tell you in a flash whether there is a seat on that aircraft or not. All data concerning bookings throughout the Republic are contained in the brain of the computer and if there are vacant seats&#x2014;it does not matter where you want to go&#x2014;you can immediately book your seat. If we were unable to use computers in our banking sector, the clearing system would become an impossibility.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether we could not go further with this Bill. If there is any doubt about that, I shall support it. I agree with the hon. member for Parktown that there should be no obscurity concerning any clause in a Bill. I personally think that the clause as it stands here is not obscure. If I had introduced something of which I am in charge, I could do what I liked with it and if I should want to organize it further, I could organize it for whatever ends I liked; the same goes for the accounting system of the Reserve Bank. If however, there is any doubt about that it will be very easy to change it in the Committee Stage. Let us then put it very clearly, without any shadow of doubt, that the Reserve Bank has all those powers. However, should any further doubt exist, I would go so far as to say that we should make those powers far wider. I think it is for the hon. the Deputy Minister of Finance to express his opinion concerning this. I am very sure that if he were able to improve the position, the hon. the Deputy Minister would not hesitate to do so. That is really the whole object of this Bill before the House. The hon. the Deputy Minister even went so far as to amend sections 8 and 9 to make them read better and fit in better. In section 9 of the Act certain objectives were, to a certain extent, negatively entrenched. Now those points appear in section 8, something which will make for better reading by far.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House would like to express our thanks for this amendment and for the powers which are being given to the Reserve Bank. We are very pleased that we have such a Reserve Bank in South Africa. As I have said, it was really an experiment; this bank was a prestige bank, which competed in the world and attained great heights. In the past, our Reserve Bank in South Africa with its governor, its deputy-governors, its staff, its reports and its documents which are from time to time made known to the public, and also with its present steps in organizing and regulating our monetary and credit policy in South Africa, has always had a very high standing not only in the eyes of the business world and locally, but also abroad; we can say today with pride that that bank, in comparison with other central banks of other governments, has a very high standing. Therefore we must thank those people. It is of course also under the leadership of our capable Minister of Finance, that these heights have been attained. For that I say: &#x201C;Thank you very much.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I hasten to thank the hon. member for Sunnyside at once for the informative contribution he made with regard to the historic development of the Reserve Bank as the central bank in our country. I immediately agree with the view he took in this regard. Of course, he is quite correct that, as our country&#x2019;s economic and financial activities expand, the burden of work on this bank will increase from time to time. He is also quite right when he says that our business and trade life in this country have become much more sophisticated. For that reason it becomes essential from time to time that we also make the necessary adjustments in our legislation, in terms of which these functions are fulfilled, to bring it into line with modern and present-day demands.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I should like to reply to the issues raised by the hon. member for Parktown. The first question he put to me was whether the board of directors of the Bank would be responsible for the actions of these officials acting in terms of delegated powers. It is correct that the powers, in terms of the Act, vest in the board. But in order that the Bank should fulfil its function, it is imperative and obligatory that powers must be delegated to officials. In the first place I want to say that the principle of the delegation of powers already exists. In terms of the existing law, the board is entitled to delegate some of its powers to the Governor and the Deputy-Governors. Naturally, the common law principle would <span class="col_4309-4310" refersTo="page_0708"/>apply in this particular regard, and that is that the employer would be responsible for any action of his employees, provided that they act within the scope of their responsibility and employment. In other words, I hasten to assure the hon. member that the same principle would be applicable as regards any other official to whom any powers may be delegated by the board.</p>

<p>The second question raised by the hon. member was how far down the line the board intends to delegate these powers. Let me concede immediately that this is always a difficult matter, but I would like to suggest that the hon. member be satisfied with the assurance that I am prepared to give, and that is that the extent to which powers are delegated will be determined by the responsibility of the official and the nature of the particular function that has to be fulfilled. I do not think that we need have any fears that powers will be delegated to officials who do not have the necessary sense of responsibility to perform the acts which are entrusted to them under delegated powers.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member has raised the point &#x2014;I think quite fairly&#x2014;whether it might not happen that the Governor and the three deputies are all absent at the same time. Sir, it does happen unfortunately. During this session of Parliament, for instance, there have been meetings of the Committee of Twenty and other committees, which normally would have been attended by the Minister of Finance, but he had to stay here, so other people had to go on his behalf. It does happen that all these gentlemen are away from office at the same time, although not necessarily abroad. [Interjection.] No, he did not attend the meeting because the Budget debate was taking place. As I say, it does happen that all these officials are away from office at the same time but there is still the day-to-day work that has to be done and documents that have to be signed which need the signature of somebody who has the necessary delegated powers.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member wanted to know whether the Reserve Bank holds all the shares in the South African Note Company. I hasten to say that that is so. That was not the position originally, but that is the position at the moment.</p>

<p>His second question was whether the term &#x201C;to organize a clearing system&#x201D; goes far enough to give the bank the right to participate in such a system. The hon. member was kind enough to mention this matter to me beforehand. I am personally satisfied that as the section now reads it would give the Reserve Bank not only the right to establish and organize a clearing system, but that the provision is wide enough to allow the bank to participate in that system. May I just explain why I say this. If the hon. member will refer to the section, he will see that it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to establish and organize a clearing system and take up shares in the company formed for the management and the operation of such system.</block>

<p>The company will be responsible for the actual clearing work, but the bank holding a share in the capital, as it does, will have a say in the operations of that company. My personal interpretation, and also that of our law advisers, is that the section is wide enough as it now stands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Is the hon. the Deputy Minister not rather putting the cart before the horse&#x003F; The reason why you can hold the shares is because of this wording, &#x201C;establish and organize&#x201D;, not vice versa. I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider that so that we can debate it in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite prepared to do that, Mr. Speaker, but I should like to conclude on this issue by stating that we are satisfied that the section is wide enough to allow the bank to participate in the accounting and the clearing system for the purposes of the functioning of the bank.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also dealt with the question of loans to the wives of employees. I just want to repeat in this connection that I am going to move in the Committee Stage that the words &#x201C;or to the spouse of any such employee&#x201D; be deleted.</p>

<p>Lastly, the hon. member referred to the question of donations. Sir, I have explained that in terms of the existing law the bank can acquire property. It can acquire property for two purposes, firstly if the property is required for the business of the bank itself, and secondly the bank has the right to acquire property to house its officials. In other words, the right of acquisition of immovable property by the bank is limited in terms of the existing law. The power to alienate property does not vest in the bank in terms of the law as it now <span class="col_4311-4312" refersTo="page_0709"/>stands. It may well be that the bank may lend money to an official who does not repay the loan to the bank and the property may then have to be sold. The property may be sold in a depressed market and may not fetch the amount of the loan, which would then force the bank to buy in that property. As the law stands now, it will be allowed to buy it, but not to alienate it. Once we have given the bank the right to acquire immovable property for purposes other than the two for which immovable property may be acquired by it now, the bank may sometimes find itself landed with a property which it does not require. The right to alienate that property is apparently not in dispute but I think what worries the hon. member is that that property may be alienated in the form of a donation. He suggests that if an occasion like that should arise, it would be better to come to Parliament with an amending section to empower the bank to do whatever may be necessary in those particular circumstances. I hasten to say that because the powers of the bank are limited in respect of the purposes for which it may acquire property, the purposes for which the bank may alienate property are also limited. They can only acquire property for certain specific purposes. In other words, they can only own property required for certain specific purposes. There is thus a limitation on the bank&#x2019;s powers to acquire property. Once the bank&#x2019;s powers are limited as far as the acquisition of property is concerned, its powers are equally limited as far as the alienation of property is concerned. Let me explain why this particular section is necessary. It happened just recently&#x2014;last year&#x2014;that a street that crosses the bank&#x2019;s property, had to be widened and a strip of land had to be transferred to the Pretoria Council. That strip of land was not sold by the bank but was donated to the city council. The hon. member may ask why this strip of land was donated. I presume it was donated because the bank derived certain benefits from the widening of this particular street. There was no need for the bank to negotiate with the city council on the question of compensation, because this strip of land was simply donated to the city council. I personally cannot foresee that there is any likelihood that this provision will be abused in view of what I have said about the bank&#x2019;s limited powers of acquisition.</p>

<p>Secondly, I believe that central banks are not easily convinced to dispose of property by way of donation. But I would like to suggest that we leave this matter here and discuss it again in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

<speech by="#roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. C. ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Since the Registrar may appoint trade mark agents and since South-West Africa has to cope with enormous distances and all the smaller towns do not have legal practitioners, I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister in which way the appointments could be made so as to cause the minimum inconvenience; whether an agent will be appointed in each town and whether these people have to apply for appointment&#x003F; As I have said, we are asking this in order to eliminate as much inconvenience as possible, because we find that new initiations sometimes inconvenience the public.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say at the outset that I appreciate the problem the hon. member has particularly in regard to the exceptional circumstances which apply in South-West as far as distances are concerned. I also realize that when the South-West Africa Affairs Act was approved at that time hon. members were given the assurance that the aggravating circumstances would, as far as possible, be met in regard to the work entrusted to the State. I want to say straight away that the work in respect of trade mark legislation is not easy work; that it is in fact complicated work and for that reason people who have to deal with this work are expected to have certain qualifications. These people dealing with trade marks and patents are required to have a particular and specialized knowledge. In the first place, they have to have a certain knowledge of the legal aspects of the matters they deal with and they must know what is acceptable for a trade mark in terms of the law. All the persons recognized as trade mark agents here in the Republic&#x2014;this is really what the hon. member has in mind as far as South-West Africa is concerned&#x2014;are, with the exception of a few, recognized patent right <span class="col_4313-4314" refersTo="page_0710"/>agents. In other words, if one is a patent right agent, he may normally also act as a trade mark agent. A patent right agent is required to have high qualifications and he has to pass fairly complicated examinations. The syllabus of the examinations these patent right agents have to pass, are prescribed and fairly high standards are laid down for these examinations. May I just furnish an example. Apart from those I have referred to, questions are put to him on copyright, the law relating to designs, law of procedure in the Supreme Court and commercial law. A patent right agent is also expected to pass examinations in physics, chemistry and engineering drawings. The hon. member will therefore appreciate that this is in fact a complicated process. The whole course extends over a period of four years. I also want to furnish him with a reply to his question immediately by saying that where this clause now lays down that the Registrar must use his discretion in regard to the capabilities of the people he will approve to act as agents in matters relating to trade marks, we have to lay down this specific qualification, i.e. that the people should be qualified to be able to do the work, and this will be the norm the Registrar will apply.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the time of the Second Reading of this Bill certain points of view were put to the hon. the Deputy Minister which we felt required more elucidation. I should appreciate it if the hon. the Deputy Minister will use this opportunity to do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I did tell the hon. member that I would give him further information during the Committee Stage to elucidate this matter. I am glad that he did rise on this occasion to give me the opportunity of giving more detail. I should like to explain that this clause refers to registered users of trade marks. The effect thereof is to allow persons, other than the proprietor, to use the trade mark. Naturally when a proprietor is selling his goods or services under his trade mark, he has taken steps to ensure that the quality of those goods and services is of a high standard and his reputation which, in turn, means his income, depends on the maintenance of that standard. When the proprietor expands the field of his activities, he may find it necessary to decentralize. In the case of the manufacturing industry in South-West Africa the same position may obtain.</p>

<p>In this process of decentralization the proprietor may agree with other persons to undertake the manufacture on his behalf and he may allow them to market their product under his trade mark. In such a case he would naturally ensure that the product which is so marketed would be of the same high standard and quality as his own product. The proprietor will then take it further and he will then enter into an agreement with the other persons that, subject to such quality controls as he may consider necessary, he will allow his products to be manufactured and marketed by them in terms of the agreement. In this arrangement the proprietor will not only give the other persons the particulars of the manufacturing process, but he will also disclose to them the important element in the manufacturing process of &#x201C;know how&#x201D;; in other words, the expertise. Obviously, arrangements such as these could be an important stimulus to the industrial potential of South-West Africa. I think it should be encouraged. The Registrar of Patents and Trade Marks is required to satisfy himself that the conditions contained in the registered user agreement comply with the requirements of the legislation and that the use of the trade mark by a person other than the proprietor will not be misleading or give rise to traffic in trade marks.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to explain that provision for registered users was made in the Republic with effect from 1948, but the Ordinance which provided for trade mark registration in South-West Africa was not amended at the time. However, a number of such registrations did, in fact, take place under the erroneous impression that the law of South-West Africa was the same as the law in the Republic. It is therefore necessary to make the provision relating to registered users retrospective to safeguard existing rights, not only in respect of registrations made but also in respect of the use by other persons of a trade mark with the proprietor&#x2019;s consent but without having obtained registration.</p>

<speech by="#roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. C. ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides for the use of certification <span class="col_4315-4316" refersTo="page_0711"/>marks. A few years ago the Karakul Board of South West Africa applied for the name &#x201C;Swakara&#x201D; to be registered as a certification mark. This application was rejected. I now want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether this matter could be reconsidered. South-West Africa produces approximately 3&#x00BD; million karakul skins per year which earn foreign currency of about R30 million per year. The Karakul Board was established for the very purpose of exercising control over the marketing of the product and to ensure that products of a poor quality do not reach the market. In my humble opinion the Karakul Board is capable of exercising proper control over this certification mark if the authority to do so were granted to them. As you know, Sir, karakul skins from South Africa are being marketed abroad under the name &#x201C;Swakara&#x201D;, a name which has become well known. I now want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether there is any possibility of reconsidering this application made by the Karakul Board.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say at the outset that, like the hon. member for Mariental, I am also aware of the special position of the karakul sheep and karakul products in the economy of South-West Africa. Neither am I unaware of the contribution it makes to the economy of our own country. An application was submitted in the past by the Karakul Board to have the name &#x201C;Swakara&#x201D; registered as a certification mark. For the information of the hon. member I now have to explain that a certification mark is viewed in a particular light. Although the basic principles of the trade mark practice applies to it, there are also other considerations.</p>

<p>It is a fact that a certification mark should be distinctive and should be capable of being registered in Part A of the register. In the third place, it must not offend against any existing registered trade mark. The main difference between trade marks and certification marks is that the latter is used by an undertaking which does not undertake the marketing itself but merely acts in a supervisory capacity. When an undertaking therefore applies for the registration of a certification mark, he must be able to satisfy the Registrar that it is capable not only of laying down the directions according to which the quality of the goods or services may be tested, but also of ensuring that those instructions are carried out, in the first place, in the case of goods, at the production point and then after the products have been marketed. As a matter of fact, this also applies in respect of the wool mark. After the product has been marketed, tests are, from time to time, carried out on the article marketed to ascertain whether it can stand the quality tests applied at the production control point. When application is therefore made for a mark of this nature, the applicant has to submit rules to the Registrar. I now want to make haste&#x2014;without taking up your time, Sir&#x2014;and say that certification marks, as in the case of any other trade mark, cover the whole field of commerce and industry, as well as the business world.</p>

<p>There is not one profitable undertaking, of whatever nature it may be, which does not use a trade mark. When the certification mark has been approved the proprietor may at any time change his rules with the consent of the Registrar. From the nature of the control exercised by the Registrar over certification marks, it is appropriate that the proprietor, if he intends ceding his certification marks, obtains the prior approval of the board. In the consideration of the application by the Karakul Board to register the name &#x201C;Swakara&#x201D; as a certification mark, the principles mentioned above will apply. I want to say at once that the Ordinance which applied before did not lay down the requirements as I have indicated a moment ago. If the Karakul Board is of the opinion that its rules are adequate and it is in the position to carry out the necessary tests at the production points and marketing points, they should once more apply to the Registrar for the registration of &#x201C;Swakara&#x201D; as a certification mark in terms of the provisions of the new Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p><span class="col_4317-4318" refersTo="page_0712"/>This Bill seeks to give statutory recognition to historic events and administrative procedures which have for many years been the practice. It may with good reason be asked why this change has become necessary after such a long period of time. I wish to furnish a reply to that question immediately and inform this House that since the Bureau of the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; has, especially of late, been receiving regular donations of books and other donations, and an increasing revenue from investments has to be expected, its juristic personality should, firstly, be established beyond all doubt so that it will be possible to utilize, <i>inter alia,</i> the revenue from investments. Secondly, it is necessary for the Bureau to be indemnified against prosecution, and thirdly, it is desirable to afford employees of the Bureau statutory protection in regard to their rights and privileges.</p>

<p>Before I elucidate the contents of the Bill in greater detail, I deem it desirable, for the purposes of the record, to furnish a brief survey of the origins of the <i>Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal</i> (WAT), or die Afrikaanse Woordeboek, as it is also known. Even before 1920 ideas had been exchanged in regard to such a dictionary, and on 10th July, 1920 an article appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> in which reference was made to a letter from Prof. J. J. Smith, then professor of Afrikaans at the University of Stellenbosch, in which, <i>inter alia,</i> he praised the Nasionale Pers for having taken the lead in collecting funds for the compilation of Afrikaans dictionaries, firstly, a more popular bilingual dictionary and subsequently an explanatory Afrikaanse Woordeboek as well. An amount of R1 206 was collected at the time and subsequently supplemented by the Nasionale Pers to an amount of R1 800 for defrayal of the costs.</p>

<p>Negotiations were conducted from 1920 onwards, and on 12th March, 1925, a joint committee of both Houses, consisting of Senators Langenhoven, Reitz and Schweizer, Drs. Malan and Van der Merwe and Mr. Krige, recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that a Government grant be made available for an authoritative dictionary. Consequently it was decided that an explanatory dictionary, in Afrikaans only, should be published; that a subsidy should be paid to the publisher; that an editor-in-chief be appointed, and that the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns should, if desired, guarantee the scientific accuracy of the work. In terms of this decision an agreement was entered into in 1926 between the Government, the University of Stellenbosch, the Nasionale Pers, and Prof. Smith as editor-in-chief. At that stage it was expected that the work would be completed within three years and three months. A subsidy of R20 000 subsequently increased to R26 000, was provided by the State.</p>

<p>In 1930 the University of Stellenbosch took over the responsibility from the Nasionale Pers, and the entire undertaking moved from Cape Town to Stellenbosch. In 1936 the Government, before appropriating further funds, had an investigation instituted into the progress that had been made. The finding was that it would take another 15 to 20 years before the work would have been disposed of.</p>

<p>Although a great deal had been done and good progress had been made, no dictionary had appeared by 1945. At that stage the Government had already contributed R55 000 and the University of Stellenbosch approximately R29 000 to the undertaking. In that year Prof. Smith fell ill and could not continue the work, and Prof. R. W. Wilcocks, then rector of the University of Stellenbosch, acted as administrative head. As a result of his illness Prof. Smith subsequently had to relinquish the post of editor-in-chief. At that stage the then Minister of Education once again, before the Government continued its financial assistance, had an investigation instituted into the state of affairs of the WAT. To this end the Minister appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Adv. A. H. Broeksma. In the meantime the University of Stellenbosch decided to continue with the work at its own expense. The Broeksma Committee instituted a thorough investigation into all aspects of the work, and its proposals contributed to the undertaking being placed on a sound basis both editorially and administratively. I mention briefly the following points:</p>

<ol>

<li>1. All previous contracts in regard to the undertaking were cancelled;</li>

<li>2. The board of control over WAT was established, consisting of: Adv. A. A. Roberts, the then Secretary for Education, as chairman; Mr. G. A. C. Kuschke, the then Secretary for Social Welfare, as member of the board; Dr. R. W. Wilcocks, the rector of the University of Stellenbosch, as administrator; and Dr. D. B. Bosman on behalf of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap <span class="col_4319-4320" refersTo="page_0713"/>en Kuns, as member of the board of control;</li>

<li>3. This board, <i>inter alia,</i> had to make appointments, control funds, and ensure the orderly and proper continuation and completion of the work;</li>

<li>4. The Government accepted financial responsibility for WAT, provided the University made an annual amount of R3 200 available. I may mention that the university has also since 1930 been providing accommodation free of charge to the undertaking, and is still making its financial contribution.</li>

<li>5. The appointment of a full-time editor-in-chief in the person of Dr. P. C. Schoonees, as well as editorial, administrative and technical staff, was proceeded to. In 1948 there were already ten full-time staff members, and statutory provision was made to the effect that they could become members of the Universities&#x2019; Benevolent Fund; and</li>

<li>6. It was stipulated that the work should be disposed of within five years and that the publication could be effected in instalments.</li></ol>

<p>By 1949, however, it was clear that the work would not be disposed of within five years, and that at the most it would be possible to complete one volume. This volume appeared on 7th May, 1951, dealing with the letters A, B and C. Since that time additional volumes, II to V, have appeared; and at present the Bureau is hard at work on Volume VI. which it is hoped will be completed within the next three years so that the letters up to K will then have been dealt with. Normally 10 000 copies of each volume are printed and bound in 4 000 leather and 6 000 cloth bindings. I have here in my desk an example of the dictionary in cloth binding. The hon. members will see that, in the words of my former professor at Stellenbosch, Prof. Smith, it is truly a bulky folio.</p>

<p>By the end of February, 1973, the cards on which words are recorded, totalled 2 411 000. The State&#x2019;s financial contribution up to 31st March, 1972, had been R1 724 246-29. WAT is printed by the Government Printer in Pretoria, and copies may also be ordered there. In addition I am just mentioning that, since 1961, in order to promote the sale of WAT, a generous rebate of up to 45% has been granted to book sellers.</p>

<p>In 1962 Dr. F. J. Snijman, the present editor-in-chief, succeeded Dr. P. C. Schoonees, and at present he is being assisted by nine editorial members and six other staff members. I should like to pay tribute today to the persons and bodies who have taken pains to promote, and have also taken an active part in promoting, the interests of this undertaking. Many of them are no longer with us, but we and future generations as well will always be grateful to them and to those who took over the task from them. Allow me to point out that each one of the hon. members may also make a valuable and lasting contribution by sending words, especially dialectal words with their meanings and usage, to the editor-in-chief. These will always be welcome. If there should be any hon. members who are interested in paying a visit to the WAT Bureau to see for themselves what is being done and how it is being done, I shall gladly arrange for such a visit to be made possible.</p>

<p>I have referred several times to periods which were determined or instructions which were given for the completion of WAT. It is clear to me that we should preferably make no predictions. Regular progress reports are made, and I am convinced that the Bureau is working hard and doing thorough work. I should just like to refer to a few well-known dictionaries to prove that we have already made good progress. Firstly I want to refer to the dictionary of <i>Webster.</i> In approximately 1800 Noah Webster began to work in earnest on his first dictionary, <i>The Compendious Dictionary</i> (1806), which was followed in 1928 by <i>An American Dictionary of the English Language.</i> This dictionary has in the course of time been constantly brought up to date and reprinted. According to the introduction the latest reprint of 1961, <i>Webster&#x2019;s Third New National Dictionary of the English Language,</i> has with all modern amenities, a quotation collection of 10 million, and an extensive, technically differentiated editorial staff, taken 757 editorial years to complete.</p>

<p>Secondly I want to mention the <i>Woordeboek Der Nederlandsche Taal.</i> As long ago as 1849, plans for this were being drawn up, which were put into effect a few years later, but the first volume only appeared <span class="col_4321-4322" refersTo="page_0714"/>in 1882. In 1922 the Dutch Government officially recognized the Commissie van Bijstand which, since 1887, had been responsible for its financing and administration, and the editors became public servants with the right to a pension, and the dictionary received a permanent basis on which the work could be continued without concern. For the sake of interest I should like to mention that from 1893 to the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War the Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek contributed R500 perannum to this undertaking. Work is still in progress on this dictionary at present.</p>

<p>Thirdly I want to mention the example of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary.</i> The first volume of this dictionary appeared in 1884, after work had commenced on it in the &#x2019;fifties. It was only completed in 1933. J.A.H. Murray, editor-in-chief from 1879 to 1915, once commented that his best assistant had struggled for six months with the one word &#x201C;that&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Since forecasts were frequently made in the past on when the work would or ought to be completed, it would in my opinion be closer to the truth to say that as long as there is an Afrikaans language, work will be in progress on WAT. For this reason as well it is necessary to regulate the undertaking in an orderly way, and give statutory recognition to it.</p>

<p>In considering the legislation, various possibilities were taken into account. Incorporation of WAT into the Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns or the Human Sciences Research Council was considered, as well as incorporation into the National Cultural Council in terms of the National Culture Promotion Act, Act No. 27 of 1969, or the declaration thereof in terms of the Cultural Institutions Act, Act 29 of 1969. I do not want to go into the merits of every possibility at this juncture. However, after giving the matter the fullest consideration it was decided to introduce no organizational change but to let it suffice, as I have already stated at the beginning of my speech, to give statutory recognition to what has for years now been administrative practice. The undertaking is functioning very well at present at the University of Stellenbosch, and therefore there is no good reason why an organizational change in or relocation of WAT should be necessary. In fact, such a change or relocation would place a considerable additional financial burden on the State. In the second place one cannot, with a single stroke of the pen, undo the historical tradition of this matter. The University has had a lion&#x2019;s share in the establishment of the undertaking, is still making its annual cash contribution of R3 200, and is providing WAT with accommodation as provided in clause 2(2), read in conjunction with clause 1(i); in addition this accommodation is being made available free of charge. In the third place the Rector serves on the Board of Control as Administrator, in terms of clause 5(1)(b), and in terms of clause 8 he exercises all the powers of the Board of Control, subject to certain restrictions, between meetings of the Board. Apart from these considerations, the University offers the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; undertaking an academic context which is very conducive to the work because in virtually all fields professional assistance may be obtained from the teaching staff, and temporary office assistance from the students. This assistance is rendered at a remuneration which entails relatively little expenditure for the State.</p>

<p>The circumstance that a dictionary should be accommodated at the university, is nothing new. <i>Die Woordeboek Der Nederlandsche Taal</i> has close ties with the University of Leyden, and the Oxford English Dictionary with the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has for many years now been the policy that the conditions of service of the WAT staff, as far as is practicable, should correspond to those of the University of Stellenbosch, but apart from this policy and apart from pension benefits, those staff members have very little to fall back on, and they enjoy no statutory protection. It was therefore felt that it was time the necessary provision was made, and with this in view you have this Bill before you today. A practical problem which similarly made such a step desirable, cropped up when the interest from an investment made by the late. Prof. T. H. le Roux accrued to WAT, and it was not possible to receive it because there was no juristic person. This contingency is now being provided for by means of clause 2(1), apart from the moneys for which this specific provision is being made in clause 12. I can only hope that more such bequests to the benefit of the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; undertaking will occur in future. In the third place it is necessary to protect the work being done by WAT against prosecution. Last year there were reports in the Press to the effect that a court order <span class="col_4323-4324" refersTo="page_0715"/>had been requested against the Oxford Dictionary on the usage of certain words, as well as against the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Macmillan, as Chancellor of the University of Oxford. According to a report in the <i>Nieuwe Rotterdamse Courant</i> of 17th November, 1970 an action was brought against the <i>Groot Nederlandse Woordeboek</i> (<i>Van Dale</i>) in regard to certain words. Although the Bureau proceeds judiciously and responsibly when a word or expression is being considered for inclusion, it has been deemed necessary to insert clause 17.</p>

<p>In clause 5(1)(c) the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns is empowered to nominate persons with a view to the appointment of one person to the Board of Control. The Akademie has always displayed great interest in this undertaking and rendered valuable assistance, particularly in the field of spelling problems. The good co-operation of this body in the past is appreciated, and for that reason, as was the case under the administrative arrangement, this representation is being continued.</p>

<p>The present members of the board of control are: Dr. J. T. van Wyk&#x2014;chairman (Secretary for National Education); Prof. J. N. de Villiers&#x2014;administrator (Rector: University of Stellenbosch); Prof. H. B. Thom&#x2014;member; Prof. G. P. J. Tr&#x00FC;mpelmann&#x2014;member; Dr. S. H. Pellissier&#x2014;member, and Prof. W. Kempen&#x2014;member (Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns). The conditions of service, such as salary scales, salaries, leave, etc., of the present staff members, are being guaranteed in clause 10. The privilege of receiving a housing subsidy or of contributing to a medical aid fund are provided for in clause 10(4).</p>

<p><i>Die Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal</i> will in future, as in the past, appear as a Government publication, and copyright shall, in terms of clause 15, continue to be vested in the State.</p>

<p>The remainder of the Bill is self-explanatory, and in my opinion requires no further elucidation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Let me say right at the outset that the Second Reading of this Bill will receive the full support of this side of the House. We will in fact make certain observations in regard to it during the Committee Stage, but those will come later.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is one of the greatest attempts, if not the greatest, to give recognition to our Afrikaans language, one of our official languages in South Africa, in our cultural and our common history in South Africa. The only reason for my not saying that this is in fact the greatest attempt in this connection is because the translation of the Bible into Afrikaans is possibly the greatest attempt in this regard, but the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is certainly one of the most outstanding steps forward in the promotion of the Afrikaans language here in South Africa. If one goes back over the years, one is amazed to see how this language, which took root so many years ago on a very small scale in South Africa, has grown. Today we have the Bible in Afrikaans. Some of the greatest works in medical science, in law and in engineering have been translated into the Afrikaans language. Even works on highly technical subjects are today available at our universities in the Afrikaans language. For that reason it is of course necessary that we should have a good standard work such as our <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> which was commenced with so much zeal in the past and is being proceeded with today with as much zeal. Then, too, I think of other technical dictionaries which are also available today. I think of Prof. Du Toit Malherbe&#x2019;s technical dictionary, where excellent pioneering work has been done; I think of the Post Office technical dictionary, which is an excellent one but in regard to which I do have one minor objection which I will probably have until the day I die, and that is to the term which is used in that dictionary for a telephone booth, namely &#x201C;oproepkantoor-spreeksel&#x201D;. &#x201C;Oproepkantoorspreeksel&#x201D; is not the translation for an ordinary, everyday telephone booth. Perhaps my hon. friend, the member for Carletonville, could provide the Post Office with a better translation, but we are never going to use that big word.</p>

<p>Just send a card along to the editor of the dictionary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I think I should do so. Sir, there are many bodies that have contributed their share to the progress which has been made with the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> and in the same spirit in which the hon. member for Brits <span class="col_4325-4326" refersTo="page_0716"/>spoke today, I also want to pay tribute to those bodies. The University of Stellenbosch has done pioneering work and has played an exceptionally constructive part in our <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> The Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie and the Nasionale Pers should also be mentioned, regardless of what the Nasionale Pers thinks of me, for they also played a part here. I think we should pay tribute to Prof. J. J. Smith, that great pioneer of our South African books, and to Dr. Anna Smit who is today chief librarian of the municipal library in Johannesburg and who is just as fond of the language and the treasures of librarianship as he is, as well as to Prof. Dr. Wilcocks, Prof. Schoonees and Dr. Snyman, the present editor. They did their work quietly. They did good work, and it is a difficult task to compile a library. I always feel that for South Africa the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is not only a dictionary for the Afrikaner people, for the one section, but that it is a dictionary for all of us in South Africa, all of us who call ourselves South Africans and who have the greatest respect in our hearts and souls for both languages. It is a long history, this history of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> and the hon. Minister sketched it to us in an excellent way. But you know, Sir, my favourite dictionary in Afrikaans is this one, which will never be officially recognized. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will allow me to quote Langenhoven, for I understand that it is permissible these days. I am quoting from Langenhoven&#x2019;s <i>Aan Stille Waters,</i> his article on the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> In that article he compiled the first dictionary in Afrikaans, with the first few words in it. Langenhoven began like this, under the title &#x201C;Die Suid-Afrikaanse Woordeboek&#x201D; and said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Following on similar previous appointments such as that of Prof. A to expurgate for us the history of the Voortrekkers, that of Prof. B. to bring down the waters of the Zambesi to us for rain, and that of Prof. C, to test scientifically the intelligence of our &#x201C;Dutch&#x201D; children in order to establish beyond all doubt their inferiority, the Government has entrusted to me the task of compiling our <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i></block>

<p>And then he gives a great many entertaining definitions. Of course I cannot read them all. I can only select one. In his foreword, he had this to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No recommendation is needed for this dictionary. The intelligent people will feel no inclination to consult another. To the unintelligent, under proposed penal legislation, the cat will be administered.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to define a few words under A. I have selected one, namely &#x201C;aum&#x201D; (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">aum, a hooped cask; is never found whole, but always in two parts, each of which is known as a half-aum, eight to the leaguer, or 32&#x003F; I forget at the moment. Derived, through Dutch, from the Malay-Portuguese OM!-OM!, an interjection originally implicating the sound made when people drew liquid from the half-aum. This is unknown in England. (In England people do not bother with small casks).</block>

<p>That is typical of Langenhoven&#x2019;s humour. Of course lexicography is a technical and intensive study in the science of languages, and we have seen how it has grown in all the countries of Western civilization. The first of the languages of the Western world which actually assumed its modem form in the days of Dante, was the Italian dictionary, and it is interesting to see how little Italian has changed between the days of Dante and the present. That dictionary which was commenced in 1612, still forms the basis of the Italian dictionaries today. We think of <i>Larousse,</i> the French dictionary, which subsequently became what was practically an encyclopaedia. We think of the <i>Winkler Prins</i> dictionary, and particularly the <i>Oxford English Dictionary,</i> the history of which the hon. the Minister recounted. The first volume of that dictionary appeared in 1884.</p>

<p>The name of Sir John Murray is inseparably linked to this dictionary. The English language has a wonderful history. Its origins, just as those of Afrikaans, lie in the Anglo-Saxon language. After the Norman Conquest excellent and important additions from the French language were incorporated into it. Chaucer helped to combine the two, and before that time the Anglo-Saxon language had already been altered and improved. Then the greater writers of the English language appeared on the scene. I am referring here to Milton and Shakespeare. I find it interesting to see how the English language has acquired its greatness by not being afraid to borrow from other languages and form a synthesis. Perhaps a synthesis of a language may one day develop in South Africa, but I am in complete agreement with the view of my friends who say that we should guard against Anglicisms or other foreign intrusions entering our language too extensively! On the other hand, however, we must not be afraid to take over good words from English, German or French in our Afrikaans language at times.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not an inordinate purist. I agree with the hon. member.</p>

<p>To my mind English is the world&#x2019;s greatest language; to me Afrikaans is the language I love the most. [Interjections.] Afrikaans is the language which I spoke to my parents, which I speak at home. It can be appreciated that Afrikaans is a precious feature of our culture in the hearts of hon. members on that side and in the hearts of hon. members on this side. I say that to my mind English is the greatest language; Afrikaans is the language I love the most. I believe that this also applies to all those who believe that one can be a South African without having to sacrifice one&#x2019;s Afrikaans identity.</p>

<p>I have perused the Bill. It seems to me as though the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of it was completely acceptable. Logically it is a good thing that we should now have a Bureau of the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D;. In essence this Bureau of the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; does not differ from the previous board which we had. The former rector of the University of Stellenbosch also served on that board, and so, too, did the Secretary for National Education. I think this is a logical recognition, which became necessary.</p>

<p>As I have said, there are a few matters which we should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister during the Committee Stage. I think this will be particularly true in regard to clause 17, which he also mentioned, and in regard to which there may perhaps be an inconsistency in regard to the requirements of the scientific definitions on the one hand and, on the other, definitions which are sometimes unfair, which have over the centuries become obsolete and perhaps no longer have any place in modern life. I do not now wish to specify any such definitions; perhaps we could do so during the Committee Stage. I just want to mention that what I mean here are in fact racial definitions, and for example the definitions, into English, &#x201C;Boereknapie&#x201D;, &#x201C;Jew&#x201D; etc. One would do well to give thought to this matter, particularly in view of our South African situation.</p>

<p>I saw that the hon. the Minister intends moving a certain amendment during the Committee Stage. I see no reason why we should object to it, but we will of course have to investigate the matter a little further.</p>

<p>I have sketched the history of the <i>Oxford Dictionary.</i> The hon. the Minister sketched the history of our <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> I hope there will be no objections due to the fact that it is taking such a long time, for it does take a long time to bring out a good dictionary; it takes many years. Experience in other countries indicates that this is in fact the case. I hope, too, that there will be no objection to justified costs which will have to be incurred in this connection. I want to point out that the costs which have thus far been incurred are in no way unjustified. It must be borne in mind that major costs will have to be incurred in order to publish such a vast, fundamental work. This is virtually the first work in the newest language of Western civilization. If I may express a little criticism, it is that as far as I can deduce, when the new reprints of the first volumes of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> appear, they are reprinted practically 99% as they were compiled 10, 15 or more years ago. Is it not possible, when reprints are made, to include the latest words&#x003F; My hon. friend must not tell me now that I am talking <span class="col_4329-4330" refersTo="page_0718"/>politics, but I still recall that years ago, when the first edition appeared, I looked up the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, and it did not even appear in the dictionary! A thing like that should really not happen. We will really have to look after this aspect as well. There are many new words which are created on that side, and on our side as well, I&#x2019;ll have you know. I do not think the word &#x201C;race federation&#x201D; is in the dictionary. But we will see to it that it is included. [Interjections.] Really&#x003F; We are making progress, Sir.</p>

<p>Very well, we can argue that point later. Our language, Afrikaans, one of our languages in South Africa, has a wonderful history. I think of the struggle which had to be waged during the First and Second Language Movements to gain recognition for it. And do not think the struggle was against English alone. It was also for the most part, against Dutch, against people who wanted to retain the old Dutch as a language, and did not realize how this new language had been rooted in the hearts of the people and transmitted in common parlance.</p>

<p>I am pleased that we are going to have a language monument in Paarl. I am even more pleased to hear that, although there will be a few minor changes, there is not going to be any basic changes, for we must remember that some of the other race groups in our country have also contributed their share to the formation and the vocabulary of the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>I do not want to quarrel with the hon. member about this. Oh, it is the hon. member for Waterberg &#x2026; Very well. I am not being in any way derogatory. I wonder whether the hon. member knows that he will not be able to read the first book which was ever written in Afrikaans. He will not know what it contains. I recall that it appeared in one of the quarterly publications of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie, which came out many, years ago. In that publication the first document in Afrikaans appeared. It was in the Arabic alphabet, from right to left. I cannot read it, nor can the hon. member. It was Afrikaans, and not Dutch, written in Arabic, the old Malay handwriting here in South Africa. As a person who has quite a good deal to do with the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie, he would do well to look it up. But it is no disgrace. Subsequently Prof. Du Toit and the other writers, Jan F. Cilliers and A. G. Visser, developed the language. I am merely mentioning this to indicate that our non-White peoples in South Africa also played a part in the development of the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>I think that we in South Africa feel that Afrikaans is really something which is unique to us. But there are persons, with whom I do not really agree, who say that Afrikaans has developed so far in the series of Indo-European languages that it is in certain respects, as far as the grammar is concerned for example, among the most highly developed languages in the West. The person I want to quote here is, interestingly enough, Prof. Theo Haarhoff. Prof. Haarhoff, just like Prof. Jan Hofmeyr, was a great liberal, but also a good Afrikaner. Years ago Prof. Haarhoff gave lectures in Oxford in which he stated his standpoint&#x2014;I now want to recount this piece of history&#x2014;that Afrikaans, after Esperanto, even had a chance of becoming a world language. Of course this will never be accepted. We know why, and I do not want to go into the reasons. He mentioned points such as the use of the past tense for example. In Afrikaans we simply say &#x201C;Ek het gewerk&#x201D;. In German, Dutch and in other languages there are three or four different forms. If I use the expression &#x201C;Ek het gewerk&#x201D;, no one can tell me that he does not understand. Whether it is the ordinary past tense, the pluperfect tense, the imperfect tense or whatever other tense is meant, we have only the one form for it. But there are other things in Afrikaans which appear to be a little unnecessary, such as the double negative which we should not have in Afrikaans. But it is interesting, and for that reason I am mentioning this piece of history in connection with Prof. Haarhoff. In those days I was working for another publication, and I was writing in that vein, and praised Prof. Haarhoff. Then a liberal publication of which I think he was the editor, by the name of <i>Forum,</i> made a tremendous attack on me concerning those words I had <span class="col_4331-4332" refersTo="page_0719"/>written about Afrikaans. A month later Prof. Haarhoff resigned as editor of <i>Forum,</i> and one of the reasons for that was because this left-wing liberal publication made that attack on the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that this Bill is a good one, and I want the country to know that we in the United Party and all the responsible parties in South Africa advocate the promotion of both our official languages in South Africa. There is something which is developing in South Africa, and they call it &#x201C;South African English&#x201D;. It is like Australian English, or American English, something which is growing. I recall how Prof. Matthew at the University of Cape Town told us that he had made a major study of this language, and that such a language would develop in South Africa. Perhaps a time will come when there will have to be a special dictionary and a special vocabulary for our South African English, just as the American language has developed on its own. I want us in this case to sympathise and support a great cultural development and the further cultural expansion of the Afrikaans language, which is a language of South Africans as much as English. One thinks in conclusion that if one could ever speak of a language of Africa, not of the West but of Africa, a language which was born here in Africa, grew and developed, then Afrikaans has the right to call itself a language of Africa as well. Let it, together with the English language, be the two languages with which we will show the rest of Africa that we not only have ties with overseas countries and the West, but that we also have ties with Africa and that we can use them as a medium to strengthen the position of our country in the rest <b>of</b> Africa, and can indicate to them that we mean well with the rest of the continent on which we are living today.</p>

<p>I shall also just leave the remark of the hon. member for Carletonville at that, and I would rather not comment on it. The hon. member for Orange Grove was apparently constrained to speak on this Bill. Initially he had a few attention-getting ideas that were quite good. He broached matters that I agree with. He paid tribute, <i>inter alia,</i> to various persons and bodies that had made a great contribution in connection with the dictionary up to its present stage of development. Although I have not liked to do so in the past, in this case I want to associate myself with what the hon. member said.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made a remark here that I really cannot understand. He said something about Arabic, which in some way or other is supposed to have exerted an influence on Afrikaans &#x2014;even if it is as far as the way of writing it is concerned. This is the first time I have heard about that. I studied the origins of the Afrikaans language under a very famous professor, prof. S. P. E. Bosholf, and I have never heard of that. That is the first time I have heard that. He also remarked, <i>inter alia,</i> that he regarded the double negative (the double &#x201C;nie&#x201D;) as superfluous in Afrikaans. As far as I know the double &#x201C;nie&#x201D; in Afrikaans is one of the legacies from the French language. The French say &#x201C;ne &#x2026; pas&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member may know better in that connection. She may have studied something else in connection with the origin of the double &#x201C;nie&#x201D;, but that is the point my studies reached.</p>

<p>As an Afrikaans speaking person and one who has a special love for my language&#x2014;I was glad to hear that the hon. member for Orange Grove also put it in those terms, and I accept it as such&#x2014;as someone who, like the over-all majority of Afrikaans speaking people, tries to use Afrikaans and speak it correctly to the best <span class="col_4333-4334" refersTo="page_0720"/>of my ability, and also as an ex-teacher of Afrikaans who made a great deal of use of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> but also as a person who still regards the dictionary as an extremely important source of information and research in Afrikaans, I am particularly happy about this Bill.</p>

<p>A very important principle in this Bill is stated in clause 2, i.e. to give corporate existence to the whole framework of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> This now ensures indemnity against any legal steps that might be taken against the board of control. The corporate existence of the board of control is hereby being established beyond all doubt. It is fitting and also essential for prove the compilation of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> to have a firm basis, and this is specifically being provided here.</p>

<p>Another very important principle is contained in clause 3. The object of the bureau, as it is stated here, is to continue, to complete and from time to time to improve the compilation of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek;</i> i.e. to supplement it after the initial task of compilation already appears to have been completed. I also find this clause very important and essential. In my opinion, the task of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> ought to be to lay down current usage by systematically and alphabetically arranging words in current usage in the dictionary and analysing and explaining the meanings.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I shall be coming to what the hon. member has just mentioned there. The dictionary must also include the words used decades ago, which were connected, <i>inter alia,</i> with articles in daily use but which have fallen into disuse because relevant articles have also fallen into disuse. These words have a cultural-historic value and can then be called to mind by consulting the dictionary. Let me mention a few simple examples of such words. The generation growing up today no longer knows the meaning of &#x201C;trens&#x201D;, &#x201C;teerputs&#x201D;, &#x201C;langwa&#x201D;, &#x201C;buikplank&#x201D;, &#x201C;veiling&#x201D;, &#x201C;naaf&#x201D;, &#x201C;remskoen&#x201D;, etc. These are all parts of the ox-wagon or the buck-wagon. The oxwagon has disappeared as a means of transport, and with it has also disappeared from our present-day spoken language the use of the names of its parts. Fortunately there are idioms connected with the oxwagon, originating in the glorious epoch of the ox-wagon, which have been retained.</p>

<p>A word can never become too archaic or outdated to be included in a dictionary. Dr. John Muir, a doctor from the Riversdale district in the twenties, learned Afrikaans after he had moved here from Scotland. He drew up, <i>inter alia,</i> complete lists of the common names of plants in his district. He then also described them scientifically. He also pointed out the cultural-historic value of words and names, putting it in these terms (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The preservation of such names ought to be regarded as a task similar to the preservation of the old ballads and folk music of older countries. Not only do they form an important, inseparable part of the Afrikaans language, but they reveal the soul of the people itself &#x2026; They are consequently the memorials of a people, monuments like the Castle &#x2026;</block>

<p>I just want to mention that the same Dr. John Muir also collected the Afrikaans names of shells and birds. He also collected popular words and expressions relating to diseases, historical terms and terms used in the administration of justice.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. He was of Scottish descent and learned Afrikaans here. He carried out this exceptional task, and some of those words and those names are contained in the present <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i></p>

<p>We know that the Afrikaans vocabulary is built up&#x2014;and now I should like the hon. member for Orange Grove to listen&#x2014;of inherited aspects, borrowed aspects and inherent aspects. The inherited aspects are those words and expressions chiefly inherited from the Dutch language of the 17th and 18th Centuries and which have been preserved in Afrikaans. Many of those words have already become archaisms in our language. I have already referred to them. The borrowed aspects are those words which were taken over from new and foreign languages that our forefathers came into contact with. Many of these words are already so old and so established <span class="col_4335-4336" refersTo="page_0721"/>in Afrikaans that we can no longer recognize them as borrowed words. Today we are still borrowing words from various languages. As far as that is concerned, the language is therefore not static. The inherent elements are those words and expressions which Afrikaans itself created, and a very large portion of the Afrikaans vocabulary consists of inherent elements. Although many of the inherent elements in Afrikaans are already old as well, new words are continually being created.</p>

<p>Afrikaans is a young, vital and dynamic language that is still growing. This is now the answer to the question the hon. member for Yeoville put to me a while ago. The language takes over usable borrowed words and material from other languages. It also creates new words or inherent elements to keep pace with technological and scientific developments, as well as development in other spheres. The task of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is then to react like a barometer and to record these words. For that reason its function is being extended, i.e. to continue, to complete and from time to time to improve the compilation of the dictionary. The compiler&#x2019;s task is a demanding one, but at the same time an interesting, fascinating and compensatory one. Mark Twain, the well-known English writer, said on occasion &#x2026;</p>

<p>Correct. Mark Twain, the American writer, said on occasion: &#x201C;A dictionary is the most awe-inspiring of all books; it knows so much.&#x201D; This is specifically where the fascination and the usefulness of a dictionary lies. The usefulness of the dictionary lies in the fact that it opens up an understanding of words, or as the Dutch writer, P. van Woensel, remarked as far back as 1790, because a dictionary (translation) &#x201C;is the key that gives access to the sciences&#x201D;. Sir, dictionaries have a fascination because they are full of the romance of words. In this connection Ivor Brown expressed himself as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dictionaries are green and blossoming pastures, wherein any fancies of curious and delightful things can meander contentedly for days.</block>

<p>He wrote that in &#x201C;A Word in your Ear&#x201D;, published in 1944.</p>

<p>Because dictionaries have a usefulness and a fascination, because they are handy reference works, because so much is expected of them, it is, indeed, also comprehensible that they can only come into existence slowly and with deliberation. We expect from them accuracy, thoroughness comprehensiveness and impartiality. The compiler of a dictionary cannot simply express preferences and disapproval when it comes to defining words. Such high demands of reliability and objectivity are placed upon the modern compiler of a dictionary &#x2014;thus also upon the compilers of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i>&#x2014;that it could take dozens of years and more to complete this.</p>

<p>The well-known Flemish poet, Guido Gezelle, put it this way round about the middle of the previous century (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is true, if we were to live long enough we would, within 250 years or so, have a complete Dutch dictionary which would do justice to our Flemish, <i>inter alia.</i></block>

<p>As is already known, a start was made on this <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> in 1926. The undertaking is therefore closely coupled with the recognition of Afrikaans, together with English, as an official language. The vocabulary of the young language had to be recorded in the dictionary so that the users of that language could learn to know it better, could learn to spell the words and could also learn to handle or use the language better subject to the great demands placed upon it alongside English as an official and cultural language. English has always been a big and powerful international language which played a dominant role in our history for a long time. Afrikaans began to maintain itself strongly against English, and the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> would have been a great help as far as that was concerned.</p>

<p>At that stage, i.e. about 1926, Afrikaans was rustic language with the simplicity, the artlessness and the directness of, <i>inter alia,</i> the hunter, the farmer and the fisherman, a language which emanated from and became a part of the South African soil. But no one knew exactly what the extent of its vocabulary was and what it was capable of at the various levels of usage. Therefore, vocabulary first had to be recorded for this purpose, of course. <span class="col_4337-4338" refersTo="page_0722"/>And that is what Prof. J. J. Smith did upon acceptance of the task. He established that vocabulary in a dictionary. How he set to work is explained in the introduction to Part I of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> It is remarkable how much help was also received from the Afrikaans newspapers and magazines, and from Afrikaans and even English speaking countrymen. Sir, the cultural value of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> must be emphasized. The dictionary does not only have a cultural value for the Afrikaner, but also for others who want to come into contact with Afrikaans culture by means of Afrikaans words and expressions. The gathering of language material is still continuing. Prof. Smith&#x2019;s collection of about 230 000 cards has been increased to about 2&#x00BD; million, and it is truly a unique collection of Afrikaans word material that has been built up throughout the years through the labours of interested parties, both amateurs and scholars. Every language lover can, Sir, contribute further to this already wonderful collection and therefore I want to link up with what the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, i.e. that there are perhaps still many words that are used in various regions, words that are still known only to our older people which can simply be written down on a card and sent to the Bureau of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> We know that they would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that we very sincerely want to thank the present editor-in-chief, Dr. F. J. Snyman, and the Bureau of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> for their dedicated and tireless labours on this great task, a task and a service being furnished to the Afrikaans language, and thereby to the whole of South Africa, and not only to the Afrikaans speaking, but also to the English speaking people. This dictionary will also be at the service of the generations to come, far into the distant future. That is why I want to wish them the best of luck and every success with this very greatest of tasks they are undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as an Afrikaans-speaking person on this side of the House, it is my pleasure and privilege to join the hon. member for Orange Grove in supporting the hon. the Minister with this legislation. Sir, we know of the hon. member for Koedoespoort&#x2019;s knowledge of the Afrikaans language and of his knowledge of Afrikaans history, but it has nevertheless been proved here today once again that one is never too old to learn, because it seems to me as if the hon. member for Koedoespoort has today learnt something from the hon. member for Orange Grove about the Arabic influence on the Afrikaans language. Sir, what I cannot quite understand is that the hon. member for Koedoespoort has to keep himself from expressing surprise at the fact that the hon. member for Orange Grove also loves the Afrikaans language. This legislation does not only have a bearing on the Afrikaner; it also relates to the English-speaking people in South Africa. It does not only relate to members on that side of the House, but also to members of this side of the House, and for me, as a member of the Afrikaner community, as a member of the Afrikaans Church and as a person who comes from an Afrikaans home with Afrikaans as my home language, it is a privilege to see that steps are being taken along these lines. The mere fact that I am sitting on this side of the House, surely does not mean that I do not love the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort spoke of words connected with the oxwagon. He was worried about those words going out of use, and I was worried that he originally perhaps thought of suggesting that those words should not be used, because the word &#x201C;remskoen&#x201D; as you know, Sir&#x2014;to mention but one example&#x2014;is such a nice word to use in politics when we are criticizing hon. members on that side of the House. Sir, the history of the board dealing with the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> has come a very long way hand in hand with the Afrikaans language. In fact, it originates with the very beginnings of the Afrikaans language, as far back as 1920 when there was speculation about the establishment of such a board. In 1925, as we know, drastic steps were taken and the board was established that very year. Although the progress appears to be very slow, one must realize that Afrikaans only came into being a brief while ago. The fact that the people involved in the compilation of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> have now only reached the letter &#x201C;K&#x201D;, proves what a massive task they have taken upon themselves. I believe it has become essential for this statutory body to be established now in respect of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> and we on this side of the House most certainly welcome it. We know that Afrikaans is a young language, and we know that in the Constitution of the Republic of South <span class="col_4339-4340" refersTo="page_0723"/>Africa it is provided that Afrikaans together with English, or English together with Afrikaans, should be the official languages of South Africa, that they should be treated on an equal footing and that they have and possess equal freedoms, rights and privileges; that all documents, reports and proceedings of this hon. House and of the provincial councils should be compiled in both languages.</p>

<p>One cannot actually compare Afrikaans with English at all, The English language is almost as old as civilization, and Afrikaans is only in its initial stage. Afrikaans only started off a few decades ago, and although the foundations of the Afrikaans language have very firmly been laid, this language is growing and changing daily. The vocabulary is expanding and it will probably continue to do so for many centuries to come. But the establishment of this statutory body will be able to give a great deal of assistance, guidance and attention as far as this is concerned. The Afrikaans language, as we all know, is a holy shrine as far as the Afrikaner is concerned, and is very firmly bound up with his cultural assets. The Afrikaans language is a principle of identity as far as the Afrikaner is concerned, and he is very insistent that his language will play an important role as far as his identity is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik is now asking me ridiculous questions, but one knows they are actually jealous. They do not want hon. members on this side of the House to express our sentiments about a language that is as dear to our hearts. I do not believe that Afrikaans is a language for only a certain section in South Africa; it is a language for the whole of South Africa. We know that the Afrikaans language even contributes to the vocabulary of the English-speaking people in South Africa. How many times does one not hear even English-speaking people saying &#x201C;ja-nee&#x201D;. You know, if two people are sitting and drinking coffee, and they do not know what to speak about anymore, having exhausted what they had to say about what the weather is like and when it is going to rain again, the one simply says &#x201C;ja-nee&#x201D;. One also finds this expression taken up in the English language today.

<block name="quote">Your language, your culture and your heroic deeds should become my language, my culture and my heroic deeds.</block>

<p>That is why I believe that the Afrikaans language is as much a part of the English community as of the Afrikaans community here in South Africa. The establishment of this statutory body entails that every Afrikaner in South Africa shall have the certainty that his language and the extension of his language will not only be laid down in the Constitution but will also be placed in the lawful hands of a statutory body. I know it is a long time. I was not born so very long ago, and at that stage the present volume of work was already half finished, but I remember that as a pupil of an Afrikaans high school I also contributed to this language. We received instructions to collect, in our immediate vicinity and in school, words with their meanings, and to also fill in these cards and send them to the dictionary. But one must be reminded from time to time that such a movement does exist. I think the hon. the Minister made a very good point when he told us today in this House that when a word comes to mind, which we think is perhaps not used any longer, or which is not generally known, we should write it on a card and send it to this bureau.</p>

<p>It is privileged for one to pay tribute to people, many of whom are no longer living today, but who laid the foundations of this great work. It is a tremendous task they took upon themselves. Many of the words originally collected are probably no longer in use today, as the hon. member for Koedoespoort said, but so Afrikaans will grow. Many people helped to build up this language. We think of the Langenhovens, the N. P. van Wyk Louws, and even today there are the writers of the sixties, whom I know many people do not like <span class="col_4341-4342" refersTo="page_0724"/>very much, but I think, nevertheless, looking at their work, that the writers of the sixties have brought a new dimension to the Afrikaans language and have given it life. We think of the Andr&#x00E9; Brinks, the Breyten Breytenbachs. We think of people like Breyten Breytenbach, who does not live in South Africa today, but spends virtually his whole life abroad and nevertheless makes a contribution to the Afrikaans language. We must also largely pay tribute to those people.</p>

Here one can issue a word of warning in the light of the circumstances in South Africa, in the light of the fact that we do not have a homogeneous community but a heterogeneous one, that we have various languages, faiths and races in this country. With that in mind one is almost afraid that one may have provisions in an act that could perhaps be dangerous for us. In the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> I looked at the definitions of a few words. I was thinking, <i>inter alia,</i> of the Jewish community. In the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> the word &#x201C;Jew&#x201D; is referred to as being&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Applied to a grasping or extortionate usurer or a trader who drives hard bargains or deals craftily.</block>

<p>That is what one must warn against so that this type of definition will not be repeated in our dictionary. There is also a further reference to the word &#x201C;Jew&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To cheat or to overreach.</block>

<p>One must not let this kind of definition get through. We have a Government that believes in nationalism. &#x201C;Nationalism&#x201D; is defined in the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> as follows, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A form of socialism.</block>

<p>These are aspects one wants to warn against, and I do think the hon. the Minister will have to give attention to this before we reach the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that Afrikaans is a language that is close to my heart. It is the language I use every day; in fact, it is the language I have been using in the House since I came here. I find it very amusing that there are hon. members on that side&#x2014;it looks to me as if it is the hon. member for Rissik and the hon. member for Waterkloof&#x2014;who are almost jealous of the fact that members on this side of the House use Afrikaans. Hon. members must remember, however, that the original leader of the mother party of this party, General Louis Botha, never made a speech in English, as far as my knowledge goes. He made his speeches in Dutch, which is the forerunner of the Afrikaans language. The wife of my leader, Sir de Villiers Graaff, is a lady with a M.A. degree in Afrikaans. And so there are good Afrikaners sitting on this side of the House and on that side of the House, and I want to say that we are all glad that this statutory body is being called into being.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it was David in the Bible who said: &#x201C;How good it is for brethren to dwell together.&#x201D; I appreciate the fact that we can speak today in so brotherly a fashion about this great matter in our language and culture. I must tell the hon. member for Turffontein, nevertheless, that it is not altogether our fault if one is sometimes surprised when these fine things come from the other side. I think it was perhaps the fault of hon. members on the other side that we have gained the impression in the past that they are perhaps anti-Afrikaans. But we do not want to go into that matter now, appreciating as we do their support of this Bill. We appreciate the fine things they have said about our language, because they are also citizens of the people using this language.</p>

<p><span class="col_4343-4344" refersTo="page_0725"/>In three years&#x2019; time, i.e. on 1st January, 1976, the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> celebrates its 50th birthday. The task that was begun 47 years ago, on 1st January, 1926, virtually as a private undertaking by the late Prof. J. J. Smith and <i>Nasionale Pers,</i> has since then expanded tremendously, so that today it is an expensive and extremely valuable undertaking of national scope. As the hon. the Minister has said, the historical development of the past 47 years is now gaining the necessary legal substance with this Bill, i.e. in making the Bureau of the <i>Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal</i> a corporate body. It is necessary for this legal status to be obtained.</p>

<p>I can understand the problems of the hon. member for Turffontein, i.e. that he is afraid that we may add certain definitions in connection with certain population groups, because the hon. member&#x2019;s leader in the Transvaal may perhaps have problems as far as that is concerned. But, Sir, it is essential that the Dictionary and its control body be protected against law suits. These matters must be seen objectively and be done correctly, and the possibility of a law suit cannot always be borne in mind.</p>

<p>Over the past year the Bureau has received extremely valuable gifts in the form of money, and particularly books, and it must be invested with the necessary authority to deal with the organization of that. In that connection I should like to refer to the fact that the widow of the late Dr. P. C. Schonees, a previous editor-in-chief, donated to the Bureau 131 books and 86 magazines from Dr. Schoonees&#x2019;s valuable library. This is a very magnanimous example and one worthy of being followed. And Mr. M. van Blerk, an ex-member of the editorial staff, donated 173 of his books upon retirement, books that are very difficult to obtain at present and which are very frequently used by the staff. Another very valuable donation is the J. J. Smith memorial collection, which was donated by Mr. Van Blerk, with the approval of the widow of Prof. Smith. Prof. Le Roux also bequeathed an annual amount and a number of dictionaries to the Dictionary.</p>

<p>Many of our people probably possess valuable Afrikaans books, some of which are Africana, because the simple fact is that our older generation has a tremendous love for books and does not easily sell them, give them away or destroy them. In our children and the younger generation that love for those books is frequently absent. The danger exists that those valuable works, standing on our bookshelves, will simply land on the rubbish heap eventually. Therefore it is a very good idea to bequeath these libraries to an organization like the Bureau of the <i>Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal,</i> which can then sort out and use the necessary books which would prove of value to them.</p>

<p>Sir, clause 12 of the Bill makes provision for the financing of the Bureau. If one looks at the Estimate of Expenditure from the Revenue Account, which has been tabled by the hon. the Minister of Finance, one notices that the Government makes a very large amount of money available annually for the working of the Bureau. For the financial year 1972-73 an amount of R162 000 was made available. For the financial year 1973-74 the amount is being increased by almost 26% to R202 600. This striking increase in the amount now being budgeted for the functions of the Bureau, must be very greatly appreciated, and the relevant Minister and the Minister of Finance and the Government certainly deserve thanks for having made available this large amount for a very important matter as far as the Afrikaans language and culture are concerned.</p>

<p>I also want to pay tribute to the University of Stellenbosch for having accommodated this Bureau for many years. As the work grew and heavier demands were made on accommodation, this university was always prepared to provide the accommodation. They also make a financial contribution, and in the year 1945-&#x2019;46, when the then Government did not give the annual donation for that year, the University of Stellenbosch had to carry the full financial responsibility. Although we are blessed with very good Afrikaans universities, for which we are very grateful and which we are very proud of, the University of Stellenbosch is actually, as far as we older people are concerned, the cradle of the Afrikaans language, Afrikaans culture and Afrikaans nationhood. On this gigantic task, which the University also carries out in respect of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> that institution deserves our utmost thanks and appreciation.</p>

<p>The functions of the dictionary have expanded greatly in recent years with the technological explosion of our century. This entails myriads of new words and terms virtually having to be found daily for new concepts and new things that crop <span class="col_4345-4346" refersTo="page_0726"/>up. Every month the dictionary receives about 12 000 cards from co-workers, and the total number of words amounts to 2&#x00BD; million, as the hon. the Minister has already said. The dictionary draws its material from all spheres of modern society, from modern science, from technics and industry. With the help of experts in all spheres, these terms are defined and edited.</p>

<p>But the dictionary also draws its material from all the points of the compass and from every corner of our country, from all sections and layers of the population and from all periods of our history. Thus, for example, the word &#x201C;p&#x00EA;rerunnik&#x201D; was received from Kuruman. I wonder whether hon. members in this House know what a &#x201C;p&#x00EA;rerunnik&#x201D; is. I will not be school-masterish now and say that those who know should put up their hands, but I do wonder, nevertheless, how many hands would go up. Inquiries were subsequently made and the people from Kuruman then sent a &#x201C;p&#x00EA;rerunnik&#x201D; to the dictionary. It is a largish kind of wheat cricket (Eugaster longpipes) which was subsequently identified by Dr. Hesse of the South African Museum.</p>

<p>The names of things that become obsolete and are no longer in everyday use, are also still being added, particularly adiomatic expressions. We have, for example, the word &#x201C;stang&#x201D;, the word &#x201C;buikgord&#x201D; and many of our young people no longer know what these mean. But if one says &#x201C;Hy ry hom stang in die bek&#x201D; or &#x201C;Jy moet jou buikgord vastrek&#x201D;, we have the idiomatic expressions and they remain a part of our language. So, too, few of our people perhaps know that a &#x201C;tuig&#x201D; also has a &#x201C;broek&#x201D;, a meaning that has perhaps lapsed. When one says in idiomatic speech &#x201C;hulle sit in the broek&#x201D;, we know what it means, i.e. that they are not doing their best and the strings are not taut. So one could continue to quote examples from our use of language where these older words, which are falling into disuse, are again being brought into idiomatic language. Thus the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is bringing together a wealth of expressions in one great treasure chest. Terms from the exact and semi-exact sciences, from the human sciences, from trades and industries, from the dialects and from cant are all being recorded and processed by the dictionary. Actually the functions of the dictionary are very much like those of a factory, a language factory which receives the words, collects them, orders them, describes them, identifies them, indicates their sources, indicates their use, and then publishes them in the dictionary. Once the word or idiom has been published in the dictionary, it is like a new brick that has now been cemented into our language building and can be used. It is consequently a new instrument that becomes the bearer of our thinking and our thoughts, and which can be of service to us in thinking more logically and expressing ourselves more subtly.</p>

<p>The staff of the dictionary has continued to expand throughout the years as the scope of the work has increased. Today there is an editor-in-chief in the person of Dr. F. J. Snyman, and like the majority distinguished people in the country he was also born in the Eastern Cape [Interjections.] I am glad the hon. the Minister agrees with me. Dr. Snyman has been involved with the dictionary for 25 years. Then there is the assistant editor-in-chief in the person of Mr. D. C. Hauptfleisch, who for the first eight years of his professional life was employed by the House of Assembly as a translator. A few of the older members will perhaps still remember him. Apart from these two, there are eight co-editors, which brings the number of editors to 10. These people are all properly trained and well qualified linguists who are doing a tremendously big job for our country. Apart from these, there are also a number of typists and technical members of the staff. These people are dedicated to their job. They are like hawks, continually in search of new words and expressions, new terms, which they bring into our language and fix there. Their work is methodical and scientifically presented, and has come a long way from that day, 47 years ago, when the late Prof. Smith began this gigantic task.</p>

<p>I should like, on this occasion, to pay tribute to this pioneer who has, since 1913, been directing his efforts at the compilation of an <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> to this man who had the vision and the perseverance to begin, virtually alone, on so monumental a work. Together with <i>Nasionale Pers</i> he actually carried the responsibility for only three-months, because as a result of the decision of the Select Committee in 1925 an agreement or contract was concluded on 25th March, 1926, between <i>Nasionale Pers</i> and the then Minister of Education, Dr. D. F. Malan, whereby the earlier agreement between Prof. Smith, <i>Nasionale Pers</i> and the University of Stellenbosch for compiling the dictionary with State assistance came into force.</p>

<p><span class="col_4347-4348" refersTo="page_0727"/>Apart from this person, I also want to pay tribute to two bodies which together, virtually hand in hand, tirelessly contributed to the development of the Afrikaans language and Afrikaans culture, and without whose assistance and support the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> would never have assumed the monumental proportions it already has at this stage. These two bodies are <i>Nationale Pers</i> and the National Party. Hon. members may laugh, but the facts of history have indisputably been proved, and on this occasion I should like to pay the necessary tribute to these two bodies.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago Langenhoven described the Afrikaans language as (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The one and only White man&#x2019;s language, created in South Africa and not brought ready-made from across the sea, which carries the traces of joy and sorrow in everything that we and our fathers suffered, struggled and triumphed through here; the one bond that binds us together as a nation; the soul revealed of our people.</block>

<p>I am glad to agree in this connection with my friend, the hon. member for Orange Grove, that the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is indeed an instrument that binds us together, even the two sides of the House, both experiencing this soul of our people and our language revealed. Since it is the only language that was formed here, as Langenhoven said, I also want to agree with this hon. member for Orange Grove that it can be carried further in Africa. It is for this language that this Bill is giving legal force to this dictionary, and it is for this language that this dictionary is being compiled in order to be used. Therefore I should like to support this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we did not expect the Bill to be dealt with today. For that reason I just want to say a few words on this matter. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the part played by the National Party in the history of the Afrikaans language. No one will deny that the National Party has also played a part. However, tribute cannot be paid to the development of the Afrikaans language, the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; and the S.A. Akademie without mentioning the name of the one outstanding person. That is the name of Gen. J. B. M. Hertzog. Gen. Hertzog was the person who played the most important part in respect of the birth of this <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> And hon. members must bear in mind that Gen. Hertzog was not only the leader, but also the founder of the United Party. The principles of the United Party are based on the ideas of Gen. Hertzog. I am merely mentioning this because the hon. member brought the National Party into the picture.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Orange Grove was speaking there was an argument across the floor concerning the contributions made by other population groups to Afrikaans. I do not want to be personal, but I must say that it always astonishes me that there should be Afrikaans-speaking persons who continually emphasize how small and how insular we are, instead of pointing out how open-minded we are. In a country like Portugal they are openly proud of the role which the Moors played in the development of Portuguese culture. We need not be at all ashamed of the contribution made by groups other than the present Afrikaans-speaking people to the Afrikaans language. There are approximately 30 million people in the world who are Dutch-speaking. Many of them are Asiatics, Orientals, who became Dutch-speaking as a result of the empire which the Netherlands had in the East. All those people have, via Dutch, played a part in Afrikaans language. I am merely mentioning this because there was an argument concerning the contribution of others to Afrikaans. Nor do I think we need be ashamed of the contribution which so many other languages have made to the development of the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>When the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> was launched, it was expected that they would be able to accomplish the task in three years in the sense that it would be possible to compile the main dictionary within the space of three years. But a language is something which grows all the time, and to which new words are constantly being added. Consequently a dictionary will never be completed. The same applies to the other dictionaries in the world such as the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> and Van Dale&#x2019;s <i>Nederlandse Woordeboek.</i> The compilation of these dictionaries has been in progress for generations, and for that reason we must not expect the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> to be completed, nor should pressure be exerted in order to have it &#x201C;completed&#x201D;, although <span class="col_4349-4350" refersTo="page_0728"/>we must certainly complete the basic foundation as quickly as possible. It is a permanent institution. As the language grows and as new words originate, so the dictionary will always grow with the language. For that reason we are pleased that the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> is, for the first time now, being placed on a statutory basis. The Bill which the hon. the Minister has introduced here, is being cordially welcomed, not only by Afrikaans-speaking persons, but also by English-speaking persons on both sides of the House.</p>

<p>I must say that I am particularly pleased that this event, which is an important event, has occurred in the year which has come to be known as Langenhoven Year.</p>

<p>There will probably be a few points which we would like to dispose of during the Committee Stage with the hon. the Minister. There will be a few questions which we will ask, but for the present I just want to point out two further aspects.</p>

<p>The one is that I find it rather strange that the first title of the Bill should be in English. Since the English titles are appearing first this year, the words to appear at the top of the title page of the Bill are:&#x201C;Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal&#x201D; Bill. This is no-one&#x2019;s fault, it is not the Government&#x2019;s fault, because I know that there is a specific order which has to be followed in the placing of the English titles at the top and the Afrikaans titles at the bottom. I wonder whether we should not, in this specific case, with a Bill of this type, consider reversing the order. After all, Bills are, when they become Acts, published as separate documents. As the Bill stands at present, it seems a little unusual to me.</p>

<p>Then I see that the Bill refers to the question of determining the purchase price of the dictionaries. This is a detail, but I want to ask the hon. the Minister, if he has any authority in regard to the price of the dictionaries, whether he would not give special attention to this matter, and try to ensure that the price is kept as reasonable as possible. Naturally a dictionary is a bulky and expensive book, but I do think that this is something which should, with the help of the State, be distributed as widely as possible, and should therefore be kept as inexpensive as possible.</p>

<p>Tribute was with justification paid to the editors, the pioneers of this dictionary. I have the privilege of knowing Prof. J. J. Smith, who was the first editor and pioneer of this dictionary, and in such a manner that I know how extremely difficult the circumstances were under which he had to work in the initial years. Not only he, but those who succeeded him, are deserving of tribute. When I say this, I do not merely mean that we in this House should pay tribute to them. We are always very quck&#x2014; I am not saying this now with any particular person in mind; on that score we can level criticism at a later stage&#x2014;to pay tribute to politicians, and to erect monuments to political leaders. We are very quick to give the names of politicians to buildings, school buildings for example. It is a noticeable failing of ours that we so seldom use the names of our language pioneers and our cultural leaders for this purpose. It is noticeable that such names are conspicuous by their absence, when tribute has to be paid to great South Africans. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that tribute ought to be paid to the pioneers of this dictionary. Since the State is becoming involved in this way, I hope that the Minister will utilize appropriate opportunities&#x2014;for example when names have to be given to institutions or buildings&#x2014;to pay proper tribute as well to the pioneers of this &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; and in general, of the Afrikaans language and culture.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I come to the hon. Opposition, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this Bill which he has introduced. It was about time that the dictionary was placed under statutory authority, and we are grateful to the hon. the Minister for that.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. Opposition gave me a pleasant surprise by supporting this Bill so whole-heartedly. Even the hon. member for Yeoville enjoyed himself when someone discussed the &#x201C;Afrikaanse Woordeboek&#x201D;. Then I wondered whether I should not consider devising some plan for presenting the hon. member for Port Natal with a dictionary. But because I personally could not afford to give him the dictionary, I think that I should give him a good Afrikaans book, out of appreciation for the support of the hon. Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove said that one was growing impatient with the dictionary. I want to agree with him; one is really growing impatient, but this is a matter which takes a great deal of time. I want to give the House one or two examples. <span class="col_4351-4352" refersTo="page_0729"/>We are all impatient, but we must remember that this is very time-consuming work, particularly if one considers words which must be neatly correlated, such as the following: &#x201C;kasaterwater&#x201D;, &#x201C;tasaterwater&#x201D;, &#x201C;koesassawater&#x201D;, &#x201C;gabbatjies&#x201D;, &#x201C;genadewater&#x201D;. &#x201C;ghwawater&#x201D;, &#x201C;kab&#x00EA;water&#x201D;, &#x201C;kienasiewater&#x201D;, &#x201C;nawater&#x201D;, &#x201C;samboelawater&#x201D; and &#x201C;skottelgoedwater&#x201D;. Sir, these are all terms used for weak coffee. Collecting them is quite a long process. Then we think of words like &#x201C;kernsplyting&#x201D;, a very scientific word. To give the meaning of this word, to select it and to define its meaning in such a way that the ordinary man in the street will also understand it is not so easy, and is time-consuming as well.</p>

<p>Then we get other instances, such as the little word &#x201C;ken&#x201D;, and the word &#x201C;kennis&#x201D;, and the permutations of the words &#x201C;ken&#x201D; and &#x201C;kennis&#x201D;. These are all words which must be correlated, and of which a meaningful analysis must be given. When one thinks of the multiplicity of problems involved in the compilation of a dictionary, and especially of a dictionary like this particular <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> then one must agree with people like C. F. A. van Dam, who said in 1954 in the <i>Spaans Hatidwoordenboek,</i> Vol. 3, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Weinig is zo geschikt om deemoed te leren als de lexicographie. (Few things are better suited to teach humility than the lexicography).</block>

<p>He too experienced this, that it is a very great and comprehensive task. Then we think of Trommius, the compiler of the Dutch Bible Concordance. What did he say, Sir&#x003F; He said that if someone contravenes the law and has to be heavily punished for it, one should order him to compile a dictionary. That must be his punishment, to draw up a list of words or a register of words for compiling a dictionary These are his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is&#x2019;t dat oyt Rechter wil een schamper oordeel vellen Waerdoor hy allermeest can den misdader quellen; Die &#x2026; leg hem op, dat hy gae woord-Register maken. Dus sal hy alle soort van straffe teffens smaken. (Should any judge want to impose a heavy sentence, with which to torment the offender the most; He should stipulate that he must draw up a register of words. In this way he will have a taste of all kinds of punishment.)</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this task which is being performed and which will be performed over a very long period, is a great task. It is a task for the Afrikaans language, a language which until recently, even at the beginning of this century, was described as a &#x201C;patois&#x201D;. Today it is a language which stands on its own two feet, which can justify and maintain itself. It is a language concerning which we can rightly say, as Dr. F. J. Snyman, the present editor of the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> expressed it (translation): &#x201C;It opens a treasure chest of quite exceptional instruments&#x201D;. Sir, if there were no such thing as words, I wonder how mankind would communicate. Words are the links between one person and another; they form the building materials of ideas; everything is expressed in words, and this goes for the Afrikaans language no less than for any other language. To the Afrikaans language which is young, to the Afrikaans language which serves this people and this country, to the Afrikaans language which had its origin on this soil, justice is being done today.</p>

<p>Sir, in the short time at my disposal I also want to pay tribute, together with previous speakers, to those who have worked and those who are still engaged in this great task of enriching our language. This <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> will always remain incomplete as long as there is an Afrikaans language. Therefore I want to wish the present chief editor, Dr. Snyman, and his staff of ten, well with this great task and I hope and trust that they will give only of their best, and will in addition devote their precious time to this great task.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to express a few thoughts concerning this particular Bill. I am very pleased to find that it is the general opinion of hon. members that this great task will actually be a never-ending process, because we are not only collecting words; we are really compiling a treasury of definition, and as such this great task will be continued as the Afrikaans language grows. I want to remind this hon. House of the fact that the <i>Woorden boek der Nederlandsche Taal,</i> which was begun in 1864, is nowhere near completion yet. There are certain aspects in respect of the collection of Afrikaans words <span class="col_4353-4354" refersTo="page_0730"/>in South Africa which I always find striking. Prof. Antonie N. E. Changuion compiled the first dictionary in 1844 and it only contained 200 Afrikaans words. What I find so striking in this connection is the fact that it was compiled by someone who came from the Netherlands, but who was in fact a Frenchman. He was a descendant of the Huguenots who were living in the Netherlands at that time. He began this task here in South Africa in an institution which was really the precursor of the University of Cape Town. It is striking, when one thinks of the establishment of the Afrikaans language and the Afrikaans people, which consisted of people whose ancestors had various countries of origin, that it should have been such a person who first applied himself to this task. Thirty years later, in 1874, we had Nicolaas Mansvelt, and at that stage the vocabulary comprised 2 000 words. Later on, under the leadership of the Rev. Mr. S. J. du Toit and the &#x201C;Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners,&#x201D; a certain programme was drawn up which was completed round about the end of the Anglo-Boer War. By then we had 16 500 words in the dictionary which was published at that time. We find that by the end of 1945, when Prof. J. J. Smith had been working for about 19 years&#x2014;he started his work in 1926&#x2014;there were already 230 000 cards containing definitions. In 1963 the cards numbered one million and by now they have increased to far more than two million. That is why I say that this task is a great one and that we must not be concerned if it is not rapidly concluded by means of this legislation. That is simply impossible.</p>

<p>Another thought which I would just like to bring to the attention of the House is that we in South Africa, and some politicians, perhaps, are sometimes inclined to think that the acknowledgment of Afrikaans in later years must be regarded as a struggle of Afrikaans against English, but in reality it was a struggle of Afrikaans against Dutch; and since this is Langenhoven year, I just want to quote what he said in 1911, as published in <i>Ons land</i> (Our country) of 15th August&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hoe lank sal ons bly hink op twee gedagtes&#x003F; Als Nederlands ons taal is, waarom praat ons hom nie&#x003F; Als Afrikaans ons taal is, waarom skryf ons hom nie&#x003F; Is die een te hoog om te praat en die ander te laag om te skryf&#x003F;</block>

<p>After having listened to four speakers of the Opposition, I want to say that I am in no way impressed by the fact that they support this Bill. Of the two younger members who spoke, I can say that I think they tried to put matters in historically correct perspective, as far as they could, and here and there, like the hon. member for Turffontein, they had to profess verbally that they are Afrikaners&#x2014;I do not know how deeply felt that is. [Interjections.] I want to tell the hon. member that I heard his verbal assurances and that I have to accept them as such. But, Sir, I must tell you that in the light of the Afrikaner&#x2019;s history, his language and also in the light of the history of hon. members such as those for Orange Grove and Bezuidenhout in politics over the past 20 or 30 years, I am not impressed at all by their expressions of esteem and appreciation, or whatever, for this particular Bill. And I am not only paying lip-service, I am saying it from the depths of my heart as far as those two hon. members are concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>No, not at all. That is not relevant at all at this stage. But I want to tell you, Sir, that the struggle of the Afrikaans Language is also interwoven in the struggle of the Afrikaner nation. I want to remind the hon. members there that in 1911, when it was asked whether officials on the Railways should know and speak both languages, a newspaper like <i>The Star</i> referred with contempt to &#x201C;that stupid patios&#x201D;. We had that kind of language. I now want to ask hon. <span class="col_4355-4356" refersTo="page_0731"/>members of the Opposition: What will the language be, for example, in the so-called federation they one day want to call into being in South Africa. There was also a time in history, in the struggle of the Afrikaans language, when it was said of some of the poets of that time that they were Afrikaners with Dutch hearts, Afrikaners with English hearts and Afrikaners with Afrikaner hearts. The hon. members on the Opposition side, who have thus far spoken, must actually square matters with their own consciences in saying what kind of hearts they have.</p>

<p>In looking at this Bill, and in wanting to speak about it, one actually feels like the young man who stood at the fruit tree with its delicious fruit, a tree planted there under very difficult circumstances by his grandfather or great-grandfather. We, this generation of Afrikaners, are standing at this tree and we are picking that fruit which we enjoy, but deep down we are nevertheless thinking of those people who planted, watered and tended the tree under very difficult circumstances. It is consequently a very good thing, therefore, that the hon. members on our side of the House also paid tribute to the people who preceded us.</p>

<p>It is interesting, if one can put it this way, that this Bill&#x2019;s Second Reading is specifically being dealt with on Van Riebeeck Day, that day on which we festively commemorate settlement in South Africa, although we shall in future be working on this day. We have a very great need of work in South Africa. It is also interesting, when looking at the history of the Afrikaans language, to note that although Colenbrander analysed the composition of the population at the end of the 18th century and found that the Afrikaners constituted 53% of that population, Dr. Heese has now brought that figure down to 36%, quite probably a more correct figure. Nevertheless, the Afrikaner people did not take its language from French or German but from Dutch. That language was consequently formed here in South Africa as the only Afrikaans language in the world. One can perhaps link Afrikaans to Dutch linguistically, and perhaps one can also link it to another people in the world that speaks Dutch, but Afrikaans had its origins, its roots and its struggle in South Africa. Therefore one also finds Afrikaans here as part of that particular national group whose pattern of life also took shape in South Africa.</p>

<p>Hon. members also mentioned that Langenhoven&#x2019;s 100th Birthday is being celebrated this year. Although Langenhoven was not all that enthusiastic about Afrikaans in his earlier years&#x2014;he also acknowledged this&#x2014;he was one of the biggest contributors to the establishment of the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>I think it was the hon. member for Durban Central who pointed out that Afrikaans actually waged a struggle against Dutch alone. I think the hon. member is quite wrong as far as the history of the Afrikaans language is concerned. As the Afrikaner nation has continually had a struggle for survival, and always will have, so will Afrikaans as a language also struggle continuously for its survival. If there are people, including those on the Opposition side, who think that a people or language should conclude the struggle for survival on a specific date, I want to tell them that that is just the beginning of the end of that people, its language and its culture. Therefore we can today dwell on another victory which the Afrikaans language has achieved in its struggle for survival. One is grateful for this.</p>

<p>One thing one is also grateful for, in speaking of the victory gained by the Afrikaans language, is that its bearers, and the people who struggle for its survival, were never imperialists and were never ever imbued with the idea of destroying or depriving any other national group of its language. That is why, in plucking this fine fruit, one can be so grateful for that.</p>

<p>In this Bill it is provided that the Dictionary&#x2019;s seat will be the University of Stellenbosch. I myself am an ex-student of the University of Pretoria. Therefore it is perhaps a good thing that I am specifically to be the one to say that one is grateful that the seat of the Dictionary will be that university. I think it is essential today for students of other universities in our country to express their particular thanks to the University of Stellenbosch for the fact that in those years, when it was the only university, it did also make a positive, even though very humble, contribution to the establishment of Afrikaans in the academic world. Although various other universities sprouted from the University of Stellenbosch, if one may put it in those terms, I think that our other universities should take note, with great thanks and appreciation, of the work which has been done at <span class="col_4357-4358" refersTo="page_0732"/>Stellenbosch for the establishment and development of the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>The other universities also did a great deal to perpetuate Afrikaans, not only on the academic level, but also in the other spheres of our national life. Whether it was in the economic sphere, the ecclesiastical or religious sphere, the political sphere or in the spheres of drama, poetry and literature, there were men and women everywhere who established the Afrikaans language. In the case of the University of Pretoria I think, for example, of Prof. M. S. B. Kritzinger, who also did very good work as far as compiling dictionaries is concerned. I am also thinking of people like Prof. S. A. Louw and Prof. B&#x00FC;ning. In the case of the University of Potchefstroom one thinks of a person like Prof. J. P. du Toit who, not only with his own writing and poems, but also in his sermons and his work as a Bible translator, did a big job getting Afrikaans established. At the University of the Orange Free State there was a man like Prof. D. F. Malherbe who also tirelessly fought for it. At our English language universities there were also professors who made a big contribution to Afrikaans. I am thinking, for example, of Prof. Van der Merwe Scholtz and Prof. Nienaber.</p>

<p>When, at this stage, we look at the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek,</i> as it has already appeared in parts, we realize again the depth and wealth locked within the Afrikaans language, and one could intellectually entertain oneself at the highest level, not only for one hour of an evening, but for many evenings and weeks by just paging through and reading the <i>Afrikaanse Woordeboek.</i> One finds a variety of words in it. One finds it particularly striking to note how the Afrikaans language, which was born in South Africa under particular circumstances, was so adaptable that today, in modern times, it can simply make or take over words at the most scientific level. In this way, in this modern world, one can in every field find a word in Afrikaans with which one can make oneself understood.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by specifically referring to the hon. member for Turffontein, who made mention of the new-fangled kind of poets that we have lately. One must then acknowledge and confess that the Afrikaans language has also been abused and made wrong use of by certain members of Afrikanerdom, that they use it simply to destroy the Afrikaner himself. I say that if the hon. member thinks that a person like Breyten Breytenbach does any credit to the Afrikaans language, I disagree with him completely as far as that is concerned. At this stage I want to appeal to our up-and-coming generation not to be dragged along by a permissive world to use the Afrikaans language, with its depth of content and meaning, to place themselves on a level not worthy of the Afrikaans language and the Afrikaner nation.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at such a late hour on a Friday afternoon one would only be able to generate so much interest in a subject and a debate such as this, and so much zeal to participate in it, if it dealt with a Bill on which there is complete unanimity in the House. That would be a good reason which one could advance for the course this debate has taken. But on the other hand it is also true that we really have reason to be grateful and unanimous. I want to begin then by extending my sincere thanks to all the hon. members who participated in this debate for their contributions. Here and there, a few digs were made at one another, but I do not think this made any real difference to the actual course of this debate. I think the debate remained on a very high level throughout, and all the members made contributions in regard to which we need not express too much criticism.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove began with a quotation from Langenhoven, which was very appropriate. He also mentioned, as did other speakers, that this Bill is actually being piloted through the House in Langenhoven Year. That is true. It is perhaps a very appropriate occasion. Perhaps we could also have piloted it through the House in the year in which we commemorated the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners, but on the other hand it would have been an omission on our part if we had not rectified these matters when they were brought so specifically to our attention, as did in fact happen.</p>

<p>I want to agree with hon. members who stated that this is a great occasion this afternoon, an occasion which will still be recorded in our history as one of the milestones. It is not only something which a single language group or section of a language group can appropriate to itself in this country, for the contents of the <i>Woordeboek</i> <span class="col_4359-4360" refersTo="page_0733"/><i> van die Afrikaanse Taal,</i> and, in fact, the dictionary itself, is the common heritage of us all. For that reason we are all grateful to have reached this stage.</p>

<p>I want to go further. This is an equally valuable contribution within the framework of our ties with Medieval Dutch. I am convinced that cognizance will also be taken with great appreciation in certain circles in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, of the legislation which we are in this way this afternoon placing on the Statue Book.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout mentioned that justice should be done to a greater extent to the language pioneers, and perhaps the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; pioneers as well, when names are given to institutions and even buildings. This is most certainly something to which consideration ought to be given in future. However, I do want to say that this is something to which justice has in fact been done quite frequently in the past. Sir, we know that the University of Stellenbosch has for years been collecting money for a Langenhoven Hall. We know that justice has been done to these writers and language pioneers by naming streets after them in various places in the country. We have also heard with gratitude that on 11th August this year in Oudtshoorn the C.J. Langenhoven Memorial Library will be opened. All these things prove to me that our people are in fact aware of the need to commemorate in this way our language pioneers as well.</p>

<p>The subject we discussed, as you could gather, was a subject which we could have gone on discussing for days on end. Perhaps it is a good thing that we are dealing with it at this hour of the afternoon, and that time is catching up on us. We need not discuss it for such a long period. I think we have placed on record what we wanted to, and should have said, and we need not elaborate on it further at too great a length and in too great detail. However, certain points were mentioned to which I want to return.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove mentioned that Afrikaans also gives us a link with Africa. I want to confirm this. It is true that there are in many parts of Africa persons whose home language was Afrikaans, as well as other South Africans who are able to speak Afrikaans and who like to speak it or to show that they know it. They do this to indicate in that way their ties with South Africa and their differentness, (<i>andersheid</i>) in the country in which they find themselves. So we do in fact have that link. If we wish to elaborate on this subject, we need only think of all the non-White miners who come here from all over Africa and are here taught a miner&#x2019;s language, Fanagalo. You would find it interesting to ascertain how much Afrikaans has been included in Fanagalo. These miners return to their own countries and bear those transformed Afrikaans expressions into those countries as well, and in this way it is also considerably easier to achieve a mutual understanding there. We also know that in Israel it frequently happens that when some Israelis want to discuss matters with one another which they do not want other Israelis or Arabs to understand, many of them speak Afrikaans to one another. This was told to me as a fact by reliable persons who are citizens of Israel. From the limited experience I have had as ambassador abroad, I can personally testify that there was an Idonesian ambassador in Vienna, a woman, and she and I always spoke to one another in Afrikaans and Dutch. Frequently some of our other colleagues became green with envy because we were speaking a language they could not understand. This also touches on the point mentioned by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, viz that there are in fact 30 million or more Dutch-speaking persons in the world, persons who speak a language cognate to our Afrikaans. The opportunity therefore exists for us to forge ties in Africa, and even outside Africa by means of Afrikaans. I believe that the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D; will make a major and important contribution to that end.</p>

<p>I think that the Board of Control and the Bureau of the &#x201C;Woordeboek&#x201D;, as well as its editor-in-chief and staff, will take cognizance with much gratitude and, I almost want to say, with relief, of the fact that this House is unanimous in its opinion that the long period of time required for this work as well as the justifiable costs which this entails was not a consideration for us in our discussion. I think this gives them a certainty which they have probably desired for a long time. They have always had the feeling that a sword was dangling over their heads. I think for example of a language expert whom I knew very well and still know, who was considered at the <span class="col_4361-4362" refersTo="page_0734"/>time for appointment to the post of editor-in-chief of this dictionary. He refused because he said the future was too uncertain. The dictionary has to be completed within a few years and if he had to accept that post at his age, what would happen to him afterwards&#x003F; I know that the present staff of the Woordeboek now have the certainty that there is no concern in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Since I am referring to money matters, I could perhaps bring up the point mentioned by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, namely the price of the dictionary. Now, I want to inform him that the price of the dictionary is determined as a Government publication according to fixed norms laid down by the Government Printer. In the case of the dictionary we have a concession in that only the printing costs, the handling costs and the storing costs are in fact included in the calculation of the price. In other words, this is already a considerable concession in respect of the dictionary. Then, too, I may refer to the rebate of up to 45% which is being granted to dealers to encourage the distribution of the book, and I think that with that we have already made a laudable effort. Who knows, in this atmosphere of unanimity, in which we all agree that money and expenditure is not the prime consideration, we could perhaps persuade the Minister of Finance to make a larger grant available to the <i>Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal,</i> and in this way try to reduce the price even further. I shall in any event try to establish what the possibilities of doing this are.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove also raised the matter of subsequent editions. Now it is unfortunately the case that subsequent editions of the dictionary remain unchanged or practically unchanged. The reason for this is that it is almost impossible, from the point of view of the work and also from the point of view of the costs, to bring the first volumes published up to date and to republish them again in printed form while one is still working on the remaining letters of the alphabet. When I say this, I have told only half the truth, for the work on the entire dictionary, all the letters, continues unabated. I do not want to bore the House with figures, but it will nevertheless be interesting if I were to mention that the first volume of the dictionary contains 33 864 words which have already been explained and recorded in print.</p>

<p>Up to what letter of the alphabet did that volume go&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the first volume went up to the letter &#x201C;C&#x201D;. At present there are 4 000 words and expressions in respect of this first volume which have not yet been furnished with definitions; as well as words and expressions with which the lexicographers are experiencing problems. This work continues unabated. On the other hand this latest volume which I showed to hon. members a moment ago, viz. Part V, contains 27 000 words which have been defined, and which are recorded in that volume. Here, too, there are a further approximately 4 000 words which are being processed and have not yet been defined. In other words, this is a process to which there is almost no end. I also want to refer here to the observation made by the hon. member for Turffontein. I concede that he did not do so in a derogatory sense. He said that the work is of such a magnitude that we have only now reached the letter &#x201C;K&#x201D;. I want to tell him that we have of course progressed much further than the letter &#x201C;K&#x201D;, for the work continues unabated on all the letters of the alphabet. But as far as the printing is concerned, we have at this stage only progressed as far as the letter &#x201C;K&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the statement which, I think, was made by the hon. member for Orange Grove, that we need not be afraid of loan words. I can reassure him and say that we are not afraid of loan words from other languages, but that we must obviously establish a very strict criterion when we determine which words should be included in the dictionary, and when a word should be taken over as a loan word. It is a fact that Afrikaans has a wonderful creative ability and people from abroad who are able to understand Afrikaans are repeatedly astonished at the creative ability of Afrikaans in the modern times in which we are living. While one finds other countries, and even cognate countries, which readily take over loan words, one finds that Afrikaans retains the creative ability to make viable and unique <span class="col_4363-4364" refersTo="page_0735"/>words for many of these modern concepts. We must encourage that trend, and not discourage it by simply borrowing words. The hon. member for Koedoespoort placed particular emphasis on this aspect of what is unique to us, what we preserve in our language and on the basis of which we try to coin new words. I agree wholeheartedly with what the hon. member said.</p>

<p>Then, too, reference was made to clause 17, which we shall discuss later during the Committee Stage. Misgivings were expressed in regards to this clause, and I want to say that I agree wholeheartedly that the lexicographers should be extremely careful when they come to the interpretation of words. But the lexicographers find that their path is strewn with thorns. The hon. member for Turffontein quoted a few examples to us here from the <i>Oxford Dictionary,</i> and I can inform the House that some of those examples to which he referred are in fact those which gave rise to court cases. What is the real problem of the scientist dealing with the compilation of a dictionary&#x003F; There is in the first place the science of defining the concept, and that in itself is difficult enough. In my Second Reading speech I said that according to the editor-in-chief of the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> one of his best assistants worked for six months simply to find a proper elucidation of the word &#x201C;that&#x201D;, which all of us regard as an everyday word. In addition the lexicographer deals with the fact that in language, which is a living phenomenon, one has to deal with something like semantic deterioration. A word which at one stage was completely acceptable and gave no person in the country or abroad any offence, can in time and under other circumstances undergo a semantic deterioration. In subsequent editions such a word must obviously be re-scrutinized to see whether it has not undergone semantic deterioration. On the other hand there is in philology such a thing as semantic refinement.</p>

<p>A word which at one specific juncture had a derogatory or even dubious meaning, can in due course undergo semantic refinement. Such a word may in common parlance acquire a better and more acceptable meaning. These are all problems with which the lexicographer has to cope. I also want to say that when it concerns an explanatory dictionary such as this &#x201C;<i>Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal&#x201D;,</i> the lexicographers try in the course of their activities to support their interpretation of the word&#x2019;s meaning by quotations from writings to prove that it is a current expression. The hon. member for Turffontein quoted a few examples here. I also have an interesting example which I want to quote to hon. members from the latest volume of the dictionary. Here for example you have the word &#x201C;kattekoor&#x201D;. This is &#x201C;&#x2019;n kattegekerm of -skerts, beskou as &#x2019;n koor&#x201D;. Then a few examples are given, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Die opposisie het &#x2019;n kattekoor aangehef teen die voorgestelde wetgewing.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I am grateful that we have not had a &#x201C;kattekoor&#x201D; this afternoon, but that we have in fact heard paean of praise for the work of this Bureau of the &#x201C;woordeboek&#x201D;, the editor-in-chief and his assistants, and that we all agree that we are engaged here in a major and important task with which we, despite time and costs, are continuing, because what is at issue here is an asset to us all.</p>

<p>With that, I think, I have done justice to all the speakers who participated in this debate. I want to thank them once again most sincerely. If I should perhaps in haste, because of the pressure of time, have overlooked anything, they must please raise it again during the Committee Stage.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish, at the outset of my reply, to congratulate the hon. member for Parktown most sincerely on the admirable way in which he opened his speech at the start of this debate last Monday. You will recall, Sir, that for quite a number of years I have been urging, challenging, exhorting and pleading with the hon. gentleman to say something positive about gold, and this at a time when gold plays such an important part in the economy of our country and in the monetary affairs of the world. We, as the South African Government, have for many years been battling to ensure that gold retains its rightful place in the monetary system. It was only fitting, one would expect, that the leader in financial matters on the other side of the House should say something more positive about this metal than he has said in the past. Mr. Speaker, I had almost feared that my pleadings had been in vain. At last the hon. member responded last week, and he responded in a most magnificent manner, telling us of the wonderful qualities of gold. The thought came to me of the young man in Tennyson&#x2019;s poem, &#x201C;carrying a banner with a strange design&#x201D;. The words used by one of the old Dutch poets also came to mind:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Een nieuwe lente met een nieuw geluid.&#x201D; (A new spring with a new sound.)</block>

<p>I regret, however, that here my congratulations end. I regret that I cannot go further in extolling the merits of the speech of the hon. member or the speeches of most hon. members on the other side of the House. As a matter of fact, I feel genuinely sorry because those hon. members have lost a golden opportunity. At a time when they had an opportunity to do something really positive in regard to the requirements of our economy, their speeches were lacking the fervour we expected from them. I was sorry that after these opening few sentences had been uttered, there was nothing more to be found that could give inspiration and confidence to our people.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, they lost a golden opportunity because never before have they been presented in this House in such a way with a subject on which I think we all, as members of this Parliament, are supposed to be in full agreement, a subject of such great importance to our country and our people, namely the subject of the growth of our economy. After the golden words fell from the lips of the hon. member for Parktown, I expected the Opposition to rise to the occasion. I expected them to come forward with some new, bold and positive ideas. I expected them to come forward with some inspiring ideas as to how they could co-operate with the Government in order to achieve the desired growth. What we saw, on the contrary, Mr. Speaker, was not an inspiring Opposition, but a despondent, hesitant and heel-dragging Opposition, an Opposition completely paralysed with negativism, frustration and with fear. I shall later on demonstrate how the spectre of fear and of danger was lurking around every corner in the eyes of the Opposition, how the spectre of fear has inhibited them in their thinking, and how it has prevented them from seizing the opportunity of the moment and making a golden contribution to this debate. In the end things developed so badly that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition found himself constrained to intervene in order, in the first place, to explain to the House what his followers had really meant to say in the course of the debate, in the second place to gather the shattered remnants of the Opposition&#x2019;s attack, and thirdly to salvage what still was to be salvaged after, as far as the Opposition was concerned, this ruinous and, I would say, fateful debate.</p>

<p>I shall come back at a later stage to the charges which were made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who has told me that, regretfully, he cannot be here today. With all respect to the Leader of the Opposition, I can only say that his entry into this debate did nothing to improve the image of the Opposition. He only repeated what had already been said time and again over all these years. He repeated the generalizations which have always thus far failed to impress those people in the electorate who have to vote them into power. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition contradicted himself in many ways and, for the rest, like his followers, he gave us a number of generalizations which have never been tested by the hard facts of political reality and, if tested, would never have <span class="col_4367-4368" refersTo="page_0737"/>a chance of survival. Mr. Speaker, let us be clear on this matter. In politics there is a vast difference between theory and practice. It is very easy, for instance, for an academician, for a theorist, to sit behind his desk and, in the safety of his study, to give advice to a country and to the world at large on all the difficult problems of the world. It is easy for him because he knows that he will never be called upon to put his theories into practice. He can have them in his mind, but he will never be asked to bear the responsibility. By the same token, Sir, it is very easy for an Opposition and for the Leader of the Opposition to express idealistic generalities of all sorts and to offer the most perfect solutions to the most difficult questions of the day. It is easy to do so when for a quarter of a century hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House have never had the sobering experience of actually governing a nation and of finding that things are not as perfect as pictured in the flights of their imagination and in their futile expectations. Sir, coming back to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition and his followers, of whom not a single one has had practical experience in actually governing the country, I wish to say that I attach much more importance to the opinions of practical men in the business field. By that I mean practical businessmen in business itself or even financial writers who are in close contact with these business leaders. I know that there is a difference of opinion amongst them, but reading the remarks on this Budget I find that most practical business people have welcomed this Budget as a very good one. Let me give just a few brief examples. I quote from a leading article in <i>The Star</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Step lively, Dr. D. This year&#x2019;s Budget is the most significant Dr. Diederichs has delivered. Its importance lies not in his dexterous manipulation of the nation&#x2019;s finances, but in his statement of policy: Growth is essential to ensure satisfactory employment opportunities and rising prosperity for the growing population.</block>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Before I proceed to consider the details of the criticism levelled at the Budget there are three matters which I want to examine closely, quite apart from this Budget. In the first place there is the matter of the defence of our country. Various speakers on the opposite side of the House voiced opinions on the question of defence and referred to the fact that our expenditure on defence is exceptionally high and has risen considerably this year. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, in particular, made statements here which certainly were not only highly dangerous, but which could perhaps be regarded as very irresponsible as well, statements <span class="col_4369-4370" refersTo="page_0738"/>which could certainly add fuel to the fire of our enemies. In his speech the hon. member for Bezuidenhout created the impression that our expenditure in South Africa is attributable to internal unrest caused by this Government; that the large amount which is needed for defence, would not have been needed if we had been able to eliminate in some other way the unrest and dissatisfaction among our citizens. Sir, let me say the following: Our expenditure on defence is considerable, but our expenditure on defence is still proportionately less than that of most countries, not only in actual amounts, but in proportion to our national income, in proportion to the total Budget and in proportion to the <i>per capita</i> income of our citizens. I want to mention a few figures here for the year 1970. Unfortunately I was unable to obtain more recent comparable figures, but these figures show what the trend is. As a percentage of State expenditure, the expenditure on defence in Israel, in 1970, was 49%, in Portugal 34%, in Britain 16%, in Australia 19%, in the Netherlands 11%, in Canada 15%, and in South Africa 9,7%. In proportion to the gross national product: Israel 26.5%, Portugal 6,5%, Britain 4,9%, France 4%, Australia 3,6%, the Netherlands 3,5%, Canada 2,5%, South Africa 2,6%&#x2014; among the lowest in the world. <i>Per capita</i> of the population: Israel R483, Portugal R41, Britain R107, France R118, Australia R100, the Netherlands R85, Canada R90, and South Africa R16-70. In the year 1970 South Africa&#x2019;s expenditure on defence was low in comparison with that of comparable countries in the rest of the world. This year the expenditure is a little higher&#x2014;approximately R21 <i>per capita</i> of the population. Hon. members on that side, particularly the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, tried to create the impression that we are maintaining a Defence Force as a result of internal political situations; that if we want to restrain the unrest in our country, no army will be necessary, or only a small one. But, Sir, that is not true. Why does the United States then have an enormous defence force&#x003F; Why do the Netherlands and Germany and Italy and France have large defence forces&#x003F; Why do the Swiss, who are a neutral people, have one of the largest defence forces in comparison with the rest of Europe&#x003F; The answer is that they want to protect their people against attacks from outside forces. We have always said in South Africa that we do not want to attack anyone with our Defence Force; that we do not desire the territory of any other nation; but we need our Defence Force for defence against any possible attack from outside sources. Are hon. members on that side not aware that we are constantly being threatened&#x003F; Are they not aware that there are countries, particularly in Africa, which declare openly that they are preparing for militant or military action against South Africa&#x003F; They are not doing this because we pursue a political policy here which they do not like, but because they have it in for the White man in South Africa, and because they wish to possess the riches of South Africa. I want to make it absolutely clear here that the defence of our country has to be carried out by the Defence Force, that this is a defence not of the Whites against the non-Whites, but of the Whites as well as the non-Whites in South Africa. I recently read about talks held by a journalist with various population groups in South Africa. He asked the Bantu what would happen if a foreign power should attack South Africa. The reply was that if a foreign White power should attack South Africa, 80% of the Bantu would stand by the South African Government. When he asked them what would happen if a non-White power should attack South Africa, the reply was that 90% would then stand by the South African Government. One of the great European statesmen of today recently told me that he had been in South Africa and had spoken to the Coloured population of South Africa. He said that they had levelled criticism here and there at the actions of the Government. He then asked what they would do if a foreign power should attack South Africa. To that they all replied that they would be on the side of the Government. I am mentioning these things to refute the notion that we are building up a defence force here simply because there is alleged unrest in our country, in order to allay that unrest. We have the same right to build up a defence force as any country in the world has, a defence force to defend us against possible threats from outside sources.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I want to come to two questions of principle which were hinted at in the speeches of the hon. members opposite. The first matter I want to deal with is the relation of the State to the economy of the country. I have always been under the impression that we and the Opposition adopt a common standpoint in so far that both parties believe in the principles of private <span class="col_4371-4372" refersTo="page_0739"/>initiative, and that it is the task of the State to lay the foundations and create the framework within which the economy can move, but that it is the duty of the individual, the citizen, in the first place to display the spirit of enterprise necessary to keep the wheels of the economy turning. The State itself must supply only the bare essentials, such as establishing the infrastructure and providing those things which the individual is not able to or does not want to provide. That has always been our joint philosophy, the market economy and the philosophy of private enterprise, but I have recently noticed a strange element in the speeches of hon. members opposite, a disturbing tendency in the thinking of the United Party, which is that they want to hold the State, and the State alone, responsible for everything which happens or does not happen in the economic life of the people; that they accuse the State of everything which goes wrong; that they blame the State on the one hand and say that it is doing too much and if things go wrong it is the State which has to bear the blame for that. I think the attitude of the Opposition, in which they seldom if ever refer to the duties of the entrepreneur, but always to the duties of the State only, is an insult&#x2014;and I want to make this clear, it is an insult&#x2014;to the entrepreneurs and to the businessmen of our country. I have for many years co-operated with the businessmen. I know them to be honest, dedicated and competent people with initiative, and for the Opposition to want to imply now that the businessmen of South Africa, who are the main springs of our economy, are merely sitting idly and asking for alms from the State, is extremely insulting to the businessmen of our country. You know, Mr. Speaker, that in the past the members of the Opposition frequently levelled accusations at our farmers. They said that the farmers were the people who simply came to the State for largesse all the time. I now find the same tendency in the thinking of the Opposition, that the economy of the country should be determined by the State and not by the consumer or by the enterprise, or whatever. They have broken away from the principle of private enterprise and are directly pursuing the principle of what we call State Socialism. What has become of the principle of private initiative&#x003F; The hon. members opposite are beginning to groan, but was it not they who last week referred to everything the State should do, that the State should do this, and that it should do that&#x003F; They were constantly accusing the State of not having done enough to keep the wheels of the economy turning. Nothing, not a single word, was said last week about what the private entrepreneur should do. It would be an evil day if this spirit of the Opposition should become the spirit of South Africa, for then we would be taking the direction of State Socialism which is one of the most dangerous things, particularly for a country like South Africa.</p>

<p>One of the most shocking things I heard in last week&#x2019;s debate, was when the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District participated in the debate and stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Government should use its big surplus&#x2014;please note&#x2014;to help industry to pay higher wages. It is shocking that a leading speaker on the opposite side of the House, in a country which believes in private initiative, should want to go so far as to propose that the State should use its surplus to help industry to pay its workers higher wages.</p>

<p>I do not think our businessmen feel this way. In addition I believe that they will utilize the opportunities which they have now been afforded, and they will not allow this to be done by foreigners. The foreigners have confidence in the economy of South Africa. If our businessmen do not heed the clarion call to growth, the possibility exists that foreigners may take their place. We on this side of the House have always welcomed foreign capital and foreign enterprise as a supplementation to our own entrepreneurs. However, it would be a sad day if the foreigners had to take over our economy because the economic philosophy of the Opposition discouraged our entrepreneurs from fulfilling the task they should have fulfilled.</p>

<p>I come to a second point which I find disturbing. This applies to the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude to our social policy concerning our assistance to the poor, the needy and the underprivileged. I want to test the entire matter with the question whether they, in the same way as they wish to push South Africa in the direction of State Socialism, are not also pushing South Africa gradually in the direction of a welfare state&#x003F; In what way are we to understand the sudden concern hon. members opposite display for the poor, the sick and the needy in our country&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_4373-4374" refersTo="page_0740"/>It is a very long time since the United Party last governed, but is there any person today who can remember their having ever been so concerned, in their time, for the poor, the weak and the elderly&#x003F; Was that not the time when the old-age pension reached a peak of only R10 per month, the buying power of which was at the time far less than that of R45 today&#x003F; Was that not the time when some of our people established organizations, bodies and movements to help lift our people out of their poverty&#x003F; At the time those organizations were not only treated harshly by that Government, but people who were members of such organizations were threatened with concentration camps. The attitude of the Opposition in this connection can only be explained in two ways. Firstly, it could be superficial emotionalism or a superficial demonstration with the aim of winning popularity for itself among certain sectors of the people. Secondly, it could mean that the Opposition is moving in the direction of a welfare state, with all the fine things which that implies, but also with all the terrible dangers which lurk within such a system. When the hon. member for Rosettenville, who is an esteemed and well-intentioned member, one for whom I have a great deal of respect makes certain suggestions in this House, it sets me thinking. During this debate hon. members on that side of the House made frequent reference to the increase in Government expenditure, but on the other hand an eminent hon. member on that side of the House made suggestions such as those, in which he was partially supported by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. member said that all old age pensions, for example, should be increased to R80 per month.</p>

I tried to make a little calculation and I can inform the hon. members that these three things which he requested are going to cost the State an additional amount of almost R1 000 million per annum. If I add to that what was requested by the hon. member for Umbilo, it would amount to more than R1 000 million per annum.</p>

<p>It sounds very idealistic, but how far should the State, as State, pursue a course of charity&#x003F; Is it the duty of the State to bear the full responsibility in this regard&#x003F; Has the individual the right to expect everything in this regard from the State&#x003F; Must we assume that in these times in which we are living we have reached the era where love of one&#x2019;s fellow-man should make way for State assistance&#x003F; Does no duty rest any more on the community on the individual, on the family or on the welfare organizations&#x003F; Should the State do everything&#x003F; We are moving in a dangerous direction, as dangerous as that of State Socialism, in which the hon. members want us to move.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, allow me to refer to some of the aspects of the main themes of the Budget. At the beginning I said that this Budget has as its object the promotion of growth. It is obvious, therefore, that most of the discussion last week must have centred around this point, namely the promotion of growth. It is in this connection that the Opposition has missed a wonderful opportunity. The hon. members have failed to rise to the occasion, and have utterly discredited the golden views at the beginning of the hon. member for Parktown&#x2019;s speech. In this debate where they could have made a positive contribution, they were as negative as never before. Where everybody was looking forward to ways and means to stimulate the production of our country, they were as unproductive as never before. When they should have shown faith, confidence and courage regarding the future, I am sorry to say they behaved like frightened men, and that I will prove. Indeed, throughout their speeches one finds the expressions of danger and fear pervading all their ideas.</p>

<p>I first want to come to the hon. member for Parktown. He referred to what he called &#x201C;the inadequate rate of growth&#x201D;. I admit that 4% of the GNP is not the ideal rate of growth for a country such as South Africa, but there are reasons for this slow rate of growth. Most of these reasons are of an international nature over which we <span class="col_4375-4376" refersTo="page_0741"/>have no control at all. I have explained that often enough in this House. This growth rate compares very favourably with that of many comparable countries, but I have no time to show that by means of figures.</p>

<p>I can quote only one example now. We always talk of West Germany as one of the greatest industrial countries of the world. We talk of it as the outstanding industrial country of Western Europe. I want to ask my hon. friend, the hon. member for South Coast, whether he knows what the growth rate in Germany was last year, Germany which is considered to be so strong that billions of dollars are streaming into the country in an attempt to push up the Deutsche Mark in order to make a capital profit. I saw in a very authoritative article last night that the growth rate in Germany last year was 3% compared to South Africa&#x2019;s 4.% The year before that their growth rate was 2,8%. The hon. gentleman must know that there were periods in our history when our growth rate was one of the highest in the Western world. Ask the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. Last week he indeed became highly enthusiastic about the wonderful growth rate obtained during the 1960s. Everybody knows that in all economies there are cycles, there are ups and downs, valleys and peaks. They know that it is quite natural that in the last few years we have been going through a valley, but that the signs of new growth are already there and that better days are surely soon to come. However, the hon. members all have &#x201C;fears&#x201D;. Referring to the large Budget deficit, the hon. member for Parktown asked whether this was the right way to grow. He said: &#x201C;Is the Government not taking away too much of our capital resources&#x003F; Is there anything or enough left for the private sector&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. member nods in the affirmative.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can set his mind at rest. The Government is not draining the private sector of all the funds it needs. On the contrary, leaving aside the small taxes which I mentioned in my Budget speech together with the extra tax reliefs, the Government takes relatively no more from the private sector than it did before. The reverse is true; the Government is actually giving the private sector more this year than it is taking from it. This is the meaning of a deficit Budget&#x2014;that the Government is giving to the private sector more than it is taking away from it. That which it is giving more to the private sector than it is taking away from it, it finances by means of loans which have been made in the previous year, not in this year. The Government is putting money back into the economy. The hon. member and other members on that side of the House need have no fear on this score. Apart from the fact that the Government is putting money back by utilizing the loans it made last year, the hon. member knows there are other means by which we are increasing the liquidity in the economy, such as the repayment of loan levies earlier than expected, the abolition of bank credit ceilings, the lowering of interest rates, the abolition of loan levies on dividends, etc. And in addition to that we had a favourable balance of payments. All these factors together will ensure that capital should not be an obstacle this year in the development of our country.</p>

<p>As usual the hon. member for Parktown contradicts himself time and again. On the one hand he expresses fear that too great a drain by the public sector must obviously affect the availability of funds in the private sector. On the other hand he complains about the injection of some R600 million into the economy as being a massive goad rather than a mild stimulant. Which of these two views must I now believe&#x003F; Is too much money being taken out of the economy or is too much money being injected into the economy&#x003F; Obviously, these two views cannot both be true. Then again, referring to this massive injection of cash into the economy, he critizes the government by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Much of the Government&#x2019;s expenditure will be spent abroad. This is certainly not going to help a local industrialist.</block>

<p><span class="col_4377-4378" refersTo="page_0742"/>Now, Mr. Speaker, I must say things are getting &#x201C;curiouser and curiouser&#x201D;. The hon. member complains about three different things. In the first place he complains that too much money is being siphoned out of the economy and that consequently too little money will be left there for the private sector. Secondly, he complains, on the other hand, that too much money is being injected into the economy with resultant inflation. And then again he says that of the money that is being injected into the economy too much is being taken out of this abundantly injected money to be spent overseas. I must say this is all very difficult to understand. Maybe the key to the contradictory thoughts of the hon. gentleman for Parktown lies in the words which he uses towards the end of his speech. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Growth by itself solves no problems.</block>

<p>Really, Mr. Speaker, he said it. It is true. You can read the Hansard of the hon. gentleman and you will find that he really said: Growth by itself solves no problems. If the hon. member had said that growth by itself does not solve all problems I would have been with him. But he clearly said that growth solves no problems. Why then are we here&#x003F; Why are we spending many long, dreary hours here speaking about the conditions and the possibility of growth&#x003F; Why should we go to all the trouble to promote growth if growth by itself solves no problems&#x003F; I shall come back to the hon. member for Parktown later but I now first want to cross swords with the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia has a different view of the world; at least so it seems. He says and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Real growth is the solution to all our problems.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown says growth by itself solves no problems while this hon. member rightly says: Growth by itself is the solution to all our problems. In this respect I completely agree with the hon. gentleman. But, while agreeing with him here, I was surely justified in expecting greater enthusiasm on his part in this regard. I expected many more positive suggestions as to how that growth which we all desire could be achieved. For that reason I listened with great expectations to the speech of the hon. gentleman. Sir, I always listen with great interest to the hon. member for Constantia. Generally I do not agree with him. But I must say that I regard the hon. member for Constantia as one of the most logical and analytical economics speakers we have ever had in this House. That is why I listen to him &#x2026; It seems to me that he does not believe it himself! That is why I listened to him with great expectations. However, the hon. member did not come up to standard. In his whole analytical speech, as I shall show, there was nothing of any positive&#x2014; I say &#x201C;positive&#x201D;&#x2014;value. On the contrary, his speech was characterized completely by sentiments of scepticism, negativism, fear and pessimism. I was surprised to find in the hon. gentleman a frightful and fearful man in the economic sense. If you read his speech, you will find that the hon. gentleman is afraid. He is full of fear. He sees dangers lurking around every corner. If the tone of the speech by the hon. member for Constantia were to become the tone and character of gentlemen on the other side of the House, then I understand why they could not and should not ever be allowed to become the Government of this country. In these years we want a Government with spirit and with faith, with confidence in the future. We do not want a party or a Government with gloom and despondency written all over its face. Let me remind the hon. member for Constantia of the saying, &#x201C;Faint heart never won fair lady&#x201D;. Where to the hon. member for Parktown and the hon. Leader of the Opposition this Budget is a great gamble for growth, the hon. gentleman for Constantia sees nothing but dangers around every corner.</p>

<p>In the first place, he fears&#x2014;you will find the word &#x201C;fear&#x201D; everywhere in his speech&#x2014;the danger of a deficit Budget on a grand scale. He likens the situation to a printing press which is used to print money, to create money, which is not taken out of the economy. I think I am quoting the hon. gentleman correctly. We are, so to speak, using the printing press to print so-called money without taking the money out of the economy. But the hon. member&#x2019;s fears have no foundation at all. The money he refers to is not and will not be printed. It has been taken out of the economy. To alleviate the fears of the hon. member for Parktown, let me tell him it has been taken out of the economy, not this year, but last year. It is because of the great success we have had, particularly with our internal <span class="col_4379-4380" refersTo="page_0743"/>loans, that we have been able to put back money this year into the economy.</p>

<p>Connected with this fear of the hon. gentleman, is the further apprehension, &#x201C;what might happen later on&#x201D;. He says that I am taking these amounts out of the economy&#x2014;and now listen carefully, Sir&#x2014; &#x201C;at a time when revenue is buoyant&#x201D;, &#x201C;when the economy is expected to grow&#x201D;, &#x201C;when he (referring to me) can reasonably expect windfalls&#x201D;. He said that I was having to do this &#x201C;at a time when company profits and company taxation are expected to grow&#x201D;. He says that I am doing this &#x201C;despite these favourable conditions&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe, but these are the hon. member&#x2019;s actual words. He speaks of the soundness of this economy and he expects much more revenue than we have anticipated. Apart from the hon. member for Parktown&#x2019;s words on gold, I think this was the brightest spot in the speeches of the members on the other side. That was the only time when a real belief in the soundness and prosperity of the economy was expressed. Sir, may I now relieve the hon. gentleman of his fears. If the economy is as good as he believes it is, or as good as he expects it to be, if the receipts by the Treasury will be as high as he thinks they will be in the prosperous time to come&#x2014; and here I partly agree with him&#x2014;then naturally we shall not, and I repeat &#x201C;not&#x201D;, use the reserves to the extent proposed now. If revenue should rise to more than what has been estimated, and the deficit decreases to that extent, to the same extent the reserves of our country will remain intact for the day when we might need them more.</p>

<p>But if the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s fears were to materialize and there really were no reserves any more because they had been used, what would the position be then&#x003F; He maintains that if there are no longer any reserves, I shall either have to &#x201C;pull in my horns as far as expenditure is concerned or increase taxation&#x201D;. That is what the hon. member said. I do not think the hon. gentleman need be so pessimistic. After all, the hon. member for Parktown has, in quite a number of statements, inside and outside this House lamented the fact that, as he thought, our cupboard was bare. You will remember, Sir, that last year most of the speeches and statements of my hon. friend were on this particular theme, namely that we had used all our reserves and that our cupboard was completely bare. And yet, in the meantime, our reserves have grown so strong that we could produce a deficit Budget, a Budget with a deficit of over R400 million, and finance this deficit from reserves, and then still have considerable reserves left in our cupboard.</p>

<p>If the worst comes to the worst&#x2014;which we do not expect&#x2014;and if there is absolutely nothing in the cupboard, the hon. member knows, or should know, that the State can still borrow money. If the State does not borrow the money from the public it can always borrow the money from the Reserve Bank. The hon. member&#x2019;s fears are completely unfounded, and I challenge him to show the contrary.</p>

<p>The second fear which the hon. member has is in regard to the labour question. When the economy grows as fast as we hope it will grow, he fears that a time will come when entrepreneurs will find themselves bumping against the barrier of insufficient labour. I shall leave this matter for a moment and come back to it later in another context.</p>

<p>Finally, the hon. member fears the effect of inflation upon productivity. He fears that inflation or escalating costs will in the end wipe out all the concessions made by the Government. I am at one with the hon. member that we must do all that we can to combat inflation, but I do not believe with the hon. gentleman that the fact that there is inflation should deter us from promoting the development of our economy. You know, Sir, sometimes the fear of inflation is a greater danger than inflation itself. There is inflation in all Western countries and in Japan as well, and yet they progress in spite of inflation because their people have the will and the courage and the determination to grow out of inflation. Allow me in this connection to make the point once again that South Africa is not the only country suffering from inflation. In fact, as I have often pointed out, the rate of inflation in South Africa is lower than in many other countries. I saw this week in a well-known American paper that in spite of the American wage and price policy, the consumer price index in the United States in February this year rose by 0,8% the largest jump in one month in 22 years. At the same time I read in that paper that the wholesale price index in America in January/February increased by 13,4,% at an annual rate. Sir, there are those who say: &#x201C;But this is South Africa; why do we compare South Africa with other countries of the world&#x003F; We are unique; we are <span class="col_4381-4382" refersTo="page_0744"/>separate.&#x201D; Sir, this is a completely unrealistic view. South Africa&#x2019;s economy is inextricably bound up with the economy of the rest of the world because of our exports and our imports and because of capital flows. We have every right to compare what happens in South Africa with what happens in the rest of the world. But I want to mention one thing here which I do not think has ever been mentioned, and that is that apart from the rates of increase in the various countries, we can also compare the actual cost of living in South Africa with the cost of living in other countries. I do not know whether any hon. members opposite have recently been over to Europe or to America and whether they noticed the high cost of living in those countries compared with the cost of living in South Africa. When we compare living costs, we usually compare the rates of increase. I think it is wrong to compare only the rates of increase; one should also look always at the bases to which these rates apply. When, for instance, a meal in South Africa costs R3 and the very same meal in America costs R6, then a rate of increase of, say, 5% in the U.S.A. is equivalent to a rate of increase of 10% in South Africa. The same rate of increase in South Africa can mean, in actual sums of money, much less than the same rate in America, for instance. Hon. members of the Opposition seem to think that pump priming of the economy to the extent of R400 million in one year, is highly inflationary. This need not be the case. I want to say a few words about this inflation.</p>

<p>We do not find ourselves today in the same situation in which we found ourselves a few years ago. A few years ago it would have been impossible and completely unwise to have a deficit Budget of this nature because then we suffered from a demand inflation and all we had to do was to try to bring down that demand. Today we are no longer suffering from a demand inflation. Actually demand has dropped. What we experience now is a cost-push inflation, and the cure to cost-push inflation is greater production. Increased demand should now lead to increased production. This will lead to the lowering of unit costs and therefore to bringing down the rate of inflation. We can now stimulate the economy in the way we have been doing because it is possible, because of unused capacity which we did not have in the past. We must use this free capacity existing in our industry to grow out of inflation. The more goods we manufacture, the lower the prices should be. The question was posed by hon. members opposite as to why we did not follow this policy in the past; why did we follow the policy of monetary and fiscal braking and retarding of the economy and not of stimulating the economy&#x003F; The answer is very simple. Because we had demand inflation in the past we could not stimulate the economy. Because we had no surplus capacity in the past and particularly&#x2014;and that is a thing which hon. members opposite refuse to understand&#x2014;because our balance of payments in the past was very unfavourable and our reserves of gold and foreign reserves were low. It is only now, from the beginning of this or the end of last year, that we have seen quite clearly that our balance of payments position has become favourable and that our reserves have risen to a high level, that we can apply this policy of deficit financing to promote the economy of our country. The fear was also expressed, I think by the hon. member for Constantia, as to what would happen now if all the available capacity is being utilized. We think there is about 15% to 20% capacity now which is not being used in industry. What will happen the day when that capacity is being fully utilized&#x003F; My answer is, what do other countries do&#x003F; Other countries also sometimes face the position that all the capacity in the manufacturing industry is being utilized. The answer is that they create new capacity, and this is the whole message also of this Budget. The message of this Budget is that we should use the existing capacity and in the meantime we should build up new capacity, which we can now do because we have a favourable balance of payments and higher reserves. It would be a sad day if we were to reach the stage where we are afraid to use the opportunity on our doorstep because we cannot see what might happen in the future when capacity is being fully utilized.</p>

<p>*I think the Government has gone as far as it really can go in stimulating the economy. To say that it did not go far enough in stimulating the economy, is either wilfulness or party politics. As I quoted, our businessmen understand this and realize that the onus now rests squarely on their shoulders. They must not, like the Opposition, react in a negative and fearful way.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of labour. I want, in a few words, to state my standpoint here in regard to labour and labour <span class="col_4383-4384" refersTo="page_0745"/>training. My hon. colleagues sitting here, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and of Bantu Education, and the hon. the Minister of Labour, will discuss these matters in greater detail under their Votes. In the first place I want to say that it is absolutely wrong to believe that labour alone is the key to all progress. There are numerous countries where labour is in abundant supply, and where there is no progress. I am thinking of the underdeveloped countries in Africa, Asia and South America. I am thinking even of countries like the United States of America, England and Italy where there was and still is an abundant supply of labour, but where there has not always been progress, yet great inflation. Labour alone is not the solution.</p>

<p>My hon. friends on the opposite side of the House are always trying to imply that it is the Government&#x2019;s fault that there is insufficient labour and that because there is insufficient labour, there is insufficient development. Even if there were a sufficient supply of labour, that in itself is not reason enough to believe that it would bring sufficient progress, for in the first place it depends on the quality of the labour. It depends on the utilization of the labour; that is, the quality of the management of that labour. Just as the poor workman sometimes blames his tools for the mistakes he makes, so it frequently happens that the poor manager seeks the reason for his failure in his workers or in the lack of workers. Our managers are in duty bound to utilize their labour as efficiently as possible, particularly at a time when wages are rising. This applies to White as well as to non-White labour. It is also necessary that not only the managers, but the workers as well should be capable of being utilized efficiently. This entails that we should examine the question of the education and training, as far as our non-Whites are concerned as well.</p>

<p>This Government has accomplished great things in providing the non-Whites with school education, so much so that one finds in South Africa, in comparison with many other countries, a very low percentage of illiteracy. Instead of constantly being attacked abroad, the Government of South Africa ought to be praised abroad for the civilizing and upliftment work which it has brought to the non-Whites in South Africa and is still bringing to them. This school education alone, within the White and non-White areas, has contributed a great deal to making the non-Whites happier people, and also to giving the non-Whites greater efficiency in our economic life. Apart from school education a great deal has already been done today to make the Bantu, who are already active in business life, more competent for their task by means of in-service training. In this connection an interdepartmental committee has been appointed to devise ways and means, in conjunction with employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations, of ensuring that this in-service training takes place most beneficially. The first report in this connection has already been submitted.</p>

<p>However, it is now felt that the ideal of efficiency on the part of the Bantu in the occupations which have been entrusted to them, may be even better served when their employment may be preceded by pre-employment training. Such pre-employment training already exists in the Bantu homelands in the form of ordinary vocational education. The plan is to expand a form of in-service training, as is already being used in certain factories, to the White areas, after a thorough prior investigation has been instituted into its practicability. If this plan comes into operation, it will not mean that the Government has by so doing thrown overboard its policy of control over the influx of Bantu labour. On the contrary. It is the opinion of the Government that through more intensive labour-orientated training, the Bantu will not only be a happier person, but also a more productive worker, and that consequently it will be possible to employ fewer of them.</p>

<p>It will therefore be possible to produce more with the same number of workers, to the benefit of both worker and employer. This is particularly important in times such as these in which constant demands for higher wages are being made. This idea of pre-employment and in-service training of Bantu in the White area does not mean that all occupations are going to be thrown open to the Bantu in White areas; the intention is merely that this will refer to those industrial categories of employment which have been properly thrown open to Bantu individuals in the White areas, and to which they have been properly admitted.</p>

<p><span class="col_4385-4386" refersTo="page_0746"/>It is the intention of this Government to take the steps envisaged in this connection as rapidly as possible. I am consequently making an appeal to the employers&#x2019; organizations to supplement and expand the existing training funds so that they cover not only apprentices and technicians, but semi-skilled and unskilled workers as well. This will mean that it will be possible to involve large numbers of Bantu workers in this process. The Government is prepared to consider financial concessions in this regard.</p>

<p>The statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that most of the statements I had made in the past on this matter had not worked out, is quite wrong. Hon. members will recall that in 1971 I made certain statements in my Budget speech in regard to labour. Those statements led to discussions with the Chamber of Industries, to the Rieckert Commission and to the White Paper of the Government on labour and decentralization. This White Paper was met with general acclaim from the industries, and it had its positive results. Last year I again enumerated in the Budget certain concessions in respect of labour. These were also accepted gladly by the employers and have already been applied to a quite considerable extent.</p>

<p>There are a few other matters I want to touch on, matters raised by this side and that side of the House. I am thinking, for example, of matters touched upon by the hon. member for Von Brandis who discussed the duality of our economy. One can spend hours discussing that topic. I am thinking of the matters which were touched upon by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens which related to motor vehicles, the protection of motor vehicle spares and the pessimistic mood in certain sectors of business life. However, time does not allow me to go into all these matters.</p>

<p>Before I conclude there are two matters I wish to mention briefly. The one refers to the Public Service. The hon. member for Constantia discussed the so-called high Government expenditure, and stated that the Public Service is the most unproductive sector in our society. The hon. member is nodding his head in the affirmative; he therefore confirms this. I want to ask the hon. member on what grounds he makes that assertion. Why do hon. members on that side of the House always single out our public servants for critical comment&#x003F;All too frequently Hon. members of the Opposition refer to our officials in a derogatory manner. I can give them the assurance that although there are few exceptions here and there, our officials on the whole are performing their task in a manner deserving of great praise. I want to ask the hon. member what criterion he uses to measure the productivity of a public servant. What is his criterion when he measures the productivity of the Public Service, as one does with the workers in a factory&#x003F; My hon. friend, the hon. member for East London City, must tell me with what criterion he measures the productivity of the public service&#x003F; With what criterion does he measure the productivity of a teacher&#x003F; Or the productivity of a Minister&#x003F; And with what criterion does he measure the productivity of a member of Parliament&#x003F; The work of the officials may perhaps seem to members to be of a very poor quality, it may appear very unproductive, but let me tell them that the work of our officials is indispensable to economic growth, and is something without which the community of South Africa could never move forward.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, together with other hon. members, discussed devaluation. I do not think it behoves the hon. Leader and other members of the Opposition to say these things about devaluation now. They are prepared to accent the advantages of devaluation, but they do not want to accept any of the disadvantages. Last year, after our devaluation, I warned that devaluation was going to cost us something in the form of inflation. I said that there was going to be a 7.7% rise in the cost of living, but that the increased advantages would be far greater. If it had not had its advantages, we would not have been able today to vote the funds which we have in fact voted and to make the concessions in our Budget which we have in fact made. If it had not been for devaluation, we would not have had this relatively favourable balance of trade, the rise in prices and the drop in imports. If it had not had its advantages, we would not have had this favourable balance of trade, and we would not have had this capital inflow. On the contrary. Instead of a capital inflow, we would have had speculation against the rand I want to make it clear, in particular, to the hon. member for Constantia, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, as well as the hon. member for Von Brandis who so frequently speaks against devaluation, <span class="col_4387-4388" refersTo="page_0747"/>that if it had not been for devaluation, we would not have had this favourable balance of trade and would not have been able to encourage this growth as we are in fact doing. If it had not been for that, we would not have had the liquidity which my hon. friend referred to. Then the building societies in South Africa would not have had the money which they now have, and the Stock Exchange would not have been as lively as it is at present. All in all, devaluation has brought us far more advantages than disadvantages.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by adopting a suggestion given to me by the hon. member for Constantia. He said that I should cease garbing myself in the robes of a poet or a philosopher, and that I should rather put on the business suit of a company chairman reporting to his shareholders at an annual shareholders&#x2019; meeting. He then gave me an example of what he would have discussed at such a meeting.</p>

<p>I want to say, with all due respect, that if the hon. member had made a speech at the annual meeting of his shareholders such as the one he presented as an example here, he would have deserved to have been kicked out as chairman by his shareholders. I should like to tell the hon. member how I think I should address my shareholders. I would say to them: It is a pleasure for me to be able to inform you that despite difficult international circumstances, our company has experienced a relatively good year. The liquidity of the company has been increased to an exceptional extent as a result of the fact that our expenditure has decreased considerably, and our income has increased considerably. In addition outsiders have shown so much confidence in the company that they have entrusted major permanent amounts, totalling more than R500 million, in funds to the permanent care of the board, so that the board is at present able to undertake major expansion work without asking its shareholders for additional capital funds. The reserves of the company have also, during the past financial year, shown an exceptionally high increase, i.e. from R439 million to R1 090 million. The profits of the company have increased by 4%, a percentage profit which could have been higher. But, under the circumstances, it compares favourably with that of many other similar companies. There are clearly-discernible new signs of growth and of progress, and to us the future seems a favourable one. To my regret, however, I have to inform you that the board has experienced considerable difficulties with a certain group of shareholders, shareholders who do not adopt such a positive attitude to the future development of the company. However, the board does not pay much heed to them for they are a small minority and in any case, they do not themselves know what they want.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is not present here this afternoon, but, for the sake of the record, I think it is essential for me to say what I am going to say. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout will be able to read my Hansard to see what was said by me this afternoon. I am sure that all parliamentarians in this House, on both sides, will agree with what I am now going to say. In a previous debate the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said the following (Hansard, col. 1137)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall tell you: What he sees is that the Coloureds are always set apart; they must always go round the back. They sit behind a rope in the city hall. They are always partitioned off or excluded. Just take a look at the Galleries of this House of Assembly. Mr. Tom Swartz, the leader of 2 million Coloureds in this country, sits partitioned off in a corner. He cannot come to this Parliament like an ordinary South African and sit where he pleases. I may not even take the leader of the Coloureds for a cup of tea in the parliamentary lounge. I, who am a Member of this Parliament, elected by the people, cannot take the leader of 2 million Coloureds to the refreshment room of this House for a cup of coffee.</block>

<p>Of course, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was trying to get at the Government in this way, but the Government is not responsible for any arrangements in the buildings of Parliament; that is the exclusive responsibility of this House on the one hand and the Senate on the other. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has been a member of this House for many years. I have always regarded him as a good parliamentarian. He ought to know that there are two Standing Committees which are appointed by Mr. Speaker and on which both sides of the House have representation. They are the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders and the Committee on Internal Arrangements. Should he therefore feel dissatisfied with any arrangement in this House, then it is his duty to approach his own party in the first instance and convince them of his point of view. Then the representatives of his party may raise the matter on these particular committees. If the committee concerned should reject the matter, then the hon. member and other members of this House are free to broach the matter here.</p>

<p>I must say with regard to the arrangements of Parliament, Mr. Chairman, that the resolutions taken by these two committees have always been unanimous up to now. As far as I can remember&#x2014;and I have been serving on those Committees for many years, there has never been a difference of opinion. As far as the arrangements of this House are concerned, there have always been unanimous resolutions.</p>

<p>Sir, we attach the greatest value to the customs, the traditions and the procedures of this House. I trust therefore that the hon. member, and any other hon. member of this House, will bear this procedure in mind so that matters of this nature shall not be broached in this open House. The hon. member may, in accordance with this, approach his own representatives so that the matter may be discussed on those Committees.</p>

<p><span class="col_4391-4392" refersTo="page_0749"/>Mr. Chairman, allow me to behave in a manner which differs from that of the hon. member to whom the hon. the Leader of the House has just referred, and to avail myself of this opportunity to express appreciation for what is being done towards the smooth working of Parliament by the Secretariat, and also by the Committees concerned. Sir, we often have visitors from abroad, people who are acquainted with other parliamentary institutions, and one after the other their comment is that they are highly impressed with the arrangements of this Parliament. Here before me I have a letter which I received only this morning from London from a visitor who sat over there in the Gallery last week. We have limited seating accommodation in our Galleries, but this still does not mean that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was correct in what he said. I think that V.I.P. treatment is given to all visitors who come here. As I have said, we have limited accommodation, and I want to congratulate the Secretariat on the arrangements which have been made, particularly in the past few weeks. With the aid of closed circuit television and a room on the first floor, additional accommodation can be made available to the large overflow of visitors.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to refer, too, to the task of Hansard. A number of years ago the staff of the House of Assembly themselves took over this task, which was previously done on contract, and one wondered whether they would be able to perform this murderous task in addition to their numerous duties, especially in the course of a session. Today I want to express the opinion that they are doing so with signal success&#x2014;the people in charge of Hansard who must work day and night to keep up to date and who have made so much progress up to this stage that we have indexes to subjects and speakers in every weekly edition of Hansard as well. At the end of the session, in the thick volumes, we have an index to questions and all the other things as well.</p>

<p>Sir, I should also like to say &#x201C;Thank you&#x201D; for the facilities we have here, even though this cannot be done every day, for translating speeches in the Chamber from Afrikaans into English on fixed occasions. A week or so ago a visitor from abroad made the comment to me that this was an outstanding service, and I think that I am speaking for everyone when I say I should like to congratulate the person concerned, Mr. Culhane, on the service which he renders to this House in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall be very brief. The matter touched on by the hon. the Leader of the House, has unfortunately been touched on in the absence of the member concerned who, due to unavoidable circumstances, is absent, but I am sure that this will be brought to this member&#x2019;s attention and that he will react to it in good time, either in public or in private.</p>

<p>I should just like to say to the hon. member for Stellenbosch that as regards the services rendered by the staff, and particularly by Hansard, to Members of Parliament, they do deserve the thanks of every member on both sides of the House, but I just hope that the speech of praise made by the hon. member for Stellenbosch does not create the impression that all members are satisfied with everything which exists and which is being done in the House of Assembly and in the Senate. For example, there are people in the ranks of the Opposition who feel that there are certain matters which can be improved, but it is not my intention to discuss this here. I agree with the hon. the Leader of the House that these are matters for which Committees exist. I only rise to sound the warning that the speech of praise made by the hon. member for Stellenbosch must not be interpreted as complete satisfaction with everything that exists in this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, because the time for this Vote is usually limited, I do not request the privilege of the half hour There are a few matters which I should like to raise urgently with the Deputy Minister, who is in charge of this discussion. I should have liked to raise matters of wide importance today, but there is one question which affects the vast majority of the population of South Africa and which is becoming so urgent that I make no apology for mentioning it first of all today, and that is the problem of the accumulating traffic in our cities&#x2014;the congestion of traffic in our large cities. There was a time when we argued in this House and when many people thought the solution to the traffic problem was to be found in freeways in the cities.</p>

<p><span class="col_4393-4394" refersTo="page_0750"/>However, the Government came to the conclusion that this was not the solution and indicated clearly in its White Paper on the Borckenhagen Report, which it published in 1971, and again in the latest report of the Secretary for Transport, that in spite of further representations made to it by the cities, the Government would carry out only those undertakings which had already been concluded with the cities in respect of these roads and would take no further responsibility. But, Sir, there are certain lessons which we may learn from the experience we have had with the subsidies paid by the National Transport Commission to our municipalities for freeways, and these are that these matters are urgent and that unnecessary delay, whether on the part of the State or the municipalities, causes unnecessary expense to the taxpayer and gives rise to further unnecessary delays. The indecision displayed by the Government in the case of these freeways which are being built in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town is rather striking.</p>

<p>Johannesburg, the example which I know best, applied for a subsidy for certain planned roads which they had on their books, roads which were in the planning stage, and it took six years before they received a final reply. Johannesburg has calculated, and this calculation is correct &#x2014;this is the estimate today&#x2014;that whereas the roads would have cost R45 million originally they will now, as a result of this delay of six years, cost R80 million, an increase of R35 million because of the delay. It is very interesting to see what this means. This means that the State, if it had said to Johannesburg in the first place, &#x201C;Proceed on your own; do not wait for a subsidy from me,&#x201D; and Johannesburg had built those roads, then the State, or the taxpayers, would have saved R15 million because that subsidy would not have been paid and the City of Johannesburg would have saved R25 million, because the cost would then have been R45 million instead of R80 million. That is the lesson which I think we must learn.</p>

<p>But there are still many urgent problems experienced by our cities. In the Government&#x2019;s White Paper on the Report of the Borckenhagen Commission which it published in 1971, the following is stated at the end of paragraph 9&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is, however, aware of the new demands being made on local authorities regarding the planning and financing of modern urban and metropolitan road networks in order to provide, <i>inter alia,</i> efficient systems of mass passenger transport. (Cf. par. 393 of the Marais Report, R.P. 31/1969.) The Government will therefore consult the provincial authorities on the best procedure whereby this matter could be properly and speedily investigated with a view to formulating guiding principles regarding future development, and also the financing involved. The body which will be appointed to conduct the inquiry, will be requested to submit within six months an interim report in which broad guiding lines regarding probable future developments in urban transport in South Africa, and the possible financing thereof, are indicated.</block>

<p>That was six months, and there was an interim report.</p>

<p>Now I take it that what is known as the Driessen Commission is engaged in considering the matter. I should very much like to know when we may expect this report which will deal with this urgent problem of the mass transportation of city-dwellers in our large cities. Then I should further like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he will give the undertaking that when this interim report, which presumably has to appear any day now, is published&#x2014;it will be an important report because the commission is under the chairmanship of one of our most able officials&#x2014;speedy action will be taken. Again I mention Johannesburg as an example, because this is the city where I live and in which my constituency is situated. Johannesburg is now planning for a tube train, an underground railway. They have a plan according to which one part of this railway line will emerge in my constituency, Yeoville&#x2014;consequently it interests me a great deal&#x2014;and this railway line, which is urgently required &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>In Yeoville there is just sand everywhere. The point which I want to make, is that such a form of transport is imperative for a city of the size of Johannesburg and with the growth potential of Johannesburg and of the whole Witwatersrand. It should be borne in mind that Johannesburg does not serve the City of <span class="col_4395-4396" refersTo="page_0751"/>Johannesburg only it also serves the mighty Witwatersrand with its tremendous concentration of people. It has been estimated that such an underground train system will cost R300 million at today&#x2019;s prices. However, we have inflation in South Africa today. Perhaps I should rather say &#x201C;cost increase&#x201D; because I do not want to use contentious words today. Some people say that we have a cost increase of 12% in South Africa, but even if it is only 10%, this means that for every year for which the construction of this railway line is delayed, the cost of the railway line will increase by R30 million. The amount by which the costs increase, will be borne by the taxpayers of Johannesburg and by the State and therefore every day is important, because R30 million per annum means R80 000 per day. Therefore I want to address a special request to the hon. the Deputy Minister to urge the committee to get a move on so that the interim report may be made available. Then there will still be two things for the hon. the Deputy Minister to do. In the first place he will have to decide immediately what he is going to do by way of implementing that report and in the second place he will have to instruct the local authorities concerned &#x2014;it is not only Johannesburg which is concerned in this matter&#x2014;to start following immediately those guidelines which will be prescribed to them.</p>

<p>I give this matter priority in this debate, because it is a pressing matter. I have often wondered&#x2014;I have never seen any estimate in this connection&#x2014;how many manhours are lost in South Africa, where manpower is a precious commodity, in cities like Johannesburg. Cape Town and Pretoria. Judging from my experience more manhours may possibly be lost in Pretoria than in the other cities because of the fact that people are delayed in their own personal transport from their homes to their places of employment and back. I believe that this amounts to hundreds of many years per annum. Anything which we in South Africa can do to meet this problem and, if possible, to anticipate it, will bear strong testimony to the efficiency of our community and to the determination of all of us not to be lavish with our most precious possession, namely our people.</p>

<p>There is something concerning national roads which I want to mention. It worries me to see how the funds available for national roads in South Africa are accumulating. I see interesting figures in the report of the Department of Transport for 1971-&#x2019;72. On 31st March, 1971, there was an amount of R35 305 million in the National Road Fund which had not been utilized. In this connection I refer to the entry &#x201C;Excess of income over expenditure as at 1st April, 1971&#x201D; in statement 1 on page 24 of the Report, R.P. 85-&#x2019;72. Furthermore I notice that revenue for the year 1971-&#x2019;72 exceeds expenditure by approximately R29 400 million. This leaves a total of approximately R65 million as a balance in the National Road Fund. This year Parliament is being asked to appropriate an amount of approximately R99 million for the National Road Fund, which will be collected solely by means of customs duties, and so on.

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Yeoville touched on the matter of freeways. One has to admit that delays do occur but when one sees what is in fact being done to build freeways, and when one sees how expensive and how difficult they are to build, I want to express my gratitude for what has in fact been done. I was in Johannesburg recently and I must truly say that I was impressed by the progress which had in fact been made there. The hon. member for Yeoville was probably correct in saying that if the roads had been built sooner, they would have been cheaper. How was one to have known that in advance&#x003F; It could just as well have been the other way round. Perhaps the money was not available at that time. It is not always so easy to start building such a scheme precisely at the time when one wants to do so. I think the same applies to this tube train. We shall probably have to have tube trains in future when our cities are big enough, but in other countries it has been found that one cannot build an underground railway system before one&#x2019;s city has reached a certain size, because before that stage such a system cannot operate economically. If the investigation were to reveal that Johannesburg had become big enough then an underground railway system would probably be necessary.</p>

<p>I should like to touch on another matter; I want to discuss the development of air traffic, particularly as far as the rural areas are concerned. We live in a country of wide expanses. Fine roads are being constructed at present and we are convinced that it is a good thing that this is being done. However, the future does indicate that we shall have to make progressively <span class="col_4397-4398" refersTo="page_0752"/>greater use of air traffic. The Government appointed a commission of inquiry with the terms of reference to investigate airfields. The abbreviation of the name of this commission is INDEV. The commission has released very interesting data. The commission was appointed to ascertain whether existing airfields should be developed and to investigate the matter of the capital expenditure which will be required for building more airfields. What is very interesting is that they found that if airfields were in fact built it would stimulate the economic growth of the rural areas and would also promote decentralization. That is why I regard this commission, and the data which they have released, as being important. They also found that the State should take a share in the development of more airfields, that it should even go as far as subsidizing airfields, particularly where they were strategically and economically essential. They also drew up a list of priorities for the development of airfields. The first group is the strategically essential airfields. Here they found that it was essential for the Department of Defence to take a share in the establishment of this category of airfields. The second group was the strategically desirable and economically essential airfields. Here the State has to make a contribution. Thirdly, there are the airfields which are economically desirable and in the interests of the country. Where growth points are being established and an airfield is in the interests of the State for that reason, the State should also make a contribution. The fourth group is where local regional requirements render an airfield essential. In this respect, too, they found that the State could make a small contribution. The fifth group is the local airfields provided by municipalities. It was found that at this stage the municipalities should continue with these airfields. In their recommendation they stated that the Government should make an amount of at least R400 000 available for these airfields. I should like to support them in this but I just wonder whether this amount of R400 000 is not perhaps a little small for such an important matter. I believe that in the future we shall have to do a great deal more in this respect. This commission will have a bigger task in the future. For example, they will have to determine requirements and priorities, they will have to determine the places where the airfields are to be built, and they will have to make recommendations with regard to subsidies for such airfields.</p>

<p>Another aspect of civil aviation to which I want to draw the attention of the House, is the valuable asset which the civil aviation subsidy scheme has been to the country in the past. This scheme was introduced on 1st September, 1954, at the time for a period of four years. From time to time, however, this scheme was extended. The present scheme was introduced with effect from 1st April, 1970, for another period of three years. I think we should continue with this. The scheme makes provision for the issue of private pilots&#x2019; licences, for advanced training of pilots, for commercial pilots&#x2019; licences and for the training of instructors and engineers. I believe that this is a very important job of work which is being done. What is more, on the recommendation of the Civil Aviation Subsidy Committee, subsidies may be granted for gliders and parachuting equipment. It is interesting to note that of the 365 candidates who participated in the scheme in the year 1971-&#x2019;72, 354 succeeded in passing the course. Since the establishment of the scheme in 1954, an amount of R581 000 has been spent on it, 2 075 candidates have received private pilots&#x2019; licences, 2 306 candidates have undergone advanced training and 265 candidates have received commercial pilots&#x2019; licences. This shows us what a tremendous asset this has already been to our aviation. I think it is a fine thing that they received R80 000 last year, but I also think that it will perhaps be necessary in future even to increase this amount since it is so important for us to improve our air services, to decentralize and to move forward with future development. We must also look to the possibility of more and regular regional services which will render possible easy transport from town to town and from town to city, and we must ensure that strategically our country will be prepared in the future. Since we may require airfields for the defence of our country, we must see to it that we do the necessary in this connection.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to be able this time to agree with an hon. member on the Government side. We agree that the expansion of air transport is something which must be planned now and which must receive urgent attention.</p>

<p><span class="col_4399-4400" refersTo="page_0753"/>&#x2020;I believe that in this modern age time has become one of the scarcest commodities and that air travel is the answer to that problem. More and more we are going to have to rely on the speedier forms of transport not only on the ground&#x2014;the hon. member for Yeoville has referred to the speedier forms of transport needed on the ground to get people to their work and save millions of man-hours per year&#x2014;but also in the air to get people from town A to town B faster, more easily and more conveniently. We on this side of the House are in full support of anything that can be done to urge the Government to greater action in creating a net-work of airfields, landing strips and the necessary facilities to go with them. It is not enough only to create the airfields and the facilities; I believe we also have to bring about a change in attitude in respect of the granting of certificates. I believe there is a tendency to turn down applications for air carrier certificates, something which is not assisting the expansion of commercial flying. The more facilities we have available the more competition there will be, the cheaper it will be to fly and the more people will make use of commercial flying. This in turn will mean more feeder services feeding the South African Airways, more business for the South African Airways and so the circle will continue. So, Mr. Chairman, I am in full sympathy with the views of the hon. member who has just spoken.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking of airports, I had the privilege and pleasure of being present at the opening of the new international airport at Jan Smuts. I should like to record my tribute to those who were concerned with the planning and construction of this magnificent international terminal. I wish I could say the same for Durban. Poor Durban! While we have beautiful facilities at the D.F. Malan airport and Jan Smuts airport with its facilities, Durban with 665 000 passengers in 1971-&#x2019;72 and very many more in this current year, is still battling with an out-of-date airport, totally inadequate and totally hopeless for the demands that are made on it. It handles something like 2 000 passengers per day. This year we have voted on the Estimates million in respect of the new airport at La Mercy. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he will tell us today when the extensions to the existing Louis Botha airport are going to be completed and when he estimates the new airport at La Mercy is likely to come about, if ever. We are being asked to vote R&#x00BD; million this year. Can he give us some idea of what in fact is going on there! Amongst all the rumours and all the denials we would like to know what is happening. Suddenly we have this money on the Estimates. Will he please clarify the picture once more and tell us what Louis Botha will have, when it will have it and what the prospects are for the airport at La Mercy.</p>

<p>Coming down from the air to the ground, I want to refer to the motor transport vote, where again there has been a considerable increase in the kilometres being travelled. I find, for instance, that the Department of Customs and Excise has an increase of over 50%, i.e. from 960 000 to 1&#x00BD; million km in the estimates of Government Garage transport services rendered. There are similar increases in other Votes. Generally, because of the removal from the Estimates of two departments which I presume are now being budgeted for through other bodies&#x2014;Bantu Trust is one of them&#x2014;there is a reduction in the total mileage which we are being asked to vote. There are however, general increases throughout. We have in previous years debated the use of official transport by Cabinet Ministers. We have been told that all travel by Cabinet Ministers is official travel. That is the official policy. But does that mean, too, that all travel by Cabinet Ministers&#x2019; families is official travel&#x003F; I have here a photograph showing two Government Garage motorcars taking two members of Cabinet families 150 miles, not to go and buy anything, but to a preview of a private auction sale! You can identify one of them. I will give the number to the hon. the Minister if he wants it. If Ministers travel around on private business, we can argue about that. But, surely, you do not take two official motorcars to go and view goods which are to be sold at an auction sale 150 miles away; surely you could arrange to take one car and share it. But in any case, if you are going to a private auction sale to buy private things for yourself, is it Government policy that that should also be done by official transport&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, they did not even change the numberplates. Perhaps they slipped up there. The hon. the Minister asks what we did in our time. I will tell you what we did in our time, Mr. Chairman. <span class="col_4401-4402" refersTo="page_0754"/>Ministers used to use their private cars when they went on private and political business; not like the hon. the Minister of Tourism, who goes all the way from Durban to the Klip River by-election in a Government Garage car. But he did not use GG numberplates; he had ND numberplates, so that the car would not be recognized as an official car. He was attending the hon. member for Umhlatuzana&#x2019;s election, to help that hon. member to come to this House. That is not national service; that is a national disservice. And then he uses official transport for that. No, Sir, there must be a limit to this. Whilst the hon. the Minister has said on many occasions that Ministers can use their cars for any business, that all business is official business, I do not accept that attending auction sales requires taking two ministerial cars simply to view what is going to be sold.</p>

<p>In the minute left to me I want to deal with another matter. Can the hon. the Minister clarify the position in regard to the inspection of ships&#x003F; There has been publicity in the last week of a ship in Durban harbour which the crew refused to sail because they maintained that the ship was unseaworthy. Everybody has been passing the buck. The port captain says if he is approached he will send somebody to inspect it. The inspector says that unless he is asked by the agents, he cannot go aboard to inspect it. Now what is the position&#x003F; Must the ship be allowed to go to sea when there are allegations by the crew serious enough to lead them to strike, allegations that the ship is unseaworthy and dangerous&#x003F; Is there no machinery, no responsibility on the Government to ensure that that ship is examined and that in fact, it is established whether it is or is not seaworthy&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

I do not want to name the Minister now, but one of the Ministers sent his wife and family in his private railway coach to have a holiday at the Wilderness. The then hon. Prime Minister, Gen.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was purchased, according to my information, by the Department of Defence; the plane was purchased by the Government. I have all the particulars here. I have a list of all the passengers and flights of that Avro York. These were private persons, not on official journeys. I have, for instance, the names of a lady Moore and a Mr. John Martin, who was at that time chairman of the Chamber of Mines, and Mr. McIntosh. From Algiers there were Genis. Van Ryneveld and Venter&#x2014;that is from Germiston-Northolt, Rome-Z.L.S. There was a large number of these flights. After we took office in 1948, we even went so far as to allow Gen. Smuts, who had an appointment as chancellor of one of the universities in England to deliver a speech there, to use an Avro York to go to England and back. Nobody said anything about that. I have evidence here that Ministers of the previous Government used their motor-cars for private purposes. I have here a letter, written to me quite unsolicited, by a former driver of one of the motor-cars. I will give his name too. He writes as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Hiermee wil ek graag bevestig dat gedurende my dienstermyn as amptelike motorbestuurder by die Staatsgarage to Bloemfontein van 1942 tot 1959, ek benodig was, en opdragte ontvang het, om verskeie Kabinetsministers van tyd tot tyd in amptelike en private hoedanighede, insluitende na party-politieke vergaderings sowel as party-kongresse, te vervoer. Dit sluit in die gewese Eerste Minister van die Verenigde Party, sowel as die gewese Minister van Lande, met wie ek baie te doen gehad het.

<p>There was quite a long debate about Mr. Coward and the private railway coach. Mr. Sauer even quoted some of the poems that Noel Coward wrote, and from some of his plays. Mr. Chairman, I merely mention this to show that that is what happened under a previous Government. Is it in our interest to scratch these things out&#x003F; I have been a Minister of Transport for 19 years now, and I have never even mentioned this, in spite of a lot of provocation. I have kept quiet. I can tell hon. members a great deal about what previous Ministers did, but what does it help&#x003F; Why should we scratch these things out&#x003F; Why should we start muck-raking&#x003F; It is not worth it. I suggest that hon. members should refrain from doing that. After all. Ministers have certain privileges; they all have them One day when those hon. gentlemen sit on this side of the House they will have those same privileges. We have Cadillacs; that is true. All my colleagues do not want Cadillacs. I have one, and I like it very much indeed, and I have a second car. The main reason for having a second car is that we do not want to use the big cars on outside roads. As a matter of fact, most of the time I use my Buick, travelling to and from the House. It is only when I attend official functions, when my wife is with me that I use the Cadillac. Now what is wrong with that&#x003F; Surely there is nothing wrong with that. I know that under the previous Government they even used Air Force planes to attend public meetings. I have that evidence, too. So I say again: What do we gain by it&#x003F; We do not want to talk <span class="col_4405-4406" refersTo="page_0756"/>about these things. I know of a Cabinet Minister in the United Party who used to use his private coach to go to Bloemfontein during the night He used to leave Johannesburg in the evening and be there the next morning, and he used to entertain his friends in that private coach. It might interest hon. members to know that when Gen. Hertzog made that very famous speech of his at De Wildt in 1912, he travelled there in his private coach.</p>

They had motorcars in 1912, but it was apparently the usual thing for a Minister to do He travelled in his private coach, which was shunted into a siding there. He made his speech, had lunch and came back to Pretoria in his private coach. These things have been happening, and I suggest that we leave this type of thing alone. Let us not try to scratch these things out; it is really not worth it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one does not want to scratch these things up, but the hon. the Minister must rest assured that the people we entertained after the war we entertained for one purpose only, and that was to give South Africa a very much better image than it has at the present moment. If the Government brought some of the leading figures from overseas and entertained them, I do not think we would object if Government means were used to take them around the country. Noel Coward did a wonderful job amongst the troops during his visit here. I remember the occasion well, and I think it was money well spent. Sir, I do not want to continue in that particular vein.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Humansdorp mentioned the establishment of private aerodromes.</p>

<p>As a representative of the Western Cape, I want to congratulate the department on the very fine airport, the D. F. Malan Airport, we have here in Cape Town. It does, however, lack a few of the amenities it should have. I would, for instance, like to suggest that consideration be given to installing escalators in the building so that one could do away with the very steep stairs up to the restaurant. Then, I want to refer to a fault which I think is found at many of our airports today. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could not do something about speeding up the handling of baggage. There is a wonderful machine at the airport, but something is wrong with the link between the aircraft and the actual distribution of the baggage. At the one end the process is manual and at the other end it is mechanical.</p>

<p>There is another item I wish to refer to. I have spoken to the Minister about this. The main runways at the D. F. Malan Airport have been lengthened. They are now something like 10 500 feet, or 3 200 metres in length. It is mentioned in the report that they were completed in 1972. I have on previous occasions brought up the question of these runways and the national road to the Strand. Before this road was actually constructed, I suggested in this House that the Department of Transport, which also controlls the airports, should give consideration to sinking the national road under the extended runaways at the D. F. Malan Airport. At the present moment one has to cross a bridge over a railway line at the end of the main runways. The run-in to the runways is actually indicated by means of lights on top of the bridge. The hon. the Minister has explained to me what the position is there. One is not allowed to park on that bridge. On account of the danger the Traffic Police do not allow one to park on that bridge any more. During holidays and over weekends the Provincial Traffic Police stop one from parking there. A week or two ago an aircraft came in from Durban, and made a very low approach. One is, of course, deceived by heights, but one wonders what would have happened if a double-decker bus had been crossing the bridge at that time. You will recall, Sir, what happened in East London when a double-decker municipal bus was struck by the wheels of a Skymaster when it came in to land. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister, with the advent of these very large aircraft and with the weather conditions that we have in the Cape, that serious consideration should be given to the sinking of this national road and the extension of the runways over the road. I realize that this will be expensive, but I feel that it should be done in the interests of safety. This has been done, for instance, at London Airport, and one sees similar arrangements at other airports all over the world. I feel that the existing position could well lead to an accident. Again, <span class="col_4407-4408" refersTo="page_0757"/>I do not want to mention names. [Interjection.] I will mention names, if the hon. member wants me to do so, but I think it is wrong to mention names across the floor of the House. Leading pilots have expressed the same view. Especially foreign pilots who have brought planes to this country say that this is a dangerous factor. They are surprised that the road was allowed to go so close to the airport.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with another subject concerning the local scene, and that is the apartheid regulations that exist as far as our buses and taxis are concerned. Sir, we have the largest Coloured population in the whole of the Republic here in the Cape. The vast majority of the Coloureds have been moved to the Cape Flats, and the more affluent Coloureds and those who wish to get on in life with the assistance of the Coloured Development Corporation would like to run their own buses, but whenever these people have applied for certificates to operate buses their applications have been rejected. Things have got to a stage now where the Coloureds have become thoroughly frustrated and feel that there is no future for them in road transport. On the one hand they are told to establish their own industries and to get on to their own feet, and on the other hand their applicatons for certificates to run their own bus services are invariably refused. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to the question of allowing the Coloureds to run their own transport services. I think that is the least that the Government can do for the Coloureds here in the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Another item that I want to deal with is the local taxi service. The taxi service that we have here at the present moment is laughable. Some years ago the Government decided, in the interests of I do not know whom, to introduce taxi apartheid. Today you have the ridiculous position that there are White taxis and Coloured taxis.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. member how ridiculous it is. Taxis which are licensed to carry Whites only have Coloured and Bantu drivers. The taxi is licensed to carry Whites, and then you have a Coloured or a Bantu driver; that is how ridiculous it is. Hon. members who know the history of Cape Town will know that years ago we had hansom cabs here which were invariably driven by Coloureds. Over the years they changed over to the use of cars to carry on their business. There was no regulation which obliged the Coloured owners of these hansom cabs to convey only Whites or only Coloureds. It was only with the advent of this particular Government that it was decided to introduce what is called taxi apartheid. The position in the Cape today is that you simply cannot get White drivers for our buses or taxis. There is apartheid on our buses, but you find that every second bus in Cape Town is driven by a Coloured, simply because Whites are not available. You find that on buses which are licensed to carry White passengers you have a Coloured driver/conductor. Sir, I asked the hon. the Minister a question the other day and I was amazed to find that between 1968 and 1973 the number of White taxis operating from Bellville right down to Simonstown had increased by only eight, from 261 to 269. You can rest assured, Sir, that the vast majority of those White taxis are driven by Coloureds. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River raised matters here which ranged from airports right down to taxi-drivers and I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will reply to that.</p>

<p>Sir, from the time I entered this House, a little more than a decade ago, the subject of motor accidents, the slaughter on the roads and everything which that involves has regularly been discussed under this Vote. And not only has it been discussed under this Vote, but on occasion we have also had private motions and even snap debates on this matter. This has not been debated simply as a matter of normal routine but because it is a matter of national importance, and both sides of this House regard it with equal concern. The concern and the heartfelt anxiety of members of the House of Assembly in regard to the temporary and permanent mutilation of victims of motor accidents, the colossal death-toll on the roads and the tremendous economic losses resulting from the damage and destruction of vehicles, is confirmed by the fact that numbers of members of Parliament have also given evidence and submitted memoranda to the Committee of Inquiry into the South African Road Safety Council.</p>

<p>I should like to convey appreciation and also my thanks to the Committee of Inquiry under the chairmanship of Dr. Steyn, <span class="col_4409-4410" refersTo="page_0758"/>assisted by Prof. H. Venter and Mr. Melt van Niekerk, who acted as secretary. I should like to thank them for the comprehensive, enlightening and opinion-gauging final report which we have received. It is truly a magnificent achievement to have summarized so systematically, logically and completely the mass of data arising from all the memoranda submitted by private individuals and bodies and also the oral evidence given by individuals and bodies.</p>

<p>Some time ago I read the following in an overseas magazine in connection with traffic matters and road safety, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Just about everyone has solutions to traffic problems in this country and the more experts or would-be experts there are the more proposals are forthcoming as to changes that can be made for the better.</block>

<p>Perhaps in this country, too, there are thousands of such experts, people who were perhaps unable to give evidence, but also others who did not want to give evidence before this committee. I believe that they would perhaps be the people to level the most criticism at this report and the recommendations made by this committee. I am convinced that the bodies and the persons who did in fact give evidence are sincerely concerned about the road safety situation, and they are probably very grateful for this excellent report. It appears from the report of this committee, as well as from numerous other reports and scientific research concerning traffic on the roads, accidents and everything this involves, that the human element in traffic is of the utmost importance. This is really the cardinal point around which everything revolves. Consequently it is to be welcomed that the National Road Safety Council is arranging a symposium, to be held on 22nd June, 1973, concerning the human element in traffic. The venue for this symposium is Pretoria where one of the members of the committee, Prof. Herman Venter, is at present mayor.</p>

<p>The person behind the wheel who does not have the right attitude towards the use of the road, who does not have enough responsibility towards his fellow road-users and above all, towards himself, must be brought to book. It is this kind of driver who does not want to become safety-conscious. It is this kind of driver, too, who regards himself as above all human fallibility. He believes that the human factor does not play a role as far as he, as a driver, is concerned. Recklessness, a couldn&#x2019;t-care-less attitude, selfishness, frustration, wilfulness, adventurousness, impudence, negligence, inconsiderateness and injudiciousness, sometimes aggravated by the use of alcohol, are the elements to which expression are given as soon as those people get behind the steering-wheel of a vehicle.</p>

<p>If stricter action is not taken in future, in the light of penalties which already exist, against these irresponsible and reckless drivers who disregard the law, then this must inevitably lead to the general opinion that the eradication of the evil of the slaughter on our roads is a matter of concern to neither ourselves nor our authorities.</p>

<p>According to research only 10% of our drivers are responsible for 90% of all road accidents. Ten per cent of the drivers of South Africa are, in other words, a constant safety risk. It is imperative that this 10% be identified for the courts. In some way or another a record must be kept of this reckless driver.</p>

<p>The real culprits are in fact few in number and it should be a reasonably simple matter to get hold of them in course of time. I think that the 90% of careful and decent motorists can earnestly insist on that. What is more, I think that they can even demand that these road hogs be shown up.</p>

<p>It seems that legislation is being prepared to screen the motorists who are such a constant safety risk, to restrain them effectively and even to eliminate them temporarily as road-users. No information, no education, no pleas over the course of the years, nor even light penalties have made any impression on the reckless driver, whether under the influence of alcohol, or whether simply self-centred and unmannerly. He is still our companion on the road and in his own eyes he is a tremendously capable driver. The responsible, careful driver always has to take this unmannerly ruffian of the road into account. Even obeying the rules of the road is no insurance against a motor accident for the law-abiding motorist, because the fact must be taken into account that one out of every ten fellow road-users are reckless and dangerous and do not intend, or are possibly not capable, of obeying the highway code. It is indeed this group which becomes the target of our traffic police force. It is they who cause the traffic police force to be employed over the holidays, long weekends <span class="col_4411-4412" refersTo="page_0759"/>and Christmas and New Year holidays, to try to prevent slaughter on our roads. The challenge, then, is not only to discipline the 10% of chronically reckless drivers on our roads, but also to deal with them by means of restrictive measures. It is in fact important to make a plea to the responsible road-users to join the traffic police force in their struggle against the criminal on the road. It would not even help to lay down heavy fines for reckless infringements of traffic measures or to revoke the licences of those who have poor records as drivers. It is also essential in my opinion that motor cars should be summarily confiscated and that they should be impounded for varying periods should anyone drive in such a way as to endanger the life of his fellow road-user.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I should like to reply to certain matters which hon. members put to me. Since the hon. member for Yeoville, who has made his apologies, is not here at present. I shall first reply to other hon. members before I come back to the matters he raised.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the remarks that came from the hon. member for Humansdorp in respect of training, airfield planning, etc. I gladly acknowledge that he is correct in saying that the planning of airfields in South Africa and their classification will be of the utmost importance to us in the future. The hon. member for Yeoville referred to increasing costs. Nowhere is this more true than specifically where one is dealing with land and property. It is simply a fact that airfields take up large pieces of land. Therefore it is perhaps more essential for us to give attention to acquiring land or at least putting it aside. We must obtain it as quickly as possible so that it can be developed at a later stage for airport purposes, etc. I should like to refer to the subsidy scheme, and I want to say that we have achieved very favourable results. Unfortunately we also have to refer to certain shortcomings. Recently quite a few unfortunate private aircraft accidents have taken place in South Africa. Statistics indicate that this is nothing out of the ordinary when taken over a certain period. A whole series of these accidents have taken place in quick succession, and as a result this has made a greater impression on the reading public of South Africa. I should like to issue a warning on this occasion that our private pilots must fly more carefully. The weekend newspapers were again full of an accident that took place near Greytown in Natal. Merely on the facts I obtained from the newspapers, it would appear to me as if a reckless act of irresponsibility was committed. When an investigation is instituted, other facts may come to light which are not available to me now. As I have said, a series of such accidents has taken place recently, and my department wants to ensure that such accidents do not occur. I now want to issue the friendly warning that if measures, which exist at present and are implemented to guarantee the safety of private pilots and to ensure that they keep to the rules, are not complied with, I shall not hesitate to come to this House and take additional steps. This is not a threat, but it is a very friendly warning to our pilots, a warning that they must abide by aviation regulations which have been established as the result of thorough study and which are amended from time to time, as the circumstances make this necessary, to adapt to those circumstances. If all those steps, which are taken, are apparently insufficient, I must issue a warning that stricter steps will have to be taken.</p>

<p>I want to reply to the question which the hon. member for Yeoville mentioned, i.e. the traffic congestion in the cities. A committee of inquiry into urban transport facilities has been inaugurated. The hon. member for Yeoville has referred to that. In the first place, the committee was, of course, not appointed by my department, it was, in fact, appointed by the Minister of Finance. The committee&#x2019;s report will therefore go back to the Minister of Finance. But because my department is very closely concerned with this, it is a matter that deserves our attention, and I can inform the hon. member that it is the intention of this committee to publish, during this calendar year, a report about a very substantial problem. The scope of this problem is much greater than it would appear to us at first glance and even than we could perhaps effectively indicate by discussion in the scope of this debate. The problem of urban congestion is one of the big traffic problems of modern times, not only for our own cities in South Africa, but for the whole world. It is true, a great deal is being done about that in South Africa in an effort to solve the problem. In this connection I can just refer to what has already been done by the National Transport Commission. They undertook <span class="col_4413-4414" refersTo="page_0760"/>certain obligations in respect of expenditure within municipal areas. Durban has been allocated an amount of R10 million; Port Elizabeth an amount of R5 million; Johannesburg an amount of R15 million; Cape Town an amount of R11 million; Pretoria an amount of R10 million. These amounts, a total of R51 million, will be provided by the National Road Fund to help solve this problem.</p>

<p>Well, apart from the R51 million that has already been made available for urban freeway schemes, the commission has also accepted financial responsibility in respect of the construction and maintenance of quite a number of projects, a few of which I should like to mention: The ring-road round Durban is going to require an amount of R37 million; the Pietermaritzburg by-pass is going to require R3,5 million; the Kroonstad bypass is going to require R2,3 million; the Pretoria eastern by-pass is going to require R19 million; the Silverton by-pass is going to require R3.2 million; Johannesburg&#x2019;s ring-roads are going to require R55 million; the Bloemfontein by-pass is going to require R11 million; the East London bypass is going to require R11 million and Port Elizabeth by-pass an additional R11 million. This amounts to R153 million. The hon. member will agree with me that that is no longer a mere bagatelle.</p>

<p>This is such an extensive problem, so tremendous a problem that planning and spending must be done very carefully.</p>

<p>I should like, through this House, to make a friendly request to municipalities, such as the Municipality of Johannesburg, which I hear&#x2014;this knowledge has not reached me in any other way&#x2014;is engaged on an underground train system. This will be a big and costly scheme and I doubt whether the amount involved is going to be only R300 million; I think it is going to be considerably more, not because of the time factor, but because of engineering problems. Johannesburg&#x2019;s circumstances are unique in the sense that it is chiefly an undermined area and more subject to earth tremors than other parts of the country because of pressure shifts deep below the surface. For that reason, from an engineering point of view, additional reinforcements will have to be introduced in the case of Johannesburg, something which would perhaps not be necessary elsewhere. Not that our engineers would flinch from that, because I think our country&#x2019;s engineers are resourceful enough, but the cost factor must be given very proper consideration. Over and above that, the planning is going to be extremely important. We are dealing here with something that must be erected for our succeeding generations. What we are going to do in this respect is going to have a permanent influence on Johannesburg&#x2019;s transport for a 100 years or more. Therefore I appeal to Johannesburg&#x2019;s local authorities to consult all possible departments concerned, including my own department, so that whatever is established there can be co-ordinated, properly planned and bear the stamp of development that will also still be of service to our descendants. The hon. member asked me to give quick attention to it when this matter saw the light. I can tell him that the committee to which I referred has experienced certain problems with respect to information that must specifically come from local authorities. A part of the delay in the committee&#x2019;s activities is specifically as a result of the lack of information and co-ordination on the part of local authorities. Since this committee is again becoming better known as a result of this debate, I would be grateful if local authorities could submit any information to this committee as quickly as possible so that attention could quickly be given to it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;"The hon. member for Durban Point referred to feeder services. I am on record as a person very much in favour of feeder services in South Africa. I had the privilege of serving on the Civil Aviation Advisory Committee for a number of years. From the records of that committee it will be obvious that on every occasion I pleaded for additional feeder services. I am completely in agreement with the hon. member. Feeder services have a tremendous potential for opening up parts of the country which are not being served properly by other means of transport. In a large country like ours, there is potential, an undoubted potential for feeder services. The hon. member can therefore rest assured that he has my complete sympathy and that wherever possible feeder services will get the assistance which they are entitled to.</p>

<p><span class="col_4415-4416" refersTo="page_0761"/>*The hon. member&#x2019;s compliments in connection with Jan Smuts Airport were unfortunately accompanied by a small measure of criticism about the position in Durban. I shall first explain the position in Durban to the hon. member. I shall mention certain amounts that appear in the Estimates in respect of the Louis Botha Airport.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It may sound like &#x201C;chicken feed&#x201D;. I shall give the amounts, and then we can discuss the position further. The extension and the development of the parking area at Louis Botha Airport will be completed by about September of this year. An amount of R347 240 has been provided in the Estimates for that. For the purchasing of furniture for the building itself an amount of R50 000 has been placed on this year&#x2019;s Estimates; R60 000 will appear in the Estimates for next year. That is merely in respect of furniture for the buildings. According to calculations by the Department of Public Works, extensions to the terminal building will be commenced during January of next year at an estimated cost of R1 3 million. Because the matter is urgent, the intention is to erect a type of prefabricated building at Louis Botha Airport, similar to that which was used at the D.F. Malan Airport for a time as an international terminal building. Something similar is being envisaged to help relieve the situation there. In the meantime my department has made representations to the Department of Public Works to already begin with the project within this calendar year if it is at all possible. The prospects of already beginning with the additional work there this year are good.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am aware of certain bottlenecks. I would not say the position is impossible. That is perhaps something of an exaggeration. There are bottlenecks, and they have developed, in particular, because the South African Airways tried to furnish an additional service in Durban by introducing the 747 Jumbo Jets to Durban. Specifically because of the improved service to Durban certain bottlenecks developed at the terminal. I think that is the chief problem as the hon. member also sees it.</p>

<p>As far as the airport at La Mercy is concerned, the most important item at present is that provision be made for the purchasing of the needed land. A considerable piece of land is needed for the La Mercy airport In the Estimates for the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure there appears this year an amount of R11 million for the purchasing of that land. On this department&#x2019;s Estimates there appears an amount of R&#x00BD; million that is intended for the planning of that airport. If the programme develops as it is foreseen it will, La Mercy airport will be ready for use in about eight to nine years, i.e. about 1980 or 1982. The practical life of the Louis Botha Airport is estimated to last until 1979, bearing in mind changes and extensions that are being proposed. By about 1980 or 1982 the La Mercy airport ought to be ready to take over the traffic there.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport replied to certain other matters which the hon. member for Durban Point mentioned. I do not intend to go into them. The hon. member made certain inquiries about the inspection of a certain ship in Durban to ascertain its seaworthiness. Unfortunately I have no knowledge of the incident. If he were to give me more particulars I could ascertain the facts for him. The only conclusion I can, in fact, draw is that this is an isolated case. Such cases do not normally occur. It is an isolated case, the particulars and scope of which I unfortunately do not know about at this stage. I therefore cannot give him a reply to that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Salt River referred to the problem of the handling of baggage at D.F. Malan airport. I think it is mainly a problem in respect of the Boeing 747 aircraft. Normally, this problem does not exist. The problem normally crops up when you have a Boeing-747 coming in with perhaps an additional aircraft as well. The position is that the 747 aircraft are making use of containers and all luggage is loaded into a container at Jan Smuts before being loaded into the aircraft. Those containers are numbered alternatively, A and B, which means that there are two sections of luggage being carried along the automatic conveyor belt in Cape Town. I happened to come in with my family with the same aircraft yesterday afternoon, and I stood watching there for about ten minutes. People do not seem to take notice of the fact that their luggage cards are <span class="col_4417-4418" refersTo="page_0762"/>numbered either A or B, which should be to them an indication where to go and fetch their luggage. Without asking people, I got the impression that people with labels numbered A were queueing up at the conveyor belt carrying luggage numbered B and <i>vice versa.</i> I do not know what other steps we can take. We could ask the airport authorities to make announcements on the public-address system to rectify the matter. However, I got the impression that people were not careful enough in looking at their luggage tickets and that they were therefore queueing up at the wrong conveyor belt. After the landing of the aircraft, &#x201C;A&#x201D; and &#x201C;B&#x201D; containers are alternately taken from the aircraft onto the conveyor belts so as to ensure a simultaneous feeding of the conveyor belts all the time. That normally brings about a reasonable free-flow of baggage through the conveyor belt system. But being human beings, as we all are, people go and meet friends or make telephone calls. They even go and have a cup of tea. In the meantime, their baggage keeps on circulating on the conveyor belt. It clogs up the system. There is nobody there to take it off. I particularly watched out for this yesterday I saw certain suitcases going around and around for seven or eight times. If people are not punctual in this regard, they will merely add to the confusion which I think is not the mistake of the airport authority in the first place.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the possible sinking of the road at the extension of the main runway at the D.F. Malan Airport. He referred to a very low run-in. Sir, I cannot understand how this could happen. There are two systems by which an aircraft approaches the D.F. Malan Airport. In daylight use is made of the so-called VASI (visual approach slope indicator) system, which is a very positive and useful system, where the pilot has a visual indication of the slope at which he is approaching the runway. This slope, obviously, is well above all the saftey limits there. It is well above the road and should not create any problems whatsoever During bad weather or at night a glide slope indicator is used, where the pilot couples the instrumentation of his aircraft to the glide slope. He then glides in at a very safe slope, well above the road. Over and above that, Sir, there is runway lighting giving a very positive indication of the direction of the runway and the approach attitude of the aircraft, and then, of course, there is Calvert lighting at the runway, which also guides in the pilot. I do not know whether they had that type of thing when the hon. member for North Rand did flying in the olden days.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they flew by the seat of their pants. That was the most useful instrument in those days. There is a Calvert system at the end of the runway which also gives the pilot a very positive indication of the attitude of the aircraft towards the runway. I cannot possibly understand how they can have a low run-in which would be a danger either to road traffic or to the aircraft itself I cannot understand how such a situation could arise at all, because if a pilot flies according to the normal rules, he is well clear of the road; his eyes should be focused, way ahead of the road, on to the runway or the lighting system, and he should not have any problem at all.</p>

<p>The clearing of the road on the southern side of the runway was done so that additional lighting could be provided there, and there is also a beacon at the end there. It is perhaps not the best of things, but I can assure this Committee that it entails no danger either to the road traffic or to the air traffic. It may be a slight nuisance to a pilot who is on the glide slope and at dusk perhaps when the light is failing, or under bad weather conditions.</p>

<p>Yes, that is true.

That is my approach to this matter. Of course, it is not desirable to have a road too close to the end of a runway; I grant the hon. member that. But in this particular case I am not convinced that it entails any danger whatsoever</p>

<p>*The hon. member referred to taxi apartheid here in Cape Town. I should like to tell him what the position is. As far back as 1949 it was decided to limit new applicants solely to members of one race serving their own people. What happened in practice then is that a number of non-White taxi owners here in the Cape applied to be allowed to continue with their work, and because it was felt that they should not be treated unfairly, quite a number of them were allowed' to continue transporting White passengers. That position continued for a considerable time. Assistance has been given to them from time to time. I just want to tell the hon. member that today any taxi company or taxi owner is still free to go to the local road transportation board and to apply for exemption. There are no restrictions on their access to the local transportation boards. They are still free to do so today. But the principle was accepted in 1949 that people should serve their own races as far as taxi driving is concerned. However, concessions were made, and that will still continue for a time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort broached a very important matter which I should like to refer to. In the first place I want to thank him for the appreciation he expressed for the magnificent work done by the Steyn Committee. It was work of tremendous scope, and a great deal of research was done. A great many hours were spent on that. I am grateful for the appreciation from the hon. member for that committee and its work. But we are saddled with a tremendous problem, and hon members will already have gathered from the Press how this problem is still increasing and growing larger. One can hardly pick up a newspaper without reading of a fatal accident that has taken place somewhere in our country. The trend is increasing at a frightening rate. In fact, to round off the figures, 1 000 more people are killed on our roads annually. Every year 1 000 more people are killed on our roads. I am grateful for the fact that the hon. member for Koedoespoort has broached this very vital matter. In that connection I just want to refer to the National Road Safety Council which was called into being as a result of the recommendations of that committee which the hon. member mentioned. It is a council that only came into being last year, but it is a council that is giving its full attention to this problem. I just want to give the Committee an indication of some of the projects the National Road Safety Council is at present engaged in.</p>

<p>Under the heading &#x201C;Public Relations and Publicity&#x201D; they are engaged on a pedestrian project which will be receiving attention in the course of the year. They are bringing out a new series of publications They are engaged in safe-driving schemes. There is now an inter-city road safety competition for the State President&#x2019;s floating trophy. As far as road safety education is concerned, they have now commenced with a scheme of pre-school road safety tuition, and then there is, of course, tuition at school, which the hon. member knows about. Only recently a scheme was announced in which I personally have a great deal of confidence and which I believe will furnish great results, i.e. an attempt to involve the Defence Force in road safety. A scheme is being launched whereby national servicemen will receive lectures on road safety by their instructors during the year in which they join up. But over and above that they can take part in an oratory competition at commando level which would then eventually be rounded off at national level. We hope this will create enough interest amongst national servicemen for their very zealous participation in this scheme. I think it is an important breakthrough which the National Road Safety Council made when it decided to involve the national servicemen. Here we have a lot of young people, all at the stage just prior to receiving their drivers&#x2019; licences, or at a stage when they have become old enough to obtain a driver&#x2019;s licence. They are people who are usually at a stage where they begin to look forward to buying their first cars, but they are also young people receptive to tuition and guidance These young people are now being given the benefit of lectures and actual instruction in road safety. I think we shall see the results of that in the near future. I personally expect very favourable results in respect of this scheme.</p>

<p>There are, of course, legal-technical aspects which the National Road Safety Council is giving its attention to. One of <span class="col_4421-4422" refersTo="page_0764"/>those, which has received the most publicity, is the question of the permissible percentage of alcohol in the blood. Up to now it has been 0,15%, and I hope it will shortly be 0,08%, i.e. 800 milligrams of alcohol per litre of blood.</p>

<p>I should like to emphasize something here that is frequently overlooked. This whole matter of alcohol in the blood is not going to be taken out of the hands of the magistrates, and nothing is being placed in the way of the discretion of magistrates in that connection. As the position is at present, so it will remain in the future. Magistrates will, therefore, still have full discretion in deciding how they will handle these cases.</p>

<p>But there is no discretion.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me explain. As a magistrate at present tries someone who has alcohol in his blood in the region of 0,15%, so will the position remain exactly the same in respect of a lower percentage. Therefore, nothing is going to be changed as regards the nature of the evidence or of the trial. It will still remain subject to the discretion of the magistrate.</p>

<p>The National Road Safety Council is giving attention to the utility of making the wearing of safety-belts compulsory. At present we have the strange position of the installation of safety-belts in a vehicle being compulsory, but not their use. If that position were to continue, and it should scientifically be decided that it should continue, I would be in favour of our just as well not having any safety-belts in motor vehicles, because it is senseless to compel someone to have an apparatus installed in his vehicle, and to incur costs in that connection, but one does not compel him to make use of it. This whole matter is at present being approached from a scientific point of view, and we shall learn more about that shortly.</p>

<p>Of great importance are the traffic police force and the implementation of road safety laws. This hon. House, provincial councils and local authorities can make just as many laws, ordinances and regulations as they want to, but if the regulations are not implemented it does not help at all and is useless. Therefore I regard it as being of the utmost importance that the implementation of laws should receive more and more attention. In the course of the year, by means of the National Road Safety Council, we shall make an increasingly greater appeal to the provincial authorities entrusted with this matter to extend their traffic police forces, to increase their efficiency and to make the implementation of the law stricter. I think that is extremely important, and I should like to give the assurance that the National Road Safety Council regards this matter at present as being of very high priority.</p>

<p>Another matter receiving attention is that of a central register of drivers&#x2019; licences. At present it is technically possible, although it is illegal, to have a licence revoked in one province and to have a new one issued in another province. There is not sufficient control at all. There are no methods according to which a driver&#x2019;s record can be placed before a magistrate when he is being tried. I do not want to elaborate on this too much now, but such shortcomings do in fact exist. The National Road Safety Council is convinced, however, that a national register of motor vehicle drivers&#x2019; licences has become absolutely imperative, and at present they are engaged in investigating the matter.</p>

<p>Safety standards of motor vehicles are receiving attention. An investigation is also being made into the usefulness or otherwise of reflecting number plates. Hon. members are aware that reflecting number plates are already compulsory in our neighbouring state, Rhodesia. We are at present considering this aspect as far as South Africa is concerned. The National Road Safety Council is also investigating the wearing of crash-helmets, the benefits, etc., that could derive from that.</p>

<p>I think I have replied to the points which the hon. members have thus far put forward.</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to raise certain aspects of the national roads programme for the eventual freeway which will span from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth. During <span class="col_4423-4424" refersTo="page_0765"/>recent weeks there has been considerable publicity indicating that at the moment in specific areas there are three proposed alternate routes, namely the existing route and then one or two additional proposals for certain stretches. I want to say that I appreciate that in a freeway of this nature &#x2014;and ultimately South Africa will have some of the finest freeways in the world&#x2014; various aspects must be taken into account. They are topographical aspects, engineering, defence, commercial and tourist aspects. It so happens that this particular freeway route spans some of our most beautiful countryside. It also spans some of our most agriculturally and commercially rich countryside.</p>

<p>I want to refer particularly to the route where the freeway will span the Elgin apple orchard area. As is known our Elgin apple orchards are located on land which is ideally suited for apple production. It so happens that the income from the sale of apples overseas and apple juices is of a considerable order. I would like to make a plea that in selecting the best possible route consideration should be given not only to the engineering aspect, but also to the economic aspect. It is a well-known fact that in California where the freeways traverse the main pear orchards of the American pear industry, the avenues of trees lining the freeways on either side to a depth of seven rows are completely destroyed by the lead content of the exhaust fumes of the traffic carried by those freeways. It is a source of major concern to the apple farmers in that area that in the first instance some of their finest apple productive land will be taken away where alternate routes may well exist at little additional inconvenience to the State, and that the actual production of apples may suffer to the same extent as indicated.</p>

<p>Then I pass on to the route which covers the area George/Plettenberg Bay/Storms River. Considerable publicity has been given during recent weeks to this route and I commend the fact that at last after many years, owners of land alongside that route, whether it be agricultural or forestry land, are at least now for the first time given an indication as to where the ultimate route will go. Hon. members can well imagine that the indecision and uncertainty must cause considerable worry to persons who have vested interests in this area. It so happens that in this case the proposed route again goes through some magnificent agricultural land, some of our finest indigenous timber land and also some of our best commercial timber land. This route also happens to be one of the finest scenic routes in this country. There have been conflicting opinions as to whether the consideration is one of defence, tourism or merely that of practical road-building, in determining whether the road should run alongside the coast, in the near vicinity of the sea or whether it should run through the timber country or whether it should be taken behind the mountains which will probably be a straighter and less costly route which might detract from one or other of the merits which I have just been discussing.</p>

<p>It is apparent that where it runs through the timber country one has a major problem. In most instances it is one of the most productive timber areas we have in this part of the country, and with our economy crying out for more and more timber, it would appear most regrettable that one or two of these three alternate routes is really making inroads into that country which cannot be replaced as timber country. I would also like to refer to specific cases where of the three routes, one route will go through an historic homestead and a century-old oak grove, whereas the existing route by-passes the estate at the moment&#x2014;I refer to the largest timber estate in the Plettenberg Bay area, along the route Lottering to Ladywood. Here there are three possible routes. There is the existing route which has been there for years and which is capable of being widened to the required standard to make it a freeway. As I have said, of the two alternate proposed routes one will go through a homestead which should be an historical monument. It will also go through oak groves of century-old oaks. The second alternate route goes through a watershed area and transgresses a large hydro-electric scheme, which means that the scheme will be nullified, whereas the present existing route will be suitable.</p>

<p>I merely make the plea that in such instances the consulting engineers, in discussions with the National Roads Board, should not take into account only the engineering aspects, thereby displaying a straight-line mentality, but that they should have regard for the ecological effect the road will have in certain cases when it goes through the Tzitzikamma area for instance, and for the effect it will have on industry when it goes through our agricultural or our forest areas. I know that in <span class="col_4425-4426" refersTo="page_0766"/>the final analysis it is necessary that the National Roads Board should be frank with the vested interests concerned, that they should make their plans known and available and that, having received objections of a specific nature, they should have an open mind and should appeal to the engineers and their structural advisers to take all these factors into account to enable us to maintain this almost perfect area of South Africa as a tourist amenity, having due regard to the Defence requirements and the engineering problems involved.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Gardens must not think I am being unfriendly in not reacting to what he has said. Unfortunately the space of ten minutes is very short, and I accept the fact that the hon. the Deputy Minister will reply in detail to the matter he raised.</p>

<p>I am actually standing up to broach a matter here which I also had the privilege of broaching a few years ago. I want to say at once that I am in no way apologizing for the fact that I am raising this matter which is of real importance to the city of Welkom, the Northern Free State as a whole and, together with that, the Western Transvaal. I gained the impression that the former Deputy Minister of Transport was very well disposed to this matter. Unfortunately he was sent to New Orleans before he could give a decisive answer to my request. But I have the utmost confidence in this hon. Deputy Minister because I know he is a person who has an expert knowledge of airports, aircraft and concomitant problems. I know that if I put my case to him it will make an impression on him and I know he will realize that it is a matter with very strong and deeplying merit. Today, on this occasion, I want to repeat my plea to the hon. the Minister in a very friendly though serious and definite manner, that he give serious attention to having the airport at Welkom taken over by the Department of Transport and declare it a national airport or, otherwise, placing it on the scheduled route of the South African Airways. To motivate my case, it is important for me to bring a few aspects to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention. I immediately want to emphasize that merely on account of the fact that I am again raising this matter, indicates that this matter is of real importance to us in that area and also as far as the whole of the Northern Free State is concerned.</p>

<p>Up to now an amount of about R500 000 has been spent on the airport by the Welkom city council. At present Welkom&#x2019;s airport has two runways of about 5 000 ft. The one has a 60 ft. wide strip of tarmac for its entire length. For the construction of this strip of tarmac&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;a base was provided that makes it suitable for the wheel axles of aircraft up to the size of a Boeing. As far as the control tower is concerned, I may just mention to the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is regarded by experts as being comparable with the best we have in South Africa. At present that control tower is already being manned by officials of the Department of Transport. This tower is excellent for present use, and has been planned with a view to future development. As far as the terminal building is concerned, I can state that it is a well-balanced building in which all the necessary facilities have been provided.</p>

<p>In this connection I can call the hon. the Prime Minister to witness, because he landed at that airport a month or so ago to address an important meeting in Kroonstad. I also want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that its planning was such that it will be very easy in future, with expansion to the airport, to add additional sections to the existing building. It is an acknowledged fact that the travelling public in South Africa is making increasing use of air transport today. It therefore goes without saying that in that part of the Orange Free State, i.e. the Free State goldfields and the related Northern Free State and, as I mentioned at the beginning, certain portions of the Western Transvaal as well, increasing use of air transport is also being made.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I approached three travel agencies, which are situated in Welkom, to ascertain to what extent air transport is being made use of in that region. I found that during the year 1971-&#x2019;72 no less than 2 224 air tickets were sold to travellers using the South African Airways from Jan Smuts airport and J. B. M. Hertzog airport in Bloemfontein. If one considers that those 2 224 tickets were naturally tickets which were to a large extent bought by inhabitants of Welkom alone, it is acceptable and understandable that if one also includes the larger and wider areas of Welkom that number of tickets <span class="col_4427-4428" refersTo="page_0767"/>would be considerably more. Neither does this include the large number of passengers who make use of charter aircraft on those airports.</p>

<p>I therefore believe that the service furnished by Welkom&#x2019;s airport has already reached national proportions. It can no longer be regarded merely as a local service that has to be furnished by the local authority. I think the time has come for airports in South Africa to be graded and that airports that qualify according to such a grading should be taken over by the Department of Transport as national airports. Also&#x2014;and this is important as far as I am concerned&#x2014;it will be in the national interest for airports to comply with particular standards to be owned and controlled by the Central Government in the same way as the Railways and our network of national and special roads are the responsibility of the Central Government. In times of emergency or war it is essential for all important and strategic centres to have well-developed airports. Local communities cannot be expected to provide national services from their limited local resources.</p>

<p>Geographic and climatic conditions make Welkom extremely suitable, apart from use as a national airport, to serve also as an airport that can be used for the training of military and civil aviation pilots. If Welkom were therefore to be declared a national and scheduled airport, there are many people in that area, as well as others, who will make use of that airport. Time does not permit, but in this connection I could quote what was said by the hon. member for Stilfontein a few years ago when I also broached this matter here. He then delivered a fervent plea for the matter I presented here, seen in the light of the fact that a large number of people from that part of the Transvaal would also make use of that airport.</p>

<p>When one discusses the Welkom airport, one must see the matter, not against the background of a single city or body, but against the background of the economic progress of an important part of the Orange Free State. It is a pleasure for me to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that if this matter, which I have presented, were to receive his favourable consideration, the Welkom City Council would be prepared to hand over to the Department of Transport, just like that, the R500 000 they have already spent, with the stipulation that the conditions I mentioned at the beginning of my speech be accepted by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I also want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that I realize that a counter-argument can be advanced in the light of the fact that Welkom is situated very close to the Jan Smuts airport at Johannesburg. I am quite prepared to concede that; it is true, but I want to suggest that if this matter were favourably considered, thought could be given to whether an aircraft on the way to Cape Town from Jan Smuts could not initially land at Welkom and then skip Bloemfontein, and the other way round, could land at Welkom and not Bloemfontein when coming from Cape Town. I want to state very clearly that I do not want to take away anything from my good friends in the capital of the Orange Free State, but I think this is a service that could be introduced. I have only a minute or two left, and in conclusion I once again want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that this is an important matter, particularly in the light of the fact that that is a large area, in the light of the fact that many of those people must travel many miles to get to an airport. In view of all the circumstances I have mentioned, I believe that the merits of this case are very well-founded. I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that if ever he wants to make a name for himself, if ever, in that region of the Orange Free State, the goldfields &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Welkom must excuse me if I do not react to his speech. He dealt with his own local affairs, and I want to confine myself to one of my own local problems, too.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to speak about the instrument landing system at Ben Schoeman airport, East London. I do not think anybody will disagree with me when I say that there is no airport in the Republic of South Africa which has more inclement, inconsistent and treacherous weather than the one at East <span class="col_4429-4430" refersTo="page_0768"/>London. It occurs virtually every week during the rainy season during the summer months. It is for this reason that the late Mr. Colin Bennett, who at that time represented Albany in this House, mentioned this instrument-landing system as far back as five years ago, and even earlier. I want to quote from Hansard what he had to say on 12th June, 1968 (Hansard, col. 7106). He said:</p>

<block name="quote">This is a matter I have raised before &#x2026; I want to deal with the provision of instrument landing systems at both Port Elizabeth and East London. I know that those are going to be provided in the course of this year.</block>

<p>He said that in 1968. That is almost five years ago. Only recently, on 20th March, I asked the hon. the Minister this question:</p>

<block name="quote">Whether another instrument landing system will be provided at the Ben Schoemen airport, East London; if so, when; if not, why not.</block>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister replied:</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. Before the end of 1974.</block>

<p>We have&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Deputy Minister knows it&#x2014;one system which covers aircraft landing at this airport when a westerly wind is blowing but we do not have a system for easterly winds at all. The East London Chamber of Commerce has made representations to the Department of Transport from time to time, pointing out the urgency of the matter. I am very disappointed that even today we still do not have a landing system which can assist the aircraft when an easterly wind is blowing. We all know that when an easterly wind is blowing, it usually affects which I believe is the shortest runway we have at any airport, where aircraft have to land without any instrument system. It is a common occurrence that aircraft have to overfly East London because of bad, unfavourable weather. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will consider this matter. It is of great urgency, and I have been approached by the Chambers of Commerce and many business people who are faced with this problem at East London. It is not merely something I have sucked out of my thumb. I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister, we are very worried and unhappy about it.</p>

<p>Another I want to raise is the question of seating accommodation in the reception halls at the D.F. Malan and Jan Smuts airports. This is a small matter, but we find that there are many backless seats in the large reception rooms. I have been approached by people from Johannesburg who want to know whether something cannot be done in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to return now to the question of national roads and road safety. As you know, Sir, a road safety levy of 50 cents per annum is payable on every vehicle. The full 50 cents is payable whether the vehicle is purchased in December or in June of the same year. In the case of third party insurance, if a vehicle is purchased in December, then only one-twelfth of the annual insurance premium is payable, but in the case of the road safety levy the full 50 cents is payable on a vehicle purchased in December, although the owner will only use that vehicle for one month before he has to pay another 50 cents for the following year in January. I want to know what the reason for this is&#x003F; I feel that this should be adjusted.</p>

<p>Sir, when I look at the estimates of expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue Account, I notice on page 24 under &#x201C;J&#x201D; that an amount of R120 000 was voted for the Road Safety Council for 1972-&#x2019;73, but no provision is being made for this year at all. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Deputy Minister would explain to me what the reason for this is&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, reading the newspapers, one is alarmed to see, in almost every newspaper one opens today, the high toll of road deaths. Only this morning in the local newspaper we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Grim holiday weekend: 11 die on roads and 80 injured. Eleven people were killed and more than 80 injured in a spate of road accidents reported in the Western Cape at the weekend.</block>

<p>When one turns to another newspaper, from the Border, one reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nine killed in Eastern Cape road accidents.</block>

<p>This was also over a weekend. Sir, I accept that our Provincial Traffic Police are doing a good job of work, not only in trying to keep death off the roads, but in assisting many people who happen to be <span class="col_4431-4432" refersTo="page_0769"/>stranded on the road with vehicle problems. We realize, too, that the Provincial Traffic Police are understaffed, and for this reason I know for a fact that many of them have to work overtime. I believe, Sir, that we as South Africans will have to get our priorities right in this regard. Our priorities do not seem to be right at all. When one comes to the cities, one finds many meter maids, and traffic officers, walking up and down the streets looking for parking infringements. Well, Sir, this is fair enough; I am not complaining so much about this, but when I think of what our few Provincial Traffic Police are doing on our main national roads, then it seems to me that our priorities are all wrong. I realize that meter maids and traffic officers in our cities fall under the municipalities, but if our municipalities can keep an eye on people for parking infringements, then I think it is time we spent more time and money on the prevention of accidents on our national roads.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville rightly mentions that more time should be spent on moving traffic than on stationary traffic. While on this subject, there is a strip of national road which has caused quite a few deaths recently. This is the road between Cathcart and Queenstown in the Border area. This road is a real hazard and a danger to the travelling public today. It has a very bad surface. It is of course a tarmac surface but there are so many potholes that vehicles become very unstable when travelling along this road. Vehicles go into dry skids and we have had quite a number of deaths due mainly, I believe and the public believes, to the bad surface of this road. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London North will excuse me if I do not follow him up. I just want to say with regard to urban traffic arrangements that I partly agree with him. However, I want to react to what was said by the hon. member for Welkom. The hon. member for Welkom made out a very good case for an airport and air service at Welkom, but unfortunately he spoiled his whole argument in the end by dragging Bloemfontein in. I know that the Chambers of Commerce as well as the Afrikaanse Sakekamer have made representations for more services at Bloemfontein, but now the hon. member advocates the necessity of fewer services for Bloemfontein. On that basis I can give him the assurance, with the confidence he has in the hon the Deputy Minister, that his representations will not succeed.</p>

<p>I should like to exchange a few thoughts in connection with national roads. I think we will all agree that the national traffic requirements of South Africa have greatly increased over the past years, and that in future they will increase even more. There are, of course, two reasons for this increase. Firstly there is the increase in the volume of traffic, and secondly there is the economic development which is taking place in South Africa. Roads are of course a very important component of the infrastructure of our country. That is why a fresh approach to the construction of national roads in South Africa has become necessary. That is why it has also become necessary for us to think big when we are planning a road network in our country. That is the task of this department, as well as the task, more specifically, of the N.T.C., to carry out these tasks entrusted to it by Act 54 of 1971. I think we may be very grateful for the work that has been done so far by the N.T.C. After the matter had been studied very extensively, arterial roads were planned throughout the country. These arterial roads, which will serve as freeways, form the artery of the roads network throughout our country. The first arterial road is undoubtedly the road from Cape Town eastwards along the coast via Port Elizabeth through the Transkei and Natal to the border of Mo&#x00E7;ambique. We know what tremendous development is taking place in this particular area and we know, too, how the traffic, as a result also of other circumstances, has increased, and will increase in this area. A second arterial road that is being planned is the road from Cape Town along the West Coast up to the border of South-West Africa, more or less as far as Vioolsdrif. We also know what tremendous development will soon be taking place along the West Coast in the area for which the hon. member for Moorreesburg made such fervent pleas. I merely want to mention these roads to indicate that the N.T.C.&#x2019;s view was very correct in determining these routes and the planning that will be taking place. A very important route that is being planned, is the route from Cape Town via Colesberg through the <span class="col_4433-4434" refersTo="page_0770"/>Free State, Johannesburg and Pretoria to Beit Bridge. That, then, is the third route. The fourth route is the road from Johannesburg eastward through Natal to Durban. The fifth route is the road from Pretoria through the Lowveld to the border of Mo&#x00E7;ambique. These are more or less the major areas where development is taking place and where these freeways will form the arterial roads with which the entire network throughout the country will be linked up.</p>

<p>I think that we should be very grateful to this department and the N.T.C. for this early planning they have done. It goes without saying that it is gigantic planning that is being held out in prospect, planning which will take many years and cost a great deal of money to be carried out. When a country is developing as South Africa is developing, it is necessary for this money to be spent on the roads network.</p>

<p>I understand that for the next 10 years more or less R1 500 million is planned to be spent on this road's network. It goes without saying that these freeways have to be of a very high quality to be able to carry the volume of traffic and also to meet the safety requirements for our roads. That is why safety will have to be built into these roads We hope that it will make a great contribution to the diminishing of the accident rate on our roads.</p>

<p>Not only has this network been planned; a start has already been made to carry out that planning. I believe that 787 kilometres of these roads have so far been completed. It goes without saying that certain stretches that are the most necessary will be built first.</p>

<p>Under Act 54 of 1971 stretches of the old national roads which have been deproclaimed will revert to the provinces. This, of course, is in agreement with the Borckenhagen Report. I want to stress tonight, however, that the fact that these roads are being deproclaimed and returned to the provinces will in no way detract from the importance of these roads, because these roads still form the network of our entire roads complex throughout the country. What is important, however, is that these roads will be maintained. I am concerned about the possibility that the provinces may not be in a position to spend the necessary money on the maintenance and reconstruction of certain roads where necessary. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport to plead with the Treasury for sufficient funds to be made available to the provinces so that these roads may be maintained. So far 8 490 kilometres of old national roads have been deproclaimed and returned to the provinces. These roads are old, and will need major maintenance costs for them to be restored to a safe condition But because the traffic on these roads will diminish, they will still after reconstruction be able to give many years of service to South Africa.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think we will all agree with the hon. member for Bloemfontein East that not only are roads terribly important to the economy of the country but that we have reached the situation in South Africa today where the provinces and the local authorities are unable to carry the burden of their own road building. They require a great deal of Government assistance. For many years we have been appealing to the Government to provide that assistance.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the Jan Smuts Airport. I wish I could offer the same congratulations as my hon. colleague, the hon. member for Durban Point. Jan Smuts airport has undoubtedly a very beautiful building, but it is not the building that makes the airport. It is what you find within the building that makes the airport. It is a strange thing that when a visitor arrives from abroad he is usually a bit diffident and a little uneasy particularly when he is a stranger to the country. It is his reception at an airport which really at once creates either a good or bad impression upon him of the country he is visiting. In September and October of last year I had the privilege of touching down at some 16 airports, including two behind the Iron Curtain, namely Warsaw in Poland and Prague in Czechoslovakia. I approached these two airports with a certain amount of trepidation but it was the very sincere and very efficient welcome at both these airports that made me feel reasonably at home for the moment. I think this is lacking at Jan Smuts airport at the moment. First of all we do not appear to be using porters in the customs hall at the airport any longer. A great number of our visitors who are coming from abroad are elderly visitors and are finding problems with removing their luggage from the automatic conveyor belts. It is true that the airport is well-equipped with these luggage trolleys, but there are no porters to take the luggage <span class="col_4435-4436" refersTo="page_0771"/>off the conveyor belts. On three occasions I especially went to the Jan Smuts airport just to see what was happening, because I had the feeling that we were not providing the showcase at Jan Smuts that we should be providing. That was the first thing that struck me. I understand that there have been some problems about porters stealing luggage, overcharging passengers and one or two other problems This I believe is something which should be put right. We must not say that because this is happening we are going to withdraw the service. What you must do is to put the porter service right. I believe that Jan Smuts needs a porter service because you still get porter service in most countries of the world today. Be that as it may, not being able to get a porter you load your luggage on your luggage trolley and you approach the exit from the customs hall. As you come out, when you look in front, you see a notice which says: &#x201C;To the Buses.&#x201D; When you look to the left you see a notice which says: &#x201C;To Internal Flights.&#x201D; Whichever direction you take, either to the bus or to the internal flight, you find yourself and your trolley faced with three or four steps. I have mentioned this to the hon. the Minister and I want it on record, because unless something has been done about this over the past couple of months since I have been down here, it is something that ought to be attended to urgently. As hon. members will appreciate, the dear old ladies and the dear old gentlemen with their trolleys and three or four suitcases have to stop at the steps, try to off-load their luggage, carry the luggage up the steps, drag the trolley after them and reload again. Then they have to push their trolleys to the bus or to the national service Fortunately most South Africans are good, kind and hospitable people and they assist these visitors. However, it should not be necessary to have to negotiate the luggage trolleys up or down steps. I remember that, when I stopped over at Frankfurt airport, one of the bad features that struck me was that, when I wanted to convey my luggage to the International Locker Service by trolley&#x2014; there are no porters in Frankfurt&#x2014;I had to cross a road and, to do so, I had to go down a pavement which was about a foot high and had to lug the trolley up onto the pavement on the other side again. These factors create an impression on people when they arrive at an airport. I hope that immediate steps will be taken to rectify this matter. I understand that there are problems regarding structural alterations&#x2014; the Post Office, apparently, is not at the right place&#x2014;but at least ramps should be put in immediately so that one can easily negotiate the steps with these trollies. This must be done, or, otherwise the porter service must be reinstated immediately, which I think should be done any way.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the customs hall. The customs hall as such is good. The question of the green and red lights does not interest the hon. the Deputy Minister, but what is happening there is that, as you come out of the customs hall, you are met by a mass of people, particularly when a large aeroplane arrives. Sometimes two or three aeroplanes arrive within an hour, some of them being jumbo jets. As a result you get a mass of people standing outside the customs hall and looking into it because there are only large windows between the customs hall and the public reception area. I have been told that plans have been agreed upon and will be implemented very soon to provide a barrier between the public and the customs hall. What is happening&#x2014;and this is from my own observations&#x2014;is that the customer &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I have a business sense in all these things. They are in fact our customers. The visitor arrives, he is looking for his friends, he is trying to push his little trolley, he has a customs officer trying to deal with him and everything becomes one complete, unholy mess. The public must be segregated and separated also visually from the arriving visitors. This is done at every airport in the world. I know of no airport in the world where, when you arrive and go through the customs, there is a multitude of people looking on. Any altercations you may have with a customs officer is not their business. I have seen customs officers, as I am sure we all have, open a bag, empty out its contents and examine them. It does happen. It is the customs officer&#x2019;s duty and job to do this. Therefore I believe it is urgent that, if we want them to perform their function properly, we must have a barrier, whether it is a wall, a partition, or whatever, between the public sector and the customs hall so that the one will be cut off from the other.</p>

<p>Talking about the airport and the approach to it, I mentioned to the hon. the <span class="col_4437-4438" refersTo="page_0772"/>Deputy Minister the other day that, when you come from the northern side of Johannesburg and want to go to the airport, the easiest route to take is the M1. You travel past the Edenvale hospital on your right, you then turn left in the direction of Modderfontein and then turn to the right to join M1 going south. There is no sign at all telling you that you can get onto this road or that this is the way to the airport. The hon. the Deputy Minister told me that this was a provincial matter, but it is his airport and he must look after his customers going to his airport. I hope he will see to it immediately that the proper signposts are erected so that people, travelling along that road, will know where to turn to the right to get onto M1 and on to the airport. There is a sign telling you how to get onto Ml if you are travelling north, but you do not want to travel north but south, for that is the easiest, the quickest and the safest way of getting to the airport.</p>

<p>The last point I wish to raise is a matter which I have raised with the hon. the Deputy Minister previously, namely the question of the catering arrangements. I asked him about the lounge and bar service of the main dining-room on the departure floor. All he could tell me at the time was that he would go into the matter. Just to recapitulate very briefly: As you so up to the departure hall, you have a cafeteria on the left-hand side where, as I have said, you can get coffee and tea. On the right-hand side there is a lounge where you can get drinks and beyond that there is a restaurant. The restaurant is very good, as is the service in the lounge where you can get a drink. However, as I have explained, you cannot get a drink and coffee or tea at the same place, unless it has been changed. Furthermore, the seating accommodation at the tables is very bad. I believe that, on this floor too, there should be some place where you can be served with tea or coffee. Today you only have as far as I know on the departure floor a small cafeteria on the left-hand side facing it. These are important things, because the comfort of your passenger is a very important thing today. You can travel anywhere in the world today and visit any of the great airports and you will find that each time you go back to one of these airports there is an improvement. They are constantly improving the facilities at the airports of the world. Tourism is the greatest export commodity that exists in the modem economy and we in South Africa, despite some differences of opinion and despite some problems regarding tourists, want the maximum number of tourists we can get. The best advertising, despite the work that is being done by Satour, the Railways and other agencies, is a person whose first impression is a good impression, because this relaxes your visitor, makes him happy and he starts off on the right foot. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will be able to tell me that attention is given to these matters.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, personally I find it a great pleasure to refer to the speeches by the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. member for Humansdorp in connection with the promotion of local civil airports. While expressing my appreciation, I just want to ask the hon. member for Durban Point whether he would not perhaps positively influence the supporters of his party in my constituency since I recently had the experience that they played the role of demonstrators there and lay in front of a big bull-dozer. I must say that I was placed in a rather difficult position, because if they had not been such pretty girls I would perhaps have decided to close my eyes. However, in the end I decided to keep my eyes open. In any event, this is already a <i>fait accompli,</i> but I still think that the agitation which preceded the realization of the ideal &#x2014;and coming from the United Party supporters in the constituency&#x2014;was quite uncalled for and unnecessary.</p>

<p>The second matter I would like to touch on is a very delicate one and concerns the licensing of Bantu buses for the transport of Bantu from outside the municipal areas to the municipal areas. This is a matter with which I have been concerned for the past few years without having achieved any reasonable degree of success. Nevertheless I would like to refer this to the hon. the Minister with a view to a possible inquiry to see to what extent the policy of the National Transport Commission might not be adapted to the higher loyalties of orderly development, the Group Areas Act and labour control. In practice all these are being circumvented at present in a manner which I shall now indicate. These buses transport labour, and now I am not referring to transport within municipal areas, but in areas outside the municipal boundaries. This affects a policy the logic of which I am quite unable to understand, and I think that this is a very limited viewpoint. If one can transport non-Whites to <span class="col_4439-4440" refersTo="page_0773"/>Pretoria for a distance of 20 miles westwards of the Pretoria municipal boundary, and from the Randburg boundary to the north-west for a distance of 10 miles, I ask the question: Why can this not be done from Rustenburg to Pretoria, and from Brits to Randburg, and from Carletonville, Ventersburg and Lichtenburg to Krugersdorp&#x003F; This therefore affects the same principle and the same policy and this can only lead to one thing, namely chaos, absolute chaos. I had the experience that in his time the late Dr. Verwoerd deproclaimed, at my request, three farms at Krugersdorp which indulged in the recruitment of labour through Krugersdorp, for this very reason of eliminating the confusion and unorderly development. At present this transport is circumventing the regulations. And this is quite apart from considerations of health, because there are no facilities at bus stops and these people must of course satisfy their natural urges just there. This may lead to road accidents, because sometimes this is done in such an indecent manner as to cause one to turn one&#x2019;s face. Virtually every three miles, 10, 12 and 15 of them are standing in a group so as to travel from areas outside the municipal areas into the municipal areas to go and work there. This also gives rise to circumvention of other aspects, namely people spending the night illegally in urban areas, i.e. overnight vagrants. Sir, this is not being exaggerated. I have received written requests from schools, churches and the Police requesting me please to step in and help them, since the position is becoming untenable. The Police cannot handle the situation every afternoon when 200 Bantu are offloaded by buses in their area. They have plenty of other work to do. The schools complain that social conditions are deteriorating. Church-sites, too, are polluted by nearby bus stops. This is a totally uncontrolled situation. The municipalities are unable to do anything. They are unable to supply facilities outside their areas of jurisdiction, quite apart from the damage caused to harvests and telephone lines and insulators. This complaint is not limited to my constituency alone; it affects the whole of the Rand complex. Personally I am fully convinced that there is no practical need for such a service, because it is in conflict with the provisions of the Group Areas Act and the laws relating to influx control and labour control. The services supplied there, are supplied by the farmers themselves. If they want to take their servants to the city either to see a doctor or to go shopping, they do this themselves with great pleasure. Otherwise there is no major practical need for such a service&#x2014;and this I want to emphasize&#x2014;outside the municipal boundaries. There is no requirement I can think of to justify that service, apart from the remuneration received by the carriers in that respect. However, this causes great confusion and impedes orderly development there, because squatting takes place and superfluous Bantu congregate. We have the unofficial establishment of locations and residential areas. If one drives into the city in the morning, one gets the impression that it is a homeland, with the groups of Bantu standing along the road. 10, 12 or six every two or three miles, waiting for the buses. And this takes place to the great alarm and dissatisfaction of the community for the reasons I have mentioned. If we allow squatting and the resultant increase in population to develop in an unrestricted way, and later wake up and realize that we must provide housing for these people, where do we go with them&#x003F; There is no control whatsoever. All the control measures which exist, are being circumvented by this service. I repeat, I cannot be convinced that a necessity exists for this service outside the boundaries of local authorities. I say with great respect that it gainsays the policy of the National Transport Commission to go 10 miles outside the municipal boundary to bring in Bantu. Remember, this is not a prescribed area for the recruitment of labour. Every town area has its prescribed labour area where it may undertake recruiting, and these are not prescribed areas for the Rand towns. This gainsays their own policy. Then they might just as well allow this same thing to happen at Ventersdorp, Lichtenburg, Standerton and Mafeking; because after all, this is already happening up to 10, 12 miles outside the municipal boundaries, and this is in fact illegal. I want to make a serious plea here and address a friendly request to the Deputy Minister&#x2014;I am not on the war path&#x2014;please to consider whether a way cannot be found better to reconcile the existing policy of the National Transport Commission, and higher loyalties towards Government policy and orderly development in the urban areas.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens put certain questions to me in regard to the proposed route of the national road from <span class="col_4441-4442" refersTo="page_0774"/>Cape Town to Durban. Since we had met here in the Cape, I went to the trouble of obtaining an aircraft and inviting my colleagues, whose constituencies are concerned with this matter, to join me on a trip in order to take a closer look at the position. In addition, I invited the chairman of the National Transport Commission and the members of the Commission as well as the chief engineer of my department to join us on the trip, and we went to have a look at the position there. I have great sympathy with the owners of the apple orchards at Elgin, which falls in the constituency of my colleague, the hon. member for Caledon. The hon. member for Caledon and one of his people who is concerned with this matter, accompanied me there. They indicated to us quite clearly the situation which prevailed there. I can assure the hon. member for Gardens that it is the policy of the National Transport Commission to have as much consultation as possible with everyone involved in this matter. This is what will happen in this case too. I should like to assure him that nothing is going to be done over-hastily in this regard.</p>

<p>Sir, perhaps I should deal in greater detail with this route for the sake of clarity. For record purposes it may be a good thing that we should state quite clearly what the position is. As the hon. member knows, the route from Cape Town to the Strand has been completed and opened to traffic. After consultations were held with the Cape Provincial Administration it was decided to abandon the so-called coastal route, which was to have skirted the mountain at Gordons Bay, passed the mouth of the Steenbras River and proceeded past Kogelberg. We flew over that part of the world the other day. I am not an engineer, but as a layman it was quite clear to me that this would be an impossibly expensive road if it were at all practical to build it. There are certain major engineering problems one will have to face, particularly at the mouth of the lagoon below Bot River. To my mind, the National Transport Commission very wisely decided to abandon that route. What is left now, is the other route over Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. The termination of the route from the Strand over Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass/Grabouw/Bot River is now being considered and then the apple orchards at Elgin will come into the picture. The hon. member for Caledon pointed out to me that the irrigation problem in particular is very serious there. These people have laid on a network of pipelines to their orchards. As was said quite rightly by the hon. member, this is expensive land with a high production potential, and I should like to give him the assurance that the National Transport Commission is very well aware of this situation and will do nothing there which will be to the disadvantage of the people involved. Two alternatives are being considered. One alternative is to build the road around the mountain on the seaward side, i.e. south of the apple orchards. The terrain there will be somewhat difficult to negotiate; there is a private dam there&#x2014;Henderson&#x2019;s Dam&#x2014;and one alternative is for the road to go around the dam. The other possibility which is being investigated is to follow more or less the existing route, but there are also quite a number of plantations in the area belonging to the Department of Forestry, and so forth. From the nature of the case these are not as valuable as the apple orchards, but it is also highly undesirable to build a national freeway of the proposed standard, parallel with or next to the existing road, because this existing road will have to serve as the access road for people who have to join the freeway later. I want to assure the hon. member that this problem will be considered sympathetically.</p>

<p>Sir, between Bot River and Mossel Bay various alternative routes are being surveyed in order to ascertain the best route; this is now being done between Bot River and Bredasdorp, past Puntjie, De Hoop Vlei and Stilbaai, and so forth. The reason why different routes are being surveyed&#x2014; in some cases two and in others three&#x2014; is to give the National Transport Commission the opportunity of discussing this matter with local bodies, such as farmers&#x2019; associations, agricultural unions, or industrialists in the area. Alternative proposals will then be submitted. All those alternative proposals will then be investigated, from an engineering as well as other points of view. The planning of the route between Mossel Bay and George has been completed, except at Great Brak itself. Work is now being carried out between Mossel Bay and Great Brak. The consulting engineers are at present investigating the alternative routes between George and Knysna, and they are planning the national road between Knysna and Plettenberg Bay at the moment. In the area referred to by the hon. member, consulting engineers are busy with the planning of the section between Plettenberg Bay and Lottering, including <span class="col_4443-4444" refersTo="page_0775"/>the three major bridges in that area across the Groot, Bloukrans and Bobbejaan Rivers. They are planning and investigating those three bridges in that area. Work is being carried out between Witelsbos and Humansdorp, and the consulting engineers are at present planning the national road between Humansdorp and the Gamtoos River. Between the Gamtoos River and Nocton Farm the national road is being built departmentally, except the Gamtoos River bridge, which will be built on contract. From Nocton Farm via Port Elizabeth to Colchester the road has, of course, been completed and opened to traffic. I think this covers all the matters raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Welkom made a plea for an airport at Welkom. I want to congratulate him as the representative of his constituency, because he made an excellent speech. It was with some nostalgia that I recalled the days when I was in a position to make such a plea for my constituency. But now I do not know. If I want an airport, I do not know whom I must go to. However, it is with regret that I have to say that I cannot react positively right now to the plea made by the hon. member, despite its being an excellent one. I think he furnished the answer himself when he said that this airport is quite near to Bloemfontein and Jan Smuts. From the point of view of the State we are compelled to plan national air traffic routes. Consequently airports have to fit in with our air traffic route system You will agree with me straight away that an airport at Welkom does not fit in with that pattern in the way the plea advanced by the hon. member justifies here. I want to say to the hon. member that there are other priorities at the moment which must be given preference over Welkom. I do not mean that Welkom has been written off for all time. But the problem of Welkom is that the feeder air services, in view of the manner in which they operate their service, are responsible for their own downfall on account of their successful services. It is our experience that if a feeder service is operated somewhere and if that feeder service is very successful and handles a great volume of traffic, the people say: Look at the large number of passengers we have; why not allow the aircraft of the S.A. Airways to call at this airport&#x003F; Our feeder air services are in fact prejudicing themselves simply because of their efficiency. I am afraid this is also what is happening, among other things, at Welkom now, i.e. that the feeder service to Welkom is efficient. The volume of passengers are increasing and so is the scope of the trips, and now the hon. member wants us probably to give more priority to it than we are able to. It is with regret, therefore, that I have to say to him that I cannot furnish him with a positive reply.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London North advanced a plea for an instrument landing system at East London.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The position is that we already have an instrument landing system at East London. It has been in operation since 1968-&#x2019;69, but that is on runway 28. There is an ILS system on runway 28, but if he looks at the estimates for this year he will find that an amount of R175 500 is being budgeted for a category 2 ILS system on runway 10 at East London. So his request has already been met.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned the possibility of splitting the levy of 50c <i>pro rata</i> over the period of a year. This would amount to 4c a month. I do not know how the administrative costs of working out 4c a month would be justified in this case. I do not think a levy of 50c per motorist per year is at all too much for the work being done by the National Road Safety Council. They are doing tremendous work. The total income of this council from this 50c levy amounts to roughly R1&#x00BD; million per annum.</p>

<p>I do not think it is asking too much of the motorist that he should invest 50 cents per annum in his own safety and that of the other users of the road. Earlier on, in reply to the hon. member for Koedoespoort. I referred to the question of road safety. I think we are all entirely agreed on this subject and I think we are all very much impressed by the seriousness of the situation as it exists at the moment. I fully <span class="col_4445-4446" refersTo="page_0776"/>grant the hon. member that you hardly open a newspaper without reading about deaths and other accidents on the roads. I think levying a payment of 50 cents per annum on motorists is not unreasonable. I do not think it will be justified to split the levy into small monthly payments of 4 cents each.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned the road from Cathcart to Queenstown. That road has been deproclaimed as a national road and this has been the position since 1971. It is now a provincial road.</p>

<p>*I am indebted to the hon. member for Bloemfontein East. He furnished us with a most interesting explanation of the national roads position and pattern. I have nothing to add to what he said, except to tell the hon. member as a matter of interest that the National Transport Commission has now started a ten-year plan. The total amount to be budgeted for this ten-year plan over the period of ten years will amount to R1 317 million.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Parktown mentioned the question of porters at Jan Smuts. I must agree with him in one respect. I think a bad porter at an airport can create the worst possible impression of a country. I should prefer having no porter at all to having a bad one. I think we are agreed on that. I had this sort of experience at the railway station at Paris. I arrived there by train and after I had paid the taxi, I found that porterage of my luggage from the train to the taxi cost me more than my taxi fare from the station to the hotel. I can assure the hon. member that I have never since travelled by train to Paris and I never shall. That is the sort of impression that porters can create.</p>

<p>The problem is, first of all, that we cannot have porters within our transit area at Jan Smuts. There are, of course, porters available to carry luggage from the building itself to private motor-cars, taxis or buses. However, up until now the system of using small push-carts has been very satisfactory. I shall investigate the particular problem of steps which has been mentioned. I do not know exactly where the steps are situated, but the department will go into the problem.</p>

<p>As far as the division between the customs hall and the rest of the building is concerned, I may point out that our sin perhaps lies in the fact that we built too luxuriously at Jan Smuts by making use of too much glass. That matter will also be investigated.</p>

<p>As far as the signposting is concerned, I wonder when last the hon. member happened to drive there.</p>

I concede that at times it may be a bit difficult because you have to sort of pass the entrance and then come back again on the new throughway in order to enter the airport in the vicinity of the Holiday Inn Hotel.

<p>*The hon member for Randburg raised certain problems in this regard.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would just like to touch on that gruesome accident that has taken place in the Karkloof Hills at Greytown. I do not want to go into detail because fortunately the hon. the Deputy Minister is a qualified pilot himself and therefore it is unnecessary to tell him things that he knows himself Pending the result of the inquiry into the accident, what has come to light is that the pilot filed an open flight plan with the air traffic control in Johannesburg. The pilot also did not request what they call overdue action and could therefore have altered his journey at any stage <i>en route.</i> Had he filed a detailed flight, a full-scale search would have been set afoot. Had this been done, Mrs. Delport&#x2019;s life could most likely have been saved. I wonder if we can truely imagine what this 13 year old boy went through at the scene of an accident in the bush, with the pilot dead, his brother dead and his mother dying in his lap. While this is still fresh in our memory, I wonder whether we should not consider granting this young man a medal for his devotion and bravery. If there is no means of awarding him a medal from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, I wonder if we cannot approach the hon. the Prime Minister, who I believe can award a medal.</p>

<p>What I want to speak about today is road safety. The long-awaited report of the committee of inquiry into the Road Safety Council, an inquiry which has taken almost 2&#x00BD; years, has at last been tabled. I notice that the chairman of the committee has become acting director and that the secretary has been appointed head of publicity&#x2014;this must be mere coincidence&#x2014; of the National Road Safety Council. This is the new name of the organization. I was one of the witnesses that was interviewed by the committee. My most important point was that the National Road Safety Council should be removed entirely from the political arena. This is not even mentioned in the report. Therefore I must continue to plead for this. How any political party can elect itself as a saviour in the field of road safety, is surely beyond comprehension. Should we not be allowed to pool our resources, ideas and experience in order to try and overcome this useless carnage on our roads&#x003F; If your child, a youth in the prime of his life, is brought home lifeless as a result of a car accident, through which door do you expect political sympathy to enter&#x003F; These matters are too deep and too tragic ever to be treated lightly. Has the time not arrived for a committee representing all parties in this hon. House to meet around a table to discuss this vital subject&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, I am not making political propaganda at all. I am very serious about the matter. As was mentioned here just now by an hon. member, over the last weekend there were 11 deaths and 80 people injured in road accidents in the Western Cape. How much longer must this continue while we are playing politics with road safety&#x003F; Other than the quarterly report which is issued by the Road Safety Council, a pamphlet on road safety was, I believe, issued recently in Pretoria. It bore a most alarming title: &#x201C;Stem Nat en vrek op die pad&#x201D;. I do not believe for one moment that the author intended to insult the Nationalist Party; it was merely a &#x201C;gimmick&#x201D; to draw attention to the seriousness of the situation. I believe that he, too, advocated that road safety should be removed from the political arena. If this is only done, I and many others&#x2014; even members on the other side&#x2014;will feel that we are making some progress with this vital matter.</p>

<p>I want to read a small article which appeared in the <i>Argus</i> of the 8th February, 1973, under the heading &#x201C;Scandal on the road&#x201D;:</p>

<block name="quote">Almost 30 people a day, on average, died on the roads of South Africa during the first nine months of last year. Not in battle, not in some terrible epidemic&#x2014; no, on the roads The total was 6 421 for the nine months. It was an increase of 272 on the 1971 total&#x2014;and looked at from whatever way one likes it was scandalous and shameful. Altogether 20 680 people were affected, either fatally or by serious injury. In one month alone, September, 31 265 vehicles were involved in accidents &#x2026; What is the matter with <span class="col_4449-4450" refersTo="page_0778"/>South African motorists&#x003F; Do all their frustrations balloon in their heads when they get behind steering wheels&#x003F; Are they especially inconsiderate people, especially callous, especially dim-witted&#x003F; And our pedestrians&#x2014;do many of them have an in-built death wish&#x003F; (Many of the dead and maimed were pedestrians, and presumably the motorists were not to blame in all cases.)</block>

<block name="quote">The questions are asked year after year; the appeals are made; the warnings are given&#x2014;and the country&#x2019;s motorists go on murdering fellow-citizens, go on committing suicide, in ever-increasing numbers.</block>

<block name="quote">What is the answer&#x003F; Stricter laws, more control&#x003F; These seem unavoidable and inevitable. At base, though, there is no substitute for the personal approach: Personal responsibility, personal respect for life and for the other man, personal caring.</block>

<block name="quote">We have been called a very strange society. We stand in danger of being called a very savage one&#x2014;on the roads.</block>

<p>How serious is not the situation! Can we continue to ignore it&#x003F; Do you not agree, Sir, that we are an exceedingly strange society&#x003F; During 1970 the Road Safety Council organized yet another campaign for pedestrians The Motor Vehicle Assurance Fund contributed R50 000 apart from the amount the council itself contributed. With what result&#x003F; The number of accidents and casualties involving pedestrians increased! This is another case of wasting the tax-payer&#x2019;s money. Slogans will never decrease the accident rate. This has been tried over and over again but has been proved a dismal failure. As an example, they say that all nuts on a motor vehicle should be tight with the exception of the nut behind the wheel. That slogan raises shrieks of laughter in a bar and then another round of drinks are ordered for the road! [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg who has just resumed his eat, usually makes a very positive contribution in this House. I must say, however, that as far as his introductory ideas to this speech are concerned, he is completely at sea. I can assure him that road safety is by no means approached by this side of the House from a party-political angle. Anyone with an idea like that, or who makes statements like that, simply does not know what he is talking about.</p>

<p>So much has been said here this afternoon about airports that I actually feel hesitant to begin this little speech of mine, but as a member who represents the Southern Cape in this Parliament, I also have my duties to perform. I should like to have a word with the hon. the Minister about the airport at George. When this has been completed, it will serve the whole of the Southern Cape. This airport has been on the drawing-board for many years and a while ago we read in the Press that things are stirring again. If we look at the transport facilities of the Southern Cape, we see that they are relatively poor and that an airport is what is really lacking in these modern times in which we are living. The reason for that is that some time ago the area around Mossel Bay, George, Knysna and Oudtshoorn in particular was declared to be one of the growth points in the country. When this happens in an area such as this which is particularly suited to light industries, one can expect a stream of businessmen coming to investigate the place, to determine whether they could establish a factory there. They are people with limited time at their disposal and are usually in a hurry. For the businessmen and for the future economic development of that region, an airport is therefore an urgent necessity. Secondly, there are the holidaymakers. The Southern Cape probably has the best beaches in the country, one could almost go as far as to say in the world. The hasty holidaymaker, coming from all over the world to enjoy a wonderful holiday there, must make use of trains which are very fully booked during holiday periods. They would make abundant use of an airport. Then, too, we have the public of that region, which lies just in the centre of the route between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, who could also make use of it. We believe that if it is completed, it may also serve as an alternate airport for Cape Town, which will be much nearer than Kimberley, at present being used as an alternate airport for Cape Town. I would therefore be greatly obliged if the hon. the Minister could tell us how far the planning has progressed, when the work will begin in all earnest and the airport completed, and when it is completed, how it will be integrated with the South African Airways.</p>

<p>In the few minutes remaining, I would like to say a few words about marine pollution <span class="col_4451-4452" refersTo="page_0779"/>and when I talk about marine pollution, I refer only to oil pollution. Since the department took over this division, there have been a few ships which sprang a leak along the coast and which caused grave problems. The department succeeded in pumping the oil from those leaking ships into other ships and they have done this in an exceptionally praiseworthy manner. None of the oil which could have polluted our beaches, was lost. Pollution of the sea by oil and the prevention of this, is a major and difficult task, because in the first place one requires preventative action here. If one wants to succeed in this matter, it does not help to wait until a ship is leaking or sinking and then to speed to its assistance and see what can be saved. Before the fat is in the fire, it has to be removed. In fact, it should rather be kept away from the fire altogether. Sir, it is of course true that no one can have prior knowledge of when a ship will sink, when it is going to be struck by some object, when it is going to run aground or when it is going to develop a crack or anything of that nature. But I believe that in the first place we must have an international code here to enable us to act on an international basis in this sphere. It seems to me that many of these tankers which convey oil around our coasts, are rather decrepit and that many of the owners do not care two hoots what kind of ship they have in the water, just as long as they can off-load the oil, albeit with some luck, and put the money from that consignment in their pockets. Many ships are registered in harbours which do not care two hoots what condition the ship is in, whether it is seaworthy or whether it complies with certain national requirements, as long as it can just be registered there and supply revenue to that harbour. I believe that in the first place an international code should be established, so that an oil tanker has to comply with certain specifications. If it does not, then it should not be allowed to convey oil by sea. We also believe that a system should be devised whereby the owners may be compelled, if any of these regulations are contravened and a ship begins to leak, to pay damages and make good the costs incurred by the department which has to rectify these blunders. It also happens that many ships, when they return empty and are on the open sea, are cleaned inside and in this way too, tons of oil are discharged into the sea, and it does not take long for ocean currents or the winds to cause this to drift towards our shores. Now you can realize that we, having holiday resorts on our South Coast and not having other industries with the result that the holidaymakers assure us of so much revenue, are very jealous of the beauty and cleanliness of those beaches. If it should happen that a disaster were to strike us and a few of the beaches are totally polluted by oil the holiday-makers would disappear. Once a place has a bad name, the holiday-makers do not easily return. Once a beach has been polluted by oil&#x2014;sometimes it is a few feet deep&#x2014;it is a tremendous task to get those beaches clean again. We believe that this is exceptionally important for our tourist industry, particularly along our South Coast, that we should apply ourselves to this task and, bearing in mind that prevention is better than cure, try to keep the oil as far from our coast as possible. If it should happen that, as a result of an accident or collision, oil does leak, the department must of course be prepared to speed to the assistance of those involved and to keep as much as possible of the oil away from the coast.</p>

<p>Sir, it is not only our beaches that can be harmed in this respect; I also think of our marine life. If one discusses this subject with experts, they paint a very grim picture of marine pollution which already exists as a result of oil discharged into the water. Although the sea has fantastic powers of recuperation and the ability to destroy the waste material which is discharged into it&#x2014;through the salts in the water, waste material such as iron, etc., is dissolved &#x2014;it is not capable of doing this in respect of oil. When oil is discharged, this forms globules which sink and pollute marine life.</p>

<heading>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill before the House is the second successor to the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act, which was introduced in Parliament during 1917. As hon. members will recall, the world was at that stage involved in the First World War, in which South Africa also took part. According to the reports in <i>The Cape Times</i> on the debate in question, hon. members of that time reluctantly dealt with this Bill since their attention was focused on the war effort. The main issue provoked by that Bill, was the jury system. It is interesting to note that the introducer of that Bill, Minister (subsequently Mr. Justice) M. J. de Wet found himself in the unenviable position of having to introduce a measure which did not have his personal support. The jury system obviously did not appeal to him. I am grateful that that struggle need to be repeated today, in view of the fact that this knot was cut back in 1969.</p>

<p>I am also grateful that the present Bill is not being introduced under equally depressing political circumstances. On the other hand, it is probably true that as far as crime is concerned, the conditions that prevailed then cannot be compared with those prevailing today. It is a general phenomenon all over the Western world that crime is continually increasing, especially serious offences. I am not referring here to the common burglar, robber and thief. They have been with us since time immemorial and will always be with us. Their crimes are bad enough as it is, but they pale into insignificance in comparison with today&#x2019;s organized crime, which shocks one to the very marrow. Aircraft hijackings, kidnapping, drug peddling and the blackmailing of individuals, even of States, are the order of the day. Fortunately South Africa has up to now been spared to a large extent.</p>

<p>Unlike our criminal law, which has its origins in common law, our criminal procedure is based on English law and was introduced into our statute law many years ago. In the period before Union each province had its own legislation in this regard, but the respective ordinances had a great deal in common with one another. However, the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act, 1917 (Act No. 31 of 1917), which was a consolidatory measure, also brought about uniformity. That Act was reviewed in 1955 and consolidated once again in the measure known today as the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955 (Act No. 56 of 1955). For nearly a century, therefore, our criminal procedure has remained basically unaltered. In itself this is a splendid testimonial to our system, but it is, what is more, known throughout the world for its fairness to an accused. To tell the truth, Mr. Speaker, our system goes out of its way, or as one of our text-book authors phrased it so strikingly, &#x201C;leans over backwards&#x201D; to protect and to pamper the accused.</p>

<p>The questions arises why it is necessary for our system to be changed. Mr. Speaker, it cannot be denied that points of friction have arisen in the course of years. These can be attributed to many factors. I want to mention just a few of them. Owing to the manpower shortage prevailing in our country, absolute efficiency has become essential. Cumbrous procedures serving no purpose cannot be afforded. New aids have been developed, aids which can enhance the efficiency in the courts. However, outdated ideas and methods have proved to be a handicap in this regard. Change is also necessary in that the pattern of crime has changed over the years. Organized crime by criminals who are thoroughly conversant with the laws of the country, has come to the fore. Rules originally designed for the protection of ignorant accused persons are being exploited to the limit. In saying this, Mr. Speaker, I am in good company. It seems as though a new attitude towards crime has developed throughout the Western world. In America President Nixon has taken up the cudgels against crime. In England a Criminal Law Revision Committee has been in existence for many years. In September, 1964, that Committee, constituted from the most prominent lawyers in England, received the following terms of reference: &#x201C;to review the <span class="col_4455-4456" refersTo="page_0781"/>law of evidence in criminal cases and to consider whether any changes are desirable in the interests of the fair and efficient administration of justice; and in particular what provision should be made for modifying rules which have ceased to be appropriate in modern conditions&#x201D;. This Committee&#x2019;s report was published in June, 1972. Mr. Speaker, to those of us who are familiar with the conservatism of the English legal profession and their predilection for traditions, the recommendations of this Committee are surprising. Age-old rules which were considered to be indissolubly connected with their administration of justice, were summarily thrown overboard. I shall mention a few of them. The judges&#x2019; rule which requires the police to warn an accused during the course of the investigation of the case that he is not obliged to say anything to the charge against him and that what he says can be used in evidence against him, has to be abolished, and the same goes for the right of an accused person to remain silent. Furthermore, it must be possible for the court to call a witness to give evidence, and if he fails to do so the court has to be able to draw reasonable inferences from his failure to do so. Mr. Speaker, what is surprising is not only the radical changes recommended by the Committee, but also the outspokenness of the Committee in regard to views and rules which have already become traditional. To illustrate this I want to quote a few paragraphs from this report. Firstly, paragraph 24 on page 13&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our main object, then, has been to go as far in getting rid of restrictions on admissibility of evidence as is possible, in the &#x201C;modem conditions&#x201D; referred to in our terms of reference, in particular having regard to the changed conditions referred to above. We have also aimed at reducing the gap between the amount of relevant evidence which could be given and the amount which is in fact given. This is done chiefly by provisions designed to discourage the accused from refraining from giving evidence if a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out against him, by reducing the great restrictions as to the giving of evidence by the spouse of the accused and by abolishing certain privileges of refusing to answer questions. We justify the reforms which we recommend for this purpose not only because of the changed conditions to which we have referred but mainly on the ground that there is no clear reason why the restrictions should ever have existed.</block>

<p>Also paragraph 27 on page 15&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We need hardly say that we have no wish to lessen the fairness of criminal trials. But it must be clear what fairness means in this connection. It means, or ought to mean, that the law should be such as will secure as far as possible that the result of the trial is the right one. That is to say, the accused should be convicted if the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty, but otherwise not. We stress this, although it may seem obvious, because fairness seems often to be thought of as something which is due to the defence only. At least there seems to be an idea that the defence have a sacred right to the benefit of anything in the law which may give them a chance of acquittal, even on a technicality, however strong the case is against them. We disagree entirely with this idea. It seems to derive from an unwarranted extension of the principle that, in order that the accused should be convicted, the prosecution must prove their case and perhaps also of the convention that those appearing for the prosecution are not concerned to secure a conviction but only to present its case. As a result the habit has grown up of looking at a criminal trial as a kind of game to be played, according to fixed rules, between the prosecution and the defence; and since the defence are naturally likely to be the weaker (and the accused may very likely seem stupid and helpless), it seems to be expected that the prosecution will refrain from using all their strength and that the judge will take any opportunity to make the contest more even.</block>

<p>Another leading British lawyer also commented on this matter. In an article in the <i>American Law Journal</i> Lord Hartley Shaw-cross, a former attorney-general, Labour M.P., chief delegate to the U.N. and Chairman of the Bar Council for many years, took up the following standpoint as far back as 1965&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And so I come finally to what is very much our concern&#x2014;the policy and administration of the law in this particular context. The truth is, I believe, that the <span class="col_4457-4458" refersTo="page_0782"/>law has become hopelessly unrealistic in its attitude toward the prevention and detection of crime. We cling to a sentimental and sporting attitude in dealing with the criminal. We put illusory fears about the impairment of liberty before the promotion of justice. Indeed, our whole idea of justice is, when you think of it, a bit odd.</block>

<block name="quote">The task of the judge in most foreign systems of law is akin to that of the scientist in a laboratory: to ascertain the real truth by all proper means. But not so the judge in systems founded upon the Anglo-Saxon. He is more akin to the umpire in our English games, his duty limited to ascertaining objective truth, in so far as the parties can or choose to present it; to see that each side observes the rules of the game and to answer the question &#x201C;How&#x2019;s that&#x003F;&#x201D; Indeed, we symbolize justice as blindfolded and holding scales. The scales are weighted against the truth.</block>

<p>Hon. members may now say, &#x201C;Yes, that is the position in England; what does that have to do with us&#x003F;&#x201D; However, it is very relevant, for England is, as has already been mentioned, the cradle of our criminal procedure and evidence. What applies there is as applicable here. However, to come nearer home: I am not a supporter of Mr. Justice Hiemstra&#x2019;s proposed amendments to our Criminal Procedure Act, but any person who has read his articles in the <i>Law Journal</i> and does not realize that there are major hitches in our system, is closing his eyes to the truth. I do not wish to pursue the matter any further, Mr. Speaker, for I think that every right-minded person will have to grant that our Criminal Procedure Act badly needs to be renovated. Therefore, when the opportunity presented itself, I took the necessary steps for the appointment of the Commission of Inquiry into Criminal Procedure and Evidence. I want to thank Mr. Justice Botha of the Appeal Court for this sound piece of work which he did in record time. Within the short space of 18 months he presented us with a report and a Bill, truly an unsurpassable achievement if one considers that it took the English committee eight years to report on a few aspects of the law of evidence. I am also aware of the personal sacrifices which this task demanded of him and of the inconvenience he had to put up with. He lives in Bloemfontein, but, except for certain weekends, he had to stay in Pretoria while the commission was in session.</p>

<p>The report of the commission and the Bill were published as far back as December, 1971. I am pleased to be able to say that these did not give rise to any particular controversy. Those who commented on them in the Press, generally welcomed them. That was gratifying, Mr. Speaker, for the administration of justice is a subject on which one would not like to see any sharp differences of opinion. I also want to mention that the entire Judiciary was consulted. The Chief Justice, every judge president and magistrate&#x2019;s office were provided with copies of the report. Once again, Mr. Speaker, I must say that the reaction was encouraging. No fundamental objection to the Bill was received. Comments were in fact made in regard to the details of the Bill. Sound proposals were also put forward and the necessary adjustments were effected in the Bill.</p>

<p>Nor was any objection received from any of the law faculties in the country. So far it is only Prof. Strauss of Unisa who has commented on it in the Press and has promised his support to the Bill.</p>

<p>The General Council of the Bar and the Association of Law Societies also commented on the Bill. Unlike the rest of the legal profession, they have misgivings about certain changes recommended by the commission. Their comments, however, were also for a large part concerned with the details of the Bill. Where possible, their proposals were accepted and adjustments were effected to the Bill. In reviewing the contents of the Bill, I shall go into some of their objections.</p>

<p>Representations were also received from other interested bodies and persons, such as the United Municipal Executive of South Africa. However, their problems were met by way of talks with my department.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, on a matter such as this one the greatest measure of unanimity should prevail amongst us. Politics have nothing to do with it. The only object I have in view, is to give South Africa the best criminal procedure in the world. That we are on the right track, is apparent from the words of Prof. Strauss of the University of South Africa. I quote from <i>Die Burger</i> of 13th December, 1971 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s criminal procedure ranks among the best in the world and is something of which the country may justifiably be proud. All the amendments <span class="col_4459-4460" refersTo="page_0783"/>being proposed now are, what is more, very constructive ones.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that our criminal procedure is above politics; it is also above self-interest. To me as an attorney it may go against the grain that my already difficult task of defending an accused is being complicated further, that in future it will not be so easy for me to secure the acquittal of an accused. However, that is not the point at issue. Mr. Speaker, the point at issue is the truth. The purpose of a trial is to ascertain the truth, to secure the conviction of a guilty person and vice versa. If one&#x2019;s system leans over too much to the one side or to the other, one&#x2019;s administration of justice is prejudiced no end. While we are all aware of the tragic consequences which the conviction of an innocent person entails, I wonder whether we realize to what extent our administration of justice is prejudiced by unnecessary acquittals of guilty persons. The Courts Inquiry Commission, 1971, of Rhodesia puts the matter like this, and I quote from their report (page 88)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today there is a growing realization that not only is it a miscarriage of justice for an innocent man to be convicted, but it is also a miscarriage of justice for a guilty man to be acquitted. Lord Goddard gave expression to this realization when he said:</block>

<block name="quote">The judge must consider the interests of justice as well as the interests of the prisoners. It is too often nowadays thought, or seems to be thought, that the interests of justice means only the interests of the prisoners.</block>

<p>Dr. Glanville Williams put it even more plainly when he said:</p>

<block name="quote">The evil of acquitting a guilty person goes much beyond the simple fact that one guilty person has gone unpunished. It frustrates the arduous and costly work of the police who, if this tendency goes too far, may either become daunted or resort to improper methods of obtaining convictions. If unmerited acquittals become general, they tend to lead to a disregard of the law, and this in turn leads to a public demand for more severe punishment of those who are found guilty. Thus the acquittal of the guilty leads to a ferocious penal law. An acquittal is, of course, particularly serious when it is of a dangerous criminal who is likely to find a new victim. For all these reasons it is true to say, with Viscount Simon, that &#x201C;a miscarriage of justice may arise from the acquittal of the guilty no less than from the conviction of the innocent&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I appeal to hon. members to approach the Bill objectively, for if they do so I am convinced they will find that there is nothing in this Bill which will make it more difficult for an accused to put his defence to the court. I concede at once that there are in fact provisions which will make it more difficult for a guilty person to be acquitted. However, we cannot be opposed to that, surely&#x003F; It would therefore have been pleasant if this could have been an unopposed measure. However, it has unfortunately happened now that a Press campaign has been started, a campaign which is quite disproportionate to the seriousness of the changes being effected.</p>

<p>Hon. members will appreciate that it is impossible for me to give a thorough survey of the Bill in the time at our disposal. This is pre-eminently the type of Bill that should be dealt with at the Committee Stage. Although the Bill contains drastic changes to the existing system, no principles which are completely foreign to our law are being introduced. These changes are by and large that recognized principles are being harnessed in a new way and that we are doing away with a number of provisions which are impracticable or have become obsolete because of modern circumstances. However, the present Criminal Procedure Act is for a large part being retained without change.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should like to mention a few of the more well-known provisions of the existing Act which have been omitted by the commission from the Bill. Firstly, the provision in section 258(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, that an accused in a lower court, except in petty cases, may be sentenced on a plea of guilty only if the commission of the offence has been proved by evidence <i>aliunde.</i> This provision is replaced in the Bill by a procedure with which I will deal later on. Suffice it to say at this stage that this change will bring us into line with the rest of the Western world which regards a plea of guilty in a court of law as the highest form of proof that an accused has committed the offence with <span class="col_4461-4462" refersTo="page_0784"/>which he is charged. Secondly, section 227(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act which allows an accused to make at his trial an unsworn statement which is not subject to cross-examination. Thirdly, the so-called two-witnesses rule in perjury and treason cases which is provided for in the proviso to section 256. Fourthly, the requirement in section 257 that an accused may be convicted on the single evidence of an accomplice only if the offence has, by competent evidence, other than the single and unconfirmed evidence of the accomplice, been proved to the satisfaction of the court to have been actually committed. The omission of this section from the Bill does, of course, not affect the continued existence of the &#x201C;cautionary rule&#x201D; which has been developed by the courts in recognition of the fact that section 257 does not provide adequate safeguard against false incrimination of an accused by an accomplice. As hon. members know, the cautionary rule requires that a court should warn itself of the peculiar danger of convicting on the evidence of an accomplice. A court, therefore, should seek some safeguard which will reduce the risk of the wrong person being convicted, for instance corroboration implicating the accused in the commission of the offence. The omission of this section will bring our law on this point into line with that of England.</p>

<p>I now come to the reforms in our law of procedure. First of all I propose to deal with those reforms touching the criminal trial itself because I regard them as the most important. According to the Bill, summary trials will henceforth be the rule in the Supreme Court and preparatory examinations will only be held where the Attorney-General considers that it is necessary for the more effective administration of justice. The only opposition to this recommendation of the commission came from the Bar and the Side-Bar. On the other hand at least one Judge-President and all the Attorneys-General have requested the total abolition of preparatory examinations. We have all heard the pros and cons of preparatory examinations many times before and I am not going to repeat them. All I want to say is that I have read the report of the commission on the matter and I am satisfied that the middle course adopted by the commission is in the circumstances the correct one. Although the Side-Bar has objected to the change there would, appear, even in their own ranks, to be a difference of opinion. According to the <i>De Rebus Procuratoriis,</i> the monthly journal of the Association of Law Societies, an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, appointed by the Association to make recommendations regarding the simplification and speeding up of criminal procedure, recommended during March, 1970, that preparatory examinations should either be abolished or changed considerably (March, 1970, p. 111).</p>

<p>In regard to summary trials in the Supreme Court the commission made a concession to the defence. Otherwise than at present the accused will not only have to be provided with an indictment before the trial but also with a summary of the facts alleged against him. Although this is welcomed by the General Council of the Bar, they are not satisfied; they want more. They want either the statements of the State witnesses or the right to call for further particulars in connection with the summary of facts. They want all this, notwithstanding the fact that the existing right to request further particulars to the charge is retained. This attitude to me is not reasonable. The Commission has rejected a proposal that the furnishing to an accused of copies of the statements of State witnesses be made compulsory and has given very good reasons for its decision. I am sure the defence would not be prepared to hand their statements to the State. Why then should this be expected from the State&#x003F; As it is the Attorneys-General feel that an unnecessary burden is being placed upon their shoulders, particularly in view of the fact that superior as well as lower courts are at present functioning satisfactorily without the summary of facts envisaged by the Bill. I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accede to the Bar Council&#x2019;s request.</p>

<p>*The main features of the procedure at a trial in terms of the Bill may be outlined as follows. Every accused person must, within 48 hours of his arrest or as soon as possible after that, be brought before a magistrate&#x2019;s court which has jurisdiction. If it is possible to put the charge to him on the occasion of that appearance in court, it must be done without delay. If this is not possible, for instance where insufficient progress has been made with the investigation of the case, it must be put to him as soon as possible after the said appearance. If the accused pleads guilty, the court shall, except in the case of minor offences with which the court <span class="col_4463-4464" refersTo="page_0785"/>may be disposed of summarily, explain the essential elements of the offence to the accused and inquire from him whether he understands the charge and whether his plea of guilty is an admission of all such elements. If the court is satisfied in this way that the accused understands the charge and admits the elements of it, he shall, except in a case where the court does not have the jurisdiction to try the case, be found guilty without more ado.</p>

<p>After that the court may hear evidence with regard to imposing punishment and may sentence the accused or, if the offence is of such a nature or magnitude that it merits a punishment exceeding the jurisdiction of a magistrate&#x2019;s court, the court may commit the accused for sentence to a regional or superior court, which shall in regard to sentencing follow the same procedure as the magistrate&#x2019;s court. In the case where a magistrate&#x2019;s court does not have the jurisdiction to try the case, such as in cases of offences in respect of which the death penalty is a competent sentence, a conviction is not recorded but the case is committed to a superior court through the intervention of the Attorney-General. In such cases as much evidence must be submitted to the superior court as that court may require for proving the guilt of the accused.</p>

<p>If the accused in the magistrate&#x2019;s court pleads not guilty to any charge, he shall be asked by the magistrate whether he wishes to tender any explanation of his attitude in relation to the charge or to make any statement indicating the basis of his defence, and whether he wishes to say anything else in relation to the charge which he wants to bring to the notice of the magistrate or the trial court. If the accused does not react to this request, the magistrate may, if the offence is to be tried by him, and in order to define the issues in the case, inquire from the accused whether his plea of not guilty amounts to a denial of all the elements of the offence charged or whether he wants those elements which he does not deny to be recorded as admissions of those elements. If the case is to be tried by another court, the court shall determine the issues and commit the case to a regional court, or through the intervention of the Attorney-General, to a superior court. At the trial of the accused in a regional court or a superior court anything said by him before the magistrate shall be admissible in evidence on the mere production of the record of the proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this stage I want to interrupt my summary of the Bill once again in order to discuss certain objections raised to the procedures I have just set out. In the main there are three principles which, because of their importance, one immediately finds striking. The first one is that the accused shall, at the earliest opportunity possible, plead in the magistrate&#x2019;s court to the charge against him.</p>

<p>The objects of this clause are of twofold nature. What is envisaged by the procedure, is, on the one hand, to afford an accused pleading guilty the opportunity of putting to the magistrate his side of the case against him at an early stage. This may possibly lead to his being released at an early date or it may considerably shorten the trial, if there has to be one (see paragraph 1.31-1.33 of the Report, p. 9). On the other hand this clause may also imply a great deal of benefit for the State. Experience has shown that once an accused has been detained in prison, he often comes forward with a fabricated defence. If he does not have a true defence, one is made up with the help of numerous advisers in prison.</p>

<p>The principle that an accused person cannot be expected to plead at his first appearance, is not a foreign one. In fact, at present there is nothing to prevent a prosecutor from putting the charge to an accused person at his first appearance. This is being done in our courts every day, especially in cases of a less serious nature. In Johannesburg, for instance, it used to be the practice to take all pickpockets, together with the witnesses, directly to court and to settle the matter there and then. Great success was achieved by these means. However, this is no longer common practice today. At present most serious cases are postponed almost without exception, and in that way the psychological moment when accused persons admit their crimes is lost. This moment occurs, so it is accepted universally, shortly after the arrest of the accused, before he has had a chance to think up a story. The recommendations made by the English commission in this regard are, of course, very interesting. They seek to go much further than does the Bill under discussion. What they envisage is that an accused should tender his explanations to the police investigating the case even before the trial takes place. The <span class="col_4465-4466" refersTo="page_0786"/>General Bar Council and the Cape Bar Council are objecting to this clause, unless the presiding officer notifies the accused that he&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) is entitled to a postponement in order that he may consider his position and take legal advice; and</li>

<li>(b) may apply to the Legal Aid Board for legal aid.</li></ol>

<p>The object of this clause is not to deny the accused legal aid, advice or assistance. Clause 73 (2) confirms that right in no uncertain terms, and if the accused has not had an opportunity of contacting his legal representative, the court will have to afford him that opportunity. This is the case at present, and the Bill does not change that position. However, the Bar Councils are losing sight of the fact that only a minor percentage of all accused persons appearing in court are defended. A great deal of valuable court time would be lost if every accused person&#x2019;s rights had to be explained to him in order to sift the small number of cases which want legal representation and do not have it already. I am also convinced that to accept this proposal would merely lead to a waste of time. Experience has shown that those who want legal representation either make arrangements in good time or ask for an extension of time in order to do so.</p>

<p>Another objection is that an ignorant accused may plead guilty before being able to obtain legal representation and that this may complicate the course of the case. This sounds like a hypothetical objection. Clause 112(1)(b) provides explicitly that where a plea of guilty is entered, the court shall investigate the matter carefully and that certain requirements shall be met. Clause 113 provides that if the court is in doubt whether the accused is in law guilty of the offence to which he has pleaded guilty, a plea of not guilty shall be recorded.</p>

<p>The next important change which is being envisaged is that the court may, except in the case where the death penalty may be imposed, convict the accused without evidence, provided that the court explains all the elements of the offence to the accused and that he admits each of them. This change is fully motivated in the commission&#x2019;s report. I cannot think of another provision in the Criminal Procedure Act that has done more to discredit our administration of justice in the public mind than has the present one, which requires <i>aliunde</i> evidence proving the commission of the offence to be submitted to the court. This has led to the discharge of numerous accused persons who pleaded guilty, and to a stream of letters of protest to me and my department. Consequently I am delighted to see that the commission has adopted a new course. The Natal Bar Council and the Association of Law Societies send word that they did not support this provision. However, the General Bar Council made no comment on the matter, and the Cape Bar Council is of the opinion that the provision is logical and that no objection can be brought against it.</p>

<p>The third change I want to discuss probably is also the most important change envisaged by the Bill. When an accused person pleads not guilty at present, he places, without any further formalities, the whole case in issue. Practice has shown, however, that an accused person seldom denies everything alleged against him in a case. This results in the calling of many unnecessary witnesses, with the attendant inconvenience, costs, and so forth. In future the accused will be afforded an opportunity of putting his side of the case against him, if he so wishes. This is nothing new. Section 169(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act contains a similar provision which, however, has completely fallen into oblivion. That is probably why the commission added a further provision which provides that if he does not avail himself of the opportunity, or if it is not clear from his statement what points are in issue, the magistrate may ask him whether his plea of not guilty amounts to a denial of all the elements of the offence charged and whether he wants the elements mission of such elements (clause 119).</p>

<p>Sir, the new procedure, in a nutshell, is therefore that an accused should plead as early as possible and that the court should determine what the accused&#x2019;s reply is to every accusation. Numerous advantages ought to flow from this system. It should <i>inter alia</i> benefit the accused as well, for if he reveals his defence at an early stage and perseveres with it, it can hardly be said to have been invented. For the State this implies many advantages. It ought to save costs and precious court time, but, Sir, above all it ought to promote justice. I do not have the time to go fully into this matter, but that is probably not necessary either, for the consequences which this change will involve ought to be obvious to all of us.</p>

<p><span class="col_4467-4468" refersTo="page_0787"/>I would rather use my time in examining briefly a number of questions and objections received in this regard. The following questions in regard to the relevant clause were raised by a certain judge&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) If the accused were to omit to give an explanation or to make a statement or to state what points are in issue, would the court be able to draw at his trial an unfavourable inference from it&#x003F;</li>

<li>(b) Would the court in such a case be entitled to cross-examine the accused in regard to his omission&#x003F;</li></ol>

<p>The judge requested that the intention of the legislature be stated clearly. I think that the Bill is quite clear. Clause 119 provides explicitly that the court may put these questions to the accused and that the court shall do so in certain cases. It would be a bad day for us if any person were able to ignore the legitimate questions of a court or to deceive the court without the court taking cognisance of it. As far as I know, a prosecutor may also cross-examine an accused on any relevant point. I am not aware of anything in this Bill which changes that position.</p>

<p>One of the Bar Councils has also stated that the questions of the court will have persuasive power, which will make it difficult for an accused to exercise his right to remain silent. As far as I know, the accused has never had such a right at the plea stage. Section 163 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides <i>inter alia</i> that the accused shall, upon the day appointed for his trial, be informed of the offence with which he is charged, and shall be required to plead instantly thereto. Furthermore it is also being said that an accused person may perhaps make incorrect admissions because of ignorance. Of course, that possibility cannot be disputed, for at present, too, it happens that accused persons plead incorrectly. However, the courts permit a plea to be altered for sound reasons. This phenomenon, however, ought to be restricted to a minimum in future, for in terms of the Bill the courts will be obliged to investigate the matter properly. Some of the Bar Councils also have scruples about the accused having to reveal his defence at this early stage. In the past the courts pointed out time and again that an accused should reveal his defence during the cross-examination of the state witnesses. However, this rule is conspicuous by its being broken so often. All that happens now is that provision is made for it in that stage of the proceedings where it logically belongs. The English commission goes much further, of course, and is of the opinion that an accused should reveal his defence to the person investigating the case as early as prior to the trial. As far as the fairness of this is concerned, the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some lawyers seem to think that it is somehow wrong in principle that a criminal should be under any kind of pressure to reveal his case before his trial. The reason seems to be that it is thought to be repugnant&#x2014;or, perhaps rather, &#x201C;unfair&#x201D;&#x2014;that a person should be obliged to choose between telling a lie and incriminating himself. Whatever the reason, this is a matter of opinion and we disagree. There seems to us nothing wrong in principle in allowing an adverse inference to be drawn against a person at his trial if he delays mentioning his defence till the trial and shows no good reason for the delay. As to the argument that it is &#x201C;unfair&#x201D; to put pressure on a suspect in this way, what we said above about fairness in criminal trials generally applies. Bentham&#x2019;s famous comment on the rule that suspects could not be judicially interrogated seems to us to apply strongly to the &#x201C;right of silence&#x201D; in the sense under discussion. He wrote: &#x201C;If all criminals of every class had assembled, and framed a system after their own wishes, is not this rule the very first which they would have established for their security&#x003F; Innocence never takes advantage of it. Innocence claims the right of speaking, as guilt invokes the privilege of silence&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The provision that the accused may make admissions, is not a foreign one. It exists at present and, what is more, it is being used.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that brings me to the report that appeared in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> on 25th March, 1973. Although the hon. member for Durban North features prominently in the report, I do not want to impute to him all the statements made in it. In the main the report alleges two things. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bill &#x2026; will abolish the country&#x2019;s present trial procedure and introduce an inquisitorial system. <span class="col_4469-4470" refersTo="page_0788"/>The report goes on to say later on that our system is the accusatorial system. However, on 3rd April, 1973, the hon. member for Durban North issued a Press statement in which he identified himself with the idea of the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> I quote again&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">The proposals in the new Bill concerning pre-trial interrogation of persons accused are unacceptable.</block>

<p>The full charge is therefore that our accusatorial trial system is being replaced by an inquisitorial pre-trial system. I want to state categorically that this is untrue. Our accusatorial trial system remains in force. I also want to deny that any kind of inquisitorial pre-trial system is being introduced.</p>

<p>The trial of an accused commences the moment the charge is put to the accused. Hon. members opposite need not take my word for that. This was decided by the Appeal Court as long ago as in the case of <i>R.</i> V. <i>Reeves,</i> 1926 A.D. 410 on p. 418. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a criminal prosecution it (meaning &#x201C;the trial&#x201D;) commences with the reading of the indictment, and calling upon the accused to answer or plead to it.</block>

<p>Now I want to put it to the hon. member for Durban North that there is no provision in this Bill which introduces interrogation of the accused before the charge has been put to him. What is more, I want to put it to him that no change whatever is being effected in regard to the interrogation of an accused before the charge has been put to him. The present position is being retained <i>in toto.</i> As regards the statement that the accusatorial system is being abolished, I must say that the hon. member did not repeat it in his Press statement, and I accept that after studying the Bill he changed his views for the better. I also want to make my position clear in regard to an inquisitorial pre-trial system. As hon. members know, Mr. Justice Hiemstra did, after the publication of his articles in the <i>Law Journal,</i> submit a Bill to my predecessor, the hon. the Prime Minister, with the request that such a system be introduced for South Africa. After comment had been obtained from all interested parties, I decided against that and informed him so. However, that was not the end of the matter. Not long after that I received requests from <i>inter alia</i> the Law Revision Committee, the Judge President of the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court, the General Council of the Bar and the Association of Law Societies, requests for having Mr. Justice Hiemstra&#x2019;s proposals considered by a commission of inquiry. As there are also other aspects of the Criminal Procedure Act which are being called into question from time to time, I decided in favour of the commission, which was eventually appointed. It has now become history that the commission rejected Mr. Justice Hiemstra&#x2019;s proposals.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, next I want to deal briefly with the question whether any of the procedures I have just outlined are of an inquisitorial nature. Firstly, when a plea of guilty is entered, it is incumbent upon the court to ascertain whether the accused admits every element of the offence. In the case of a plea of guilty being entered, there cannot be any trial in the true sense of the word, as nothing has been placed in issue. The accused admits every element of the offence. In order to make sure that this is in fact the case, the court now merely puts each of them to the accused one by one, to which he has to reply. I fail to see in this procedure any similarity with an inquisition, for an inquisition and a plea of guilty cannot be reconciled with each other. All that the court is doing, is to ascertain whether the accused understands the charge and whether he still pleads guilty in spite of that. Incidentally, in that report in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> the hon. member for Durban North posed the following question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One wonders how the courts will be in a position without all the evidence to properly assess the extremely difficult task of passing sentence.</block>

<p>Clause 112(3) does of course make detailed provision for this matter.</p>

<p>The second procedure that has to be reviewed, is the proceedings that follow on a plea of not guilty. Before I discuss that, we should obtain clarity on what we have in mind in referring to an inquisitorial system. All the inquisitorial systems which I know, include an interrogation of the accused, shortly after his arrest, on all the facts of the case, even before a charge has been put to him. What is the position concerning the system being envisaged for us&#x003F; Clause 119 provides <i>inter alia</i> that the court shall, after a plea of not guilty has <span class="col_4471-4472" refersTo="page_0789"/>been entered, inquire from the accused whether the plea of not guilty is intended to place in issue all the elements of the offence and all the acts or omissions on which the charge is based in so far as such acts or omissions are apparent from the charge, and I want to repeat, in so far as these are apparent from the charge. My reason for emphasizing this is that the clause indicates without any doubt that there cannot be any interrogation on the facts of the case. In the first place, at that stage the court is not in possession of the facts, and, in the second place, this is prohibited by the clause. What does therefore happen here in effect&#x003F; Instead of the accused denying all the elements simultaneously by pleading not guilty, he is asked to deny each of them separately. This is no drastic change, nor does it show any similarity with an inquisitorial system. Its effect will be that the accused will have to reveal his defence. However, he will do so in public and in the presence of the court. In terms of the proposal put forward by the English commission, he will already have to do so to the police.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also want to indicate who is against the envisaged provision and who is in favour of it. Although the entire Judiciary was asked for comment, not one single judge, magistrate or attorney-general raised objections to this provision; on the contrary, several judges commented on it in the Press, indicating that they supported the Bill. The following comment was received from a judge president (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Clause</i> 119: This is probably the most important clause in the entire Bill, and I welcome the idea that an attempt is being made to force an accused to co-operate in defining the issues in the case more closely. This is, naturally, an experimental provision and difficulties may arise, but I do not think these difficulties will be insurmountable if sympathetic guidance is provided on the part of the judges.</block>

<p>No, I am sorry; I do not have the information now. However, I shall find out and let the hon. member know. In any case, he is a judge president. This judge president went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If there are shortcomings in the clause, they will become apparent very soon and may be remedied at a later stage.</block>

<p>Nor did I receive any objection from any university. It was only Prof. Strauss who commented on it in public, and this is what he said. I quote from a report in <i>Die Burger</i> of 13th December, 1971 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most significant single change proposed by the one-man commission is, according to Prof. Strauss, that the present system of preparatory examinations prior to an accused being charged is falling away. It is being recommended that instead of that a suspect should be brought before a magistrate as soon as possible, where he may put his case and reveal his defence if he enters a plea of not guilty. This will speed up criminal cases considerably, while the rights of the individual will still remain quite unaffected, said Prof. Strauss.</block>

<p>Now I come to the various Bar Councils that commented on the matter and here I find myself in a strange position. Natal and the Cape sent word that they were opposed to the provision. The General Bar Council made the following comment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general feeling of the committee is that where an accused is represented, his legal representative should be entitled to follow the procedure described in this section. In the case of doubt, the accused could be asked to confirm what has been said by his legal representative.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as you will note, this comment does not contain one single word condemning the provision. The council merely asks for an insertion to be effected in the clause. What is more, it is my intention to accede to this request, and a suitable amendment will be submitted to the House at the Committee Stage. I would therefore have been justified in claiming the support of the committee of the General Bar Council, but unfortunately they sent word that they, too, agreed with the Cape and Natal. All I can say to this is, &#x201C;How is one to save a Bill in the face of such a division of opinion!&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Association of Law Societies also lodged objections against the provision under discussion. Unlike the General Bar Council, the Association preferred to come and see me about the matter. I am grateful <span class="col_4473-4474" refersTo="page_0790"/> to them for having done so. In the course of these talks an amendment to clause 119 was decided on. This amendment appears on today&#x2019;s Order Paper and will be moved at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I also want to mention that in order to get the best for the country I invited the Justice groups on both sides of the House to come and discuss with me or my department any objections to the Bill or problems in that connection. Hon. members opposite chose not to avail themselves of this invitation. However, my invitation did lead to fruitful discussions with hon. members on this side of the House, and a number of amendments on the Order Paper are attributable to these talks. I want to thank them for coming to see me.</p>

<p>Other aspects of the criminal procedure that have been changed, are the provisions in regard to searching and the seizure and disposal of property. The powers of the police concerning searching and seizure remain virtually the same. However, powers of disposal are now being conferred upon the Police, mainly in cases where ownership is not disputed or where, in the absence of criminal proceedings, the property has to revert to the person from whom it was taken. At present all warrants in regard to property that has been seized, must be issued by a magistrate or by the court.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The provisions in regard to bail in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, have been reviewed and obscurities and anomalies have been clarified and repetitions removed. Two concessions have been made to accused persons. Firstly, provision is made for the release of an accused on warning in lieu of bail and, secondly, the restriction has been removed that an accused against whom a preparatory examination has been instituted shall be entitled to be released on bail only after his committal for trial or sentence. On the other hand the provisions relating to sureties have not been reintroduced and an accused can only be released on bail if he deposits the bail money with the court.</p>

<p>The admission of guilt procedure has also been changed considerably. The most important change is that a written notice to appear in court will in future be placed on a parked vehicle instead of a notice which enables the accused to compound the crime. The amount stipulated in the written notice may still be paid by way of the admission of guilt procedure. If the amount is not paid before a date specified in the written notice, the matter will be followed up by sending a similar notice by registered post to the registered owner of the vehicle instead of serving a summons on him. The compounding of crimes in terms of section 387 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, has therefore been abolished.</p>

<p>The legislation arising from the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Responsibility of Mentally Deranged Persons and Related Matters, in so far as the recommendations relate to criminal procedure, has been included in the Bill. The Bill therefore provides that if an accused by reason of a mental illness or mental defect does not have the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act, or of acting in accordance with that appreciation, he is not criminally responsible. In such a case he will be found &#x201C;not guilty by reason of mental illness&#x201D; and declared a State President&#x2019;s decision patient. Similarly, an accused who is not capable of understanding the proceedings so as to make a proper defence, will be declared a State President&#x2019;s decision patient. To assist the court with its inquiry, the accused will be examined by a panel of psychiatrists.</p>

<p>In regard to the oath which is administered to a witness in court, the requirement that he must take the oath in the form which most clearly conveys to him the meaning of the oath, and which he considers to be binding on his conscience, has been abolished. The Bill only makes provision for the oath in its accepted Christian form. Anyone who objects to taking the oath in the prescribed form or who does not regard the oath in the prescribed form to be binding on his conscience, shall be obliged to make a solemn affirmation.</p>

<p>The Bill also provides for two new procedures. Firstly, there is a provision whereby a petition for mercy by a condemned person, based upon evidence relating to such a person&#x2019;s conviction, or the death sentence imposed upon him, and which was discovered after all the recognized legal procedures have been exhausted, or are no longer available, may be referred by the State President to a court to hear such further evidence and all other related evidence. The court to which the petition has been referred, must hear the matter and submit its report thereon to the State President. Another provision provides that whenever the Minister of Justice is in doubt as to the correctness of the conviction of a person who has been sentenced to death, <span class="col_4475-4476" refersTo="page_0791"/>and the convicted person does not appeal against his conviction, he may refer the matter to the Appeal Court after the prescribed period for noting an appeal has expired.</p>

<p>As far as the law of evidence in criminal cases is concerned, the Commission has not introduced any drastic changes. The Commission was of the opinion that the law of evidence in criminal as well as civil cases, with a view to the general revision of our law of evidence, should be considered jointly and that another Commission should be appointed for this purpose. It may be mentioned that the revision of our law of evidence might well be one of the first assignments of the Law Commission to be established under the legislation which was recently before this House. In order to facilitate the proof of certain matters in the interim, the Bill contains several new provisions. One of these has been adopted from the Civil Proceedings Evidence Act, 1965 (Act 25 of 1965) and others are derived from English legislation. The provisions are not of a contentious nature and require no further discussion.</p>

<p>An important change in regard to confessions has, however, been introduced. A confession of the commission of an offence is admissible as evidence against the person who made it, provided such confession is proved to have been made freely and voluntarily by such person in his sound and sober senses without having been unduly influenced thereto. No confession made to a peace officer, other than a magistrate or justice, is, however, admissible in evidence unless it was confirmed and reduced to writing in the presence of a magistrate or justice. The Bill now provides that where a confession is made to a magistrate and reduced to writing by him, it shall at the trial of the person who made the confession, be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been freely and voluntarily made by such person in his sound and sober senses without having been unduly influenced thereto. The Bar and the Side-Bar oppose the provision and label it as yet another example of the increasing tendency on the part of the State to create presumptions against accused persons. Sight is, however, lost of the fact that we are dealing here with a provision which is unique. A judicial officer is made available with the specific purpose of ensuring that the confession made by the accused is made freely and voluntarily. Yet, after all the trouble that has been taken, the confession must still be proved in the ordinary way. Now we all know that where an accused makes a confession to a magistrate during the course of a trial, nobody would think of questioning it at a later stage unless an irregularity has been committed. The accused, however, would have to prove the irregularity on appeal or review if it does not appear from the record. Why then, should there be this difference&#x003F; I therefore subscribe to the views of the Commission which give meaning to the making of a confession before a magistrate. The accused is not deprived of the right to dispute the confession, but he will have to take the initiative if it is alleged that he did not make the confession freely and voluntarily.</p>

<p>Section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, which deals with the detention of witnesses, has been retained in the Act in a revised form. I do not want to go into this matter any further as the hon. member for Durban North intimated last year already that his party accepts this provision.</p>

<p>The rest of the Bill consists mainly of existing provisions which have been revised and adapted to fit into the suggested system and meet with modern requirements.</p>

<p>The overwhelming impression which this Bill creates is that it is aimed at the expeditious disposal of criminal cases and that in the process the scale which at present weighs heavily in favour of the accused will be somewhat better balanced.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask for the privilege of the one hour.</p>

<p>I would have thought that in introducing so fundamental a change in so fundamental a statute as is being done in this Bill, the hon. the Minister of Justice would have given to us some weighty reasons as to why it was now necessary to introduce then changes in a great hurry, like he did. One would have thought that there would have been some most important reason. All that we have had from the hon. the Minister is the thought that the scales of justice are perhaps weighted too heavily on the side of the accused. All we have had from him is a number of examples of what English judges and of what English commissions said in regard to the system of justice to which ours is so similar. As the late Mr. Justice Toon van den Heever once remarked in a judgment, only British bias could suggest the thought that because in <span class="col_4477-4478" refersTo="page_0792"/>Britain they have such things, we should have them also. I am sure that the hon. the Minister is not motivated by a British bias that what they have there we should also have in South Africa. What do the statistics show&#x003F; Does the hon. the Minister suggest that in fact many people who in terms of the law are guilty have been found not guilty&#x003F; If so, how many; if so, in what circumstances&#x003F; How can he in these circumstances introduce a measure such as this with no motivation for it other than the vague suggestion that, perhaps, the scales are weighted on the side of the accused and that they do this in other parts of the world&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said I was quite wrong to suggest that this introduced elements of an inquisitorial system, because, he said, this was not done before the plea has been heard. However, that is not the point. It is done at the time of the plea; it is done immediately after the plea. The fact is that it is done, whereas it is not done under the existing law. Let me say that the hon. the Minister need not be guided by what my views on the matter are. However, I think he should take some notice of a body such as the General Council of the Bar of South Africa. I think he should also note that Mr. Justice Botha in his report upon which this Bill is based, referred to the General Council of the Bar as part of such weighty authority on the law.</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to. The General Council of the Bar&#x2014;I shall deal with their statement later&#x2014;says on page 2, paragraph 8, of their memorandum that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Various of these proposed changes (in this Bill) contain features of an inquisitorial system of criminal prosecution and are not reconcilable with the accusatorial system of criminal justice which has been the foundation of South African criminal law for over 100 years.</block>

<p>The hon. gentleman also spoke about modernizing the criminal procedure. Let me say that there is nothing so modern, so desired or so &#x201C;with it&#x201D; as the confidence in the security which each individual has today under the law, where his rights are determined by evidence, facts, and not by his answers to legal questions.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one other point in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech before I deal with other aspects of this Bill. He talked about inviting me and my colleagues on this side to go and see the officials in his department who drafted the Bill. I want to say that the situation is not as described by the hon. the Minister on Wednesday during question time in this House. Arising out of a question by the hon. member for Musgrave, there was a question related to whether or not the representations made in respect of a draft Bill similar to this one, which was published in December, 1971, would be made available to Parliament. The hon. the Minister replied that there was so much material involved that it would be impossible to do that. I then asked whether we could go and have a look at it, to which the hon. the Minister replied: &#x201C;Yes, I have invited you to do so before.&#x201D; Just for the record I want to &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>You will find it in Hansard. The hon. the Minister will recall that I asked for a White Paper on this Bill. He said that the official concerned was available and that I had his permission to see him about the Bill. It concerned the Bill only. I want to say that, as a result of that conversation, we were able to get from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s official a cross-reference indicating how the clauses of the Bill are related to the existing sections of the Act and vice versa. That is the situation. We are quite capable, as we always have been, of reading the Bill for ourselves. The hon. the Minister gives me the impression that he is somewhat hurt that we did not go and talk to the officials about the Bill.</p>

<p>As I have indicated already, and as is quite clear, this Bill makes the most radical changes to our system of justice. It is proposed summarily to abolish the tested, proved and accepted basis on which the rights of the citizens and their relationship with the State, with the arm of the law, have been regulated throughout the lifetime certainly of most of us. The document that we have before us today is not a Bill which only deals with criminals, or only <span class="col_4479-4480" refersTo="page_0793"/>with terrorists or saboteurs, but a Bill which deals with the ordinary law which has been tempered by the fires of our experience, of our compassion, of our history and by our innate sense of justice and order. What is in the existing Act is part of us; it has grown out of a respect for the judicial process as we have known it over centuries. It is kindled by the knowledge of the public that there can be no doubt that citizens dealt with by the courts are dealt with in accordance with standards that ensure for them, each individual, the security that they can feel safe and that the system will be there to protect them.</p>

<p>Not only do we have objections to the contents of this Bill, but I want to say that we also object to the manner in which such an important measure has been thrown before the public and the attitude of this Government to Parliament itself in regard to this Bill. What in fact has happened here&#x003F; Where did all this begin&#x003F; It began when Mr. Justice Hiemstra proposed, to me, some radical, presposterous changes of the existing criminal procedure. There was a storm in the legal world about this and there were all sorts of answers and all sorts of stirrings. The hon. the Minister, instead of rejecting the idea apparently the hon. the Minister did not know whether he accepted this or whether he did not accept it&#x2014;did not indicate that he as Minister of Justice and the Government did not accept the Hiemstra proposals &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>One of the bases on which he rejected it, was that it seeked to marry the inquisitorial system with the accusatorial system, as indeed this Bill proposes to do in some respects. But, Sir, as a result of that report, a draft Bill was published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> on the 10 th December, 1971, incorporating the recommendations of the Botha Commission, and this was published for general information. In fact, what the <i>Gazette</i> said, was that any person desiring to offer any comment on the Bill or submit representations, was invited to do so to the Secretary for Justice. I might say that this was done by a number of people, some of whom had given evidence before the Botha Commission. Other people who had given evidence before the commission obviously felt it was not necessary to give any further comment on the Bill. But, Sir, all that this was, was a draft incorporating the suggestions and recommendations which Botha, J.A., made to this Government. I may say, at the time I was asked to comment on this Bill. I said that there was no point in commenting. This was just a draft flowing from the findings of the Botha Commission. It was not suggested legislation by the <span class="col_4481-4482" refersTo="page_0794"/>Government, it was merely a draft, merely a recommendation to the Government &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and when the Government decided what Bill it wanted to produce, it would produce it in the fullness of time, if it wanted to, and then we would know what the Government&#x2019;s proposals were. That came suddenly to the public. The Government&#x2019;s intention as to which of those recommendations it would accept, was made known to the public when this Bill was published a couple of weeks ago in this House. That was the first time the public had any knowledge of what the Government&#x2019;s intention was in this regard. I think it is, to say the very least of it and using the most temperate language I can, both inconsiderate and objectionable in that the Government, in attempting to change a statute of so fundamental a nature as this, gives something like three weeks&#x2019; notice from the time that the Government&#x2019;s intentions are known to the time that we in this House debate whether or not Parliament will accept the principles contained in the Bill. At any rate, there is no hurry. One wonders why the hon. the Minister is in this hurry. The system we have is working perfectly well. But since then we have made our position clear, as the hon. the Minister has indicated. We have fundamental objections to this Bill, and it should be referred to a Select Committee before the Second Reading&#x2014;that is to say, before any principle in this Bill is agreed to by Parliament. In other words, we want this Bill sent to a select committee&#x2014;I shall deal with this in more detail in a moment&#x2014;before Parliament decides to accept one principle of the Bill.</p>

<p>What happened thereafter&#x003F; The General Council of the Bar of South Africa produced a document, copies of which were sent to the hon. the Minister, hon. members on the Government side, hon. members on this side and to the Press. I want to say that the General Council of the Bar is the united body of all the Bar Councils&#x2014; that is, the advocates councils throughout the country. It represents them all, and it never utters its opinion unless it speaks unanimously for every constituent Bar Council on that General Council of the Bar.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It is the unanimous view of the General Council of all the Bars. That hon. gentleman must make himself more <i>au fait</i> with his own profession. This document I have referred to, condemns the main principles contained in this Bill.</p>

<p>Thereafter there was a statement which has not appeared in the newspapers, a statement issue by the Incorporated Law Society of Natal. That statement was apparently handed to Sapa. In that statement they indicate publicly that they reject those main portions of this Bill which form its principle. What they do also is to point out what the Association of Law Societies had to say in this regard. The Association of Law Societies, representing the attorneys, again, like the General Council of the Bar, does not speak unless it speaks with one voice on behalf of all the constituent associations. That association made its representations in regard to this Bill, in regard to the main principles which are still in the Bill, and they still have those fundamental objections to it.</p>

<p>This is surely an accentuation of the request which we make, and that is that this Bill should go to a Select Committee so that not just the Opposition, but Parliament can examine the views of such important authoritative legal bodies as the General <span class="col_4483-4484" refersTo="page_0795"/>Council of the Bar and the Association of Law Societies of South Africa. The manner in which Parliament can apprise itself of this is through the system of our select committees. A Select Committee will be able to hear the views not only of these bodies but also of our judges, because we have here the opinion and the view of one judge. A Select Committee could hear the views of the Bar, of the Police and of all the persons who are associated with the administration of justice. It could, for instance, hear the views of the attorney-general. It is clear from the report of Mr. Justice Botha that even amongst them there is some difference of opinion in respect of some matters. What we have here is a Bill reflecting the view of one judge only, and the hon. the Minister feels bound by it.</p>

<p>Sir, to cap it all, what do we have here today&#x003F; We have an Order Paper in which there are 13 amendments to this Bill. We did not get this a week ago or two weeks ago and, after all, this Government has been considering this measure for a long time. It published the Bill for general information more than a year ago. But today, when we debate the Second Reading, we find that there are 13 amendments on the Order Paper, and I may say that one of them is of a fundamental nature. One of them removes the objection which was made by the General Council of the Bar as to the provision that if you do not immediately say that you wish to raise an alibi, you may be prevented from giving evidence of an alibi to the court later. That provision is going to be scrapped, and we are entitled to deal with the Bill on the basis of these amendments. Sir, how can the hon. the Minister pretend that he is in a position to deal with this Bill or that Parliament is in a position to deal with this Bill when at this stage we start getting fundamental amendments of this nature as the result of representations which have been made&#x003F; Sir, I think the time has come to stop and think about this Bill. I think the hon. the Minister should seriously consider discharging this Bill from the Order Paper. The Order for the Second Reading should be discharged and the Bill referred to a Select Committee. Sir, what is the fundamental change that we have in this Bill&#x003F; What is the situation that we now have&#x003F; We have the position that if there is a suggestion that anyone has committed an offence, the matter is invested by the Police; if there is sufficient information the man is accused; he is arrested, if necessary, and charged. That is to say, he is told precisely what he is accused of and what the position is. He is then asked to plead whether he is guilty or not guilty. If he says he is guilty and if, in the opinion of the magistrate, he would only be subject to a fine of R50 or less, then the magistrate can sentence him to a fine of less than R50. But if he thinks that he will be fined more than R50, or some other punishment, imprisonment or a whipping, the rule, the evidence <i>aliunde</i> rule, is that you cannot convict him and sentence him unless you lead evidence, because the court should be in a position, when it sentences someone to imprisonment without the option of a fine, or to some serious sentence, to know what the facts are. And that has been our law for as long as most of us can remember, and quite rightly and quite properly so. And if you plead not guilty you join issue with the State and say: You must now prove your case against me; and there is no obligation on the person accused to take part in the procedure unless he wants to take part in it. The State must then put its case. It is proposed now to change this time-honoured system for a brand new one, the brain child of one judge of appeal. In terms of clause 112 of this Bill, if a person pleads guilty it is no longer necessary, if the magistrate thinks he can sentence him to some sentence of more than R50&#x2014;in other words to imprisonment&#x2014;for him anymore to hear evidence <i>aliunde.</i> In fact, if he thinks that his own jurisdiction is not enough for the sort of sentence he thinks the person deserves, he can remit the case to a regional court where he could get up to three years&#x2019; imprisonment; and in terms of this Bill the regional court may sentence this man without hearing any evidence, if it pleases. It is quite true that the regional court magistrate, as the hon. the Minister has mentioned in his speech, may call for evidence, but the fact of the matter is that he need not. The fact of the matter is that I do not think it is possible for anyone to sentence a person in respect of an offence of that nature without hearing evidence.</p>

<p>I will tell the hon. member what this Bill says about people charged with murder but I hope <span class="col_4487-4488" refersTo="page_0797"/>that before that hon. member speaks he will ask his colleagues what in fact does happen in the Supreme Court. Then he will be in a better position to talk about the Bill. Sir, sentence, whether somebody is guilty or not, is itself a difficult task but it is by no means difficult compared with the task of sentencing a person. Sir, how do you sentence a person without hearing the evidence&#x003F; I want to make a prediction, that because the court can call for evidence, the court will call for evidence. It will ask the prosecutor to present evidence. What will then happen&#x003F; You will have the situation where there will be a further delay and a further adjournment. What will you have achieved&#x003F; You will not have saved any time; you will not have modernized anything. You will have the situation where the regional magistrate is going to say: &#x201C;I want to hear evidence; I am not prepared to sentence the accused on a series of questions and answers which came to me from the magistrate who has examined him in the court below.&#x201D; The regional magistrate is going to say: &#x201C;I am not prepared even to think of sentencing the accused in respect of my jurisdiction which is three years imprisonment, without the option of a fine, if I choose, without hearing evidence.&#x201D; That is what is going to happen and I want to tell the hon. the Minister that as I know the regional magistrates of this country, that is what they will insist on.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister something else too. As I know the courts of this country, if they do not do it, they will be told by the Supreme Court that they ought to do it. Can you imagine how many cases like this are going to go on review&#x003F; Of course, they all have to, where the fine is more than a certain amount or where imprisonment without the option of a fine is imposed. They all go on automatic review to the Supreme Court anyway.</p>

<p>What is going to happen&#x003F; What form of question is going to be put&#x003F; How is each magistrate going to explain the elements of each offence in all the circumstances which arise&#x003F; If there are a thousand magistrates, there are going to be a thousand different explanations.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Is he going to put to the accused all the defences which are available to him&#x003F; He does not have to in terms of the Bill. The defences available to an accused are part of the elements of the offence. Let me give an example. If a man is charged with theft, what is he going to be asked&#x003F; Is he going to be asked whether he did take it, whether he had the right to take it, whether the plaintiff was the owner or whether the accused himself was the owner&#x003F; Is he going to be asked whether he has a claim of right&#x003F; Is he going to be asked whether he thought that the owner would given him permission&#x003F; Are all these things going to be put to the accused or are they not&#x003F; Neither I nor anyone else can answer this, because it all depends entirely on the magistrate, on the circumstances and on the place. This is going to lead to more delays and more misunderstanding of the law than anything the present system could possibly ever lead to.</p>

<p>It is so simple. What do you do now&#x003F; You now charge a man and he says that he pleads guilty. The magistrate then says that he thinks the accused will get a bigger sentence. The accused&#x2019;s record is produced and the prosecutor then calls a witness. The witness comes along and says: &#x201C;Yes, that is my coat and nobody is entitled to have my coat. I identify my coat.&#x201D; The accused then asks whatever questions he wants. Then a policeman is probably called and he states that he found the accused in possession of the particular coat. The accused then gives his explanation and the case is over. That case goes on review and justice is done and it is seen to be done and, more important than anything else, the person who is in that dock is satisfied as to what it is that he has done and as to why it is that he is being punished.</p>

<p>The persons who are going to be affected by this are going to be the great majority of the people in this country, namely the Bantu people. They are going to be unrepresented, almost exclusively, as is the position at the moment. This is going to lead to further difficulty, because on a plea of &#x201C;guilty&#x201D; he has to answer not just questions of fact; he has to answer questions of law.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the time involved in all this, when it could all be sorted out by leading evidence, when there is no doubt whatsoever as to what the facts are and as to whether the offence has been committed or not&#x003F; If you plead not guilty, you have the procedure which is prescribed in clause 119. The hon. the Minister says that this is not inquisitorial, but what happens&#x003F; I quote clause 119(1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where an accused &#x2026; pleads not guilty to the offence charged, the accused shall be asked by the magistrate &#x2026;</block>

<p>He must be asked by the magistrate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; whether he wishes to tender any explanation of his attitude in relation to the charge &#x2026;</block>

<p>He has already said that he is not guilty, but that is not enough, according to the Minister; he must now be asked whether he wants to tender an explanation of his attitude in relation to the charge. He has already indicated his attitude in relation to the charge. He has said: &#x201C;I plea not guilty and I join issue.&#x201D; Whether he does answer that or whether he does not, he is then to be asked whether he wishes to make any statement indicating the basis of his defence. This means although he has not had the evidence yet, he is being asked to indicate what the basis of his defence will be. Thirdly he is asked whether he wishes to say anything else in relation to the charge for the information of the magistrate or the trial court. Is that not a marvellous situation&#x003F; What a lot of nonsense! For the purpose of the issues that have been joined by his plea of not guilty, by the issue of whether he is guilty or not guilty, he has to give this indication for the information of the magistrate or trial court. He is then to be asked whether he wishes to make a statement that he has been induced by duress or otherwise to make any statement there might be. He is not being quizzed, according to the Minister; it is not inquisitorial. He is just going to be asked.</p>

<p>Once again, there are four questions. If there are a thousand magistrates, the questions are going to be asked in a thousand different ways, and it is going to have a million different reactions because a million people will be affected by it. The reaction of the magistrate to the person who answers that question will depend upon many things and all the various gifts or lack of such gifts which the magistrate has. This depends upon whether he regards the answer as inadequate to him or as this or as that. There are different interpretations which they are just not dreaming up and which are not theoretical because I have seen it happen in court as any other practitioner has seen. That is not enough. Then he has to be further interrogated. The magistrate then shall inquire from the accused whether the plea of not guilty is intended to place in issue all the elements of the charge and all the acts or omissions on which the charge is based in so far as such acts or omissions are apparent from the charge, or whether the plea is intended to place in issue only certain of such elements or certain of such acts or omissions.</p>

<p>Do I have to go very much further than just to look at that to believe that this process has to occur in every case in which the accused pleads not guilty and where he is likely to be fined more than just an amount of R50&#x003F; Can hon. members believe that this is going to take place on every occasion&#x003F; Can hon. members imagine the time that will be involved&#x003F; Can hon. members understand what a lot of nonsense this is&#x003F; This is done although we have a system which is centuries old and which has been tried and tested in our own country for 100 years. When you say to a man what the charge against him is and you ask him whether he pleads guilty or not guilty, and he says &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D;, you say to him that the issue is joined and that the State will call evidence. In most of these cases the evidence is going to be that of one witness and possibly two. It will then all be over in ten minutes, as it is at the moment.</p>

<p>This procedure, however, has to apply <span class="col_4491-4492" refersTo="page_0799"/>in every case, and I do not know whether we have the magistrates, nor do I know whether the magistrates would have the patience&#x2014;even though we know that they are very patient&#x2014;to go through this whole nonsensical rigmarole when we have a perfectly good and just system at present. Under the present system cases such as that by and large will go on automatic review, and there the Judge can see what has happened. Then the accused knows what has happened, what the facts are and then the matter is disposed of in accordance with justice.</p>

<p>There is another very fundamental objection to all this, namely that the procedure here prescribed provides that the magistrate should himself interrogate the accused.</p>

<p>Call it what you like; if I call it an interrogation, I am not incorrect. I want to say that it is most undesirable, it is against all our traditions and it will lead to great and grave misunderstanding if the judicial officer is obliged to take part in such an interrogation. As one of the Judges of Appeal said once in respect of the conduct of another Judge in the court below, &#x201C;The Judge should not enter the arena lest the dust of the conflict might affect his vision.&#x201D; I think that is precisely the case here. He should not in any way be associated with the prosecution. His traditional role is that of an impartial arbiter. I want to say that there is nothing that makes one more proud, when one is having to defend South Africa against all sorts of claims, than to say: &#x201C;Look at our judicial system; look at our legal system, our system of criminal procedure.&#x201D; Look at it! Look at what this Government is trying to do to it! We are asking the magistrate to take off his impartial robes and climb down into the arena in a procedure specifically designed to make the accused say things prejudicial to himself as soon as possible. The hon. the Minister will not deny that that is in fact what this is designed to do. The whole tenor of his speech was that the accused is getting away with too much that he should not get away with. In that procedure, which is designed to get the accused to say things which are prejudicial to himself as early as possible, the person we use to do it is the magistrate who in the very same trial, having carried out this interrogation, puts on his robe of impartial arbiter again and hears the rest of the evidence. This is not only not desirable, but it will not be understood by the general body of the people of South Africa, and especially the Black people.</p>

<p>I want to say that in the overwhelming number of undefended cases in the magistrates&#x2019; courts, the Supreme Court or wherever it may be, the court assumes the role of independent arbiter and it assumes the role of defence counsel, almost, in that, when the accused is unrepresented, the court sees to it that the accused&#x2019;s rights are in fact protected in accordance with the law. They do it all the time as one knows from experience. That is no longer to be the case. That person whose role traditionally and properly that was, has now to interrogate the accused in order to get him to say something prejudical to himself. It is no good pretending that that is not in fact what this system means.</p>

<p>Of course that is what this system is. What else is it designed for&#x003F; Why have we changed it&#x003F; Did you not listen to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech&#x003F; This was the whole tenor of his speech. Have you thought about why we now get this Bill&#x003F; You should have listened to the Minister. We are having it because we want to weigh the scales more heavily in favour of the State and less heavily in favour of the accused. We want to do it because they seem to be doing something like it in England, or because in England they want to do something like it. This is even worse. If <span class="col_4493-4494" refersTo="page_0800"/>you are charged with murder, or a serious offence in respect of which the Supreme Court, where you will go for your trial has jurisdiction, you go to the magistrate&#x2019;s court. You go to the magistrate&#x2019;s court and you have to plead in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. You go through your quizzing process and whatever admissions you make are recorded there in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. That is evidence, incontrovertible evidence, unless it is improperly recorded, in the Supreme Court where you are to have your trial.</p>

<p>This is an extraordinary situation that the court that tries you, and the law provides that only the Supreme Court can try you in cases of murder, does not hear your plea. That court does not ask you the question. It is asked somewhere else and it is all part of the evidence in that Supreme Court. This is not sound. The other aspect that arises from this is that we have a tradition in South Africa, a very good practice, that in every case where an accused is charged with an offence in respect of which the death sentence is competent <i>pro Deo</i> counsel is appointed from the local Bar to defend him. That counsel&#x2019;s fees are paid for by the State and it is a very good rule. It is felt that where somebody faces the death sentence he ought to have the assistance of an advocate and that is quite right. What happens here&#x003F; The same man is accused of murder, he comes before the magistrate and there he is interrogated. He can, figuratively speaking, hang himself in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. He does not have to go to the Supreme Court.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>He has always been able to make a confession, but it has never been the case that when he comes before court he is told &#x201C;Right, you say you are not guilty; now tell me this and tell me that &#x2026;&#x201D; That has never been the law. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, if he accepts this proposal, whether he is going to provide that there is going to be <i>pro Deo</i> counsel for a man in the magistrates&#x2019; courts, because it is very much a part of his trial. In fact, it is the most important part of his trial now because we have now produced a system which is designed to ensure that he makes prejudicial statements as early as possible when he goes to court. Let me say in all earnestness and sincerity that justice is not a set of rules, or questions or elements or of offences; it is in our tradition the judgment of human beings in accordance with the rules, procedures and evidence. Their cases are tried by other human beings with a knowledge of the law, with compassion and with experience of life, looking at the evidence of that particular person&#x2019;s circumstances. The circumstances of every single individual in this world are different and need different attention and need to be examined because of their unique nature. There is no case in the world in which anyone in this House has ever appeared which is exactly the same as any other case, nor is there one person in the world that is exactly the same as anyone else. This is justice and that is what the system has produced over the centuries, because the examination of the evidence indicates to you what has happened, what kind of person it is, the circumstances in which he found himself, and so on. This Bill seeks to take that humanity and that justice out of justice by substituting for the facts and for the judgment of human beings a series of questions and answers which prove elements. It is like playing on a computer and justice is not a computer system. It is the evidence in each case which tells its own story. I have indicated that it is in any event an attempt to combine the inquisitorial system with the accusatorial system.</p>

<p>I do not have much time, but I would like to say one or two words about preparatory examinations. There is no doubt whatever that there is a case to be made out for the abolition of preparatory examinations. There is, after all, in our law provision for a protracted examination, which is adjourned from time to time because of the investigation necessary in the case, in order that the accused and the Supreme Court should know what the case is against the accused, and so that the accused knows what case he has to meet. I think the case has been made that this sytem is not necessary, provided that there is some other system that will follow it. But this Bill provides no substitute for a preparatory examination system; nor can it be the excuse for the abolition of preparatory examinations. The system here proposed does not apply in cases that will go to the Supreme Court, where before one would have had to have a preparatory examination. It applies in every single case whether you are charged with petty theft or murder.</p>

<p>There are a number of other matters in this Bill which are going to be dealt with. <span class="col_4495-4496" refersTo="page_0801"/>They are important matters, for instance, concerning the detention of witnesses and the mental capacity of persons to understand proceedings. They also concern something that will affect more people than I think the hon. gentlemen over there realize, and that is the motorists. I refer to the sort of summons they are likely to receive and the sort of results that it is likely to produce, so far as their appearance in court is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Botha quite rightly indicated in his report that the standard of civilization of a people is measured by the sort of criminal procedure that it provides for the maintenance of its <i>order.</i> That is what we are dealing with today. Against that test we are now holding up something as showing what form of civilization we have in this country. We have been proud up to now to show what we have. I hope that we are not going to pass the Bill in its present form. I do not believe that we can with confidence or with safety discharge our duty as members of Parliament, elected to exercise our judgment in making the country&#x2019;s laws, by destroying institutions which have been part of our heritage and outlook, part of our pride of South Africa. By this Bill we may be judged. I therefore wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Order for the Second Reading of the <i>Criminal Procedure Bill</i> be discharged and the subject of the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers and to have leave to bring up an amended Bill.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since I do not, like the hon. member for Durban North, have the privilege of the hour, I can only reply briefly to what he had to say. I want to deal at once with the question of whether this Bill contains any elements which may be termed inquisitorial. I want to deny emphatically that this is the position. I maintain that the hon. member for Durban North did not do his homework; for a system which is inquisitorial, for example, the French system &#x2014;I shall come back to this in a moment&#x2014; has an in-built system of pre-trial interrogation, and a system in terms of which the judicial officer may in actual fact also ask questions which force an accused person to make certain admissions in regard to facts and evidence. This has not been built into this Bill at all. In other words, there is to my mind a specific definition of interrogation. This does not mean only the asking of questions; it means that a person is driven to a point where he makes certain admissions, as occurs in an inquisitorial system.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North made a great point of the fact that the hon. the Minister does not want to consent to a Select Committee being appointed. He says that we as a House of Assembly, as a legislature, have to decide on the word of a single judge of appeal whether this Bill is good enough. But, Sir, surely that is not the position. I shall go into the entire history of the matter in a moment, but the position is that an hon. judge of appeal sent a draft Bill, via the department, to all parties that could possibly be interested in an alteration of our criminal procedure. Comment was received from all possible parties and, as the hon. the Minister said, no single objection in principle was raised in the case of any judge-president, magistrate&#x2019;s office or university. What is more, the hon. judge eventually submitted a report, a well-motivated report dealing with all the arguments for and against the matter. I maintain that this report of the hon. judge is just as good as, if not better than, the English Criminal Law Revision Committee&#x2019;s report, and this English Committee consisted of upwards of 14 members. I maintain that the work done by this hon. judge of appeal was just as good, if not better.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I am speaking on behalf of every one on this side of the House when I convey my gratitude and appreciation to the hon. Judge of Appeal, D. H. Botha, sole member and chairman of the commission which was responsible for the brilliant report on our criminal procedure and evidence which was published during 1971, and for the draft legislation which is now before us and which was based on that report. But I want to go further. In this connection I should also like to mention, on behalf of this side of the House and the Justice group on this side, the name of Advocate D. D. van Niekerk, S.C., who played an enormous part in the activities of the commission and the drafting of the Bill before us. I also want to thank Mr. W. P. Theron, the secretary of the commission. I think Mr. Theron must have had the patience of Job to have correlated all the memoranda and suggestions <span class="col_4497-4498" refersTo="page_0802"/>submitted to the commission. To the hon. judge of appeal and his two able assistants I want to say: Not only have you submitted to us an excellent, practical Bill, you have also accomplished much in the cultural-juristic field. As a former Chief Justice, L. C. Steyn, and the late Judge of Appeal, Toon van den Heever, and so many others, revived pure Roman Dutch legal principles in our common law, so you are now giving us criminal procedure legislation which differs so fundamentally from the Anglo-Saxon trial methods that we may with justification be proud of our own criminal procedure legislation, which is excellently suited to our purpose in our own country.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, this side of the House is not narrow-minded and ungrateful. We are grateful to the English law, particularly in the field of commercial law, criminal procedure and the law of evidence, for these having enriched our own law to such an extent. To tell the truth, although our ways part on certain fundamental principles, we think so much of the new tendencies in the English criminal procedure that we have already incorporated these again in this draft legislation.</p>

<p>A person who also deserves our thanks, is the hon. Mr. Justice V. G. Hiemstra, an expert on our criminal law and criminal procedure. Although his system of pretrial interrogation has not been accepted, it was, <i>inter alia</i> his insistence on change which set the ball rolling. Sir, now I do want to emphasize this. It was not a wicked official in the Department of Justice who wanted to load the scales against the accused and who drew up this draft legislation; it was an objective jurist in the person of the hon. Mr. Justice Hiemstra who initiated all this, with the publication to certain articles in the <i>South African Law Journal.</i> His first article, viz. &#x201C;Abolition of the right not to be questioned&#x201D; appeared in the <i>South African Law Journal,</i> Vol. 80 of 1963. In this first article the hon. Judge made quite a few thought-stimulating statements, and quoted statistics. For example, I am quoting the following extracts from what he had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not primarily a heavy penalty which deters the offender. It is the certainty of arrest and the certainty of conviction which stays his hand. Our C.I.D. is among the best in the world, but the judicial side of law enforcement fails them too often. We acquit too many people who are not as noble as the principles behind which they shelter themselves.</block>

<p>Sir, this is not an eccentric statement by a South African jurist. It is borne out by the fact that the English Law Revision Committee states as follows, on page 12 of its eleventh report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There has also been a good deal of feeling in the committee and elsewhere that the law of evidence should now be less tender to criminals generally.</block>

<p>It is generally accepted, Sir, that this is the position. What is also interesting is that Mr. Justice Hiemstra then quoted from his own criminal court the case of the <i>State v. Douglas Ntuli and Moses Silo.</i> He then furnished the following particulars, and we would do well to take note of this. The charge was murder. The accused remained in custody for 7&#x00BD; months, from the date of arrest to the date of sentence. During this period the accused appeared in court for a period of three days for a preparatory examination. Subsequently, for his trial in the Supreme Court, he spent five days in court. He was in custody for 74 months. The judge then went on to point out that the preparatory examination of the accused and the trial took up more than 40 working days of highly skilled and skilled people. Mr. Speaker, these facts which I have just quoted from the article written by Mr. Justice Hiemstra reflect the principal reason why new legislation is necessary. The first reason is that the scales of justice affecting the State and the accused should be brought into better equilibrium, an opinion which is being voiced throughout the entire Western world today. Secondly, without detracting from justice and efficiency, more rapid methods of trial have to be found. This has, at once, the great advantage that the accused is sentenced or acquitted sooner. Sir, after his first article a Bill containing his suggestions was circulated. It is interesting to note that Mr. Justice Hiemstra pointed out in his second article, which appeared in 1965 in the <i>South African Law Journal,</i> Vol. 82, that two-thirds of those who reacted were prepared to accept the principle of pre-trial interrogation of the accused, subject, however, to certain inbuilt protection.</p>

<p>But, Sir, to return to the Botha report. In the first place the amount of evidence was imposing. Five divisions of the supreme <span class="col_4499-4500" refersTo="page_0803"/>court submitted memoranda. Seven judges, as well as six State departments and seven attorneys-general, submitted memoranda. In addition, approximately 35 other persons and bodies submitted memoranda, among which were legal practitioners and universities. After very thorough consideration, with the help of highly qualified staff, as I have already indicated, the judge and the commission submitted an excellent report to the Ministry in question, and as far as I am concerned, the principle recommendation contains a brilliant compromise between the proposed pre-trial interrogation of Mr. Justice Hiemstra, and the existing system. It is very definitely not suggesting an inquisitorial system, for there is definitely no pre-trial interrogation. There is no pre-trial interrogator, as in the French system, as I have already mentioned, nor is there any question whatsoever, as in the French system, of the trial judge also participating in the actual interrogation on questions of evidence, etc. Clause 119, which is the essence and the heart of this Bill, merely states that on a plea of not guilty, the accused may state his side of the case. If he should not do so, or if the issues are not clear, the magistrate may, and in some cases must, ask the accused whether his plea of not guilty amounts to a denial of all the elements of the crime and whether he wants to have the elements which are not at issue recorded as admissions. What does clause 119 amount to&#x003F; Clause 119 corresponds fundamentally to the exchange of pleadings in a civil action, and what is wrong with that&#x003F; I am not one to maintain that clause 119 as it stands there is infallible, this clause is very definitely an experimental one and we will, as we proceed, have to work on it and if necessary effect improvements. But why should we now be so inflexible in our thinking as the United Party and not wish to venture into new territory&#x003F; According to <i>Die Burger</i> of 13th December, 1971, Prof. Dr. S. A. Strauss had the following to say about this new fundamental principle in the report of the Bill. He said it would expedite criminal cases considerably, while the rights of the individual continue to remain completely unaffected. The accused is at all times entitled to legal advice, and he may also elect to remain silent when he appears before a magistrate. Sir, not only does the report and the Bill strike a good balance of justice as far as the essential points are concerned, but certain recommendations also emphasize the commission&#x2019;s absolute objectivity in respect of the accused, for it still leans over backwards to protect the accused. I just want to mention a few striking examples of this. In the first place the commission recommends that the proviso to section 244 should continue to exist. This means that we are, to my knowledge, the only country in the world where a confession to a policeman, who is not a peace officer, is inadmissible as evidence. We are the only country in the world, Sir. What happens now to the inquisition charge&#x003F; It is in fact true that the proposed legislation now shifts the onus if an accused should allege that an admissible confession was obtained for him in an improper manner, but this is very fair, and cannot be faulted.</p>

<p>I come now to the ouestion of police-dog evidence&#x2014;spelt with a hyphen&#x2014;because I do not mean that a dog can actually give evidence. This commission states that this type of evidence should remain inadmissible. I agree with that, but in 19 states of America it is admissible evidence. Once again, under our particular circumstances&#x2014;I am thinking of cases of cattle theft&#x2014;this is a tremendous protection for the accused. I am thinking for example of the new section 329, in terms of which the Minister may on behalf of a person who has been sentenced to death apply for leave to appeal if that person has not done so himself within the prescribed period. In terms of developments in the past few years, this is a tremendous improvement on our legal system, and affords protection for the accused. I am thinking of the amendment of section 215<i>bis,</i> in which provision is now being made that detention as envisaged under the section should take place under judicial control, once again tremendous protection for an accused person.</p>

<p>Then I want to deviate a little, and I really think it is necessary for us to place this on record as well and to state, for the information of the general public, that the commission also made an in-depth study of the trapping system, and that the commission arrived at the considered opinion, after a very intensive study of the entire matter, that the Police are not abusing this system, and that the Police may consequently continue with this system because accused and suspected persons are not being wronged by this system. I just feel I should mention this, for the newspapers are for most of the time placing the effect of the system under a tremendous cloud with their sensational newspaper reports.</p>

<p><span class="col_4501-4502" refersTo="page_0804"/>The General Bar Council complained and said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposed changes contain features of an inquisitorial system.</block>

<p>I have already dealt with that and pointed out that this is not the case, and that it is unscientific to say that it is in any way the case that this system contains any measure of inquisitorial elements. However, I want to cross swords with the General Bar Council in regard to a few other points.</p>

<block name="quote">Regrettably the Bill is to a large extent a continuation of a process which has made substantial inroads upon principles which have long been accepted in the criminal law systems of numerous Western countries and in our view are essential to ensure that accused persons have a fair trial and that the possibilities of miscarriage of justice taking place are minimized.</block>

<p>The difference between this side and that side of the House is that this side keeps itself constantly informed of the latest developments.</p>

<p>I maintain that since a body such as the General Bar Council should have studied this Bill in a scientific way and should have made objections to the provisions on legal grounds, it is reprehensible that they should in this way have wanted to intrude purely political considerations and have made charges which could only be extremely detrimental to us and our legal system abroad.</p>

<p>I come next to the question&#x2014;after that I want to resume my seat&#x2014;of the objection of the Bar Council to preparatory examinations. There again, in my opinion, they proceeded very unscientifically. They quoted a long article in which a case was made out for the abolition of preparatory examinations. This article was compiled at the time by a certain Mr. Greeff, who was then Secretary for Justice. To that article they attached another memorandum which was opposed to this and which contained old, hackneyed arguments. I want to say to the Bar Council that, as they justifiably stated in their memorandum, the system of preparatory examinations have served us well for a hundred years and more. I also want to say to the Bar Council, and I want to say this to the United Party as well, that the ox wagon also served us well for 300 years, but we nevertheless saw fit to exchange the ox wagon for more modem means of transportation. There are a number of the advocates who said that preparatory examinations should remain, but we are not abolishing this. The provision is going to remain. But I want to predict that that section in question will fall away owing to disuse. If we have already, in anticipation, introduced a system of summary trials, if we know that this is a success, if our administration of justice and our judges in general indicate that they are in favour of the abolition of the system, if it is obvious that it will be conducive to shorter trials and that it will save time and money, why should we then continue to cling desperately to that system&#x003F;</p>

<p>I shall resume my seat after I have said that the Botha report and the draft legislation was well thought out, that it was well drawn up, that it was well motivated, and that it affords us legislation which is going to be our own proud legislation. It is going to be our own proud system, and we are, with energy and imagination, going to expand it into an excellent system in the years which lie ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there can be nobody in this House who is not under the realization that a change in our law of criminal procedure is a most <span class="col_4503-4504" refersTo="page_0805"/>important one for the country. It has been said that peace goes hand in hand with justice. I think the words of the Psalm are: &#x201C;Geregtigheid en vrede kus mekaar.&#x201D; This is a very direct form of justice that is ministered to the people by our legal system. Therefore, in our country above all, it is important. We have perhaps a higher proportion of people per head of population who are brought to our courts than in most countries in the world. We have peculiar difficulties, we have population groups at very different stages of development. Partly this has resulted in a very large number of people being brought to the courts. These people are in many cases foreign to the system which we employ. It is therefore of obvious importance that the system of our criminal courts and its procedures should be of the fairest, and should carry conviction with the people that justice will be done and that it should gain and maintain their confidence. Every member in this House prides himself on our system of justice and our law, and prides himself on our court procedures and the conduct of our judicial officers, whether they be judges or magistrates. This has meant a great deal to the stability of South Africa in the past. I will immediately concede that I am convinced that it is the wish of everyone in this House that this should continue. I believe, indeed, that the hon. the Minister and his side in coming with this Bill wish to do nothing to harm that structure, but I feel entirely unhappy at the result of their labours because it is certainly my opinion that it will do considerable harm to that structure, to our administration of justice. Let us concede, too, that we as lawyers tend to be conservative. I think it is most important that we should certainly not become petrified and unwilling to make a move. I, myself, am quite prepared to embrace the words of a leading member of the Canadian Bar, Mr. Wright, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Courage, common sense and sanity enough to retain the proved values of the past while recognizing the practical needs of the present, are essential. Time will prove whether of the law it can be said it gave too little and too late.</block>

<p>With that one can certainly agree. However, having said all that, I want to say that I am still extremely unhappy about this Bill. [Interjections.] I believe we are losing a golden opportunity; our law in many respects is very badly in need of updating and modernization and we, as lawyers, all hoped that the Government would achieve the necessary improvements. I personally think it was an intolerable burden to place upon one man, however good, and I have no <span class="col_4505-4506" refersTo="page_0806"/>doubt that he acted from the highest motives. But it is an intolerable burden to place upon one man, the task of virtually reviewing and suggesting amendments to our entire criminal law procedure and evidence, because that is what the terms of reference amounted to. He has been asked to do that and, more over, he has attempted to do this task in approximately one year. I think he started his work in July, 1970, and he reported on the 29th May, 1971. During this time he attempted single-handed to review our entire criminal procedures. The Bill the Government brought forward following his recommendations in his report, was published in about December, 1971. The hon. the Minister has told us&#x2014;and we know this&#x2014;that this Bill was brought up for information and comment. But what must be remembered is that the main people who sent in memoranda and comment addressed themselves primarily to the Hiemstra proposals. It was entirely to this question that they directed their attention. It has not been made public exactly what the attitude of all those people is, but it is quite clear that those people were overwhelmingly against the proposal of Mr. Justice Hiemstra, which has become the cornerstone of this Bill. It is quite plain that they rejected it and the commission rejected it. The particular procedure which the commission accepted and recommended is one which has been subjected to extremely little public scrutiny; it has not been carefully weighed. It could not be carefully weighed by the commission because there was only one man; it could not be discussed there. It has been subjected to very little scrutiny since then. The hon. the Minister in dealing with this matter indicated that there had not been much criticism although the Bill had been published for information. But there was also no approval of any extensive kind. We have had most strong condemnation and criticism from the General Council of the Bar, from the law societies and from several judges. We know that in several cases their opinions are completely inconsistent with the final proposals.</p>

<p>Let me just pause here a moment to deal with the General Council of the Bar. The hon. member for Kroonstad directed a most violent and unjustified attack against this body. The General Council of the Bar is an entirely non-political body. It has shown this time and time again. It studiously refrains taking sides in politics. Yet the General Council of the Bar represents every practising advocate in South Africa. I do not know its political composition, but at a rough guess it must certainly be a division of approximately fifty/fifty between Government and Opposition, and possibly more in favour of the Government. This body is the body which the hon. member for Kroonstad accuses of introducing politics, political poison, into the matter. The same, or even more, could be said of the Association of Law Societies of S.A. which has condemned this Bill. So. Sir, the hon. the Minister has not made clear at all what the attitudes of people to this Bill have been. He has left the impression that there is virtually no opposition except from the General Council of the Bar and the Law Societies. But I submit that this is an entirely unjustified impression. There has been singularly little comment from other sources, and those comments are probably more against the Bill than in favour of it.</p>

<p>My time is running short. It was a burden which was too much to ask of him. I submit that a great mass of matter on this whole question has not been sifted as a result. I submit <span class="col_4507-4508" refersTo="page_0807"/>that the reactions to the Government&#x2019;s own proposals have not been fully canvassed and where they have come in, they have not been adequately answered by the speech of the hon. the Minister. I submit that in a matter where one is dealing with such a fundamental question as our law and we concede that there is room for improvement in certain spheres the opportunity should not be lost and the Minister should therefore accept the proposal to refer this matter to a Select Committee. It would save an opportunity which otherwise would be lost.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I did not realize that the hon. member was trifling with the House at the time. But I do believe that if it is seriously the view of the hon. the Minister that he has objections to a Select Committee because of the fact that for one or other reason he may feel that it is not the most effective body, then let him consider sending this Bill to the South African Law Commission, which has just been brought into existence by the Government through the gazetting of a Bill only recently. That body is the sort of body that should have examined this whole question in the first place, consisting of a judge as chairman, an extra judge, between two and four members appointed because of their judicial or academic knowledge, or their experience as attorneys or advocates, and an official from the department, with the right to appoint one or more additional people for special purposes. It is to that sort of body that this matter should have been referred in the first place. Mr. Speaker, where the hon. the Minister himself quoted with so much approval from the English Criminal Law Revision Committee&#x2019;s report, he might have mentioned to us, as I shall, that that body consisted of approximately eight or nine learned people, selected approximately as the members of our South African Law Commission are now being selected, and that body, dealing not with the entire field of criminal law and procedure, but with a much more limited field of criminal evidence, spent years considering certain questions before coming forward with their report. They spent years including debate and discussion with jurists from France and Germany, Canada and America. They made all kinds of inquiries before coming forward with their limited recommendations. But we unfortunately have plunged into this with unseemly haste and are now faced with a Bill which is going to lose for the country a golden opportunity to bring our criminal law up to date, and yet to retain its great principles and its fair approach.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to look for a moment at what I regard as the corner-stone of this measure, and that is the new provision for questioning an accused person at the first opportunity. The hon. member for Kroonstad did not like the idea of this being called an inquisitorial procedure. Sir, the comment of the General Council of the Bar is pretty relevant in this regard. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact that the questioning is done by a judicial officer in a court of law will carry with it a strong persuasive element which may render it difficult for the accused to avail himself of his right to remain silent and to put the State to the proof of his guilt. There is a risk that this procedure may induce a feeling of compulsion in the mind of the accused. The effect may not be far removed from compelling <span class="col_4509-4510" refersTo="page_0808"/>an accused person to reply to questions which may incriminate him and thus to assist in building up the case against him, which is in conflict with the basic principles of our criminal justice that the onus to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt rests throughout on the State.</block>

<p>Sir, I believe that everybody in this House would like to see justice done, but done more speedily. The hon. the Minister believes that this measure is going to achieve that aim. I do not. I have grave doubts about that, and I shall indicate where I believe he will find extra delays. The hon. the Minister believes that we shall see the scales of justices being held more with an even hand. I have grave doubts there. I believe that in quite a few cases accused persons will get away on the basis of technicalities. Let me come to that straight away in dealing with this question of the corner-stone of the procedure. I believe that this particular procedure of using a magistrate to put the elements of the offence to the accused and to ask him questions, will place our magistrates in the position of doing the work of the Police to some extent, something for which they are entirely unfitted, something which is going to affect their whole position and status and regard in our society. I believe it will undermine the high regard in which they are held at present. Secondly, Sir, I do not believe that magistrates will relish this new job that is being placed upon them. Sir, one only has to look at the task which is being imposed upon them in terms of the relevant clause to see that they are being given a virtually impossible task, because of its very vagueness. They are obliged to question an accused on &#x201C;all the elements of the offence and all the acts or omissions on which the charge is based in so far as such acts or omissions appear from the charge, or whether the plea is intended to place in issue only certain of such elements or certain of such acts or omissions&#x201D;. This is a very vague assignment that they have been given. I believe it is an almost intolerable assignment for them. I believe that they are going to be placed in the position of virtually having to do the same job as the judge used to do when giving directions to the jury. They are in virtually the same position; they are in very much the same position, and if not precisely so, it will certainly open up a great number of possible technical points which can be taken by the accused at a later stage.</p>

<p>Oh yes, it will. They will have to get all the elements of the case. They will have to inform themselves very fully as to the true position or they will not be able to carry out the tasks given to them.</p>

<p>There is another great danger in this procedure. I believe that countless accused are going to challenge the statements that have been taken from them at these pretrial questionings. I believe that countless accused, when it is sought by the State to prove everything that went on at this pretrial hearing, will challenge the correctness of the facts as stated there.</p>

<p>Because I believe the whole procedure is open to misunderstanding and open to challenge.

And this will have a most unfortunate result, namely this, that the magistrates then will be called into the witness-box in the Supreme Court and they are going to have a whole unsatisfactory wrangle with the defence as to whether their statement of the facts correctly reflects what went on and also whether they in fact covered the elements adequately, and all the other requirements set out in this section.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that this procedure is not going to come up to the expectations of the hon. members opposite in regard to the main question. The main point is the hope, in <span class="col_4511-4512" refersTo="page_0809"/>the words of hon. members opposite, that they will get more convictions, or words to that effect. I believe that the whole formality of this procedure, where it takes place in front of a magistrate and in the presence of a limited number of others, will lead the accused to say nothing, more often than hon. members opposite suspect.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what is the answer then, where I believe there is room for improvements&#x003F; I believe the Government and the commissioner have attempted to take a short-cut in this case. They regard the matter as pressing. They want speadier trials. They speak about the manpower shortage. They believe that the scales are loaded against the State. There is certainly room for improvement in some of those respects. But I would rather see the answer, as I have indicated, in a careful examination of the whole position, either by a Select Committee or by a bigger commission. But in the meantime I want to say that I believe that the answer to immediate improvement is likely to lie along the lines that the English Criminal Law Revision Committee sought, namely not to bring in magistrates as the questioning authority. The English Criminal Law Commission rejected what we are doing here and they gave full reasons for rejecting it. They said &#x2014;I believe this is where the improvement could come&#x2014;that we should change the position of the accused when he is questioned by the Police. As they recommend, one should do away with the first and second judge&#x2019;s rules so that the accused or a suspected person is not warned that what he says may be given in evidence against him and one should also alter the whole position in regard to the &#x201C;right to silence&#x201D;. They have said that those two matters should be altered. The accused will be given in writing a statement which sets out the position as far as he is concerned. If my time permits me, I should like to read it to the House. No, I shall not read it, but simply want to say that they favoured the presentation to the accused of a written statement indicating to him, among other things, that he had a right to silence but that if he chose to be silent, this could lead to an adverse inference against him.</p>

<p>I believe that along those lines, not along the lines that we have chosen, lies the improvement that everybody in this House is justifiably seeking. I hope, therefore, that even now we shall not go ahead with this bad change to our criminal law. We must indeed make changes. It is a golden opportunity to get the right changes. So much more light has been thrown on these problems since the learned judge sat as a one-man commission and brought in his findings. It would be an act of statemenship if the hon. the Minister or the Government would be prepared to hold their hands in the interest of a system of justice which stretches back for over 2000 years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your indulgence and with the leave of the House I rise not to take part in this debate. May I add that I would have loved to take part in this debate. But that is not the reason why I am rising. I do, in fact, rise because I think that this is an appropriate time and occasion for me to pay tribute to the late Mr. Harry Lawrence, one-time Minister of Justice in South Africa. I think it is appropriate that while we are discussing this Bill, I do pay tribute to him. Of course, he held other portfolios too, but I am trying to keep within the ambit of the Bill before the House.</p>

<p>I think that the late Mr. Harry Lawrence will not, in the first place, be remembered as a Minister of Justice, but he will always and in the first place be remembered as one of the greatest parliamentarians who ever sat in this House.</p>

<p>*In the course of my career I often came into conflict with him. In fact, he was the first man with whom I&#x2014;as a novice&#x2014; actually came into conflict in this House. I had good cause to disagree with him at all times and to disagree with him very sharply. I do feel, however, that it will be right and proper, in view of the fact that our procedure does not make provision for this in any other way, for me to occupy the time of this House for a short while to place on record the desire we as parliamentarians have to express our deepest sympathy to his wife and family on the death of a person who reached great heights as a parliamentarian in this House and for whom all of us, on both sides of the House, had a deep admiration for the way in which he acted in this House. I apologize for having occupied the time of the House on this occasion for this purpose, but I do feel that this is the right way in which to act in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since you have allowed some indulgence <span class="col_4513-4514" refersTo="page_0810"/>to the hon. the Prime Minister, perhaps you will allow some indulgence also to us on this side of the House to associate ourselves with the remarks of the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to the late Mr. Harry Lawrence. I do not think that anyone who has served in this House will forget him as a parliamentarian who never missed an opportunity, who could turn a losing debate into a winning debate in a matter of minutes and who could change the whole atmosphere in the House in a very short time. He came to this House as a very young man after a very tough by-election and soon he showed his ability, to the extent that he later became first a Minister of the Interior and later a Minister of Justice. He was Minister of the Interior during the war years when he had to take some very difficult decisions in the interests of the war effort and of the security of South Africa. I think it is a tribute to the character of a man that he was able to take those decisions and that he was able to administer his portfolio in a manner which made him many friends and no enemies, even amongst those who differed from him politically. When one thinks of him, one thinks particularly of his courage in adversity during his years of illness. I think it is singularly fitting that we should be paying this tribute to him in the course of a debate of this kind which falls under one of the portfolios for which he was responsible and with which he was so intimately connected. He sure was a Minister of Justice with a difference in that he had many years of experience at the Bar and that he had an intimate knowledge of our criminal law and procedure and everything connected with it. Although he differed from us politically in later years, he was able to differ in a manner which was never bitter nor insulting nor petty. One feels that he was one of those men whose participation in the South African politics has brought distinction and even charm into our public life. It will not be possible for me to speak again during the Second Reading debate, so I would like to say now that it is a great tragedy that on this day we should be discussing a Bill which so pre-eminently should go to a Select Committee for adequate investigation and adequate evidence from all interested parties to begin with. That, however, is not the object of my intervention. I only want to be associated with what the hon. the Prime Minister has said, especially with the message of condolence to Mr. Lawrence&#x2019;s family and particularly his widow, Mrs. Lawrence.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, today is really an exceptional day for the judicature of South Africa in the sense that this is only the third time since Union that we have had a Criminal Procedure Bill in its entirety before us in this Parliament. It says much for our judicature and our application of justice that the two Acts we have had so far have sufficed for so long. The first Criminal Procedure Act remained on the Statute Book for almost 38 years. In 1955 it was imperative that it be amended. The second Criminal Procedure Act has been on the Statute Book for almost 18 years and amendments have again become necessary. All of us who are taking part in this debate know that this Act is really of an extremely juridical-technical nature. I therefore find it a pity that this Bill should immediately have been dragged into the political arena by the Opposition, that the Opposition should immediately have tried to make political capital out of it. This Bill is not something which came down on the Opposition out of the blue. They should really have known, ever since the Botha Commission was appointed in June 1970, that at one stage or another a Bill of this nature would emerge, particularly after a report was published in May 1971, followed by a draft Bill in December 1971. At present we find ourselves in the position that this Bill has unfortunately been dragged head over heels into the political arena and that they are trying to make political capital out of it. If I were to seek an explanation for this, it would simply be that the Opposition has been getting the worst of things ever since this Parliamentary session began. Therefore they are now trying to make political capital out of a Bill of a technical nature. The Opposition has fallen flat! It fell flat in the by-election; it fell flat in the No-confidence Debate and it fell flat in last week&#x2019;s Budget Debate. Now they are trying to make something of this Bill. [Interjections.] I shall come to the Bill in a moment.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>What I find most difficult to understand is the amendment introduced by the main speaker on the Opposition side to the motion of the hon. the Minister, which amendment is that this <span class="col_4515-4516" refersTo="page_0811"/>Bill, of all Bills, be referred to a Select Committee. It is now a year and two months ago that we in this House had a heated debate concerning a subject which was to be referred to a Select Committee. It was in connection with the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate certain organizations in South Africa. At the time the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had this to say (Hansard, 10th February, 1972, col. 730)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Prime Minister says that three of the organizations concerned have requested a judicial commission. I see no reason why he should not have granted their request. I see no reason at all. I believe that that would be a better body than a Select Committee of this Parliament to investigate matters of this kind. I have no hesitation in saying so.</block>

<p>At a later stage he went on to say (col. 731)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as I am concerned, I believe that not only would a judicial commission be a better body for an investigation of this kind, but also that the public would have more confidence in it. It is clear that the organizations concerned will have more confidence in it. In a matter of this kind it is not only sufficient that justice must be done, but that justice must be seen to be done.</block>

<p>Those of us who were Present last year and participated in the debate, will remember that the Opposition&#x2019;s whole argument centred around the fact that a parliamentary Select Committee was not really suited to do certain work.</p>

<p>We will come to that in a moment.

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not playing politics at all, because this is precisely the position. It seems to me as though the hon. member for Pinelands has not reached a final decision yet on where he wants to send this matter. He said that it would be best to refer this Bill to the South African Law Commission, which is something else entirely. This Bill is the product, the result, of an investigation by an expert, by a judge who is a more senior judge than Mr. Justice Hiemstra because he is a judge of the Appeal Court. He heard evidence from all quarters concerning this Bill. If there is any argument which falls completely flat, then it is this argument that the Bill should now be referred to a Select Committee. Looking at this Bill, we see that it has 350 clauses. If we look at the persons and bodies who submitted memoranda to the commission, we find that these include divisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa, judges of the Supreme Court of South Africa, advocates and attorneys, Government departments, attorneys-general, universities and other bodies and private individuals. The following persons and bodies submitted oral evidence to the commission, viz. judges of the Supreme Court, attorneys-general and staff members, the South African Police and others. This Bill is before Parliament three years after the Botha Commission was appointed. Let us just imagine for a moment what would happen if this Bill were to be referred to a Select Committee of Parliament. If this were done no amending or consolidating Bill in respect of the law of criminal procedure would be submitted to this House for the next five years. If we consider only the extent of the memorandum of the General Council of the Bar which was sent to all the parties and also to the hon. member for Houghton, one can imagine the tremendous amount of work which a Select Committee would have to do, and this after a judge of appeal had already brought out a report in this connection.</p>

<p>If one were to look at the nature and the essence of the law of criminal procedure as such, I think that the first statement which one could make would be that it is one of the subdivisions of our system of law which is applied most in practice. Not a day goes by when the law of criminal Procedure is not being applied, studied, discussed and&#x2014;I will say this too&#x2014;torn to pieces in hundreds of instances and hundreds of cases throughout the length and the breadth of our country, by judges, magistrates, <span class="col_4517-4518" refersTo="page_0812"/>attorneys, advocates, the Police, etc. This in fact makes the law of criminal Procedure a living organism of the system of law. This causes it to grow like a plant or a tree: some of its branches may wither, but it may sprout new shoots which will again bear leaves and blossom; it may lose its leaves, and may also bear fruit which may sometimes be bitter and sometimes sweet. I selected at random a volume of the South African Law Reports, a 1971 volume, No. 4, at the library. From 139 cases reported in that volume, 67 were criminal cases&#x2014;almost half. I believe that work on criminal cases comprises far more than half of the total volume of work done in our courts. Through the years our law of criminal procedure has received continual attention, as I have said, from those who administer and apply the law; and not only from them, but also from legal organizations, academic institutions, the Department of Justice and also non-juridical persons and bodies. The reason why the law of criminal procedure enjoys this attention, is that it is concerned with the freedom of the individual, and sometimes, too, with the life of the individual. Therefore, this is indeed an important Bill which we have before us today.</p>

<p>How must this House approach this Bill&#x003F; This House must approach this Bill in its capacity as a legislature. It must not approach this Bill as either a prosecuting or a defending advocate. We are here for the exclusive purpose of approaching this Bill as a legislature, and in this connection to put the interests of South Africa first. There must be no thought of a guilty party who has to be afforded an opportunity of being acquitted. But in addition the fact that an innocent party must not be found guilty, should always be borne in mind. In this connection we in the Western world have two forms to which reference has already been made, namely the accusatorial and the inquisitorial forms of the formal criminal law. Mr. Justice Botha gave a very clear and concise exposition of the two procedures. Of the accusatorial procedure as we know it today, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This contemplates a trial before an independent and passive judicial officer, in which the accused and the prosecutor play roles more or less similar to those of the parties in a civil action. The judicial officer is not concerned with the investigation of the facts which led to the accused&#x2019;s appearance in court. The procedure in both the trial and the preliminary hearing is characterized by a confrontation between the prosecutor and the accused at which the judicial officer acts more or less as arbiter and according to the evidence adduced, and ensures that the rules prescribed for the trial are observed.</block>

<p>Concerning the inquisitorial form, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the inquisitorial procedure, on the other hand, the judicial officer does not play a mere passive role. A positive duty rests upon him to discover the truth. He plays an active role in the investigation and collection of the facts of the case, and the interrogation of the witnesses and of the accused. At the preliminary hearing as well as at the trial, the judicial officer himself undertakes an active investigation into the guilt of the accused.</block>

<p>The Rhodesian commission of inquiry, in an appendix, also has a comparison between the accusatorial and the inquisitorial systems. According to the report, Dr. Daniel Williams had this to say about them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is sometimes said that England retains the accusatorial system of criminal procedure in contrast to the inquisitorial system adopted on the Continent. These terms are used with some variety of meaning by different writers, and this has the effect of creating verbal differences between the theories presented. Some writers draw a single sharp distinction between accusatorial and inquisitorial systems; others, by ascribing a number of different characteristics, enable themselves to say that both the Anglo-American and the Continental systems are mixed, being semi-accusatorial and semi-inquisitorial in different degrees. There seems to be no point in becoming en-broiled in these merely verbal issues.</block>

<p>Sir, I think that since the hon. member for Durban North has already stated in the Press that &#x201C;The United Party rejects the inquisition Bill&#x201D; and since he has made a fuss today about the inquisitorial system, we should take cognizance of the fact that the inquisitorial system is a system; it is not such a terrible thing. In any event it has nothing to do with the inquisition of centuries ago; in fact it is merely a name. Sir, our system is the accusatory form and, as the hon. the Minister said, it is being <span class="col_4519-4520" refersTo="page_0813"/>retained. Sir, it is the task of this Parliament to establish machinery in this Criminal Procedure Act which leaves no loopholes to allow guilty parties to go free, but to establish machinery for the courts and also for the parties&#x2014;for the State and for the defence&#x2014;to establish the truth, and for the courts to find the accused guilty or to acquit him accordingly. But this is not all with which the law of criminal procedure is concerned; it also envisages the maintenance, at all times, of the prestige and dignity of our courts, and ensuring that respect on the part of the public for the prestige of the court is at all times maintained. Mr. Speaker, it is not a good thing if one&#x2019;s law of criminal procedure is full of loopholes, with the result that too many guilty parties go free; this results in contempt and indifference towards the courts and also towards the person and the property of the individual. Sir, the law of criminal procedure has to exist, as the hon. Mr. Justice Botha puts it, to ensure the conviction of the guilty person without creating any danger of the innocent person being convicted. It has been said that it was better to acquit 10 guilty persons than convict one innocent person. For an effective criminal procedure, this has possibly been overstated, but it emphasizes the requirement that no criminal procedure measures should be prescribed which could, as such, give rise to the conviction of an innocent person. Looking at the Bill, we see, as I have already said, that this is the first time since 1955 that the law of criminal procedure has been before Parliament in its entirety. During the years which have elapsed since that time, many amendments have been effected, subsections have been deleted and others added, and the entire jury system has been done away with. It is therefore necessary not only that the Act be rewritten, but also that necessary adjustments be made. The Act must also be adapted to the needs and requirements of the time and as it seems to me, it is in fact the adaptations which are causing the problems. It is the adaptations which this hon. Minister has had the courage to execute, and which have stirred up such extreme opposition on the part of the Opposition and its Press. It appears to me as though the Opposition is only reacting to the command of the <i>Sunday Times</i> of last Sunday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party should reject it <i>in toto</i> without looking for compromise or trying to curry favour with its own verkramptes.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>If questions arise concerning this Bill, and legal experts have raised questions on this Bill, I think that this stems from the extreme conservatism for which legal experts are known. This is something which one commonly finds with them. I think that it would be a good thing to place on record in this debate what the hon. Mr. Justice Nicholas said in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reason for tardiness in reform is probably to be found in the fact that the tendency of the mass of people is towards conservatism. Sir Edward Coke said, &#x201C;We have a maxim in the House of Commons and written on the walls of our House, that old ways are the safest and surest ways&#x201D;. The tendency appears in lawyers in an aggravated form. Conservatism is their occupational disease, perhaps because the nature of the law and its practice produces a reverence for authority and the wisdom of the past so that lawyers come to believe with the Lord Chancellor in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x2019;s Iolanthe that the law is the embodiment of everything that is excellent.</block>

<p>Looking at this Bill, we see that it has come a long way to be before this House today. Firstly it is based on the two Acts of 1917 and 1955 which preceded it. Thereafter, Judge of Appeal Mr. Justice Botha was appointed as a one-man commission, as a result of the articles of Judge Hiemstra in which he pleaded for an investigation into a possible change in our law of criminal procedure. This commission collected memoranda and evidence and the people who gave evidence, are people with the best knowledge in connection with our administration of justice. Let me say that this Bill contains very drastic changes, but a drastic change is not necessarily an incorrect change. Often it is the drastic change which produces the best results. Let me also say that the old Act was a good Act, but it was very time-consuming, very long-winded and very expensive, it had loopholes which were utilised tactically by the defence. Particularly in these times in which we are living, where we are dealing with subversives, where we are dealing with <span class="col_4521-4522" refersTo="page_0814"/>people who have no respect for the law as it stands and for the administration of law as we know it, where they are exploiting the existing law and also exploiting the law of criminal procedure in order to make other plans outside the courts, such as plans to escape or to intimidate witnesses, I say that it has become necessary for us to adapt and modernize our law. I am in favour of the adaptation and modernization of our law of criminal procedure. As a member of this legislative House I welcome the Bill and I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and the Officials and the legal draftsmen on the fine piece of work which they have submitted to us.</p>

<p>I must make haste I want to mention one practical example of how, in my opinion, something which was exploited or&#x2014;let me rather use this word&#x2014;utilized in the past, is being done away with. I refer to the preparatory examination. This preparatory examination record as such was a very valuable document for an advocate for the defence in a capital case. It was a document on which he could prepare his cross-examination, and not only his cross-examination of the witnesses who gave evidence at the preparatory examination, but he could also play off the evidence of witnesses in the preparatory examination against each other when it came to the actual hearing of the case. At the defence of that person who has been charged with a capital crime I shall now have to act without the record of the preparatory examination. However, I cannot say that this will give rise to any injustice in the new law of criminal procedure. It is going to be difficult for me to prepare my defence, but no injustice will be done. I think that the hon. member for Durban North must also concede this.</p>

<p>So, too, there is the fact that when my client, the accused, is called as a witness, I can no longer keep him out of the witness box until I choose to put him in it. For me as an advocate this is a problem, but it should not be a problem for this House. It makes things more difficult for me because now, in accordance with the provisions of clause 151, I must have my client, the accused, adducing evidence first and should I not do so and then at a later stage decide to put him in the witness box, the court may draw from that any conclusion which it considers to be reasonable. This would be a conclusion which would probably count against the accused in nine cases out of ten. I do not think that that would be good to know, and from a tactical point of view it is decidedly not a good thing to be deprived of an opportunity like this, because, let us admit this between ourselves, the accused can now no longer sit there listening to all the evidence and listening to what the other witnesses have to say about him. He must now speak first. Through this the defence loses a valuable privilege or a valuable opportunity, but the truth, I believe, will prevail in this case as well.</p>

<p>I must conclude, but I want to express the conviction that this Bill is necessary. It is necessary to consolidate the existing legislation with the amendments which have already been effected to it. It is also necessary at the present juncture, when there is a great deal of work in South Africa, but little time and even fewer people to do the work than there is time. The Bill is drastic, but I do not doubt for one moment that should anything be included in this Bill which could prejudice a person in his defence, our judges would not hesitate a moment to see, nor would they baulk at ensuring, that justice is done.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Waterkloof made many statements that I unfortunately cannot follow up, but at a later stage in my speech I shall deal with certain points which he broached. However, there are certain of his allegations that I cannot allow to pass and which I must comment upon. The hon. member accused us on this side of the House of having brought politics into this matter. I fling this back in the hon. member&#x2019;s teeth, because if there is one member who has made politices out of this Bill it is he. We regard this legislation as radical legislation and as legislation involving principles, and that is why we feel strongly about it, but it is wrong to say that because we feel strongly about it and because we vehemently oppose it, we want to make politics out of it. That is in no way our purpose. We want to give South Africa the best possible criminal procedure legislation; that is our whole object.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further and said that we cannot reach any decision&#x2014;he got that, of course, from the hon. member for Pretoria Central who is not a member whose example it is worth following&#x2014;because in the past we have requested the appointment of a judicial commission and now again we are requesting the appointment <span class="col_4523-4524" refersTo="page_0815"/>of a parliamentary committee. What argument is the hon. member now using&#x003F; That is surely rubbish, because what kind of committee one considers will best be able to deal with that depends, surely, on the circumstances of each case. In this case we are requesting a parliamentary select committee for a very simple reason. The reason is that we are dealing here with legislation and that we want to pilot legislation through Parliament. To whom does the task of legislation fall in this country&#x003F; It is surely this Parliament&#x2019;s task. Who must, then, serve on such a committee but members of Parliament who are going to decide what shape the Bill is going to take&#x003F; How can we now request a judicial commission to go into something like this&#x003F; The hon. member&#x2019;s argument is absolute nonsense.</p>

<p>The hon. member states further that this Bill did not descend upon the Opposition out of the blue. In a certain sense of the word it is true that this measure has been brooding like a thunderstorm for a long time, for more than three years. As the hon. member for Durban North said today, we did not know what the final proposals of the Government would be before they came forward with this Bill that is before us today. We did not know what it was, and nothing was final before it appeared before us three weeks ago. The Bill is not the same Bill as the previous one. I shall point out to the hon. House that as far as possible I have tried to make a list of the differences between the published Bill and this Bill. To merely state that there is a difference, took up four typed folio pages. There are, consequently, a tremendous number of differences in this new Bill. On the Order Paper at the present moment there are more amendments to the Bill being moved by the hon. the Minister of Justice. I think that this proves that this Bill has not yet been given proper attention. There is still a great deal that must be given attention. I do not think that in this short time at our disposal we have in reality seen how widely the effect of this legislation is going to be felt. It is not only a Bill introducing a new method of procedure in South Africa; it is an unprecedented procedure as far as the world in general is concerned. No one can tell us how it works. Hon. members who are quick to say that it will work this way or that way, do not know how it is going to work. We have never seen it in practice. That is why a great deal more research must be done about that before one makes a drastic change such as this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad has also referred to what the learned Judge Hiemstra said in connection with the long detention of accused before they come before the Supreme Court and are eventually sentenced. This, of course, is not a state of affairs that meets with our approval. In Johannesburg a prisoner, who is not allowed out on bail and must appear before the Supreme Court, has to wait an average of seven or eight months before his case comes before the Supreme Court and is concluded. One would like to see an improvement in that, but this Bill cannot bring about any change. The person still has to appear before the magistrate. Subsequently he is sent to the Supreme Court, but first there is the long process of cross-examination before the magistrate which he must undergo. The great problem in connection with why it takes so long for an accused to come before the Supreme Court, is that the Supreme Court roll is so full that no date can be obtained for the case. That is the big problem. That is the reason why they wait so long; they wait to get a date on which they can appear before the Supreme Court. Then there are also, in between times, adjournments of the court. Neither are there always sufficient judges available. Those are the problems causing the procedure to take so long. We do not need a new Criminal Procedure Act to eliminate this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad accuses us of being inflexible in our thinking, of not wanting to move ahead. Both the hon. member for Durban North and the hon. member for Pinelands have already said that we realize that there must be changes in the Act. We are not opposing all changes in that connection, but we are opposing these particular changes. That is the point. That is why we are requesting a Select Committee; we realize there must be changes, but we are not satisfied with these changes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but I am not going to answer questions now.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that according to law when an accused has pleaded guilty the magistrate before whom <span class="col_4525-4526" refersTo="page_0816"/>he must appear must explain all the relevant elements to him to make sure, as he put it, that the accused pleaded guilty correctly before he finds him guilty. It is quite correct that a magistrate cannot simply find a person guilty because he has pleaded guilty; he must make sure, in some or other way, that the man is really guilty as was his plea. However, we must remember that although the elements of an offence are put to him and he is cross-examined about them, those are abstract matters; for the majority of persons appearing before that magistrate those are abstract questions. From the nature of the case many of those questions are legal questions which do not merely deal with the facts: they have a legal content. They are not concrete in the eyes of the accused. He is not sure what all the effects are. This purpose, which the hon. the Minister speaks about, i.e. that the court must be sure that the accused has pleaded guilty correctly, was the role that the evidence played <i>aliunde.</i> That is why it is important, because that evidence is objective, objective in a sense that it does not come from the accused and has nothing to do with him. The court is able to look at the evidence first and then, with the aid of the other objective facts, to decide whether the accused has pleaded guilty correctly&#x2014;that is, of course, the case in the more serious offences.</p>

<p>I have already said that this is a complex and important Bill, and I say this because if there is such a thing as a charter of human rights in South Africa, it is the Criminal Procedure Act. That is why we jealously guard the rights and the procedures contained in it. This is important and we feel it to be the entire basis of the legal set-up and of the community in South Africa. The hon. member for Waterkloof has said that it forms the basis of the legal system in South Africa, and he is quite correct in saying so, because the individual&#x2019;s rights are contained in it. It is fundamentally based on Roman-Dutch legal principles with certain amendments such as we have introduced from time to time. It is therefore right that we should look carefully at any amendment of this and that a study in depth is necessary before one would really go so far as to change it. It is so wide in scope, and the consequences of its implementation are so far-reaching as cannot be determined at a single glance. As I have already said, I do not want to allege that there are no changes necessary to the existing Act. We know that there are shortcomings, and as the hon. member for Durban North has said, we know that there is a strong case to be made for no longer allowing the system of preparatory examination to continue. That is a matter we also want to have investigated. There are some of the hon. members who have said that this is one of the reasons why we want to oppose the present Criminal Procedure Bill, but that is not so and hon. members are making a mistake. It is not because we are opposed to the abolition of the system of preparatory examination. Not at all. We know that quite a few improvements can be brought about in that respect.</p>

<p>I therefore believe, and that is why I am supporting the motion of the hon. member for Durban North, that a Parliamentary Select Committee should be appointed prior to the Second Reading, before we accept a single principle of this Bill, so that the matter can be investigated further. I want to give the background to why we approach the Bill as we are doing. This Bill about the Criminal Procedure Act protects the rights of the State and those of the accused. It is quite correct that the accused should not be unnecessarily benefited, but he must not be unnecessarily prejudiced either. There is a fine balance between the interests of the State and those of the accused, and that balance must be found. The accused must never be placed in a worse position than the State. I think there is one principle that affects our approach in this connection and that emanates from this, i.e. the independence of the judiciary, not only from an administrative point of view, but also because the presiding officer should never enter the arena or assist in building up the case against the accused. That is solely the duty of the State.</p>

<p>In this connection, in particular, I want to remind hon. members that in terms of this Bill an accused can be brought before the court and be charged with a certain offence. He then appears before a magistrate and all the questions are then put to him and the position is explained to him. He then makes the necessary admissions, those which he does make and those which he does not make. They then find, or they know from the beginning, that they cannot prove the alleged offence against him, but that from the admissions he has made they can prove another offence against him &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member must just listen first. Then they can withdraw the case against him at that stage and he is then not entitled to be found not guilty on that charge. The result is that the Police, the people investigating this case, have then obtained valuable information with which to pin him down, without his actually having been charged, owing to the admissions he has made.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>The principle is, as I have said, that the accused must not make out a case against himself&#x2014;it is the State that must prove the case against him.</p>

<p>A further principle is, as I have said, that we must regard the accused as being innocent until he is proved guilty by the person who alleges that he is guilty. That person must prove him guilty, and not he himself. The system must not be aimed at trying to catch the accused unawares. The accused must be able to see his accusers face to face. We believe that this Bill causes an important breach of this principle and also others. It is from this point of view, bearing in mind everything I have already said, that we regard the Bill. In all our criticism or allegations this basis must be borne in mind. Sir, it is true that the Bill does not only have one single principle. That is true to a certain extent, but I nevertheless believe that there is a principle running throughout this Bill, i.e. that of making everything easier for the State and more difficult for the accused. The intention is to take away more and more rights from the accused.</p>

<p>That is the principle running through this whole Bill from beginning to end. It begins at clause 6(b) in terms of which, as I have said, the case can be withdrawn after admissions have been made. Then he is not entitled, to be found not guilty either if a case has not been fully proved against him. This is also applicable to smaller cases, as in clause 7(2)(c), in terms of which a person, in wanting to exercise a tremendously important right of his, i.e. to institute a private prosecution, must do so within six weeks, after the State has usually had months and months to prepare its case and to eventually decide whether it is going to prosecute or not. The accused must then carry out that same investigation within six weeks.</p>

<p>Clause 22(2) of the published Bill has been left out here, i.e. the provision that when a person&#x2019;s house is being searched without a search warrant this should, as far as possible, take place during the day and that two prominent people in the neighbourhood should be present to ensure that that right cannot be abused. This kind of act must take place in public. I think that is very important. So these principles run throughout the Bill, through all the small provisions. Although we have continually been speaking about the basic change in this Bill, these changes also run through all the smaller provisions.</p>

<p>A great deal has already been said about the new provisions from Chapter 17 to Chapter 20. At this stage we do not know enough about that to be able to decide on what all the results are going to be. An accused can now be found guilty without any further evidence. I want to say that he could plead guilty to a charge for many reasons, and can even make all the necessary admissions after the situation has been explained to him. One of the most serious considerations bothering me is that for some or other reason he could try to protect the real offender by pleading guilty. Because there is no evidence indicating that he is the person who committed an offence, we shall never get to the real offender. The real offender will never be brought before the courts, because this person is protecting the offender in court and the real evidence never comes before the court.</p>

<p>But I should also like to deal with clause 119, which I think introduces a tremendously important difference in principle; because if someone pleads not guilty, everything is surely placed in doubt. Then the State must prove the case. Nowhere in clause 119 is it provided that the same must happen, as far as he is concerned, as when he pleads guilty in a magistrate&#x2019;s court, i.e. that an explanation should be given of what the elements of the offence are. Now he is asked: &#x201C;Is there anything more you want to say about that&#x003F; Is there anything you want to explain&#x003F;&#x201D; If one is appearing in court, it can be imagined what the position in practice will be. He may say: No, I do not know. What must <span class="col_4529-4530" refersTo="page_0818"/>I do now&#x003F; Then the magistrate will tell him: Is there something you want to tell me&#x003F; What did you do&#x003F; The magistrate will have to question him. The magistrate will have to explain to him what is expected of him. He will tell him: Look, what are you now trying to do&#x003F; Why are you pleading not guilty&#x003F; Did you not do it&#x003F; Do you want to tell me that you did not do it&#x003F; That is the kind of thing, Mr. Speaker, that will happen every day. We have witnessed enough of that to see that that will be the position exactly. I myself have frequently heard them say: Look, this policeman says you are guilty. Do you want to tell me you are innocent&#x003F; Now he has the right to do so. At that time an appeal could be based on that. But now it is his duty to ask such questions. That is the big difference.</p>

<p>Let us take the case of a person who is being charged with a hit-and-run offence. How many charges cannot be laid against that person&#x003F; He could be charged with not having stopped; not having reported the matter to the Police; having driven recklessly or negligently or without due regard to other people on the road. There one already has four alternate charges.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>There are others as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stephens">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. M. STEPHENS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there could also be other charges. One could even add culpable homicide. What elements must he now admit to and what must he not admit to&#x003F; How must he understand all of them&#x003F; I am specifically taking a hit-and-run case for a special reason. If the magistrate now asks him whether he is the registered owner of that motor vehicle and he says &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, the State already has <i>prima facie</i> proof that he was the driver of the car, because there is a presumption in this Bill. Must the magistrate under those circumstances also ask him whether he was the driver, or is it sufficient for him merely to ask him whether he is the registered owner&#x003F; If he were to ask him whether he is the registered owner and he says &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, the State does not need to prove any other aspect because then that is already <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he was the driver on that specific day. I am now arguing in terms of the provisions of this Bill. There will be other things that he must prove, but this is a very important element, particularly in a hit-and-run case. Then one of the most important elements is that one question. Must the magistrate now also put the other question&#x003F; Must he ask him whether he was, in fact, the driver&#x003F; Or is it not necessary for the magistrate to put that question&#x003F; Then each of the alternate charges must also be dealt with one by one. What a long process! It would be a long drawn-out process. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that if evidence is led from the time a person pleads not guilty, it would have taken just as long. One has the same problem with a person being charged of drunken driving and pleading not guilty. There he has the problem of the ,15% alcohol in his blood. How can he admit to those elements&#x003F; How must that person know whether the correct procedure was adopted when a sample of his blood was taken&#x003F; How is he to know whether the procedure used in testing his blood was a correct one&#x003F; The person would resign himself and say that if his blood has been tested then that must be the position. Little does he know that his arm might have been wiped with methylated spirits or something of that kind, which gives the whole matter quite a different slant. That is the kind of thing that becomes much more serious, under these circumstances, than was the position that obtained in the past. This, you must remember, is all done at the first appearance, i.e. the moment the person enters court. The State has by then had a chance to obtain evidence in terms of which to draw up its charge sheet, but these questions are now suddenly put to this person in court and he must reply to them. And he is going to be cross-examined by the magistrate at this stage. No provision is being made for his being told at that stage, when the charges are put to him: Look, you are now entitled either to plead or to ask that the court adjourn so that you may obtain legal representation for yourself or can decide how you want to plead. No provision is being made for his having to be notified of that before he is asked to plead. In my opinion that is the least one can expect. As I have said, that things should be made more difficult for the accused is a thread that runs through everything.</p>

<p>Let us look again at the charge of drunken driving, to which reference was made in clause 212. This clause makes provision for all the documents which are admissible merely by their submission in court, i.e. those documents from people who did the blood tests and transported the samples, etc. This is done by way of sworn statements. But it is not merely a question <span class="col_4531-4532" refersTo="page_0819"/>of the sworn statement being admissible; it is also <i>prima facie</i> proof of what it contains. It is therefore quite serious. Under the old procedure the State had to give him notice. It had to give the accused reasonable notice of an intention to use such a statement against him, which gives the accused the opportunity to decide whether he is going to oppose that statement or not. And this assists administration more than anything else. But I find no provision in this Bill that states that they must notify him so that he can know that such a statement will be used against him and so that he can prepare himself to the extent of wanting to oppose that statement or not, giving them notice and stating: &#x201C;Do not conclude the matter; get hold of the person because I want to cross-examine him.&#x201D; After all, it is his right to cross-examine. It is being said that one of the big reasons is that this would save time. Sir, I want to say that far from saving time, this procedure is going to cause a bottleneck in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. One of our biggest problems&#x2014;and the Minister knows this better than I do&#x2014;is the shortage of magisstrates, particularly in the ordinary magistrate&#x2019;s courts, and not so much in the regional courts. What is the present procedure&#x003F; Someone appears before the magistrate on a charge that necessitates his going to the regional court, because they know his record. All that prosecutor, who is working under pressure, does in the magistrate&#x2019;s court&#x2014;make no mistake; he is working under pressure&#x2014;is to take the person&#x2019;s name and to write down that the case has been postponed for 14 days. And with that the matter is finished and done with. When his fingerprints have come into his record, they get a date from the regional court and postpone the case so that it may go to the regional court. It therefore goes like a flash through the magistrate&#x2019;s court and it is then the regional court&#x2019;s task to go further. But now each of those cases must first be subject to this long procedure in the magistrate&#x2019;s court; whereas the case originally went like a flash through the magistrate&#x2019;s court, each of these cases will in future take a long time in the magisstrate&#x2019;s court, while the charge sheet is put to him and he perhaps asks for an adjournment of the court and then pleads not guilty. Then the magistrate must go into the long story of what more he wants to say, and all the other elements he wants to admit to or does not want to admit to, until the matter has been argued out. This would extend the case ten-fold for the magistrate. This also applies to cases going to the Supreme Court. This will not be shorter than having the normal preparatory examination and, of course, where there is a summary trial it also goes like a flash through the magistrate&#x2019;s court. So, there is going to be a tremendous bottleneck here which is going to aggravate the magistrate&#x2019;s burden, which is already a heavy one, and under those circumstances, when people are working under greater pressure, the chances of an injustice being committed become so much greater. I can therefore in no way see that this would in any way expedite the process. Neither would it cause people to be found not guilty more easily at an earlier stage, as the hon. member for Kroonstad said, because if the man pleads not guilty, the State has already prepared its case, and the State would not withdraw its case or abandon it because he pleads not guilty. The State would still continue with its case. It would save no time. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, all afternoon long we have heard hon. members of the Opposition asking that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee. Incidentally, it is rather interesting that they should ask that this Bill be so referred, particularly after then; Transvaal leader had addressed them this morning and since we know that their Transvaal leader adopts a somewhat sceptical attitude towards Select Committees and their serving on Select Committees.</p>

<p>Hon. members said that the case for a Select Committee had been made out. What is that Select Committee to investigate which has not already been extensively and very thoroughly dealt with by the learned judge of appeal, Mr. Justice Botha&#x003F; What Mr. Justice Botha had at his disposal in drafting this report, has already been mentioned. Any student of the science of law who has knowledge of criminal procedure, immediately comes under the impression of the logical reasoning of the learned judge&#x2019;s report. It bears testimony to penetrating study, and the scientifically motivated conclusions he arrives at are logical and well-founded. To what extent could a Select Committee, which in due course would in any event find itself in the same position as he did, come to a better conclusion than that to which he came in the cool and calm atmosphere of the commission which investigated this whole aspect&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_4533-4534" refersTo="page_0820"/>The United Party is trying to create the impression that the learned judge really broke new ground, while in fact he had the benefit of the Act of 1917, the Act of 1955 and the reports and memoranda which have been mentioned here. We as members of Parliament have the further benefit of having at our disposal the commission reports of Great Britain and Rhodesia. It is significant that we have these reports, too, at our disposal because, as is well known, our criminal procedure is founded on the English system. This is particularly significant in the light of the fact that the British and Rhodesian recommendations go much further than those made by Mr. Justice Botha. Later I shall go into more detail in this connection.</p>

<p>As is the case in so many institutions in which the rights of the individual come up against the interests of the State, the pendulum has swung from one extreme to the another, also in the law of criminal procedure. For example, there is the case mentioned by the learned British Commission in its report, namely a case which lasted for two minutes 53 seconds. After the State had adduced its evidence, the judge asked the accused, &#x201C;I suppose you have nothing to ask him&#x003F;&#x201D; Before the accused could address the jury, the judge said to the accused, &#x201C;You have nothing to say, I suppose.&#x201D; Later the judge said to the jury: &#x201C;Gentlemen, I suppose you have no doubt; I have none.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Then there is also the other extreme, illustrated by the following reference to &#x201C;the fairness of the foxhunt&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fox is free to run a certain length of the way for the express purpose of giving him a chance to escape.</block>

<p>It is right and it is important that there should be a difference between the law of civil procedure and the law of criminal procedure because of the greater importance of the outcome to the accused. However, we must take cognizance of what the hon. the Minister quoted from the report of the British Commission and which I should like to emphasize once more&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is as much in the public interest that a guilty person should be convicted as it is that an innocent person should be acquitted.</block>

<p>Earlier on this afternoon, the hon. member for Durban North spoke of statistics. It is very clear that he did not read Mr. Justice Hiemstra&#x2019;s first article. This article dealt extensively with the statistics as they existed in 1963, and the conclusions he arrived at were that from 25% to 40% of all accused charged in our various courts went free and that another 15% to 25% went free on appeal. No right-minded person can accept that four or five out of every ten accused are really innocent of the crime with which they have been charged. There is no doubt in my mind that a good case has been made out for overhauling the law of criminal procedure, and particularly the aspects as embodied in this Bill.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of pre-trial interrogation. A great deal indeed has been said about this so-called interrogation. It must be kept in mind that the judges&#x2019; rules have not been abolished. It should also be kept in mind that the <i>ratio</i> for this new provision is that the accused should be brought before the court as soon as possible. He must be asked at the psychologically correct stage what his plea is to the charge laid against him. If he wishes so, he has to be afforded the opportunity of advising the court of the basis of his defence. This is no inquisition. After all, clause 119 provides explicitly for the accused to be asked by the magistrate whether he wishes to tender any explanation of his attitude in relation to the charge. If he answer, &#x201C;No&#x201D;, the magistrate asks him, &#x201C;Is your plea of not guilty intended to place in issue all the elements of the offence&#x003F;&#x201D; Then he answers, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; To what extent is he being prejudiced, to what extent is this an inquisition, to what extent does the magistrate enter into the stuffy atmosphere of the court itself&#x003F; This is only an extension of his plea that he is not guilty. This is by no means a question of his taking part in the process of conviction or otherwise. Just as in the past he can still say that he places the whole matter in issue. Then the State has to prove all the elements of the crime. When hon. members look at this procedure and compare it to the procedure proposed by the learned Mr. Justice Hiemstra in the first instance, they will see to what a large extent they differ from each other. They differ particularly in the respect that the learned judge says that after the accused has been asked the question and in the event of the accused having remained silent, the court may draw a conclusion from his silence. In clause 119 and the subsequent clauses there is no provision <span class="col_4535-4536" refersTo="page_0821"/>for the accused to suffer any decision which could be prejudicial to him if he should remain silent. No cross-examination is allowed. The hon. member for Florida, however, suggested that the magistrate could ask all kinds of questions. What really happens is, as was stated by the hon. member for Kroonstad, that just as in a civil case there is an exchange of pleadings. In what respect does it differ from that procedure&#x003F; One can ascertain precisely what the principles are on which one&#x2019;s defence rests. It is interesting to note that this system of pre-trial questioning was already known in Biblical times. Mr. Justice Hiemstra also referred to this and said references to this were to be found in Genesis 3. verse 13, and in Joshua 7, verses 19 to 21. In Joshua 7, from verse 19 to verse 21, Joshua, a judge of Israel, interrogates Achan and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</block>

<block name="quote">And Achan answered Joshua, and said, &#x2026; When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and 200 shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weight, then I coveted them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it.</block>

<p>Even the provisions of clause 19 do not go as far as this. So no fault can really be found with the underlying philosophy that it is a natural tendency in man to talk when he is innocent and to remain silent when he is guilty.</p>

<p>Let us just take another look at what the British Commission says in this connection. The hon. member for Pinelands said this was a matter handled solely by the Police, but this is not true. That commission is really referring to what happens when the accused comes to court. When a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out against him the accused should be told by the court that he will be requested at a suitable time to adduce evidence &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">And it should also tell him what the effect will be if he refuses to do so.</block>

<p>On page 19 the British Commission goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the accused has failed when being interrogated by anyone charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders, to mention a fact which he afterwards relies on at the criminal proceedings or the trial, the courts may draw such inferences against him as appear proper in determining the question before it.</block>

<p>Then the Commission goes a step further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any case, where an adverse inference may be drawn from the accused&#x2019;s silence it will be permissible to treat his silence as corroboration of the evidence against him for any purpose for which corroboration is material.</block>

<p>In France, for example, the history of the accused, including his criminal record, is read out at the commencement of the trial to give the jury an image of the accused. The British Commission recommends that relevant previous convictions also be read out prior to the trial. Hon. members must remember that in England they still have a jury system and a system of lay magistrates.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the hon. member for Florida spoke of a charter of human rights. What did the Human Rights Commission of UNO say about this very matter&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Should a person charged refuse to make a statement, it shall be for the court to draw whatever conclusions it may think fit from such refusal.</block>

<p>I want to stress that in clause 119 there is no question whatsoever of the court being able to draw any conclusion from the silence of the accused.</p>

<p>No, if it were, the accused would win his appeal every time. Hon. members will see that it is stated in the further amendment to clause 151(1) that the court may draw certain conclusions if the accused is not called first. Hon. members may look at that. In terms of clause 199 the court dare not draw any adverse conclusions from the fact that the accused has remained silent. Remember, too, that he is represented by his legal adviser who may himself reply to those questions and those concerning the elements of the offence. The accused need <span class="col_4537-4538" refersTo="page_0822"/>only say whether he agrees with his legal adviser or not. The Rhodesian Commission says that at a preparatory examination the prosecutor may tell the accused, &#x201C;Now you have an opportunity to speak and if you do not speak now, the court will draw an adverse conclusion.&#x201D; Should he still remain silent, the prosecutor can ask him more questions. However, he is still entitled to refuse to answer. The prosecutor may then ask him why he refuses to answer. To this he may still refuse to answer. This again leads to an adverse conclusion.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of confessions. The hon. member for Kroonstad has already explained that South Africa is the only country in which the confession made before a police officer is not admissible. The hon. the Minister has already made mention of the fact that the Minister of Justice in 1917, when the Act was first placed on the Statute Book, was against this and voted against it on the Select Committee. This does not exist in any way in Roman-Dutch Law, nor in English Law. It is described as &#x201C;a standing insult to our police&#x201D;. Again the underlying principle is basically unassailable. In his treatise, &#x201C;On Evidence,&#x201D; volume 3, paragraph 851 on page 319, Wigmore says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The nervous pressure of guilt is enormous. The load of the deed done is heavy, the fear of detection fills the consciousness and when the detection comes the pressure is relieved and the deep sense of relief makes confession a satisfaction. At that moment he will tell all and tell it truly.</block>

<p>Just as is the case in clause 217, the Rhodesian Commission suggests that the onus be transferred to the accused to prove that a confession of guilt before a magistrate was not done freely. Against this provision, too, no valid criticism can be advanced. It is interesting to note that in England a strong case was even made out before this commission that confessions be accepted by the court in all cases and that the circumstances under which they had been obtained should determine the weight to be attached to them. Eventually it was decided that the circumstances under which they were obtained be subjected to a lighter test, i.e. &#x201C;a threat or inducement should render a resulting confession inadmissible only if it was of a sort likely in the circumstances existing at the time to render unreliable any confession which might be made by the accused in consequence thereof&#x201D;. And then on page 13, the important statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We justify the reforms which we recommend for this purpose not only because of the changed conditions to which we have referred, but mainly on the ground that there is no clear reason why the restrictions should ever have existed.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned that the old procedure in terms of which a person, after the conclusion of the case, had the right to make a declaration from where he stood, had been abolished. This was not a sworn statement and one could not be cross-examined nor could one really be interrogated about it. That unnecessary and time-consuming system is now being abolished. This is completely acceptable and I do not believe that hon. members of the Opposition will object to it. This is also the position in England and the Rhodesian commission is in favour of it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterkloof mentioned clause 151, which is welcomed and which provides that the accused must adduce evidence first on the conclusion of the case for the State. In practice, as things are today, he had the right to listen to the whole case for the State and also to listen to the evidence of his own witnesses. The possibility therefore exists that he can adapt his own case to the evidence adduced by his own witnesses. It is also interesting to refer to the clauses dealing with the competence of witnesses, namely the necessity or the fact that the wife of an accused is a competent witness under certain circumstances. The British commission recommends that the wife be a competent witness but can also be a compellable witness where a charge of violence against her has been laid, where children under 16 have been assaulted, or where a sexual offence has been committed.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the plea delivered here this afternoon by the hon. member for Durban North, namely that there was so little time for the Opposition to study this Bill. He himself admitted that the first publication of the Bill which followed the report of the judge, took place as early as December, 1970. He thought that it was not necessary to react to it, &#x201C;because in the fullness of time&#x201D; these matters would in fact be brought into question. Surely, Sir, that is not a legitimate reason for this matter to be referred to a Select Committee now. If he has <span class="col_4539-4540" refersTo="page_0823"/>failed in his duty, if he did not act after that Bill was published in 1970, why should he now ask that the matter be referred to a select committee&#x003F; He says that something of this nature is an &#x201C;insult to Parliament&#x201D;. He forgets that a great deal of evidence was adduced before the judge of appeal, Mr. Justice Botha, and that he had the fullest opportunity to study everything from which this fine Bill resulted.</p>

<p>I should just like to refer briefly to the question of the admission of guilt, to the fact that evidence <i>aliunde</i> is no longer necessary. A big issue was made of the fact that the magistrate or district magistrate was not in a position to pass judgment, since he had not heard the elements of the crime. Sir, the hon. member failed to keep in mind clause 112(3) which gives the magistrate and the prosecutor the opportunity to make out a case for an extenuation or to bring to the court any relevant matter before judgment is passed. Therefore I want to state that this Bill, as it is before this House at the moment, is an outstanding piece of work and deserves the support of this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down has, talking on behalf of his side of the House, I think, very correctly dealt with some of the features of the Bill, which he feels support the hon. the Minister in his plea that the Bill should pass the Second Reading stage. I do not think his criticism of the hon. member for Durban North, namely that he had woken up somewhat late and could have made his protestations perhaps on a previous occasion, is appropriate in the present circumstances. It is quite clear to me that the hon. member for Durban North certainly was justified in his plea to the hon. the Minister to refer this Bill to a Select Committee. I can give very many good reasons for that. A particularly good one which comes to mind immediately is the fact that we are faced today with an Order Paper on which there are 13 amendments to this Bill by the Minister, some of which are extremely important, affecting matters which would have been the subject of rather severe criticism in the House, because certain defects which would have made it necessary for this Bill to receive further consideration would have been made apparent.</p>
