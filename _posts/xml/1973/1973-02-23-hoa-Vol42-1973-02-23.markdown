<p>I want to tell hon. members what the business for the next week will be. The Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill will be disposed of on Monday. The Minister of Finance will reply on Monday afternoon when the debate has been concluded. Thereafter the House will proceed to deal with the Bills on the Order Paper from No. 4. On Tuesday we shall take the Third <span class="col_1271-1272" refersTo="page_0649"/>Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill. This will run over to Wednesday, because, as hon. members know, three hours have been set aside for this, plus the Minister&#x2019;s reply. After disposing of the Third Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill, we shall immediately proceed to deal with the Additional Appropriation Bill. I hope that this can also be disposed of on Wednesday evening, provided, of course, that hon. members adhere to the provisions of the rules.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>In the ten minutes at my disposal last night, I pointed out that the hon. member for Durban Point had said that this year was the &#x201C;Big Brag&#x201D; of the National Party. I pointed out that this National Party could rightly brag about what it had done in the course of many years. But I also pointed out that there was a stage in this history of that side of the House when they, too, liked to brag. You will remember, Sir, that I mentioned last night that there was a time, a year ago, when many of the hon. members opposite thought it was just a matter of time before they would assume the reins of Government. I referred to the fact that I took a delight in the newspaper cuttings which I read with pleasure, and I should like to refer very briefly to a few of these cuttings. I do so because I should like those hon. members to be able to take new delight in that time when they walked around like cats with arched tails. Yesterday evening I read to you the statement in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 6th February last year, maintaining, <i>inter alia,</i> that this Government was a bankrupt party. The statement went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Opposition, by contrast, shows that they are taking seriously now the task of preparing themselves for the next government.</block>

<p>Sir, I read to you from the <i>Sunday Times</i> 30th January, 1972&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tide is running in favour of the United Party in Parliament: Year after year at the start of every parliamentary session Sir de Villiers Graaff, as the Leader of the Opposition, has had the unenviable task of standing up in the House of Assembly and moving either a no-confidence motion or a censure motion. Now times have changed. The Nationalists&#x2019; majority is starting to fall and there is every reason to believe that the country&#x2019;s confidence in it is waning.</block>

<p>The <i>Sunday Times</i> went on to give hon. members opposite the following piece of sound advice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party has missed too many good opportunities in the past to be able to afford to miss this one as well. The moral of the United Party&#x2019;s speakers, I suggest, is this: No buck-shot speeches; please keep it crisp and to the point and do not try to cover too much territory in one speech.</block>

<p>That was the advice of the <i>Sunday Times</i> to the United Party at that time, that glorious time of the United Party. I read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nat drive to oust Vorster. Growing move in Press and business for new alignment.</block>

<p>Let me say this: I believe that to be Prime Minister of South Africa, no matter who that person may be, is a major and gigantic task, and in the nature of things I believe that the heavy load which he carries becomes unbearable to him at times, but I also believe that if a Prime Minister, a chief leader of a party, is able to look back and know that he may carry on in the knowledge that no one is standing behind him to stab him in the back, it must give him strength. I believe that for any Prime Minister and chief leader it is an incentive to know that he may look back in the knowledge that every hon. member on his side of the House stands four-square behind him. But more than that I believe that it must give a chief leader and Prime Minister strength to know that every Nationalist in South Africa stands foursquare behind him. As I say this, I pity the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I say that I believe that whereas I have said this in respect of us on this side of the House, the same cannot be said of the Opposition, because what happened <span class="col_1273-1274" refersTo="page_0650"/>a few weeks ago in the no-confidence debate? While the United Party Press was proclaiming the Opposition as victors, while the <i>Sunday Times</i> was assisting them by word and deed, we witnessed a debacle in the no-confidence debate which was unprecedented in the history of this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I can understand the English Press that tried to puff up the United Party, that whipped the horse, being bitterly disappointed in the performance of that side of the House. I think they know by this time that they are flogging a dead horse: the horse has died. I want to indicate what the trouble with the United Party is. I have watched them carefully. I believe there is great tension in the ranks of the United Party. I say that the greatest tension exists in the ranks of hon. members opposite. After all, it cannot be otherwise. Surely the views of hon. members who constitute the United Party, differ greatly. I am convinced that the views of a person like the hon. member for Hillbrow cannot possibly accord with those of my good friend, Uncle Bronkie. I watched them in the no-confidence debate and honestly, the tension in their ranks was visible to me sitting here. Sweat and anxiety literally broke out on the faces of hon. members opposite when they were dealing with their federation policy, that policy about which the United Party Press are reviling them to such an extent today. Have you ever in your life seen anything like the experience of a man like the hon. member for Durban North, the chairman of a commission with the task of reformulating the United Party&#x2019;s policy, when the Prime Minister put a few questions to him? I want to read out what he said, as I want to have it placed on record again since the hon. member for Durban Point yesterday bewailed the fact that the hon. member for Durban North was being treated so badly. I just want to tell the hon. member for Durban Point this: The hon. member for Durban North did not receive that bad treatment from the hands of this side of the House&#x2014;he received it from the hands of his own Press. But what did the hon. member say? The hon. member reconfirmed on two occasions that theirs was not a new policy. I am going to read this to you in brief. I quote from Hansard (col. 295)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister: Do you know what I think? I think it is a swindle.</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. M. L. Mitchell: By the same token one does not say that it is not possible.</block>

<p>Then he proceeded&#x2014;I do not want to read it all. I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister: As the father of those children, may I ask the hon. member a question? Why did you change your policy? What was the reason for doing so?</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. M. L. Mitchell Mr. Speaker, I want to say that there has been no change of policy.</block>

<p>This is recorded very clearly in Hansard. He went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am sorry, does the hon. the Prime Minister mean the federal plan as expounded?</block>

<p>Then the Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Forget about what you believe. Tell us why you changed your policy.</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. M. L. Mitchell: Wait a moment. We believe we should share the fruits of this civilization with anyone who has the capacity for it and we believe in the freedom and the dignity of the individual.</block>

<block name="quote">Those are our principles.</block>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister: Yes, we know you believe, but why did you change it?</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. M. L. Mitchell: We have not changed anything.</block>

<p>Thus the hon. member for Durban North. Sir, is it not scandalous that after the hon. <span class="col_1275-1276" refersTo="page_0651"/>the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;I address him with respect and deference&#x2014;had stood up in the no-confidence debate and had formulated the so-called federation policy of the United Party very clearly and had said that it was a new policy, that the hon. member for Durban North, the chairman, should then say that it was not a new policy. The trouble with the United Party is that they blow hot and cold. The United Party has one story for the urban constituencies and then again another story for the rural areas. After all, it cannot be otherwise, because within the ranks of the United Party there are leftists and rightists. I turn again to the address of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to tell him&#x2014;and may he mark my words today&#x2014;that there is a faction on that side of the House who want his head on a platter. They are going to do to the hon. the Leader what they did to the hon. member for Yeoville in the Transvaal. Unfortunately the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is not here. He is at present the crown prince of the United Party. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is being praised to the skies and puffed up by the United Party Press as the so-called big man.</p>

<p>May I put a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry; my time is very limited. Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout came along and made a speech in this House which I can only term extremely shocking. I have said before in this House and I say it again today, because to me this is a serious matter, that the United Party may criticize this side of the House, in and out of season. That is their task; they must do it. But I say that South Africa will never forgive the United Party if in their political opportunism they say things in this House to harm South Africa. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a speech in this House which, as I have rightly said, was shocking. I want to read just a few lines to you, Sir. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I know, Sir, that the Prime Minister pretends that he knows nothing about this. He can see no evil. Sir, the Government prescribes different uniforms where-ever uniforms apply &#x2026; Sir, we all know what the real reason is. The reason is that they must not only be seen to be separate; they must be seen to be inferior.</block>

<p>He said that with regard to the Coloureds. Hear now what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who is the so-called future leader of the United Party, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At this very moment while we are sitting here in safety in one of the most beautiful cities of South Africa, a body of policemen&#x2014;White policemen, Black policemen, Brown policemen and Indian policemen&#x2014;are in mortal peril on our behalf and they are fighting terrorists across the border of our country. I take my hat off to all of them and I honour them. But I ask the Government: Are these people who risk their lives for our safety paid the same salary, yes or no; or is it a case of unequal pay for equal danger?</block>

<p>I say these are shocking things that were said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Since we are dealing with this speech by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, and since the hon. member for Umlazi is having such a loud discussion over there, I want to ask him whether he agrees with the speech made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

I challenge the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to hold joint meetings with me. We shall chase him from platform to platform. I want to ask the hon. member for Umlazi, or any other hon. member opposite, whether he is prepared to go back to his constituency and tell that constituency that it is the policy of the United Party not to have separate entrances to their post offices. The hon. member must answer now.

I have meetings next week and in subsequent weeks in the Free State. I shall say in the Free State that the United Party, and to be specific, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, calls the Immorality Act the pettiest of petty apartheid. I am going to say that the Mixed Marriages Act is called the pettiest of petty apartheid. I am going to say that the United Party stands for the principle that our post offices in South Africa should not have separate entrances.</p>

<p>My time has virtually expired, but I still want to say this to the United Party, and that is that I believe that this party with its ambiguity, with its various factions, is a party which will fade into nothingness. It shall be my task, and it will be the task of every hon. member on this side of the House, and it will be South Africa&#x2019;s task to strive single-mindedly after ensuring that a rotten Opposition such as this one would never govern South Africa.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when one listens to the speech of the hon. member for Welkom, the hon. member who has just sat down, one cannot help being regretful that the Government is delaying the introduction of television for so long. I would have loved to have seen that hon. member perform on television. I know what he would have meant in votes for the United Party after a speech of this kind. The lack of television is something which hits us in other ways in this country, because whereas in other countries of the world politicians in times of dispute can appear on television and state their points of view and get the facts before the public, we in South Africa have not even the use of the radio as individuals and we have therefore to rely on the Press to present points of view.</p>

<p>Our difficulty with the Press here in South Africa is that a large part of it is controlled eitherly directly or indirectly by the Nationalist Party hierarchy. The other portion of the Press is independent and entitled to its own points of view. As a result of that we tend to find three types of representatives in the Press Gallery in Parliament. First are those who are seeking to report the truth of what is going on here, since there is no television and it cannot be conveyed that way. To those who are seeking to report the truth, we are very grateful indeed. Then there is a second group that reports news and slants it in the interests of the party which it supports.</p>

<p>These people are getting frightened at the turn of events in South Africa under this Government. Having no experience of politics, save perhaps as unsuccessful candidates, and having no acceptable solutions of their own, they hope that by breaking down the existing order and with it the official Opposition, the United Party, by trading on the misplaced confidence they have engendered amongst the public because of friendship in the past, they hope like immature students that something will arise to save South Africa. I have always accepted the right of newspapers to have their own opinion. I want to say at once that the hostility, rational or otherwise, of some editors will not change my view in that regard. But on one score there must be no misunderstanding: They are not the United Party; they do not select its leader; they have no responsibility for its policy. [Interjections].

I am satisfied that, as things stand, these people are not interpreting the opinion of the public but are trying by devious means to create it and thereby they are playing into the hands of the Nationalist Party. In fact, I want to congratulate the hon. the Prime Minister on his new ally. My hands are clean and they shall remain so.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>What I want to discuss with the hon. the Prime Minister particularly is the importance of the statement wrung from him during the No-confidence Debate by the hon. member for Durban North. The hon. the Prime Minister was asked what his attitude would be in respect of those areas that would not accept independence for one reason or another. His reply was: &#x201C;Then things will remain as they are.&#x201D; That question is no longer academic; it has become real as a result of the attitude of the Leaders of the non-White people in South Africa at the present time. What are those leaders saying? They are saying that they do not have sufficient land to accept independence. They are going further; they are saying that the lack of consolidation, or the method of consolidation, makes the whole plan for independence unreal. Some of them are saying that the lack of strategic ports makes the policy fatal. Some of them are saying that they want to enjoy the fruits of the economy they helped to build in South Africa; they do not want independence. Some of them are saying that the areas given to them are not viable economically. What does all this mean? If these people should turn round and refuse independence, as they are indicating they will on the terms offered by the Government, what is the position of this Government and the hon. Prime Minister? It seems to me that the whole moral basis for his policy is at an end. The moral basis is at an end because through the years he has been saying to these people to accept restrictions, to accept discrimination here in South Africa, because when independence comes you will have everything in your own areas and you will be treated differently.</p>

<p>Even self-determination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, even the policy of self-determination becomes a joke as a result of the statement of the hon. the Prime Minister, because what happens? They are not offered self-determination, they are offered independence on the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s terms or nothing at all, things staying as they are. They are offered independence on inferior conditions in non-viable states, with the major part of their population out of the area, of remain in the Republic of South Africa under conditions no self-respecting person can accept. I said before, and I say it again, the policy now becomes a policy of confrontation, a policy of revolution and not a policy of evolution. The position is aggravated by the inability of this Government to cope with inflationary forces which are spreading like wildfire through South Africa. It is aggravated by the complete inability of the hon. gentleman opposite to take effective steps to narrow the wage gap between European and non-European in South Africa and it is aggravated because of the complete inability to cope with the poverty of the masses and their inadequate plans to counter the effects of the devaluation. I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister <span class="col_1281-1282" refersTo="page_0654"/>there is one thing that will not happen if these people do not accept independence. The one thing that will not happen is that the position will remain unchanged as the hon. gentleman seems to think it will. There will be change but the change will not be in the direction which the hon. gentleman envisages. He is faced here with exactly the same dilemma as that with which he is faced in respect of the Coloureds and the Indians. Already he has appointed a commission to investigate the position in regard to the Coloureds and it is to report, <i>inter alia,</i> on their political development in the future. Let me tell him what Mr. Willem van Heerden said yesterday, the chairman of Rapport-uitgewers, and I quote from this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times:</i></p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Do what we like, the Coloured and Indian people will have to become one entity with the Whites.</block>

<p>If the position could remain unchanged, which of course it cannot, but if it could, the sort of federal policy we envisage would fit like a glove for South Africa. There would be no trouble at all, it could all be so easy. These people would have no greater aspirations and we would be able to work with them in peace and amity and the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister would fall into disuse and will be entirely unnecessary with all the friction it has created. There is going to be change and the change is going to come particularly because of two points and both of those points are aggravated by the statement of the hon. the Prime Minister because those are the points where there is friction at the present time. That friction is going to be aggravated as the result of the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The first concerns those hurtful and unnecessary invasions of human dignity which are often found in what is called petty apartheid. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has spoken about it and many other hon. members have spoken about it. So many Nationalists have told us that they believe themselves &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is a vacancy in Rome; perhaps the hon. gentleman has aspirations. Once there he can give us his real views on the policy! [Interjections.] He can tell us what answer he wished he had given when he made that reply to the hon. member for Durban North. And I doubt, Sir, whether it would have the same result, because it would be so dangerous to bring him back again! Sir, many Nationalists have told us that they believe themselves that this separate development will become non-discrimination. They believe that these hurts will disappear when independence comes to the Bantustans.</p>

<p>I have a formidable list before me of the sort of practices which are being applied at the present time. It is a very formidable list indeed. I propose to give the hon. gentleman only a few examples. I want to start by dealing with what was said in the <i>Vaderland</i> in September of last year, a newspaper which no one will describe as a liberal newspaper. It wrote, in a leading article on the pass laws&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons Nasionaliste praat so maklik oor erkenning van die Bantoe se menswaardigheid, en laat ewe maklik toe dat daardie menswaardigheid daagliks op vernederende wyse geskend word.</block>

<p>I think in no sense is that more applicable than in the way the pass laws are being applied at the present time in South Africa. Something like three thousand people a day are convicted of offences of which no White man can be guilty. Do they think, Sir, that that does not bring the law into disrepute? Do they think that that does not lead to bad feelings between White and non-White in South Africa?</p>

<p>Let me give you another example of these irritating, absurd restrictions which make it difficult for a man who wants work and who happens to be outside a city, to get work in that city. When he has found an employer who wants him, and he wants to take up a vacant position in one of our cities, he frequently has to get the approval of no less than five authorities before he can take up that post. Very often it takes as much as six weeks. Very often the job has been filled by somebody else when he ultimately gets there.</p>

<p><span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_0655"/>Then, Sir, you have the position of a man who has been living lawfully with his wife in a Bantu township. He dies, and the wife, who has been there all her life, sharing her home with her husband, finds that she and her children are evicted because she has no right to stay there on her own. Do you know, there are other ridiculous provisions. A man who wants to get married can get a girl from a prescribed area anywhere in South Africa, even a thousand miles away, and bring her into the prescribed area in which he lives once they are married. But if she happens not to be in a prescribed area, even if she is 50 or 60 miles away, she cannot come and live with her husband inside the prescribed area in which he is living. This is the sort of thing that is understandable to the Bantu people.</p>

<p>And then, Sir, you get the daily hurtful sort of things, as arose at Duiwelskloof where, on the 50th anniversary of that institution, a distinguished Indian doctor who had been working at the hospital for more than 10 years, could not attend the celebrations for one reason or another. Can you imagine, Sir, what that man feels like? Can you imagine what the people in that institution felt like? We had another case not so long ago at Oudtshoorn. We had the case of a Coloured doctor with a patient whom he brought to the hospital, and who needed an immediate operation. He was well capable of performing it, but he was not allowed to perform it in that hospital because there were no non-White staff, and no other was available. They had to wait for a White doctor to come along, who ultimately performed the operation, but the patient lost her life. Sir, this is the sort of thing that is going on; this is the sort of thing that is causing hurt and unhappiness in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister said once in this House that if any case could be brought to him where apartheid was applied unnecessarily, that is to say, in circumstances where it was not necessary in order to prevent race friction or to retain the identity of groups, then he would see to it that those cases would not recur. I wonder, Sir, wh&#x00E1;t the hon. the Prime Minister thinks about cases of the kind I have just put before him. I wonder what he thinks of a leading article that appeared in <i>Rapport</i> on the 29th October last year. They dealt with the case of an Indian doctor at Duiwelskloof, and they went on to say &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">In Pretoria over &#x2019;n professor &#x2019;n vergeefse stryd om Blanke N.G. Kerke sover te kry om hulle sale wat leeg staan, vir dienste vir Nieblankes beskikbaar te stel, en in albei gevalle &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say, Duiwelskloof and the case in Pretoria&#x2014;</p>

<p>Then the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie gebeurtenisse onderstreep die stelling wat ons &#x2019;n paar weke gelede gemaak het.

<p>Sir, has the hon. the Prime Minister done anything about this? Has he got anybody looking into incidents of this kind causing so much trouble in order to ensure that this kind of thing will not happen in the future, with all the trouble and difficulties which arise from it? What do we find, Sir? We find this situation. We have been told in the past that when independence came, then, of course, things would be changed. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs said at the United Nations that self-development was non-discriminatory. Sir, what is going to happen if these states get independence and their citizens visit South Africa? Are they going to be treated as they are being treated at the present time, or are they going to get the treatment meted out to distinguished visitors from foreign states who are allowed to go to all the areas where Whites go and to enjoy the same facilities, the same hotels and things of that kind? I would like to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether it is his policy at the moment that things will change when these areas get independence. We see what happens with Black diplomats here in South Africa. We see the manner in which they are protected against the <span class="col_1285-1286" refersTo="page_0656"/>apartheid laws and the humiliating practices. What is going to happen when the Bantustans are independent and tourists from well-disposed Black states come to visit us in South Africa? Are distinguished visitors from foreign states going to be barred from the Nico Malan Theatre? Sir, we heard what the honourable Ambassador in Rome said about the ban at the Nico Malan Theatre. Are distinguished Black visitors from overseas going to be banned from that theatre? Are they going to have to stand in separate queues at the post offices when they come here? I ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, these are the questions that people are asking themselves today. They are saying, &#x201C;Well, if independence comes it may be different.&#x201D; But what is going to happen if they do not want independence? Then, Sir, you are in the same position with these Bantu as you are with the Coloured and Indian communities at the present time. There is no independence for them. Is petty apartheid going to be perpetuated with them for all time? This is a question that one wants answered. Sir, I am afraid that a lot of this is happening because hon. gentlemen opposite want to assert their superiority and their exclusiveness even at the expense of the dignity of other people. Because not one of these things is necessary to retain our separate identities or to avoid race friction. We want an answer from the hon. the Prime Minister. Is he prepared and willing to see bitterness and inter-racial hostility grow in South Africa until resentment becomes hatred and hostility that can lead to violence developing in South Africa?

<p>That is not me, Sir; it is not the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, but Mr. Willem van Heerden of Rapport-uitgewers. Do you think he got the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to write his speech for him? Now you can talk about out-Japie-ing Japie. Sir, here we are in this position. When bad feeling is growing, the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government sit still. Nowhere do we hear of the position being investigated in the hope of improving the situation. Members on this side have said that if the hon. gentleman wants to appoint a committee to go into the amelioration of the hurts of petty apartheid we will be only too pleased to try to help. Sir, these people go on in their own way, I almost said in their own lunatic way. What has happened in regard to our sports policy? Here we are in desperate straits in regard to our tour in New Zealand, and look at the contradictions and inconsequential decision we have had in respect of sport. You can send a mixed athletics team overseas but you cannot send a mixed cricket team. You can have a mixed athletic meeting here in South Africa if it is an international one, and even if other nations do not turn up, Blacks can play soccer against Whites and Coloureds against Blacks and Whites, but you cannot have a White cricket team playing cricket against a Black cricket team if they are both South Africans. You can <span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_0657"/>have mixed trials for tennis, but you cannot have mixed trials for cricket. You can bring an English rugby side out here, a Lions side, and they can play against the Coloureds and the Bantu, but the South African Rugby Union is not allowed to pick a team on merit to represent South Africa outside South Africa.</p>

<p>You know, Sir, when you get these ridiculous contradictions, when you get these inconsequential results, then one wonders where South Africa is heading and what the result is going to be. Time and again we have said that in this sphere we have always accepted as the guideline, the overriding theme, that we should respect the right of groups to have their own exclusive amenities but that there should be an area of choice and freedom to share amenities where that is desired between the people concerned. And naturally, because we have a federal philosophy and approach, it is in the nature of things that we oppose the whole dogmatic and bureaucratic apparatus of petty apartheid. We want to see a suitable measure of autonomy for each community in matters which are of direct concern to itself. We want to see provisions for adequate machinery for continuous consultation between the various groups with regard to current and future personal as well as constitutional relations. We accept that what is desired in South Africa is evolution and not revolution. In social and cultural affairs we accept that the various communities have a right to strive to maintain their own identity but separation merely for the sake of separation, which invades the dignity of others, cannot be tolerated. That is why we say the time has come for the Prime Minister and for this Government and for the whole of South Africa to settle down and to examine the situation; because particularly as the result of the statement of the hon. the Prime Minister the other day, which envisages the continuance of the present state of affairs for those Bantu groups that he thought would be asking for independence, this is becoming an infinitely more serious matter.</p>

<p>But it is becoming infinitely more serious in respect also of another community. It is becoming infinitely more serious in respect of the urban Bantu as we know them in South Africa at the present time. I do not speak of the urban Bantu in a blanket way. I realize that there are two types. There are those permanently settled in the urban areas and there are the migrant labourers. Let us look at what this policy is doing for them, because, as the hon. the Prime Minister says, if they will not accept independence things will continue as they are. Then the unfortunate situation which is developing with these people, which we thought might be ended one day, will become more and more serious. I have said in this House many times that the urban Bantu is the flash-point for race conflict in South Africa. This Government regards them &#x201C;as mense binne &#x2019;n volksverband&#x201D;&#x2014;people belonging to a nation somewhere. Because they belong to a nation somewhere, it is necessary to alienate their goodwill towards the White people for generations to come? Why is it that because they belong to another nation, they are not allowed home-ownership in the townships in which they live? Why is it that they are not allowed any secure family life? Why is it that they can go nowhere else but to the White areas to earn a living? There is certainly no living for them in the reserves. However, in the place that they work and live, they cannot enjoy the elementary rights of a normal human civilized man. The hon. the Prime Minister spoke once before of the various committees which have been created. Of what help are they? They are established to try to maintain the link between these people who are permanently settled in the urban areas and the Bantu homelands from which they are believed to come but with which they have no links at all any more. All this is done solely to retain this tribal affiliation.</p>

<p>What is the position with the urban Bantu? He lives permanently in the urban Bantu areas, but he has insecurity in so far as his job is concerned, because there are many jobs today which he is allowed to do if there is no White man available. If a White man is available, he loses that job and the White man takes it. He has insecurity. Even if a Coloured or an Indian is available he loses that job in many cases. So, he has insecurity about his job. He has no ownership in that township. He has no stake in the maintenance of law and order. He has no executive or administrative involvement on behalf of his own people. He gets no adequate training for a job because there are no training facilities available in the Bantu townships. Training facilities are available in the homelands or sometimes in border industries. Seldom does he get adequate schooling for his children after the primary stage, because <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_0658"/>secondary schooling is reserved for the homelands.</p>

<p>What does he find at the end of his life? Does he have any security? Can he stay where he has worked all his life&#x2014;in the Bantu township in which he was born? No, this Government is trying to force him out. They are trying to force him to a resettlement camp. They are trying to force him to go to a homeland somewhere to start life all over again. Every pressure is put on him to send him back to homelands which they hope may get independence and where he may be one of the first to be hostile to South Africa. Is this the way to keep these people on our side in the difficult times in which we are living? Is this the way to prevent agitation? When one asks oneself these questions, one wonders where this Government is going.</p>

<p>There is a second group of people who live in these Bantu townships, and these are migrant labourers. They come on contract. I know that this migrant labour system has been in operation in many parts of the world for very many years. We have seen it in Europe, in the Common Market, where by agreement amongst the members of the Common Market countries, they have a special charter protecting the interests of migrant labour. We have seen it in the United States of America. We have seen it in Central Africa. We have seen it in West Africa. We have seen it in South Africa. The result is that the advantages and the evils are well known, especially to the churches.</p>

<p>What are those evils? They have no security. They come on contract for a period. They have no proper training. When they finish their period of contract, although they are supposed to be able to come back to the same boss, so often that does not happen for one reason or another. I know how often I have lost good men who went back and wanted to return and something happened, and they never get back to the same boss. We know all the evils of this system, Sir. I need not outline them. They are known to every church in South Africa. Historically, they have been the focus for all the trouble in South Africa. They suffer from a lack of mobility. They cannot negotiate for improved wages. Their wages are low because invariably the employer has to keep more than he needs, because he cannot get replacements on time. What hope have they for advancement? Mr. Speaker, one would think that any Government would like to be busy reducing this group; but do you realize, Mr. Speaker, that it is the policy of this Government to increase the size of that group, not to reduce it? This is something that is condemned in every country in the world. One would have thought that a Government sensitive to the situation would have been busy trying to reduce this group; but no, Sir, this Government is increasing it. It is increasing it, because its policy in respect of our non-European situation has in view contradictory goals. You see, on the one hand they want separate development; on the other hand they want economic growth. On the one hand, what do they ask for? They believe that all should be gathered in their respective homelands, with the Bantu workers temporary sojourners in the White area. On the other hand, they want steady economic growth, more urbanization, more men working in and around the towns. The only good way you could reconcile those two contradictory aims is by migrant labour, the very evil that is at the root of most of our troubles in South Africa. What is happening at the present time?</p>

<p>The economic forces which lead to the development of migrant labour systems in other countries of the world are fading away in South Africa. What brought that man to work here, and what made him want to go home when his contract was over? I think we have to distinguish between two types of men: What they call the &#x201C;subsistence migrant&#x201D;, who came to work because he had to earn for his family in the homeland, and what they call the &#x201C;bicycle migrant&#x201D;&#x2014;he came because he wanted to buy a bicycle, or a wife, a gun or something of that sort. When he had earned enough, he was prepared to go back. But now more and more the employer, who was glad to have a big turnover and send them back, because it was cheap labour, is finding that cheap labour is not cheap any more. He wants trained, sophisticated labour. He cannot train the contract labourer. It does not pay, and he cannot keep him long enough. What do you find? The forces which attracted that man back to his homeland are fading away. Why did he go back in the past? He went back because there was security for his old age. That no longer exists. More and more he goes back to the homelands in which there is not only no security for his old age, but where his family themselves cannot make a living unless supported by him from outside. So, <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_0659"/>the economic forces that would have made this a voluntary operation are now no longer operating. The only way to keep it operating, is to enforce it by law and with police action. That is the whole answer to the increase in prosecutions under the pass laws in South Africa. Year by year the numbers go up. Year by year we have more prosecutions for the simple reason that the economic forces which made this an acceptable system, which would have resulted in this system being introduced in any other country, are being weakened here in South Africa and are no longer applying. The result is that all that is causing this contract migrant labour to continue is the force of law and police action by the Government. Do you realize what we are paying for it, Sir? Do you realize what the effects are in South Africa? I will concede at once that in the case of the subsistence migrant who goes from the homeland to work in the town and sends his money back, his family is better off than if he did not do it. But there is a redistribution of wealth taking place, because since he is no longer there he no longer takes responsibility for as wide a group as he did when he was a breadearner in the reserves himself. More and more there tends to be a redistribution, because the man keeps more for himself as his wants have increased in the urban area where he is living and he is sending back less and less to his wife and children.</p>

<p>But there is a second thing that is happening as a result of this. As a result of this migrant labour system the rural areas are having to finance the urban areas and subsidize them in South Africa. What is happening is that they are subsidizing urban development, because those urban areas do not have to supply permanent housing, permanent amenities, or anything of that nature. An hon. member, lately in Rome, said that you must not make a Bantu township too attractive so that they would not want to go back to the reserves. What has been happening is that the rural areas have been subsidizing urban development because of this policy. That is the very opposite of what the Government desires with its policy, but this is the effect and they do not seem to realize it.</p>

<p>The third thing it is doing in South Africa is that it is creating and making permanent a differential wage structure. It is making permanent a differential wage structure between the man who is permanently in the Bantu township and the man who is a migrant, but more particularly between the Black man who is a migrant and the White man who is not. The result is that, instead of moving towards narrowing the gap which the hon. the Prime Minister states is one of his objectives, the gap will have to widen if this process is allowed to go on and the economic forces which result from it come into play. That is why the Government finds it so hard to narrow the wage gap, because this migrant labour system pulls economically in the other direction. It is the one thing they have never seemed to realize. Let me give an example. The pass laws today operate in favour of the goldmines as against industry. Anyone can get to a goldmine provided he is fit, but to get into industry there are all kinds of restrictions and things to be overcome. The result is that the ratio of the average European wage to the average African wage in industry is five to one; on the mines it is 20 to one. It is a perfect example of the result of differential wages developing because of the operation of this migrant labour system.</p>

<p>Then there is one more point, namely that migrant labour perpetuates poverty. If only I can get this to be accepted and understood by members on the other side of the House. This migrant labour system perpetuates poverty, because it perpetuates a trading in inefficient and incompetent labour whom it does not pay you to train. You cannot keep him long enough to make a capital investment in your labour and in addition you are faced with the cost of turnover, the travelling backwards and forwards. You are faced with the fact that this prevents girls from earning in the family and it prevents what is called the hidden investment in homes and gardens which the man might contribute over the weekend when he is not actually working in his job. Actually it creates unemployment as well because of the red tape at both ends, the man wanting to come and the employer applying for the individual concerned.</p>

<p>I am not going to talk about the other evils, the social evils, the social costs, of this system. These are so great that they are known to everybody. They have been condemned by every church in South Africa. What does all this mean to the employer? Here is your employer and these are the two types of labour available. It means he is faced with uncertainty as to his labour supplies and with an inefficient sort of labour. He has to employ <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_0660"/>more people than he needs, because of the difficulty of getting replacements. Costs of production are going up. It means that all this is being done because they are afraid to give these people more security and are trying to push development in the direction of border industries where frequently they are uneconomic and cannot compete. You can only protect your border industries by protecting existing industries in South Africa and giving the border industries better conditions as regards pay, wage determinations, leave, transport, taxes and things of that kind. What is the result? At a time like this, the rate of economic development of South Africa has been slowed up, the standard of living of everyone has been kept down artificially&#x2014;all for a system which is leading to the undermining of the safety in South Africa and which is preventing fast economic growth which is vital for the security of our children in South Africa.</p>

<p>I have dealt many times in this House with the United Party&#x2019;s alternative and do not think it necessary to deal with it again here this morning. I think what is important is that there should be another approach, that these people should be recognized as an essential part of the national economy, that we accept that they cannot do without us and we cannot do without them and that we regulate, guide and control their integration into that economy. You will realize, Sir, that that is in direct contradiction to Government policy because the Government wants to keep them as temporary sojourners in the White areas. That is one of the reasons why we in the United Party are looking to other solutions. We see difficulties arising in South Africa and we see the policies of this Government accentuating those difficulties.</p>

<p>That is why we have looked to a federal solution&#x2014;a federal solution under a new Government, a federal solution in which each group will have a large degree of control over the matters of intimate concern to itself; and in which there will be a liaison between this Parliament and the various groups through the standing statutory committees; and in which there will be a federal assembly in which matters of common concern can be discussed and to which powers can be devolved with the passage of time as confidence grows.</p>

<p>What have been the attacks on this policy? I suggest that those attacks do not hold water at all. The first attack on this policy was to pretend that they did not understand it. Even the Chief Whip of the Nationalist Party understands it today, and that is saying a lot. You can see how his questions have changed in the course of this debate and the No-confidence debate.

There you have it. It is as simple as that. The hon. gentleman wants to know: How are you going to elect the members to that federal assembly? We have told him it will be determined by the contribution of each group to the country generally and to the well-being of the State. We have told him there will be economic considerations. There will be other considerations as well. This is a matter that will be hammered out by negotiation between the <span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_0661"/>groups. What more does he want to know? I remember reading not so long ago one Nationalist political correspondent talking about the uncertainties of Government policy in respect of the Coloured and Indian people. He said&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#louw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place, Mr. Speaker, it is a very special privilege to me as a newcomer to this dignified House steeped in tradition, to be able to take part in the proceedings of this House and to find myself here in the company of so many respected, devoted and leading members of this House. To me it is a privilege to be able to learn from the maturity and experience of the hon. members of this House and in particular to be able to act before you, Mr. Speaker, and to respect your guidance and admonition. To me it is indeed a special and memorable occasion.</p>

<p>In the second place, I should like to convey the gratitude of my constituency to my predecessor, Senator Van Staden, who gave many years of service.</p>

<p>In the third place, I should like to confine myself to my subject, but I would never have thought I would take the floor after the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. My benchmate said I was to answer, but as I do not have my cuttings available, I shall confine myself to my subject in respect of which I trust I shall gain the support of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, too, and my subject is an evaluation of the system of transfer duties with a view to adjusting it so as to serve as a stimulant to our ever-growing housing needs.</p>

<p>I should like to start at the beginning of this century, in the year 1900, when 35% of all White inhabitants of South Africa lived in the urban complexes. Today the percentage is 85, and by the year 2000 it will be at least 95. The movement of the population from the rural areas to the cities is unstoppable. In addition to this it is anticipated that the White population will double its numbers during the next 27 years, viz. by the year 2000. Apart from that we experience even now that some of the larger urban municipalities have doubled, on the average, their number of inhabitants every ten years over the past two or three decades. If one puts all these factors together, one comes face to face with one major problem, and that is the rapid provision of sufficient housing. It is accepted too readily and too often by too many people that the Government should provide housing and finance housing forthwith, quite wrongly so, because the Government most definitely is not an arbitrary distributor of alms and of subsidies, except in exceptional cases. It is, however, much more important that people should see to their own housing needs.</p>

<p>It is much more important that every person should be encouraged to obtain his house and dwelling unit himself, and, as far as possible, to do so without any financing from the Government, but that all possible aids should be made available for this purpose so as to inspire and encourage all people to realize this ideal and aspiration. One of the biggest obstacles in the way of many potential home owners is and remains the high cost of transfer; not the attorneys&#x2019; fees which are reasonable meagre!&#x2014;hut the exceptionally high transfer duties and the accompanying stamp duties. It is significant that transfer duties were first levied in the province of Holland in 1529 and that this system was adopted by South Africa and was imposed here in 1686 for the first time. It is even more significant to note that most of the developed countries of the world have abolished transfer duties altogether or have abolished in part this ambiguous form of property taxation. Even Rhodesia abolished it altogether ten years ago.</p>

<p>This morning I am not, however, advocating the total abolition of transfer duties and the accompanying stamp duties, particularly not when one has regard to the fact that this source yielded a total revenue of approximately R50 million in the current financial year, which, incidentally, is R30 million more than it was five years <span class="col_1297-1298" refersTo="page_0662"/>ago. For any source of revenue which is abolished on the one hand, one has to find another on the other hand. What I am advocating is in fact a fresh evaluation of our system and method of levying duties in South Africa. I gladly advocate a complete readjustment of the system and the highest degree of relief possible, or as an alternative, a more favourable adjustment of the rebates on transfer duties which were introduced by the Government in 1964, but which apply only to property values not exceeding R15 000. In their time these rebates were a tremendous incentive, and they still are a great help. These rebates provided for a reduction of two-thirds of the transfer duties on property transactions not exceeding R5 000, for a 50% reduction on property transactions of between R5 000 and R10 000, and for a reduction of one-third on property transactions of between R10 000 and R15 000. Inflation, the devaluations which we experienced and the continual rise in prices make it even more difficult today to acquire housing, including the plot, below this present rebate ceiling of R15 000.</p>

<p>The total consumers&#x2019; price index on all goods in South Africa has risen by 46% from 1964 up to the present time. It stands to reason that it is extremely difficult to determine the actual rise in respect of plots, the costs of building materials and labour since 1964 up to the present time, but if a projection is made on the basis of the figures of the consumers&#x2019; price index, one may estimate conservatively that the then rebate ceiling of R15 000 will probably be equal to at least R22 000 today.</p>

<p>Sir, how much do these transfer duties actually amount to? Let us dwell briefly on two examples. A farmer who buys a farm for R100 000 pays a total transfer fee, that is all inclusive, amounting to R4 850. But what is significant in this regard is that 96% of this amount goes to the Government in the form of transfer duties and accompanying stamp duties. The remaining 4%, after provision has been made for miscellaneous expenses, if anything should still be left, is the meagre wage of the attorney. By the way, Mr. Speaker, perhaps that is one of the important reasons why so many attorneys exchange the practice for Parliament! In the second place we have the case of a man who buys a house for R20 000. He pays transfer fees amounting to a total of R950, and of this amount R817-50 represents transfer duties and stamp duties alone, in other words 86% of the total. On the basis of the usual, inevitable first bond which usually goes hand in hand with the transaction and which is usually registered at the same time as the deed of transfer, another R150 is added, on which, incidentally, stamp duties are also levied on a smaller percentage basis, and that amount of R150 added to the amount of R950, gives us a total of R1 100.</p>

<p>Sir, this potential home-owner must lay out R1 100 before he has paid off one cent on the purchase price of his property. Today this is a gigantic struggle for many people, even an impossible task, to acquire the usual 10% or 20% deposit on the purchase price. Many people can in fact afford high monthly instalments, but few people can discipline themselves to save a relatively large amount in order to use it for this necessity. The additional cash required for transfer duties and stamp duties, often renders this impossible. People can either buy nothing, or resort to malpractices, or methods of evasion are created in an attempt to overcome these obstacles.</p>

<p>&#x2020;These popular methods of evasion usually give rise to actions with a detrimental effect, such as the following: Firstly, the addition to the purchase price, often an inflated purchase price, of the transfer costs, together with a substantial amount of capitalized interest, whereafter payment of transfer costs is effected by the seller but whereafter, unfortunately, the purchaser is penalized with a burden of a substantially increased purchase price and accordingly substantially increased monthly repayments on his bond; and at the same time, Sir, the seller also runs a very high risk because quite often he may find himself in the position that he has to retransfer and once again pay transfer duty on this property in the event of the purchaser committing a breach of contract under the terms of his first or second bond in favour of the seller. The purchaser is particularly vulnerable in these cases, as he usually carries a heavy mortgage liability, very often varying between 90% and 100% of the purchase price. Secondly, Sir, more and more transfers are being effected in the name of companies, with a subsequent change of ownership by way of share transfer, thus evading payment of transfer duty entirely. Surely this is a practice which should not be encouraged, especially not in the case of residential properties.</p>

<p>Not many purchasers, Sir, are keen on <span class="col_1299-1300" refersTo="page_0663"/>being burdened with the necessity of complying with company law requirements. They are reluctantly compelled to do so, since it is the lesser of two evils when a choice has to be made between the payment of excessive transfer duty and stamp duty and, on the other hand, taking transfer by way of shares. Thirdly, there are unfortunately instances of false affidavits disclosing inaccurate property values. I fully realize that these evils cannot be efficiently avoided or overcome, but I candidly believe that these evils could be effectively reduced. I wish to plead fervently, Sir, for the complete revision of the transfer duty tariff, and particularly for a sympathetic and favourable concession to all purchasers of immovable property required for farming and residential purposes, irrespective of whether the purchaser intends occupying this property personally or whether occupation will be taken by a third party or by a nominated party or by a tenant. I feel that preferably, on account of certain technicalities, such concession should also be without the present requirement or stipulation of a maximum property value ceiling as qualification for the rebate. Without the present stipulation, the development of the unimproved property, in other words the vacant plot, should take place within a reasonable period, which reasonable period is being interpreted by the Receiver of Revenue as a two-year period in order to qualify for rebates. The young purchaser who realizes that he first has to pay for his plot, which can often take many years, and that he can only commence development thereafter, has to take a very difficult decision; either he signs an affidavit as required by the Receiver of Revenue to the effect that he intends building and occupying within a two-year period, in which case he would qualify for his rebate and there would be a saving of R100 to R150, or otherwise he decides to be honest, not to make the affidavit and to pay a penalty of R100 to R150, as the case may be, for his honesty. Sir, this is a very difficult decision indeed for a poor man. Why should a young man who has the determination to buy a plot of land and to attend conscientiously to the payment of regular monthly instalments, be penalized because he cannot pay sufficient money in the shortest possible period, namely within the prescribed period of two years? This man should not be penalized. This man should be respected. He should be praised and encouraged. I fully realize that criticism could quite rightly be directed against the obvious or the undisclosed speculator who enters into a property transaction for profit. It can quite easily be argued that this man should pay transfer duty at a higher tariff. There is, however, some justification for the argument that also the speculator is performing a very important task, namely the provision of much-needed accommodation. On the other hand, should this really create a serious problem, the obvious remedy would be a penalty transfer duty levied on all sellers selling within a prescribed period, plus the fact that the Receiver of Revenue, in the case of a professional speculator, would also take his fair share of income tax.</p>

<p>*I believe, Mr. Speaker, that a favourable readjustment of our present policy of transfer duties and stamp duties will be nothing but a gigantic step in the right direction in that it must inevitably lead to the active encouragement of individual home ownership; in that it will inevitably serve as an additional injection in the present condition of semi-stagnation in the building industry; in that it will make a substantial contribution to the realization of the ideal of a more rapid development of the very large number of vacant plots in the larger urban complexes of our country. In the Greater Cape Peninsula alone there are 50 000 open plots. During the past few years an average of only 4% of these plots were developed per year. Moreover, this ought to lead to only a limited reduction in revenue for the Government, because of the bigger anticipated turnover, because of increased growth and, in particular, because of the fact that substantially more transfers may be expected as a result of the transfer of dwelling units or flats in terms of the recent Sectional Titles Act, and especially if a favourably adjusted system could be established which could encourage property buyers preferably to take transfer instead of buying by way of share transactions.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that the favourable readjustment of our policy of transfer duties and stamp duties could be one of the biggest single contributory factors to, in the first place, encouraging a pride of ownership and thrift in the individual: in the second place, cultivating in the individual, in the midst of constantly rising prices and inflation, an awareness of the security value and resistance of property to the consuming money erosion; and finally, <span class="col_1301-1302" refersTo="page_0664"/>and in particular, in that it could encourage and enable a substantially larger number of people to own a home of their own, which is the individual&#x2019;s duty towards himself and his family and the State, and not the duty of the State towards the individual, except in so far as aids are concerned, such as this aid which I am advocating so anxiously today.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to express the gratitude of my colleagues and myself for this opportunity to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House notes with appreciation the able and sympathetic assistance rendered to the agricultural industry by the Government, and is of the opinion that the industry will to an increasing extent have to assist in supplying the steadily growing demand for foodstuffs and other agricultural products in Africa and the rest of the world.</block>

<p>We in South Africa are in the exceptionally fortunate position of having several key industries at our disposal. We think, for example, of the gold-mining industry of South Africa, the steel industry, the oil-from-coal and various other industries. However, when one considers these key industries of South Africa, there is one which stands out prominently over the others, one which not only stands out but in addition catches one&#x2019;s eye because it glitters like a sparkling diamond with different facets. One can turn this agricultural industry of ours to any angle and find there is always a facet which reflects far and wide and tangibly over the South African national economy. We think of one of its facets, the maize industry, which in normal times is worth R350 million to our country. We think of another facet, the wine-producing industry. This is an industry which has been built up and expanded over centuries here at the Cape by means of hard work, knowledge and skill, into one of the most sophisticated industries in our country. It is an industry which has with its choice products won a name not only for itself but for South Africa far beyond our borders. Another facet of the agricultural industry is the wool industry, which has over many years earned South Africa many millions of rands.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, however, that although gold, steel and oil are precious to us, we would be able to get along without these products if we had to. There is one industry which South Africa and its people, and the world and its people, will not be able to do without for one day, and that is the agricultural industry with its agricultural products. According to United Nation reports the world population is at present 380 000 million people. I want to state, without fear of contradiction, that each of these 380 000 million people needs the produce of the farmer every day of his life, for without it he could not survive. If anyone wishes to dispute this statement I ask him to wait until the hunger pangs gnaw at his body, to wait until the biting cold of winter slices through his body and then he will pause to reflect and realize that the farmer, of all people, is mankind&#x2019;s greatest benefactor and provider throughout the world.</p>

<p>The Americans have established that it costs them 8 000 dollars on foodstuffs alone to feed a baby girl from the day of her birth to her 18th year. It costs 8 900 dollars on foodstuffs to feed a young boy from birth to his 18th year. Another expert asserts with authority that a person who eats and drinks correctly and has the right living habits will with great ease, humanly speaking, attain the age of 70 years. He then divided up these 70 years of man into categories and found that the person who has attained the age of 70 years, has slept for 23 years, worked for 19, played for <span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_0665"/>nine, eaten for six, travelled for six, was confined to bed owing to illness for four, has spent two years dressing and has worshipped for one. If one then scrutinizes this analysis further, one reluctantly arrives at the conclusion that in these categories of man&#x2019;s span of 70 years, not one day goes by, whatever he is doing, in which he is not subjected to the beneficial effect of the produce of the farmer, to that of the agricultural industry. He has slept for 23 years, and in that time the food in his body has generated energy and strength for the next day&#x2019;s daily tasks. For nine years he has played. When Dawie De Villiers led his men out on to the international playing fields they wore on their feet boots made from the produce of the South African cattle farmer and jerseys and socks made from the wool of the South African wool farmer. One can in this way consider every period in the life of man, and the farmer&#x2019;s produce is present there.</p>

<p>This expert calculation that man has worshipped for one year, gave me food for sober reflection. I then thought of the good practice of our Christian people to celebrate the Lord&#x2019;s Supper every three months. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, in these most profound, most serious moments of man&#x2019;s existence, when he bows his head and looks deeply into his soul and his spiritual life, when he breaks the bread, it is bread made from the wheat kernels of the grain farmer, and when he pours the wine, it is wine made from the vineyards and the winepress of the Boland wine farmer. For that reason I believe the day will come when mankind will have to pause and say that its greatest benefactor is the farmer. I also hope that the day will come when non-farming people, the public, the consumers, will rid themselves of the often unjustified prejudice against the farmer, and will realize that the farmer is the person responsible for the physical well-being of mankind. There are people who fulfil important tasks in life, and each covers a certain aspect of man. In this way the clergyman is responsible for the spiritual side of man, the medical doctor for his health, and the teacher for his education and further scholastic development. But there is one man, the farmer, who is responsible for the whole of man. Hence I believe that the day will still come, as mankind becomes more numerous and the need for the produce of the farmer greater, that mankind will at some stage pause and say: &#x201C;A great many monuments have been erected, but why has not a great monument, even if it is only in our thoughts and our minds, ever been erected to the Unknown Farmer who makes provision for the continued existence of man?&#x201D;</p>

<p>In South Africa we have 90 000 farmers practising their profession on 101 000 farming units, units which in 1969 were valued at R4 887 million. The equipment they used on these units was valued at R674 million. Livestock on these farming units was worth R1 129 million. At the end of 1969 the total value of the South African farmer was R6 690 million.</p>

<p>Recently the South African Agricultural Union made further statistics available in which they maintained authoritatively that the present assets of the South African farmer stood at R7 661 million. What is interesting is that in 1950 the total assets of the South African farmer amounted to R2 900 million. In just over 20 years it has therefore almost trebled. Now, one may with justification ask what the liabilities of the South African Farmer are. I can say the picture is a favourable one. The total liabilities of the South African farmer amount to R1 400 million, or rather 20% of his capital assets. The net income of 90 000 South African farmers last year was something in the region of R600 million.</p>

<p>We are living in a changing world and as times and circumstances change and the demands of the times increase, so the farmer will also have to realize that he will have to keep pace with changing circumstances in a rapidly changing world. He will have to extend and intensify his knowledge of his industry, develop his managerial ability to the utmost, and modernize his methods in a scientific, economic manner. The basis, the foundation of his products should be only the best, then his end product will be attractive, competitive and profitable.</p>

<p>We owe a vote of thanks to our Ministry of Agriculture and its departments for the ever-helping hand which they are only too eager to stretch out to the South African farmer. We think, for example of the extension services, research and financing, the Land Bank, the Agricultural Credit Board, subsidies, drought assistance, subsidies for irrigation, etc. Our department&#x2014;and I wish our farmers would all realize this&#x2014;is always there to provide information and guidance. We thank them for that. Our farmers are producing well. We know that after supplying the domestic demand, <span class="col_1305-1306" refersTo="page_0666"/>we are already exporting large quantities of maize, fruit, wine, citrus, sugar, wool, etc. At the moment there is an industry which is developing rapidly, viz. the vegetable industry. We have the seasonal advantage in our favour. With rapid air transport the farmer can pick vegetables on his farm today and within 24 hours it can be for sale on the markets in Europe. There is one industry for which we have a very soft spot and which should be developed to its full potential for the sake of the farmer and for the sake of South Africa and the world, and that is the beef industry in South Africa which, in my opinion, is still in its infancy.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>It began to develop since this Government came into power. Since last year I have been advocating in this House that greater quantities of our maize crop should be marketed in the form of red meat. At present something like five million bags of maize are being set aside per annum for cattle. I should like to see from 25 to 35 million bags of maize being offered per annum for the production of red meat. We have these two cornerstones. We have the potential of cattle and we have maize; the one must supplement the other. Our present cattle population totals 8 240 000 head of cattle, of which approximately two million are slaughtered annually. If we were to improve and modernize our farming and feeding methods in the beef industry drastically, we could within a few years raise this figure from two to four million. I think the time is passing when the farmer has to wait for three or four years before marketing his livestock. The turnover is too slow and the risk too great. These cattle can be marketed profitably at the age of ten to 18 months, but then the feeding and breeding methods must be the right ones, and the managerial ability of the farmer of a sufficiently high standard. Many of our farmers are inclined to let cattle which have built up good reserves of meat and fat this summer on good summer veld winter over, only to lose that meat and fat they built up that summer and in the following summer he needs half the period of a good summer to allow his animals to regain the weight of meat and fat which they lost during the winter. If the cattle farmer is unable to prepare his stock for market rapidly, he must send them to the feeder who is. In America 70% of the cattle that are marketed came from the feeding pens; in South Africa only 10%. If we were to follow America&#x2019;s example in this, I foresee our being self-sufficient in our meat requirements, so that we will no longer need to import red meat from our neighbouring states. More than that, we will be able to export 1 500 000 beef carcasses to the value of R150 to R200 million per annum.</p>

<p>There is one matter which I find a little disturbing, and that is that last year farmers sent 112 411 heifers, 63 667 bulls, 1 067 035 oxen and, please note, 561 945 cows to the abattoirs. Last year approximately 30% of the total number of cattle slaughtered were cows and heifers. I concede that there are barren cows and heifers among these animals, but this figure is nevertheless too high. I do not think it is necessary for us to send more than 15% of cows and heifers to the abattoirs. These heifers and productive cows should be kept and utilized for further beef production. If we did this, we would be able to help contribute a small share towards supplying a great world-wide meat shortage. Last year the United Kingdom imported 436 000 tons of red meat; this is equal to one million large beef carcasses per annum. The United States imported 811 000 tons of red meat, equal to two million beef carcasses per annum. I can continue in this vein. The E.E.C. countries allege that they will have a beef shortage of 500 000 tons this year, which is equal to plus-minus 2&#x00BD; million head of cattle. The beef consumption in these countries increased as follows between 1966 and 1970: In 1966 it was 1 643 000 tons and in 1970 it was 2 127 000 tons; that is to say an increase in five years of 484 000 tons, which is equal to plus-minus 1&#x00BC; million head of cattle. There we have it. The demand for red meat is tremendous. I think that our Government and the South African farmer should be prepared to accept this challenge. The Government will, we know, continue to provide the South African farmer with information and guidance. We are grateful that this Government has already made a start on the improvement of slaughtering facilities. I hope that the department will be able in some way or other to place a damper on the slaughter of heifers and productive cows.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the marketing of the farmer&#x2019;s produce overseas. I do not <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_0667"/>know whether this is still the case, but I know that in the past officials of another department, the Department of Trade and Industries, were responsible for the marketing of farmers&#x2019; produce overseas. To my mind this is not correct, and I think it is unfair to expect a man, an official of another department, to have the knowledge of agricultural produce and to place this produce on the world markets to the full benefit of the farmer. I also feel that our Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing should now and in future make some of their best men available to carry out our marketing in foreign countries.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that over many years our farmers have frequently suffered hardships, and are still at this moment suffering hardships as a result of drought, over-production, poor prices, etc. But I think the tide has turned. I think there are better times in sight for the South African farmer, for as the world population and the population of Africa increases, so the demand will increase. The United Nations states in its statistics that the present number of Bantu in Africa is 354 million, with an increase of 2%, which is equal to seven million per annum. The world population is increasing. As the population increases, available land diminishes. This is unavoidable. As the people become more, the demand for the farmer&#x2019;s produce will become ever greater. For that reason I want to say today that the South African farmer must hold on to his farm, for I believe there are better times ahead for him. In future the South African farmer will have to help supply the food requirements of the world, for the sake of the world, for the sake of South Africa and for the sake of the South African farmer himself.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Heidelberg has introduced this motion for us, but I, and I think the entire House, expected the hon. member to give us a picture of the future, a picture of how this Government and of how South Africa&#x2019;s agricultural industry will in course of time be able to make provision for this tremendous increase in population. The hon. member waxed poetical and almost lyrical over the importance of the industry, and I do not wish to differ with the hon. member on that score. I agree 100% with the hon. member in that respect, but the hon. member&#x2019;s motion mentioned the tremendously sympathetic attitude which we have experienced on the part of the Government over the years in respect of the agricultural industry. I want to test this hypothesis of the hon. member in this motion of his today and see whether it represents the actual situation, for in the first place, if there has been such a tremendously sympathetic attitude on the part of the Government, one would have expected the young people to fall over one another in their eagerness to enter our profession. But what is the actual position? Recently we received a brief r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; from the Department of departmental activities between 1958 and 1972. Let us see what the position there was. Let us now consider our agricultural faculties and the increase in the number of students between 1958 and 1972, i.e. over a period of 14 years. This was now the period of sympathy we received on the part of the Government. If sympathy means anything, it is necessary to do more than merely boast here before us of what amounts are being spent annually on subsidizing maize for example, or the wheat industry, and on subsidizing the consumer in this way. This is general practice throughout the world. What one is looking for are the principles and approach of a Government to create general confidence in an industry. I say that in this case there are irresistible signs that the general confidence in our industry were not such that that hon. member can now say that it was the sympathetic attitude of the Government which brought prosperity and progress to our agricultural industry. Let us consider these figures. One page 43 of this report it is stated that in 1958 there were 1 069 enrolled students. In 1972 1 136 had been enrolled, an increase of 67 agricultural students over that period. In other words, there was nothing more than an approximate 7% improvement over that period of 14 years. This, to my mind, is a test of whether the sympathy shown by the Government has in any way had an effect. Let us, for example, consider the students enrolled at agricultural colleges. It is interesting to note that at Glen, for example, there were 71 enrolled students in 1958. In 1972 there were 65, while they have accommodation for 75. Let us consider Potchefstroom. In 1958 there were 106, and in 1972 still only 106.</p>

<p>No, wait a minute now. Nothing is said in the hon. member&#x2019;s motion of what happened before that time. He is now discussing the sympathetic attitude of this Government. If he had wanted to discuss those years, he should have embodied it in his motion. Let us now consider the position in the case of Potchefstroom. As I was saying, there were 106 students in 1958, and at present there are still only 106. At Grootfontein there were 245 students in 1958. There are now 27 students, while there is accommodation for 92, and one of the student hostels there was closed down because there was no increase in the number of students. The total number of agricultural students in 1958 was 573, and in 1972 the total is 442, a decrease of 131. Then the hon. member says he is proud, and thanks the Government for the sympathetic attitude it has displayed to the farmers during the past years. Sir, here he has striking proof that matters did not progress as they should have done if it had in fact been the position that there was a sympathetic attitude on the part of the Government. So I can go on to quote further and indicate what the position is in respect of the increase in our extension officers. The hon. member said in his speech that the demand for red meat was so tremendous and that the Government would do everything in that connection and that it would make more extension services available. Sir, has there been a tremendous improvement over the past 14 years under this Government? That is the test which we apply, and not pious and wise words on the importance of our agricultural industry. I am in complete agreement with the hon. member for Heidelberg on the importance of our agricultural industry. I do not differ with him at all on that score, but what South Africa is seeking today more than ever before is an overall picture of where we are going with our agricultural industry.</p>

<p>I want to take the hon. member&#x2019;s statements a little further, by referring him to what Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers said. He had the following to say about the unusual and excellent year we had in 1972 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The department&#x2019;s figures are given in our annual report. The gross value production in 1971-&#x2019;72 was a record R1 532 million, and the net farming revenue another record of R714 million.</block>

<p>Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If there are 90 000 farmers this represents an average income per farmer of R8 000 for the year, the highest average of any country in the world. But what do the farmers look like to you? How do those sitting here feel&#x2014;as if they had had the best year of all times, and had the best farming revenue in the world? No, there is definitely a screw loose somewhere. I state definitely that our information is faulty and incomplete. One reason is of course that we have since 1966 had inflation of about 25% altogether.</block>

<p>Sir, what follows then is interesting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To keep pace with that the gross value of agricultural production should during the past year have been at least R1 650 million, instead of R1 532 million. No wonder then that the farmer does not think it was all that much of a record year.</block>

<block name="quote">Then, at least 20 000 farmers had a gross income during the past record year of less than R1 000, and a net income of less then R500.</block>

<p>Sir, to my mind that is the test&#x2014;and not to come here and boast of a record year, of the wonderful turnover we had. What is the position of the individual farmer? Sir, it is in that way that one tests the sympathy on the part of the Government; it is in that way that one can test whether or not things are really going well with the farmer of South Africa.</p>

<p>The Government does not want to recognize these truths. Over the years we have warned the Government that they should do something to place agricultural financing, for example, on a sound basis. Sir, the farmer is struggling. He is not in the same position as the businessman or the industrialist. He is not always able to add the increased cost, when his production costs increase, to the price of his product immediately; for that reason he is in trouble and for that reason agriculture should in fact receive special attention, and for that reason agricultural financing should not necessarily be viewed on the same basis as the financing of other sectors. That is the reason why the farmers find themselves in difficulties. Sir, we have never reproached this Government when it wanted to give the farmer of South Africa additional financial assistance; we have never stood in its way when it introduced amendments to the Land Bank Act for example; we have never stood in its way when it proposed a change in the agricultural credit system, for we appreciate the need for this. But we are entitled to ask whether the Government has gone far enough in this respect. We feel that we are entitled to move this amendment to the motion of the hon. member because we believe that there is much that is not what it should be in our agricultural industry. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House recognizes the vitally important role that agriculture should play by producing&#x2014;</block>

<li>(b) essential raw materials required by industry, and</li>

<p>and accordingly deplores the mismanagement and lack of forward planning on the part of the Government which have to a great extent crippled this industry, resulting in hardships to both the consumer and the producer.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Now I want to say that in recent years it has become the custom to dismiss criticism which we have expressed in the agricultural sphere as mere talk aimed at talking the agricultural industry away. I expect that we will perhaps have more or less the same thing here today. But to remain quiet about the existence of the problem has not in any way benefited anyone either, and to regard justified criticism as looking for excuses for our industry and for defects in our industry is no longer an acceptable mode of behaviour on the part of that side of the House. Even the present drought, even if it has been broken somewhat now, and we hope that it will soon have been broken completely, even the present drought with its consequences has never brought it home more clearly to us, and brought it home to informed people, how vulnerable our agricultural industry is.</p>

<p>To point out the good agricultural year we had last season is merely a form of escapism. The tremendous agricultural turn over is no criterion for the financially stable position of the individual farmer. I have already quoted the figures furnished by Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers. The position of the individual farmer remains extremely precarious and for that reason it is once again necessary for us to identify the problems of the farmer in this House, even if it has been done repeatedly. The farmer&#x2019;s main financial bottlenecks have built up over the years. Here the persistent increases in production costs have left their ineradicable stamp, in spite of the increased productivity and the efficiency of the farmer himself and the fantastic increase in his production volume. But in recent months the farmer&#x2019;s problems in this respect have proliferated. Last year&#x2019;s devaluation resulted, in many cases, in increased prices, but now comes the aftermath for the farmers. Now come the increased costs and these overtake, to a large extent, the gains that were made. And, when in addition to this, poor climatic conditions are prevailing, the effect has to be far more, and the risk factor worse. Instead of an optimistic outlook the view the farmers take is becoming more pessimistic, no matter how the figures in regard to better productivity and increased net revenue are juggled. For that reason we on this side maintain that increased productivity in itself is not the solution to making the farmer financially stable. Of greater importance is the dividend which he earns on his labour and capital, and whether his earnings improve annually and can keep pace with an increase in the ever-present cost of living. Then we are not even mentioning an increase in the standard of living, to which the farmer, too, is in reality also entitled. In my humble opinion this is the main problem in our agricultural industry. If we do not make the economy of the agricultural industry sound, if we do not succeed in rectifying our agricultural financing, we can talk until we are blue in the faces about soil conservation, about whether or not the department is doing its duty; this will all be of no avail to us, for herein lies the test. Just as in the case of any other industry there has to be financial encouragement for the person who enters and practices this industry. We will only succeed in doing so if we are prepared, as we have on so many occasions already said, to establish an agricultural planning council for this industry. I see that Prof. Grobler of the University of Potchefstroom recently said more or less the same thing when he expressed the opinion that such a body was absolutely essential.</p>

<p>I can, briefly, mention the advantages of having such a body. As we have through the Industrial Development Corporation made tremendous progress in our manufacturing industry, such a body ought to do precisely the same for our agricultural industry. Only when such a body places the industry on a sound footing and when we take the risk factor into account and improve agricultural financing will our agricultural industry enter a better future, and will we in fact be able to say that we appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s having sympathy with the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate adjourned for the lunch hour. I was congratulating the hon. member for Heidelberg on the motion he moved in so excellent a fashion. It is now also my pleasant task to second the hon. member&#x2019;s motion. The hon. member for Newton Park moved an amendment in which he rejects this motion. For the rejection of this motion he used in his argument, in customary fashion, certain criteria. We are already used to the fact that the hon. member uses such criteria on occasions such as this when this side of the House wants to express its thanks and appreciation about certain steps the Government has taken to promote agriculture in South Africa. Furthermore, I want to point to the first criterion he used. He paged through the policy document of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and to imply <span class="col_1315-1316" refersTo="page_0671"/>that the young farmer in South Africa sees no future for agriculture, he quoted from a table of student attendance and student enrolments at our various agricultural colleges. However, if one subjects this table to closer analysis, one comes to the conclusion that things are not as bad as the hon. member whishes to imply. In the first place, for us in South Africa the position is such that the various agricultural colleges are situated in specific production regions. Thus there are Glen in the Free State and Potchefstroom, which must chiefly serve the sowing regions of the high-veld. Then there is also Grootfontein in the Karoo region, chiefly orientated towards training students for the sheep and wool industries. That is what the hon. member uses as a criterion, and then he says there is no future for the farmer. He referred to the position in 1958, when enrolments totalled 245, and then indicated that the figure is now 27. In addition he says that some of the hostels have even closed down because there is no future for the students. I now want to put a question to the hon. member: He is surely as aware as everyone in this House of the great problems the wool industry has been saddled with in recent years. There was the collapse of wool prices and the tremendous droughts that hit the wool farmer. Would the hon. member, as a responsible farmer and a responsible father, at that stage have advised his son to take a sheep and wool course at Grootfontein?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>If one looks at this table, one sees that the decrease in the number of students in that specific college was 218. But let us look at the rest of these colleges. At Elsenburg, near Stellenbosch, there was an increase in the number of students, while the number at Potchefstroom remained fairly constant. It is only logical that interest will vary in accordance with the prospects of the specific branches of the industry.</p>

<p>It has generally been said that we do not know what the position of wool is going to be in the future. We know that the marketing of wool depends chiefly on foreign prices. We do not know either whether artificial fibres are permanently going to pressure wool out of the market. For some or other reason wool prices have increased tremendously in the current year, as have sheep prices. Even slaughtering facilities have improved a great deal.</p>

<p>But the hon. member also used another criterion and then quoted the president of the South African Agricultural Union, i.e. Mr. de la Harpe de Villiers. He says that a percentage of our farmers had tremendous difficulties as the result of cost increases and under inflationistic conditions. I want to agree with the hon. member; that is true. Surely it is then also the duty of the president of the South African Agricultural Union to think of these people. But it is also true that in the past decade there has been great expansion and growth in the agricultural industry. It is also true that there are many farmers in the agricultural industry for whom things are going very well.</p>

<p>If things are going as badly with agriculture as the hon. member alleges, I want to point out to him certain figures made available by the Land Bank. It is interesting to note that land purchases of R31 million in 1967&#x2014;i.e. the amounts requested&#x2014;increased to R70 million in 1971. If things are going badly with the farmers, surely no land transactions would take place. Or rather, there would not be an increase in land transactions. However, the requests for such loans are still growing.</p>

<p>But if, in the light of this motion, one wants to judge the contribution and sympathetic attitude of this Government, there are two questions one must ask oneself in wanting to support this motion. The first is whether agriculture has succeeded in its primary function, i.e. the provision of food and raw materials, or not. Has agriculture supplied sufficient food? Was it freely available? In the second place, could the people of South Africa afford the food that was, in fact, provided? Was it within their means of payment? It can irrefutably be proved that the physical volume of agricultural products increased in recent years. Index figures indicate to us that, notwithstanding the drought, there was an increase in the physical volume of agricultural products of about 5% per year. In some years it was as high as 7,8%. In contrast, our total population increased by a little more than 2%. From this it is evident that more was produced than for mere local needs. We therefore had large surpluses available to <span class="col_1317-1318" refersTo="page_0672"/>export, which made agriculture a large earner of foreign currency.</p>

<p>But to the second question, the conclusive reply is definitely &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, because we in South Africa probably produce the cheapest food in the world. All of us, who have had the privilege of travelling the world, i.e. through the countries of Western Europe and even through the Americas, will agree with this statement.</p>

<p>Another question is whether this is a good achievement in the light of the fact that South Africa is not a particularly good agricultural country. Only about 10% of our total surface area is cultivable. With a view to this, this is an even greater achievement. It could only have been done by the sympathetic assistance and help of the Government. In the 25 years of this Government&#x2019;s rule it has never been necessary to announce one statutory meatless day per week, as in the days of the United Party men. It has never been necessary for us to place restrictions on the quantity of bread our people eat. They could get as much white bread, brown bread or hop-bread as they wanted. But what is important is that the consumption of food products has increased tremendously since 1948. I do not want to allege now that people went hungry in United Party times, but according to the figures they definitely did not get enough food, at least not as much as they wanted.</p>

<p>In 1948 the consumption per year per head in South Africa was 937 pounds. In 1971 the consumption increased to 1 105 pounds per year. But that is not all. The quality of the food that has been provided over this period has improved. The consumption of animal proteins has increased from 30 grams to 33 grams per day. Calorie consumption has increased by 20%, i.e. from 2 500 to 3 000 calories per day. The general protein quality has increased from 72 grams to 88 grams per day. I think the hon. member said that food is a very important basic product of a people. To provide sufficient food and food of a good quality to the people means, therefore, that one is making a very large contribution, perhaps the largest single contribution, to the promotion of the physical health of the people. But if one looks at the figures from our Budgets in recent years, these facts evidence themselves in every respect. As a result of the tremendous drought, the Government has always supplied this necessary transitional credit to the agricultural sector. Since the establishment of the new Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, from the end of 1966 up to and including 1971, the total amount spent on consolidation and the purchasing of land&#x2014;these are mostly the people, as you know, who have problems in agriculture, the people the hon. member is concerned about&#x2014;was R109 million. But in looking at auxiliary steps taken by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, we specifically remember the year in which this Government was prepared to vote R8&#x00BD; million to support the wool industry in South Africa. In that single year the total amount under this department alone was more than R10 million. Last year, from the Revenue Account alone, R160 million was spent on agriculture. It is essential that in our financing we ensure that sufficient transitional credit is supplied when agriculture is experiencing problems. It is also essential that sufficient price stabilizing funds are available. The consumer and the industrialist in South Africa must listen to this: The largest percentage of money voted by this Government for price stabilization, goes to the consumer for consumer subsidies. In a matter of ten years it has amounted to about R402 million&#x2014;the end of 1971.</p>

<p>But our Department of Agricultural Technical Services also has a very important function in the stabilizing of our agricultural industry in South Africa. With the research work and extension service it carries out in this connection, it is only necessary for a progressive farmer to pick up the telephone, call his extension officer and tell him of this or that technical problem, ask him whether they can assist him and provide the services. It is all there; all that remains is to go and fetch it.</p>

<p>This motion states, in addition, that we shall have to provide, to an increasing extent, for the demand for food production in South Africa. If we take a look at our researchers, our scientists in this country, we see we have come far in this respect. I am thinking, for example, of the development of seed and hybrid seed. Only last year, as a result of the development of better seed, we succeeded for the first time, with our greater yield, in producing sufficient <span class="col_1319-1320" refersTo="page_0673"/>wheat in South Africa, to such an extent that we could export some of it. With the scientific knowledge we have, with the research and extension work that is being done, we shall definitely be able to supply South Africa&#x2019;s food needs even in the year 1980.</p>

<p>That is why we have moved an amendment to the motion of the hon. member for Heidelberg, because we in the United Party are not interested in sympathy assistance to the farming industry. We want a well-planned and rationalized agricultural industry where it is not necessary for the department to come along with subsidies. I believe the United Party when in power will see to it that the agriculture is so well-planned that the question of subsidizing this industry will become something of the past. That is why we say in our amendment that we deplore the mismanagement and why we appeal for forward planning, because we believe that if that is done this question of sympathy assistance mentioned in the hon. member&#x2019;s motion will fall away.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal talks freely of a plentiful supply of foodstuffs to feed our population, but I want to ask him at what price. And as one who lives in a city and has to fork out and pay the price I am alarmed to see how the price of food is going up in South Africa. If it continues to go up at the rate it is going up at present, there will be a rise in the price of foodstuff of something in the region of 30%. I believe that if we properly plan this great industry, the agricultural industry, and if this Government will only sometimes take the advice of this Opposition, there would not be this need for the rising price of food. We in the Opposition are deeply concerned about the price which the ordinary man in the street today has to pay for the ordinary foodstuffs he requires to keep his family together. This is something that must enjoy the attention of this hon. Minister. The rise in price of 30% in one year is something the consuming public cannot really bear.</p>

Minister paid serious attention to introducing of an agricultural planning council. A vast industry like this has to be planned and co-ordinated. It has to be better planned and better co-ordinated than has been done during the last 25 years.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heidelberg spoke about the exportation of meat. He speaks of exporting meat when at the present time the pastoral industry cannot supply South Africa with its needs. Before he can speak about exporting meat, he has to rectify the situation so that he can supply his <span class="col_1321-1322" refersTo="page_0674"/>own local population without having to import it from Australia and New Zealand. That is what has to happen. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what his department has done to activate the production of red meat in South Africa. Why has he not given serious consideration to establishing a floor price for meat at a realistic level that would encourage the producer to produce more red meat? I want to ask him why he has not fixed the floor price for red meat at a figure at which the Meat Board could buy and export it overseas at a profit if a surplus developed. If he were to do that, there would be hundreds of farmers&#x2014;and I believe that the hon. member for Heidelberg is one of them&#x2014;who would increase their industry tenfold, because at the floor price I am suggesting there would be a profit for them. But that is not the position. We are left in an uncertain position because we do not know what the price of beef will be tomorrow, next month or next year. Many farmers in the industry are reticent to put their capital into it to increase their production.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heidelberg made a very good suggestion, in which I want to support him. With regard to the use of maize, one of our most important crops, he said that the throughput of animal feed is only approximately six million bags per annum. He suggested that that should be stepped up to 25 million bags per annum. His idea was that, if this was fed to livestock, to sheep and cattle, we would catch up with the backlog we have in our meat supply. I believe that the hon. member has a very good point, but then we on this side of the House have been making this very suggestion for the last five or six years. We wanted to know why it should be that we should export our maize at a loss each year while it is urgently needed to supplement the rations of our livestock industry. But nothing has happened. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether they are contemplating doing just that. I do not believe that it is beyond the realms of possibility; I cannot accept that a plan cannot be worked out whereby the surplus maize we produce in South Africa can be directed to supplement the rations of our livestock industry. I believe it is a perfectly feasible proposition and I support the hon. member for Heidelberg in this respect.</p>

<p>Talking of the meat industry, the hon. member in his motion praises the department for all it has done for agriculture. Why has it taken ten long years to get anything done in respect of our abattoir situation? For ten long years the Government and the department have been humming and hawing and only now does it appear that the abattoir position is being brought to a proper functional situation. There must be many hon. members in this House who are consumers of red meat. I wonder if they realize that, as a result of the obsolete meat plan which the Government was implementing, it was not possible for me to provide a local butcher with so many steers per month, per week or per annum, as the case may be. It had to go the long way round through the abattoirs and auction on the hook. All this was increasing the price to the consumer all the time. Only now are they beginning to realize what must be done to place the producer in a position to supply direct to the butcher and thence direct to the consumers in the big cities. It has taken them ten long years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that I understood the hon. member: Is the hon. member suggesting that we must abolish auction on the hook? Is that what intends?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not asking for the abolition of the system of auction on the hook, but I would say that at least 25% of the supplies should be able to get to the consumer without having to go through the expensive process of auction on the hook. That is what I am pleading for. I believe we are getting to that point, but it has taken ten long years because the industry was not properly planned. That is my point.</p>

<p>I now want to come to another point which is also connected with planning. If the hon. the Minister will recall, about three years ago in this House I raised the question of the damage which the harvester termite was doing in our pastures in South Africa. I think the hon. the Minister was sympathetic to my plea in this respect. He sent the information from the department, bringing me up to date with the latest appreciation of this problem by the department, and in one of these letters from the department about the harvester termite I was told what I will read to other <span class="col_1323-1324" refersTo="page_0675"/>hon. members shortly. When I talk of the harvester termite, I am sure hon. members know what a problem this little parasite is in South Africa. The other day, while playing cricket at Stellenbosch University, I was fielding at fine leg&#x2014;I do not know whether the hon. the Minister knows where that is&#x2014;and there where I stood were these harvester termites destroying the grass on the fields of Stellenbosch University. This harvester termite is distributed throughout the length and the breadth of South Africa and it is doing, in my opinion, far more harm than the locust parasite has ever done in South Africa. I warned the hon. the Minister at that time and he sent me these letters. The departmental letters I received said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Until 1966 all available evidence pointed to the fact that the harvester termite was indeed an economically important pest of the veld. Lately convincing evidence has come to hand that injudicious grazing practices and protracted drought periods are the major factors causing veld damage and veld retrogression, and that these factors precipitate dense termite population. Accordingly, the emphasis regarding the termite problem has shifted from a chemical to an ecological approach.</block>

<p>At that time I told the hon. the Minister that an ecological approach was not sufficient to control this parasite and that his department should look closely into this matter to see whether it was not necessary to launch a national scheme to control this parasite in the country. Nothing has happened, but here in one of the agricultural papers another warning comes from the private sector, emphasizing the tremendous damage this parasite is doing; and the damage is getting greater and greater every year. Up to this stage I do not believe the department has taken anything like the action that should be taken to get this plague under control. Do hon. members see why I am concerned? I am concerned because this hon. Government has just recently spent millions of rands on the stock reduction scheme. I hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us about the stock reduction scheme and whether they are going to abandon this scheme, which is probably the best long-term bit of planning that they have been involved in. However, millions of rands are being spent on the stock reduction scheme and now I ask hon. members: Is it wise utilization of the taxpayers&#x2019; money to pay the farmer to take stock off his pastoral land so that these termites can destroy it? It is a fact, and the net result of this lack of planning, this lack of co-ordination which we find so rife in the department, means that if there is less veld for the stock to eat, there will be less meat available to the consumer. If there is less meat available to the consumer, what is the net result? The net result is that the price for the consumer goes up. I believe it is a matter of very, very vital importance that this hon. Minister and his Deputy see to it not only that we have adequate supplies of food for the nation&#x2014;that is one of his primary roles&#x2014;but also that there are adequate supplies at prices which the average person in the street can afford to pay. I am very concerned that the price of ordinary agricultural produce is getting out of hand, that it is reaching a point where the ordinary man in the street can ill afford to pay those prices. That is the reason, Sir, why my hon. friend, the hon. member for Newton Park, has said that the time has come when we must have an agricultural planning council to deal with all these problems. I have a very high regard for the Minister of Agriculture, but I believe that the problems are so manifold and so difficult of solution that he cannot possibly be expected to cope with them on his own. I think he needs the advice of such a council, and I hope that in his term of office he will see that such a planning council is introduced and that he will shed the mantle of <i>ad</i> <i>hoc</i>-ism which he inherited when he became Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find it very appropriate in this debate, which is an agricultural debate, to convey the congratulations of all South African agriculturalists to our friend. Dr. Verbeeck, on the particularly distinguished award he received last week from the French Government. I think he gained a great deal of renown for himself by that award, but in general he gained a great deal of renown for agriculture in South Africa and for our country as a whole in particular.</p>

<p>Sir, I gladly support this motion of the hon. member for Heidelberg. I find it strange that when one is dealing with a positive motion such as this, where an opportunity is being created for a positive discussion of agriculture and its future, one <span class="col_1325-1326" refersTo="page_0676"/>always obtains a destructive type of discussion from the United Party. I want to concede at once that my good friend, the hon. member for Walmer, was perhaps not quite so destructive. I think he came along here with a few fine, positive suggestions. But, Sir, if the agriculturalists of South Africa are to pay heed to the hon. member for Newton Park, I tell you agriculture will perish. I want to declare here today, unequivocally, that the young South African farmer will not allow the United Party men to talk him out of agriculture. But we know what the reason is. The United Party men have no future on the platteland, and therefore they speak about the &#x201C;deep&#x201D; platteland. They have no future on the platteland, and the quicker they can talk agriculture down, the quicker the agricultural sector, which does not support them, will have perished. Sir, we shall continue to propagate the interests of agriculture positively in this House and outside, and we have all the means at our disposal, because I want to submit that we have two sympathetic Ministers and a sympathetic department.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to leave the United Party men there. I do not want to speak about them any further. I have much more important matters I should like to state here today. I am sorry, Sir, that I shall have to cross swords with our good friends, the <i>Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut.</i> But in November last year an article appeared in the <i>Volkshandel</i> &#x201C;The State&#x2019;s Priorities in Assistance to Industry, Mining and Agriculture&#x201D;. In the article they speak of &#x201C;our standpoint&#x201D;. I say that I regret having to cross swords with them, but I think this motion fits in very beautifully with what I want to say about this article. I find it appropriate to refer to a few aspects mentioned in this article. The article compares, for example, State assistance to agriculture and industry, income tax, contributions to national revenue, contributions to exports and the supply of employment, and then it continues by stating that the assistance the State is granting to agriculture, in comparison with the assistance to industry and others, is out of all proportion. But let us look at the reality of the situation. In the <i>Financial Mail</i> of October, 1972, it is stated that to the extent that butter, wheat and mutton can be imported at a price cheaper than local prices, the consumer is subsidizing the farmers. If that is so, then even the artificial fertilizer subsidy is not a subsidy to the farmer, but a subsidy to the artificial fertilizer industry, because last year the farmers could import artificial fertilizer at a price cheaper than the locally manufactured product.</p>

<p>But let us go further. At present we are exporting maize at R5-50 per bag delivered at the harbours, while the inland price to the millers and the consumers is about R3-80 per bag. If we were to have imported maize this year, the difference would have been about R2 per bag, and on the local consumption of about 55 million bags we would have had to pay a good R100 million or more, which means that the State subsidy for maize would have had to quadruple in order to keep the price the same. According to definition then, the maize farmer subsidizes the consumer by R100 million, apart from the Government&#x2019;s subsidy. I want to declare unequivocally that apart from a few select products, the price of food in this country is still the cheapest in the world. The rough estimate is that if all food were to have been imported last year, it would have cost the country, together with State subsidies, in the region of R300 million. This article continues and mentions artificial fertilizer subsidies, excise rebates, the Department of Agriculture, the livestock reduction scheme and soil conservation, losses of the Railways, etc. But let us just analyze these statements. Agricultural technical services has a budget of R47 million, the largest portion of which is for agricultural research and training. In the case of industry, research is done by the C.S.I.R., which in any case has a much larger budget than the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Is it therefore fair for us to evaluate the faculties of agriculture, which were linked up to Agricultural Technical Services, as direct assistance to the farmer, while the faculties of commerce at our universities are under a quite separate budget?</p>

<p>But I go further. If we must consequently accept this as a norm, the three agricultural departments being included as direct assistance to the farmer, must we then regard the Departments of Industries and partly the Departments of Labour, Immigration and Community Development as assistance to the industries? I think this is totally unfair.</p>

<p>But let us take the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, with a budget of R114 million, R72 million of which are food subsidies and R17 million of which are artificial fertilizer subsidies. <span class="col_1327-1328" refersTo="page_0677"/>When it comes to food subsidies, we could argue in circles about who is actually subsidizing whom, but I should like to briefly argue the point in the light of certain information.</p>

<p>May I help you?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>The State helps every sector of the national economy in many ways. If it decides to keep the prices of food and raw materials low by way of subsidies, it is foolish to argue about who actually subsidizes whom. In the <i>Landbouweekblad</i> of 19th December, 1972, Dr. Frans Cronje sets the average protection of industry at about 20%, which at last year&#x2019;s figures worked out to about R500 million which our consumer had to pay up for durable and semi-durable consumer articles. Must we also include this as subsidies to the industries? I am asking this question. Sir, the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is also mentioned here. It has a budget of R40 million. R32 million of that are repayable loans. But we must also remember that agricultural Credit and Land Tenure controls the entire coast up to the highwater mark. It handles all purchases of land for the State. It controls the Deeds Offices and also the Surveyor-General&#x2019;s division. Is it fair to blaze all this abroad and say that this is direct assistance to agriculture? We then come to the transport assistance to the tune of R80 million. It is true that we must regard that as assistance as a result of the loss on low rated traffic. However must we also include in this the textile factories&#x2019; tariff on cotton? Who is responsible for the loss of about R60 million per year on suburban train traffic? For whose benefit is the subsidy of R16 million on the Department of Transport&#x2019;s budget? From where does the railways recover its loss on low rated traffic? From high rated traffic, of course, such as fuel, machinery, parts and so on, to which agriculture makes its full contribution.</p>

<p>It goes further and compares income tax. It points, with great satisfaction, to the fact that agriculture pays only R35 million per year in income tax, and the manufacturing industry about R300 million, while the mining industry pays about R400 million. However, what has that to do with the matter? If agriculture&#x2019;s profit is low, in any case, or is kept low in the national interest and supplemented by State assistance, as maintained by <i>Volkshandel,</i> the public spends less on food, of course, and can spend more on other things so that more taxable profit is made in other sectors. However, there is a further point. If the whole industrial sector pays R300 million per year in income tax, but for only a portion of its production, i.e. for durable and semi-durable consumer goods, the consumer pays R400 million per year more, who then is carrying that sector&#x2019;s profits and its income tax?</p>

<p>It goes further and compares the contributions to the national revenue. Agriculture&#x2019;s contribution to the national revenue has decreased since the twenties from about 20% to the present 9%. From this the conclusion is so easily drawn that agriculture is a declining industry. I want to state here that those who measure agriculture&#x2019;s value to the national economy merely in terms of its contribution to the G.D.P. are failing to appreciate its true value and completely ignoring its ties to other sectors of the economy. To mention but one example, I point out that the composition and distribution of the population in South Africa is of the utmost importance. Therefore, with cognizance taken of the fact that in more than 200 of the 277 magisterial districts, agriculture is the foremost activity, the greatest source of revenue and the greatest supplier of work, this is a fact that must weigh very heavily in our country.</p>

<p>It goes further and compares export contributions. It states that as far as exports are concerned, unprocessed agricultural products contribute an average of about R200 million net per year plus about R250 million for processed agricultural articles which are included with the manufactured goods. It estimates agriculture&#x2019;s net export contribution at R360 million per year. In contrast the mining industry exports products to the value of R1 400 million, and industry R530 million. The average of the agricultural exports had to be calculated over a very long period in order to reach this figure. Last year the exportation of unprocessed agricultural products, i.e. wool, mohair, karakul furs, raw hides and skins, maize, sorghum, citrus, deciduous fruits and tobacco alone amounted to more than R400 million, and in the previous year to R280 million. If one adds processed or semi-processed products like sugar, canned fruit, meat and wine, this means an additional R180 million. This does not include the manufactured goods from agricultural raw materials, like leather and textiles. According <span class="col_1329-1330" refersTo="page_0678"/>to an analysis that P. A. du Plessis made for 1956-&#x2019;57, it appears that agriculture, forestry and fisheries only have to import 13% of their production means to establish a rand&#x2019;s production, as against the 46% for the mechanical industries and 73% for the textile industry. In another calculation made by J. C. du Plessis, it was found that the primary sectors, i.e. agriculture, forestry, fisheries and the mining industry, contributed 89%, in the years 1956 to 1964, to the positive net contribution to the current account of the balance of payments, while the manufacturing sector, which evidenced the greatest growth, was responsible for 26% of the negative contribution to the current account. Therefore in September, 1972, we find that a financial journal like <i>Tegniek</i> could indicate, with a very fine article, that agriculture&#x2019;s effort is the best as far as the improvement of our balance of payments last year was concerned. It describes how, and proves unequivocally that agriculture was largely responsible for the dramatic improvement in our balance of payments. The problem is, however, that as our secondary industries expanded and to a larger extent began manufacturing agriculture&#x2019;s input locally, the farmer has, almost without exception, had to pay more for that than for what he previously imported. This weakens agriculture&#x2019;s competitive position on the world market and impedes the expansion of agricultural export and therefore the earning of foreign exchange for industrial purposes. But we are not complaining about that, because we know it is tremendously essential for this country that we should also have industrial expansion.</p>

<p>As far as providing work is concerned, I do not want to say a great deal. <i>Volkshandel</i> compares the salaries and wages of agriculture with those of the mining and building industries, but it makes one basic error in its calculation: It does not take into account the farmer in his dual capacity as entrepreneur and administrator. If this is taken into account, agriculture&#x2019;s salaries and wages compare well with those of any other sector of the economy. One blames the <i>Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut</i> for launching, by means of its official organ, such a one-sided attack on our farming community and on the authorities for their measures of assistance to agriculture. Some of the statements that are disseminated abroad are irresponsible, unscientific and indefensible, and not worthy of the status of an organization like the <i>Handelsinstituut.</i> The State, which is the watchdog of every sector of our economy, is best able to decide where and how assistance must be granted. If agriculture requests assistance, it does so in a positive way without prejudicing other sectors in the process. We are supplementary to one another, not in competition.</p>

<p>Sir, I would very much have liked to speak about our extension services and about our development of agricultural production, but I felt that this article could not be left there and that one should rather take a look at it.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that we realize we have a difficult task in this country, under difficult circumstances. We do not have an ideal agricultural country, and it speaks volumes for the fact that we could push up our production and productivity so much over the past few years. In spite of the farmers, who are decreasing in number, agricultural land that is not increasing in extent and the fact that the agriculturalist continually keeps his gaze on high, from which his greatest resources come, he is purposefully orientated towards accepting the greatest challenge of all time. Together with sympathetic Ministers and departments he will continue to feed and clothe this people, but he will, too, always keep enough in reserve to help provide for the millions beyond our northern boundaries and thereby make a contribution to the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, frankly I was not impressed with the opening remarks made by the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet. It is unfortunate that he should have started his speech by dragging politics into this very serious debate, dragging politics into an industry which should not have politics figuring in it at all. Of course, I do not know whether he was serious&#x2014;he appeared to be serious&#x2014;but whatever he said in this regard, there was nothing further from the truth. Of course, we on this side are not only encouraging the agricultural industry and encouraging the producer to produce more, but we are also considering the consumer in South Africa. I believe that unless we have a satisfied consumer we are going to find the going very heavy indeed. The motion before the House, moved by the hon. member for Heidelberg, has quite obvious aims: It is the same old story, a motion whitewashing the Minister and the Government. But we have become accustomed to this and I am very happy indeed <span class="col_1331-1332" refersTo="page_0679"/>to be able to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Walmer. In the amendment you will notice, Sir, that we place emphasis on the consumer and the producer, because this is very important indeed. There are 90 000 farmers in South Africa, showing a net income of R600 million. As there are 90 000 farmers, we all realize that there are far more consumers in South Africa today and therefore it is so difficult to establish a balance between the consumer and the producer to keep both parties happy. Of course we on this side&#x2014;and it has been mentioned&#x2014;believe there is one way we can solve our problem concerning the consumer and the producer, and that is to have the agricultural planning council which the United Party will establish when we come to power. We believe that farmers must be encouraged to accumulate as much land, as many farms, as they possibly can, and not discouraged from doing so. I am very happy to say that in South Africa we have an institution, a money-lending bank, the Land Bank, which is there to assist the farmer to do just that. We all agree that the Land Bank is doing a wonderful and tremendous job. Of course they have their problems, because when advancing money to agriculturists they have to consider many facets. They have to consider whether the agriculturist is a successful farmer, as well as the security he has to offer. But it is time that we encouraged people to stay on a farm, that we encouraged people to farm. I have so often come across people who are going out of their way to discourage people from farming. This is a very serious matter indeed, and I am sure hon. members on that side of the House will agree that there are far too many people being discouraged from taking part in the agricultural industry today.</p>

<p>The hard lesson we have learnt from the droughts and the lean years is that we need never be concerned about surpluses. We have had surpluses in the past, in the flush years, but we need never be concerned about surpluses in produce, and in raw materials. The Minister himself mentioned the other day that in only 27 years&#x2019; time we will have a population of 50 million people to feed. Now in the motion moved by the hon. member for Heidelberg he mentions and lays emphasis on the export of our produce. At the moment, as we all know, we are importing mutton, and before we can start considering the export of our produce, surely we should consider the figures which the hon. the Minister gave himself only recently in a Press interview, namely that we have to think about having 50 million people to feed in 27 years&#x2019; time. This, of course, involves long-term planning. We have many short-term plans in agriculture, but these do not get us very far and are certainly not going to assist us with the tremendous problems which will face us by the turn of the century. We have heard so much of increased wages, and we have had increased wages handed out during this very session of Parliament. As wages increase, so we will find our population eating more and more meat and particularly red meat, i.e. mutton and beef. We know that the non-Whites are eating more and more meat. This is not only to be ascribed to the increase in population, but also to the fact that they are learning to eat more and more red meat. We find this applies to the White people in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>We welcome the exportation of produce, but at the moment, as I say, we are even importing meat such as mutton to keep the people satisfied. I should like to make a suggestion to this House which will assist us in producing food which will be required in our own country in the very near future. Unfortunately we have had very few suggestions coming from the Government side, supporting their motion. One of the suggestions I want to make, concerns weather data and weather forecasts in South Africa. Weather data can be used to promote modern, sophisticated farming techniques, particularly in this country of ours. The following are some of the more important aspects of farming where climatological information can assist the farmer: the adaptability of crops could be made better use of if we had more accurate weather forecasts; diseases, insects and termites&#x2014;it will assist us in fighting these parasites; the microclimatic affect, i.e. wind and erosion on cultivated land; livestock production&#x2014;if we had more accurate forecasts, this would assist us in livestock production as well in that we would be able to provide the necessary shelter for the animals against wind and inclement weather.</p>

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Heidelberg, I was interested in what he had to say about the slaughtering of cows and ewes, female animals. I was in agreement with what he had to say, but I would like to take it further. I am very concerned that we are today slaughtering far too many <span class="col_1333-1334" refersTo="page_0680"/>calves. Beef is going to be one of our major red meats in the very near future. The demand for beef is going to grow and grow. Today we find that we are even exporting calves. I am very worried about this. I know that the hon. member for Heidelberg farms with calves. He rears them to maturity. In the United Kingdom they have a system whereby they try to protect the slaughtering of these little animals. It is worked on a subsidy basis. This was the case; I do not know if it still is. However, we should try to devise ways and means to protect calves from being slaughtered. I know it is a problem. Our milk producers, for example, cannot keep calves. They have to sell them because they cannot afford to keep them on small-holdings. They cannot afford the grazing or the supplementary feeding to keep them alive until they reach maturity. We should try to devise ways and means of protecting them from being slaughtered, at such a young age.</p>

<p>Of course, to produce more red meat, we should consider a certain percentage of our maize crop being reserved for the production of red meat. At the moment we are paying from R4-50 to R4-60 a bag. At these prices it is not economic to supplement feeding in the production of beef and mutton. Unless the Government can curb the high production costs the consumers will continue to pay more and more for farm produce. It is only natural and we must of course avoid this at all costs. In the third and final report of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture, the Marais Commission&#x2019;s report, we see that many farm implements are imported free of customs and excise duty, tractors for example. Tractors alone form 70% of the machinery being imported free of excise duty. We cannot expect more to be done in this regard. However, I think the hon. the Minister will agree that when it comes to spares for farm machinery, the figures are exorbitant. Sometimes it is difficult even to believe that a part can cost so much in South Africa and many of these spares are manufactured in this country.</p>

<p>While on the subject of farm machinery, there is something else that has been worrying us on this side of the House. Of course it is due to Government policy and we cannot do anything about it while this Government is in power. Many farmers have complained to me and to others about the fact that no sooner have they trained a Bantu to drive a tractor efficiently&#x2014;it takes them quite six months to train&#x2014;then he returns to the homeland. The same driver never comes back to the same farmer again to drive the same machine. Next time he goes to somebody else where he is probably taught to drive a combine or some other machine. This is costing the farmer, I will not say millions, but certainly unnecessary expenditure. It is unnecessary expenditure, because the hon. the Minister will appreciate what it is to have efficient operators on expensive machines. Unfortunately my time is limited. My time has expired, and I should have liked to deal with the more minor matter but I do not have the time. We ought to be one of the largest exporting countries in the world today. We have the capital, we have the labour in South Africa, we have the resources and we have the know-how. We seem to have everything but we sadly lack production in all spheres.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Heidelberg introduced a motion which I found encouraging in this sense that we again have an opportunity, as happens once a year, to take a positive look at our agriculture. Unfortunately he was speaking over the heads of the Opposition, for they criticized him for having praised agriculture as a praiseworthy profession. They were not happy about that. The hon. members said he was being sentimental. One can never be sentimental about one of the oldest professions in the world. It is a pity that that should have happened, after he had stated the matter so positively. I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Heidelberg &#x2026; [Interjections.] The figures he quoted concerning the achievements of the farmers, were of importance to me for they enable us to tell the farmer at some time or other: &#x201C;Man, you are not entirely bad; look what you have achieved.&#x201D; On that I want to congratulate the hon. member for Heidelberg.</p>

<p>He expressed his concern over our beef industry. Every subsequent speaker discussed this. The more rapid finishing of our livestock is very important if we want to feed a growing population. The reason we are exporting meat today is because the world price of meat is such that after deducting freight charges and cooling costs we still make a considerable profit. That gives hon. members an idea of what the world price of meat is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park <span class="col_1335-1336" refersTo="page_0681"/>tried to throw cold water over the whole matter by saying: Look at our agricultural faculties, where there has been only a 7% growth in 14 years. The hon. member has already received replies to this from other hon. members on my side of the House. That hon. member must bear in mind that he drew comparisons with a period during which things did not go well with agriculture.</p>

<p>Have things not gone well with agriculture for an entire 14 years?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. There were eight years of drought in the wool industry, and a wool price which was not encouraging. But the hon. member must consider other norms. He must not confine himself only to the number of students. Because our country has developed to such an extent in the industrial sphere, there was a substitute for the person who did not want to farm. Commerce and industry received him with open arms. He was able to pursue other directions. When a farm is available there are thousands of people who are prepared to take a 100% loan to be able to acquire a piece of land. He is even prepared to give up his profession to be able to go farming. That is the norm which hon. members should consider. There is confidence in agriculture, in spite of our fluctuating weather conditions. But because there has been a decrease in the number of agricultural students over a period is not reason enough to accept that there was no confidence in agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. member stated that the chairman of the South African Agricultural Union had said that the income per farmer was only R8 000, and that there was a percentage who were making a net profit of only R1 000 to R3 000 per annum. Now it must be borne in mind that this is a net income. His house rent, water, lights and taxes have already been paid. Then he has that amount left over, and he still has his own livestock to slaughter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I said gross income.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member said net. Then the hon. member was perhaps saying the wrong thing. What I am getting at is that he included the smallholding farmers. Those farmers who farm for a supplementary income were included in that figure.</p>

<p>But when I discuss these matters, hon. members must not assume that I think everything is as it should be with agriculture. I have learnt something today. I am prepared to learn even from a United Party man. There are many things to which we must give our attention. What I want, however, is that the hon. member should not, in order to put his point of view, always state the matter so negatively that the interest I want there to be in agriculture is also lost to us.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to agricultural financing. He said that we were not providing the necessary agricultural financing, and did not have the means to finance the farmers. This he mentioned as one of the reasons why there had been a recession. The hon. member need only consider for a moment the assistance which the Department of Agricultural Credit has provided since this department was established. An amount of R141 million was lent to 66 500 farmers. Of that amount R56&#x00BD; million was lent to 2 289 farmers to purchase land at 5% interest; and an amount of R33 million was lent to 2 314 farmers to redeem their mortgages and pay other debts.</p>

<p>But what did the Land Bank do? At present it has an outstanding amount of R412 million in the form of loans to farmers; an amount of R81 million in the form of long-term loans to co-operative societies, and an amount of R472 million in the form of short-term loans. This amounts to more than R1 000 million. We are being criticized by farmers who say that credit is being granted too easily. But these loans have to be paid back some time or other, even if it is at 5.% Now the hon. member says that we are faced with these problems because we have not created financing facilities for the farmer. I cannot agree with that. In addition the hon. member said that I have only now discovered that it is dry in Worcester. I was there last year, and the year before last.</p>

<p>Sir, I visited Worcester yesterday, and we are considering their suggestions. Consider the Hex River Valley; this is not a problem which one can solve overnight. A fantastic scheme has been devised, with a three-mile long tunnel through the mountain; the dam has been constructed; it had 13% water last year. Should I have gone to the farmers and said: &#x201C;I promise you that the dam will be full tomorrow?&#x201D; The hon. member said that I have only now heard of the drought at Worcester. I do not want to quarrel with him; that is not in my nature. I just want to make him understand that I did not hear about the drought in Worcester only yesterday. The other steps we are going to take will be announced in due course.</p>

<p>As a result of devaluation the prices of agricultural implements and production means, which we imported, had to increase by 17%. The hon. member is concerned, and the hon. member for Walmer said that the prices of foodstuffs were going to increase by 30%. Let the hon. member be positive for once. He was criticizing me on the increase in production costs. I admit that production costs did rise; it is of no use trying to conceal this. I now want to ask hon. members on that side whether they are satisfied with our having increased the price of fresh milk last week by 2 cents per litre.</p>

<p>Sir, it is difficult for me to do my work as Minister if I am unable to receive any assistance from the Opposition. &#x201C;They want to play it both ways&#x201D;, as the newspapers said. What they lost on the swings they want to make up on the merry-go-round. [Laughter.] I asked hon. members on that side to defend this step as producers and to help me, for my position is a difficult one if I receive telegrams like the following: &#x201C;Housewives&#x2019; League of South Africa protest strongly against the increase of milk by two cents a litre&#x201D;. These telegrams are streaming in to my office. I shall come in a moment to those hon. members who said that the farmer should be paid a decent price for his produce. But what must one do if costs are continually increasing? I want to pay my Bantu worker who milks my cows every day a higher wage, and my neighbour wants to do the same, and the hon. member as well. I do not begrudge my Bantu worker a larger salary, but where must the money come from?</p>

<p>Sir, I come now to the hon. member for Bethal who to my mind set out the functions of the three departments very well. The hon. member greatly facilitated my task here by setting out those functions in such a fine manner. I wanted to mention certain of the achievements of a department like the Department of Agricultural Technical Services today. An amount of R47 million is being spent here on research, on new projects. I am thinking now of one direction in which we must go. The hon. member for East London North, as well as the hon. member for Heidelberg were concerned about our livestock population. Research is being done at Onderstepoort and other institutes of ours to cause our milch-cows to bear twin calves after hormone treatment; these are all methods and techniques which one will simply have to apply to be able to supply a growing population with food. I am pleased the hon. member for Bethal mentioned these things here. Sir, before I come to the hon. member for Walmer I should just like to inform the Opposition that it does not pay to play <span class="col_1339-1340" refersTo="page_0683"/>politics with agriculture. I want to know from the Opposition whether importing mutton is justified? Should we, or should we not, import mutton?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I now want to quote to you what was said at a meeting by the hon. member for Albany, who is not present here at the moment. The caption to this report read: &#x201C;M.P. condemns importing of mutton.&#x201D; He criticized the Minister of Agriculture from beginning to end. He made this speech in the platteland and said that the whole business seemed to him like an election ploy to help Dawie de Villiers in Johannesburg West, where the housewives were being promised that they would be able to buy cheaper mutton. Sir, we must encourage the farmer to produce, and how can he produce if he does not receive an encouraging price for his product?</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Walmer said that the floor price of beef must be such that it encourages the farmers to produce. In other words, he is asking for a higher floor price for beef. The floor price for 1A beef was 44 cents a kilogram. The Meat Board is now considering a support price, not a floor price but a support price, of something in the vicinity of 62 cents per kg, but the auction price at the moment is 72 cents per kg. It is the intention to encourage farmers to produce by saying to them that they will not have this big fluctuation that there is today&#x2014;a high price today and a low price tomorrow&#x2014;but that they will more or less be guaranteed that the price will not fall below 60 cents per kg. The hon. member says that food prices are going to rise by 30%, and yet in the next sentence he asks for a higher floor price. Those were his words. Sir, how can we have cheap meat at a lower price for the consumer if the hon. member asks us to increase the floor price of beef? You cannot have it both ways.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question? The hon. the Minister referred to a support price and a floor price. When I was speaking, I was referring to a long-term floor price so that the producer can know what the long-term possibilities are. I would like the hon. the Minister to distinguish between a support price and a floor price.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us assume that the price drops from 75 cents per kg to 60 cents. The Meat Board will then buy in meat to stimulate the market, and if the price does not go up again, the Meat Board will gradually sell that meat on different markets, spreading from Cape Town to Durban or other markets. That is the intention. But it is not altogether a floor price; it is a support price. If they buy in meat for two months at 60 cents a kg and they find that they have not got the funds to keep on buying, then they will lower the support price, but if you announce an out-and-out floor price then you have to stick to it. We did that in the past when we did not have slaughtering facilities.</p>

<p>*Then the hon. member requested that we export our surplus maize in the form of meat. Does the hon. member realize that if one puts 25 million to 35 million bags of maize into cattle, you will not be able to sell that meat for 60 cents per kilogram?</p>

<p>Sir, it is not that I am condemning this suggestion, but I want the hon. member to help me when I run into difficulties with the consumers who say: &#x201C;Look at the terrible price we have to pay for this product.&#x201D; Let us understand one another well. This Government does not want to let the consumer pay an unreasonable price for any product, but in agriculture we have two sets of clients; on the one hand the farmers who have to be encouraged to produce, and on the other the consumer whose interests also have to be looked after. Sir, why do we have only eight million head of cattle in the country today? Because there was not a price for the farmer which encouraged him to produce. Why have the numbers of our sheep decreased, apart from the withdrawal scheme? The withdrawal scheme has been responsible for the withdrawal of three million sheep, but there was a time when we had 38 million sheep; today we have 32 million.</p>

<from><span class="col_1341-1342" refersTo="page_0684"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is raining now. We did not give the farmer any encouragement to go all out and produce to the best of his ability, because he did not have any stability, because he did not have slaughtering facilities and because he had a floor price which sometimes made it impossible for him to produce. But in the meantime the production costs of the maize farmer have also increased, and the world price of maize has increased, and if I have to raise the maize price this year, and if we have to put 35 million bags of maize into cattle, there will have to be a revision of the price of meat. One must see this matter in its entirety; one must not wrest it out of its context. But, Sir, the hon. member had to put on a display here today; he had to state his party&#x2019;s standpoint, but in his heart of hearts he speaks as I do when we discuss agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to harvester termites. Sir, we have repeatedly seen that the natural enemies of the harvester termite that live in grass&#x2014;the spider, the praying mantis and so on that all prey on the harvester termite&#x2014;find shelter in veld which is well covered, but when that veld has been eaten bare, the harvester termites flourish. We have investigated various preparations such as <i>hara-kiri,</i> which is mixed with lucerne, to exterminate the termites, and we wanted to subsidize these preparations for the farmers, but we are still finding in our research that these are not a success. If one uses aerial spraying methods one has to withdraw the livestock completely. But I shall give the hon. member further information in regard to the harvester termite, for this is a threat to some of our grazing veld. But the hon. member must not say that we have introduced a livestock withdrawal scheme which is going to cost millions of rand, and that we are in the meantime allowing the termites to destroy the veld further. It has not rained in those areas, and now the termites are flourishing, but once it has rained and the farmers withdraw that livestock, the spider, the praying mantis and the other natural enemies will do their work and devour the termites. Another very important animal is the African ant-eater, for they live on those termites.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet stated the agricultural aspect very positively. We would not like to play off commerce and industry against agriculture, for they have no chance at all of competing against us. Agriculture has one important basic function: It ensures that every individual has enough to eat every day, and if one has ensured that, at a reasonable price for the producer and the consumer, one has a happy population, both White and non-White. One must keep this matter in order, for the sake of everyone. But it was a pity that the Handelsinstituut published that article, and I should like to thank the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet for the figures which he quoted and explained so well for us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London North discussed the importing of mutton. I think that we understand one another on this score. We are aware that two years ago we slaughtered 9,1 million sheep in one year; last year we slaughtered 6,4 million sheep. We do not have a sufficient number of sheep, and we do not want the housewives to get out of the habit of eating mutton and resort instead to barbecue chickens or fish&#x2014;we want to maintain the balance. The farmers of our country are quite satisfied about our importing mutton, not so much to force the price down, but to maintain the habit in the consumer of eating mutton. But the hon. member is quite right. We shall have to take a look at this. At the present price of meat, and with the shortage which is staring us in the face, we must think again before we slaughter our calves, especially at our dairies. In the past the prices were not encouraging and it simply did not pay one to rear calves. Once the calf had drunk the beastings, one slaughtered the calf because one could get 30 cents per gallon for the milk. But at today&#x2019;s meat prices it is better to encourage the farmer to rear those calves. The export of young calves is still in an experimental stage. It is not yet assuming tremendous proportions, but we will have to look into this matter and I want to inform the hon. member that he has given me very good suggestions.</p>

<p>It is true that the price of spare parts has increased, but the salary of the man manufacturing the spare parts has also increased. The wages of the labourers in that factory have increased and so, too, his travelling allowance, electrical power&#x2014;everything has gone up, but to my mind the price of spare parts has really gone up far in excess of that. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is also aware of this.</p>

<p>No, he is not simply keeping an eye on it. He has already dealt with a few. All these things come together in a pool when one has to determine the price of a product. Then one has to take all these cost increases into consideration, and see whether the farmer can still produce at prices which are profitable for him.</p>

<p>The hon. members asked for the introduction of an agricultural planning council. We do have an agricultural advisory council. But one can plan until one is blue in the face. The basic essential in regard to all these things is that one should pay one&#x2019;s producer a price which makes it profitable for him to produce. One must regulate his circumstances in such a way that he is in fact able to produce, while his marketing must be such that he can dispose of his products. That is the basic require of agriculture in our country, with our 21 control boards and marketing councils and all those things. But I shall give further consideration to this agricultural planning council. All I can say is that it can be the most wonderful council, but this principle which I have now stated to you, is the secret of success in agriculture.</p>

We are very fond of the hon. the Minister, but, really, he should not deliver himself of such things. Surely, nobody here attacked him specifically because he praised the agricultural industry. We merely attacked him for having expressed his appreciation for the &#x201C;able and sympathetic&#x201D; manner in which the Government was handling the agricultural industry. I do not think we have a single person here who can say from the bottom of his heart that this Government is handling the agricultural industry in a sympathetic and able manner.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister went on to refer to agricultural financing. He mentioned the amounts being spent by the Land Bank. Surely he knows that the Land Bank only provides 30% of the loans. Surely he knows that last year we could only get R50 million as a maximum loan at the Land Bank.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister went on to say that devaluation was the reason for the increase in production costs. He asked us whether we were in favour of devaluation. Under the circumstances created by this Government we had no alternative but to devalue. He said that devaluation was responsible for the increase. Was devaluation responsible for the increase in railway rates on livestock? This was not an increase of 5%, but of 60%. Was devaluation responsible for the increase in the railway rates on, for instance, maize? For a truck-load of maize weighing more than 1 800 tons the rate prior to the increase was 41 cents per 100 kilograms over a distance of 500 kilometres. This has now risen to 53 cents, an increase of 26%. If it is less than a truck-load, it has risen from 47 cents &#x2026;</p>

Can the Minister say that this is the result of devaluation? We attacked the Minister on the grounds of the lack of forward planning. That is why we attacked him. Does he really want to tell me now <span class="col_1345-1346" refersTo="page_0686"/>than 118%. Can the Minister say that this respect? Let us take the position in regard to meat. He referred to it himself. This country has a tremendous potential for meat production. Why have we landed in the position that we have to import meat? Surely this was unnecessary? Let us see what the reason is for our having landed in that position. The hon. the Minister himself mentioned the reason. He said there had been no incentive. When meat and wool prices reached rock-bottom two years ago, this side of the House made the plea that wool should be subsidized. We had to wait for two years before the Government responded to our pleas.</p>

<p>In 1970 I pleaded for that in my first speech in this House, but it was only given last year. What happened then? If only they had listened to us that day! Anybody could have told him that the wool price would recover. Mr. Frans van Wyk, the chairman of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association, told him that. They could merely have sent a mission abroad&#x2014;then they would have seen that it would improve. But, no, it was allowed to drop to rockbottom. People went out of production. Now that the wool price has risen to 300 cents, the production has dropped by 20%, i.e. 200 000 bales, which could have netted us an extra R60 million in foreign exchange, not only the wool farmer of South Africa, but also South Africa as a whole. Now, is that planning, Mr. Speaker?</p>

<p>Then, in the same breath, I come to meat. During that same year we pleaded for a higher floor price, and the hon. member for Prieska supported us. I want to pay tribute to him, for he is not as irresponsible as the hon. member for Dewetsdorp (Welkom)! [Laughter.] He joined us in pleading for the floor price to be raised in South Africa, but, Sir, we had to give meat away at 18 cents per pound. And what happened? The people went out of production. The entire Western Province, which produced wool and meat, switched to wheat, and now we have a wheat surplus. Now, is that planning? Because the people have gone out of production, there is no meat in the country. The housewife has to pay exorbitant prices for it, and we have to import meat from Australia. But, Sir, just consider the price at which we have to import it. We imported 2 888 carcasses of lamb, which were landed in Durban at 76,2 cents per kg. But then import duty, local railage, agency commission and cold-storage fees must still be added. If these are reckoned in, another 11 cents are added to the price. In other words, we are prepared to pay 87 cents per kg to the Australians. In Johannesburg it is 88 cents, whereas it is 77 cents in Durban. The next consignment, the one for March, was ordered at 80,8 cents per kg, plus the 12 cents, which resulted in a total price of 92 cents in Johannesburg. Let us take a look at what the floor price is.</p>

<p>Eight kilograms. These were not my sheep; they belonged to someone else. These are people whose sheep are in as poor a condition as are those of the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet. The hon. member said we should eliminate the bottlenecks from the agricultural industry, but the major bottleneck is, surely, the droughts. Year after year we pleaded with this Government just to give the farmers a chance to build up a fodder bank in South Africa. But who can build up a fodder bank with the railway rates being what they are today? After all, that hon. Minister was instrumental in the increase in the railway rates. One has to pay R1 per 100 kg of lucerne. Just take chaff as an example. If farmers in South Africa want to build up for themselves a fodder bank with chaff, it will never be necessary for us to fear a drought. But who buys chaff today, when the railage comes to more than the price of the chaff one buys, if one does so in normal times? And then these hon. members talk about planning! Surely there is no planning in this respect. The hon. member for Heidelberg made a plea here that we convert maize into wheat, and the hon. member for East London North did so too. However, the Minister said one could not stuff 60 000 bags of maize into cattle &#x2026;</p>

If one converted this into beef, one would be able to get 12 000 metric tons out of it, which would earn R9,6 million in foreign exchange. Then one would make a profit of R2,56 million&#x2014;in other words, 36% more than would have been the case with maize. We have a plus of 60 million bags, and if one converted this, one could earn R75 million more in foreign exchange for this country, but the Minister says this is impossible.</p>

<p>It is an historical fact that, for economic and traditional reasons, our best trading partner has been and still is Great Britain ever since we became an exporting country. Great Britain, for some considerable time, has been buying more than 30% of our total exports, gold excluded. The United Kingdom is South Africa&#x2019;s major export market as can be seen from the following figures: Preserves, fresh fruit and vegetables, 53%; Hides, skins and fur skins, 46%; Woodpulp, 55%; Fishmeal, 55%; Meat products, 47%. The category of fruit and vegetables, both fresh and preserved, is of particular significance because they either enter Great Britain free or at a preferential rate in accordance with traditional British trade policy of cheap imports of food to keep the food price in the United Kingdom low. This applies to agricultural raw materials. This is completely contrary to the import policy of Common Market countries. They openly protect their agricultural sector and discriminate against outside sources of supply in varying degrees. Great Britain will now have to adopt this foreign trade policy after a brief phasing-in period. In the case of wine there is no such phasing-in period and the preference-price system virtually prohibits any considerable future wine exports to the E.E.C. markets. In the case of the canned fruit industry, South African exporters will have to surmount a tariff and a sugar-content surcharge which amounts to approximately 24% as against the previous free trade entry into the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>This should prove conclusively that South Africa is very dependent on the markets of the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, on the E.E.C., a few African countries, the U.S.A. and Japan, as is also substantiated. We must remember that the E.E.C. took ten years to evolve and to develop. It took all of ten years for their agricultural policy to be co-ordinated to such an extent that they could have universal policy as far as the E.E.C. is concerned. It would take us an awfully long period to evolve an agricultural policy to meet with the handicaps that we will experience once the United Kingdom enters the E.E.C. In the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Export Trade of the Republic [R.P. 69&#x2014;&#x2019;72], which is an extremely interesting document, <span class="col_1351-1352" refersTo="page_0689"/>the conclusion is that if exports are not stimulated further in future, the balance of payments may become a limiting factor in South Africa&#x2019;s economic growth as well as its ability to maintain and to improve its military and strategic defences. To put it the other way round, a high and sustained rate of growth will in future become increasingly dependent upon the country&#x2019;s ability to export goods. Such ability will have to be sought in the country&#x2019;s comparatively favourable natural and human resources. This requires, <i>inter alia,</i> a rapid improvement in output per unit of input and in this connection a third growth determining factor is necessary and that is technology and managerial improvements. The Commission further states that some of the main reasons for South Africa&#x2019;s relatively poor export performance are, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) poor agricultural harvests with the droughts we have; (2) the increasing poor competitive position of the manufacturing sector in foreign markets; and (3) various political factors. Some of these are of an incidental and temporary nature, but others represent deep-rooted problems.</p>

<p>*I do not at this juncture want to discuss the last reason furnished by the Commission. I shall subsequently refer to that again briefly. However, I want to agree with the standpoint of the Commission that an intensified export effort should consequently be regarded as being inseparably linked to the stage of economic development to which South Africa is now proceeding, which is that in future exports will have to play an important role as the stimulator of growth. It is imperative to realize that the sustained economic development of South Africa will probably depend to an increasing extent in future on its ability to find great quantities of new export products to supplement those of agriculture and mining. In this connection the fundamental long-term choice confronting this country appears to be clear: A lower economic growth rate or intensified efforts to increase exports in order to maintain in that way and, if possible, increase growth. It is significant to hear what the Commission has to say in this regard. I quote, on page 628&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission&#x2019;s estimate of the annual rate of growth of the export potential (at constant prices and excluding gold) of 7,5% is substantially above the rate actually realized during the period 1950-1971, viz. 5,4%. While the projection is based on what the Commission regarded as a realistic potential, it remains, of course, a potential and the realization of this potential has not already become part of history. Thus considerable development in the infrastructure, and in the creation of capacity (including labour), especially in regard to all kinds of beneficiation as well as sustained rationalization of production will have to be effected in order to realize the above growth rates.</block>

<p>Then the Commission goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A country&#x2019;s export promotional measures are often dictated by what its competitors are doing. In this respect South Africa seems to have lagged behind other countries. Moreover, increasing protectionism and the increasing importance of trade blocs in world trade, are making successful exporting more and more difficult. Lastly, exports are important for various political reasons. With regard to the domestic situation, exports will create new opportunities for production and employment and contribute to the economic stability and strength of the South African economy which, in turn, is essential for domestic political stability and strength. As far as the external situation is concerned, exports affect the country&#x2019;s ability to play its proper role in the development of neighbouring territories and to make a positive contribution to the country&#x2019;s outwards policy.</block>

<p>I want to return briefly to the diplomatic, or rather the lack of diplomatic representation, of the Republic of South Africa in so many countries. It is a fact that many other countries are internationally differently geared than South Africa. Recently Australia, one of our fiercest competitors in the Southern Hemisphere, underwent a change of government. This government has not only recognized Communist China, but has in addition entered into diplomatic and/or trade reciprocity with virtually all communist countries. The same applies to New Zealand and certain Latin American countries in the Southern Hemisphere, and in the Northern Hemisphere to Germany with its Ost-politik, Italy and perhaps soon France as well. These are all left-wing governments.</p>

<p>We heard over the radio yesterday that the United States of America and Communist China are going to establish representation in one another&#x2019;s capital cities. It <span class="col_1353-1354" refersTo="page_0690"/>remains an irrefutable fact that the Republic of South Africa is being pushed out further into the cold and isolated. I do not want to express any opinion on the political aspects of this. The motion relates more specifically to trade.</p>

<p>I come now to paragraph (b) of the motion, viz. the lack of diplomatic and trade representation in so many countries, particularly in the East. At present we have representation in Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as far as the East is concerned. If one thinks of Communist China with its population of almost 800 million, and Burma, Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philipines and the many other countries of the Far East which I have not mentioned, including India, the numerical strength of the population of these countries amounts to more than 2 000 million. This is more than two-thirds of the world population. I reiterate that in none of these countries do we have diplomatic or trade representation. What is the position in Australia, comparatively speaking? Not only does Australia have trade representation as well as diplomatic representation in certain respects with virtually all the countries which I have mentioned, but a stage has been reached where Australia regards all countries to the north of her, consisting of 1 500 million people, as her market area. For some reason or other it seems to me we are prepared to relinquish this to Australia. I maintain that we are not doing our best to try to establish trade representation where we are still able to do so, and where there is still room for us to do so, whether on an official or unofficial basis. Under the circumstances the best we can do is to make our trade representation in those countries in which we are still allowed to operate under our present policy as strong as possible. In this respect I want to mention Hong Kong first. In Japan we have two trade representatives. According to the latest reports, a third post is vacant. I want to allege that we need at least that number as far as Japan and the Japanese market is concerned. Japan offers a tremendous market both for imports and exports. We are trading on a large scale with Japan. We cannot spare our trade representatives in Japan for any other area in the East. In Hong Kong we also have two trade representatives. They also have to cover Taiwan &#x2026;</p>

<p>Quiet, man, and look at your books. I repeat that the same two trade representatives which we have in Hong Kong are also those who have to cover Taiwan. These are the same two people, and I know them. The fact remains that the representatives we have in Hong Kong have to try and cover our trade which passes through Hong Kong to Communist China, as well as the trade to Nationalist China and what we are still able to obtain to the south of Nationalist China. We are still able to obtain trade there. In this way it is also possible to trade with the Middle East. It is consequently a physical impossibility for those two trade envoys to cover the area if they want to visit any of the areas I have mentioned more than once every four months.</p>

<p>Why must they cover the Middle East?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make a specific appeal to the hon. the Minister. He knows the situation there; he was there on a recent visit in September; I was there too. He knows the situation in Hong Kong as well as I know it, and he knows as well as I do that the two trade representatives we have there could never cover the area they ought to be covering. I want to appeal to him to ensure that there will be at least four trade representatives, or even six, if that is possible, for they are the people standing in the gateway to trade with the East as far as South Africa is concerned. Nowhere in the East do we at this stage have diplomatic representation. Sir, diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan were severed recently. Towards the end of September the Japanese president visited China to hold talks with Chou en Lai and within the space of five days, while I was in Taiwan, the announcement was made that diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan had been severed and that diplomatic relations had been entered into with Communist China. Sir, do you know that Taiwan&#x2019;s trade with Japan at that stage amounted to R1 000 million per annum? I regarded this as a golden opportunity&#x2014;and I said so&#x2014;to step into the vacuum and to see what we could get out of this for South Africa. I know that we have sold maize to Taiwan. Unfortunately we cannot now afford to export even part of our crop to Taiwan owing to the fact that we have had a tremendous drought and a poor crop. But I maintain that there is a possibility of <span class="col_1355-1356" refersTo="page_0691"/>selling far more to Taiwan than we have done up to now. I have already said that a vacuum developed because Taiwan severed its trade relations with Japan quite unexpectedly.</p>

<p>In addition I want to urge the Government to investigate all channels for establishing representation in Thailand as well. Thailand has an honorary consul here in South Africa, in Durban. We have no representation there at all. We know that there is still great trade potential for South Africa in Thailand. Quite possibly the Minister will be able to tell us in his reply whether there are any problems in this connection. Cannot we make a start by appointing an honorary consul there? Surely there will then be reciprocity between Tailand and South Africa. I note, when I look through the list of our representatives abroad, that in some countries we have a tremendous team of people; I am pleased about that; that is as it should be, particularly in so far as trade is concerned. But I want to advocate that we should make a start by appointing honorary consuls, on the basis of reciprocity, in countries with large populations where we do not have representation. We can then at a subsequent stage appoint trade representatives there, so that we will have a better chance to compete with countries like Australia and other countries in the Southern Hemisphere. We ought to proceed from the standpoint that we want to trade with the entire world, not only in certain zones. Australia has always been only too eager, apart from the tremendous trade potential which it has to the north of it, to gain access even here on the Continent of Africa. In African countries where we have found it difficult to retain our trade relations and we have been forced out because of our policy, Australia has strenghthened her trade representation. I note that one of their representatives stated during the course of the week that with the problem South Africa is now experiencing in getting its products into Zambia, Australia has a good chance of getting in there and filling the gap, so anxious are they to expand their world trade. We know what happened in the Middle East years ago. I advocated in this same House that we should open an office in Lebanon so that we could trade with the Middle East. Australia had had a trade representative there for a long time. If one walks into a shop there and asks the assistant to take down a can from the shelf, you see that it comes from Australia and not from South Africa. Fortunately we have now overcome those problems and we do have a representative there.</p>

<p>Sir, I hope that I still have a few minutes left in which to discuss the wool situation. Sir, as far as wool is concerned, the situation is somewhat different owing to the fact that the South African wool farmer, in agreement with his Australian and New Zealand partners, established an international wool secretariat which stands outside politics and which has found it possible over the course of years to open offices in those countries which I have already mentioned, on a far greater scale than our Government has found it possible to appoint trade representatives there. But in spite of all this, although we have far more representation undertaking promotional work on behalf of wool as such, we nevertheless find that our friends in Australia have far better access with their wool products to those countries than we have. Geographically it is better situated, I admit that, but the fact remains that they have gained a hold over the wool trade in the Middle East world which is simply fantastic. I just want to mention that I was in Persia, where if I remember correctly, there are 27 factories, 22 of which process wool. Some of them, particularly those intended for the manufacture of Persian carpets, use some of the finest wool available in the world. Two or three years ago, or perhaps more, perhaps ten years ago, Persia thought she could flood world markets with cheap carpets made from inferior, coarse wool, but she discovered that the world no longer wanted this, and they have now made a complete about-face and are today manufacturing some of the most beautiful carpets from fantastic lamb&#x2019;s wool of 80 and upwards quality. Those of you who know about wool will know what I am talking about now. But it is not being bought here in South Africa. Now, I want to admit that our diplomatic and trade representatives in Persia have only recently been appointed; our people have not been there for long. I met the trade representative there and promised to send him, through the Wool Board, a memorandum on all the characteristics of wool, which would cover the entire matter so that in his turn he could know what he was talking about, for when I discussed this matter with him I realized that he knew nothing about the quality of wool. I urged him to preferably refrain from discussing wool until he had made a study of it. I am mentioning this <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_0692"/>one product for which I had the privilege, over a period of 30 years, of building up a world-wide organization which made it possible for our wool to gain access to countries which it was not so easy for governments to gain access to, even behind the Iron Curtain. But even there it is being found that the tremendous competition of countries to get hold of export markets is very keen. We must not forget that countries of the Southern Hemisphere are competing with us in the Northern Hemisphere as far as food and other commodities are concerned because they are perhaps better geared to this, because their national policy is different. I have said that I do not want to discuss this. I do not want to attack the Government now on its policy, but because the policy of our rivals is different, they have succeeded in obtaining trade representation in infinitely far more countries than we have, and they are succeeding in selling to far more countries than we do, at prices which are comparable to ours. It is for that reason that I want to make an urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister. My time is running out.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that the Government is in earnest about taking action in conjunction with the industries and the agricultural societies which in their turn have great responsibility as far as the exporting of their produce is concerned? I find that groups of trade representatives from Australia, up to 200 strong, are being sent to the northern countries to investigate markets. These matters must go hand in hand. I am not dealing with agriculture and industries now. I can discuss them with the time for that arrives. I am now dealing with the Government and the assistance which it can give to agriculture and industries in order to strengthen our trade representation abroad. I am doing this for the following specific reasons: In the first place, growth is imperative for South Africa. In the second place our balance of payments position has to be improved by means of exports, and not by means of negotiating foreign loans. In the third place we can only effect such growth if we employ all available workers.</p>

My basic philosophy is that we must not always look at the Government to do this, that and the other thing. No, I think that we must look at this whole issue from quite a different angle. Because that is the position, and this side of the House are not going to accept this motion.</p>

<p>*I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House notes with appreciation the steps being taken by the Government to stimulate South African exports and, in particular, expresses its thanks to the Minister of Economic Affairs for his personal endeavours, ably supported by officials of his Department, to negotiate the best terms for South African export products subsequent to the entry of the United Kingdom into the European Common Market&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I think I should just mention in passing, and heaven knows it, that the hon. members opposite can really agree about nothing. There are two motions before the House today. The hon. member for East London City has just said that we must do everything possible to export, but a while ago, when another motion was under discussion, the hon. member for Walmer said that we are exporting beef while there is not <span class="col_1359-1360" refersTo="page_0693"/>enough in South Africa. At a later stage in my speech you will see that I differ with the hon. member for Walmer. Private initiative in the Argentine is willing to experience not only meatless days but even meatless weeks in order to go on exporting their product. However the hon. member wants everything that has to be done, to be done by the Government. I state unequivocally&#x2014;later it will be seen that I do not want to deny the Government&#x2019;s share in this&#x2014;that it is in the first instance the task of the industrialist to encourage his exports and to achieve success with them. The industrialists in South Africa must take note that they themselves will have to roll up their sleeves in order to be able to continue in this way. The industrialist in South Africa will have to realize that the Government will have the necessary people posted throughout the world, but the industrialist will have to ensure that he himself has his own representatives in various parts of the world. Those representatives of the industry will in the first place have to have the necessary knowledge of its product and also knowledge of how to go about stimulating exports successfully how to make them possible and how to execute orders. In the second place our industrialists will have to realize that they must get away from this idea of the hon. member for East London City that the Government must help them every time. Those people whom we appoint abroad will have to be able to take on-the-spot decisions. When they get orders, they must have the authority to execute those orders.</p>

<p>In the third place the industrialist of South Africa must realize that, if one wants to export successfully, one must have continuity in the supply of one&#x2019;s product. In the agricultural industry this is not so easy. I want to concede that. That continuity which we would so like to have, we cannot always have as regularly as we should like to, because of climatic factors and everything associated therewith. But that still does not say that it will be our control boards in particular that will make special endeavours, as they have in fact done, to negotiate these exports, as has been the case throughout the years. As regards the industrialist dealing in consumer goods, and agricultural goods in respect of which we are able to maintain continuity, for example wool and skins, it will be our own task to take the lead in negotiating and perpetuating these exports. After all, it is no secret&#x2014;for the industrialist we do have the South African British Trade Association. This is an existing body and the industrialist who is worth his salt need only make use of it. We also have the South African Foreign Trade Organization. That organization is at our disposal. I think&#x2014;if I am wrong, you may correct me&#x2014;that this latter organization also receives Government support. But the industrialist himself, through this organization, should not allow himself to be talked into the frame of mind, as the hon. member for East London City wanted to do, that we must look to the Government to help us. Sir, the industrialist of South Africa must help himself. I shall try to prove to you that it is in fact possible to achieve tremendous heights by helping oneself. I also want to prove to you that if we think ourselves into a frame of mind that we must obtain help from someone else, we land ourselves in a position in which things will immediately go wrong.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2020;In the Western world today, as far as exports are concerned, the worst off country in the whole world is the United States of America. Everybody knows that. But why is that so? It is because the United States is so vast. The American will tell you: &#x201C;If I have only got half a percent of the market, I&#x2019;ve still got a hell of a market&#x201D;.</block>

<p>*Sir, it is true. This frame of mind of the American that, even though he has a small part of the market only, he still has a big market, has resulted in the Americans being in the position, as far as their balance of payments is concerned, in which they find themselves today. I would just like to say for the record that I do not want to imply that this is the only factor causing the Americans to be in this position, but I do say that it is one of the most important.</p>

<p>Sir, let us now return to South Africa. We know that, if one wants to set about anything in South Africa, one must employ one&#x2019;s own energies. I am referring to the Rupert International Organization. That is an organization which was built up in South Africa without any State aid and which is today one of the strongest and biggest in the world. I just want to tell my friends opposite that they must not think for a moment that everything was handed to this organization on a silver <span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_0694"/>plate. No, the British American Tobacco Corporation is one of the most powerful organizations in the world. Their subsidiary in South Africa, the United Tobacco Corporation&#x2014;we mention their names, because they are public companies and there is nothing wrong with it&#x2014;is a big organization, too, and the man who is to set about anything like that must know what he is doing. But private initiative came along and set about these things and today we can look with great pride at everything these people were able to do on their own initiative. Throughout the years, of course, these people have had the support of our commercial attach&#x00E9;s, wherever they may be. That goes without saying. These people did not allow themselves to become caught up in this philosophy that one must obtain State support in order to achieve success. I also want to tell our industrialists in South Africa today that we have referred to this one firm and that it must be a lesson to us. As far as our wool is concerned, the moment has arrived when our leaders in the field of wool will have to think in terms of joining hands with organizations throughout the world in order to have a share in the processing of our product to the benefit of the product itself, of our country and of the individual. We must get away from the idea which I now want to illustrate to hon. members by way of example. A very prominent Briton was in South Africa a short time ago. He put the following question: &#x201C;Will it pay to invest in our homelands today?&#x201D; The answer he received, was that investment in the homelands today was &#x201C;more idealistic than capitalistic&#x201D;. And what does that mean? That only meant that the time was past when&#x2014;and I believe that we are not referring to one single living Briton today&#x2014;a great power can come to a continent to exploit everything there is to be exploited, take the profits for itself and then leave that colony or continent or whatever, in a state of neglect. In this way our neighbour Basutoland, near which I live, was exploited. After 100 years of British rule that country is in the condition in which it finds itself today. Now the investors here and overseas will have to be prepared to invest there&#x2014;this goes for South Africa and also for anywhere else&#x2014;and such investors will have to be prepared to share in the prosperity of such an undertaking. In that way we can strengthen ourselves and stimulate our exports.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should just like to tell the hon. member for East London City that we have the &#x201C;external trade representatives of the Republic of South Africa&#x201D;. Here we have a long list of those people. I will concede that we do not cover all countries as we should like to, but the hon. member himself mentioned that, as chairman of the Wool Board at that time, doors were open to him which were not open to Governments. That is the very point with which I should like to conclude, i.e. that business people do not like having business dealings with governments if they can have them with private people. Therefore I wish to conclude by saying to our people and to the industrialists of South Africa that it is our task to go forward, to do what we can and to take cognisance with appreciation of what our hon. Minister and our Government, the officials of the department and our foreign representatives are doing in that respect. I think that if we have all that, everything bodes well for the future.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Smithfield moved an amendment which in fact amounts to a motion of: We thank the Minister. What is the real meaning of his amendment? Does it mean that the hon. member for Smithfield is quite satisfied with the present position regarding our foreign export trade? Is he quite satisfied that there should be absolutely no institutional changes and that the present position is quite satisfactory? If this is how he feels, and is of the opinion that no improvements are necessary, I should like to refer him to the report of the Reynders Commission which was published recently, because this report, which was compiled by a group of experts, differs altogether from the view held by the hon. member for Smithfield. I shall come back to this point at a later stage.</p>

<p>&#x2020; Mr. Speaker, I think one should start one&#x2019;s contribution to this debate by paying tribute to the Reynders Commission for the remarkable job they have done on a very complex subject in a very short space of time. The whole problem of South Africa&#x2019;s export and import relationships, more particularly the problems that lie ahead of us in connection with our foreign exports, is a most complex one and has not been made less complex by reason of changes in world currencies, instability of <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0695"/>monetary systems and, in particular, the recent entry of Great Britain into the Common Market. I believe that the Reynders Commission, in taking on this massive task as late as July, 1971, have in a remarkably short time encompassed a very wide range of information, knowledge and opinions and have produced a report which is a remarkable document and one which will serve as a solid foundation for the further development of our export trade. I must confess that I have not read the whole report, but I have read the summary and some chapters. The Reynders Commission refers, on page 639, para. 55, specifically to the question which is the subject of this afternoon&#x2019;s motion. What they say is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Without detracting from the valuable work already done by the existing bodies in the public and private sectors, it must be emphasized that, at least in the institutional sphere, the Republic&#x2019;s export effort is characterized by a rather piecemeal approach to export promotion; a rather haphazard approach to export planning as an integral part of the country&#x2019;s broader economic and industrial policy; a lack in following through opportunities for export and capitalizing on past performance; and gaps in the coordination, co-operation and liaison in both the public and private sectors. This can be fatal and it would appear that a major overhaul is indicated &#x2026;</block>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Smithfield is listening.</p>

<p>This is what the Reynders Commission had to say. It goes on and in a later paragraph, paragraph 57 on page 640, they deal with the following matters. I want the hon. member for Smithfield to promise me that he will read it.</p>

</speech>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>The commission gave considerable thought to the principles on which reorganization of official export services should be based and concluded with the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) A significant degree of involvement by the Cabinet as well as by the private sector in export and export promotion;</li>

<li>(b) A concentration as far as possible of export promotional activity in one body;</li>

<li>(c) Co-ordination, co-operation and liaison between the various Government and semi-Government bodies as statutory organizations and between them and the private sector; and</li>

<li>(d) A higher status, new image, a minimum of reorganization and an extension of personnel as well as an increased budgetary provision and greater freedom from the restrictions imposed by certain civil service administrative policies, practices and procedures for the Export Promotion Division of the Department of Commerce.</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not know how to say it more clearly than the Reynders Commission has done. This is all we are pleading for. We have not come to this House to attack the hon. the Minister; we have not come to this House to attack the hon. member for Smithfield. We have come here to plead in the interests of improved exports for South Africa that certain fundamental changes should be made and we are supported up to the hilt by the Reynders Commission.</p>

<p>When we look at the Common Market as a field of special endeavour, there are certain things that need to be urgently done on a massive and systematic basis. If one goes, for example, to the market at Rungis near Paris, which has replaced the central market at Les Halles, one finds vast layouts on modem lines of a market designed to serve a public of some ten million people. This is a large market and anyone <span class="col_1365-1366" refersTo="page_0696"/>who is effective inside this market has already got a major place in which he can dispose of South African products. If one goes there he will find that the Israelis for example show how this thing should be done. In the central administrative block of Rungis market, the Israelis occupy a floor and they have experts there, all of whom have been trained in French marketing techniques, have worked in France, and have contacts in France and all its ministries. They are connected daily by telex to Israel with which they communicate after doing a tour of the market each day. They report back to Israel daily on the condition of the market, the nature of the prices, the shortages, the demand and in particular on the condition of Israeli products. They have authority to remove without more ado from the market any Israeli products which fall below standard. This constant surveillance has placed Israel in a winning export position in that important market. I&#x2019;ll give another example of what they have done. They have promoted in the whole of Western Europe the avocado pear. The avocado pear used to be regarded as a rather exotic fruit in Europe. The Israelis have conducted a campaign by means of which they persuaded every hotel, restaurant, and chef that what is needed on the menu is avocado pear in some form or other.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>They have sold this thing to the extent that it is difficult to travel through Europe and to eat in any place of high quality and not find avocado pears. And those avocado pears are Israeli avocado pears. They went into a market which did not exist. They created the market and they are now filling that market.</p>

<p>We have our seasonal advantages in South Africa&#x2014;the advantages of the Southern Hemisphere. What we cannot do in the Common Market is to go into competition against the European producer in products where we have no seasonal advantage, in other words, to compete in the same products where there is no seasonal advantage.</p>

<p>I was speaking to a South African farmer at Elgin only a couple of days ago. He is an apple farmer and he was in trouble. What he is now doing is to cultivate raspberries. He has planted several acres and they are growing well. He has flown to London himself and has found a number of buyers. In fact, he has had a wild success. He is coming back to plant as many raspberries as he can. These berries are an example of a short seasonal fruit where the Southern Hemisphere season is different from the Northern Hemisphere season and the South African can go in and sell. These are, however, exceptional cases. There are many of our exporters who are small men and who need help. They cannot do these things themselves. They cannot do their own market research, market studies, market organization and maintain salesmen abroad or travel constantly themselves. They need the help of the Government. This is what this motion is about. We ask the Government to organize assistance to our producers to advise them what to grow, to point out market trends to them and to help them get into a market which, believe me, still offers enormous opportunities to South African producers. This will, however, not be the case if they simply export what they are traditionally accustomed to grow and expect to get away with it when this is in conflict with the policies of the Common Market and its own producers. A great deal of thought has to be given to improve techniques and the approach to this whole problem.</p>

<p>I want in the short time available to me to indicate by way of an example, more than anything else, a somewhat fantastic suggestion which I do not necessarily support. It, however, indicates the kind of thinking that is necessary. The year before last I myself travelled through the Common Market and some other countries. A suggestion was made to me on several occasions that the Southern Hemisphere in order to supply the Northern Hemisphere with perishable goods, fruits, and so forth, might consider developing the airship once again. This sounds fantastic. The problem at the moment is that aeroplanes carry these goods at high costs and in quantities of mostly tens of tons. Refrigerated ships carry them by the thousands of tons but slowly and the effects of refrigeration do cause the quality to deteriorate to some extent. The airship, this Jules Vernesque idea, is something which would fly to Europe in about four or five days. It would carry hundreds of tons. It provides its own refrigeration when it flies at a certain height. The failures of the airship in <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0697"/>the past were due to the fact that they used heavy steel, canvas or cotton envelopes and hydrogen which is inflammable.</p>

<p>Today we have modern light jet engines, plastics for the fabric, light alloys for a steel framework and, instead of hydrogen, helium, which is a non-inflammable gas. It is theoretically feasible to construct these giant carriers which can convey our goods in increasing quantities cheaply to Europe. There will be no problems about landing; you moor them to a mast and the goods go straight down into the market by lift. There are, of course, navigational and design problems. But this is not entirely out of the question. Not very long ago I was talking to a German aircraft development firm and they told me that they were in fact working on the revival of the airship as a cargo carrier for the new age.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not suggesting that we should all rush out of this House and go and build an airship; the problem is not as simple as that. I mention this by way of illustration to show that imaginative thinking, research, development and participation by the Government on a broad basis, with a grasp of the problems involved, and the volumes involved in the future, is the kind of leadership that is needed and the kind of co-ordination that is needed. The individual growers cannot do this. I agree fully with the hon. member for Smithfield that a great deal must depend on private initiative and that it is wrong for everybody to sit back and hope that the Government is going to run the whole thing. But, Sir, there are certain things which only the Government can do. There are certain things which require institutional guidance and leadership, and in these matters we look to the Government. I very much hope, Sir, that the recommendations of the Reynders Commission will receive the very earnest attention of the Government and that the subject matter of the motion today in particular will receive the urgent and special attention of the Government, because there is a great lack of proper coordination of our export drive overseas.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis began his speech by asking the hon. member for Smithfield whether he was quite satisfied&#x2014;he used the term &#x201C;perfectly satisfied&#x201D;&#x2014;that we had done everything in our power and that we were doing everything in our power to promote our exports. Sir, my answer to that&#x2014;and I think that I can also speak on behalf of the hon. member for Smithfield&#x2014; is immediately &#x201C;no&#x201D;.</p>

<p>We are not perfectly satisfied, but we are thankful for what has already been done, and that is why we have proposed this amendment which the hon. member for Smithfield has framed so ably. Of course we are not perfectly satisfied. After all, Sir, who appointed the Reynders Commission? It was this Government which appointed the Reynders Commission, and why was it appointed? In the terms of reference of the Commission it was stated very clearly that this Commission was to investigate ways and means in which we could promote our exports. I repeat that we are not perfectly satisfied, and that is why we are doing certain things and why this Government appointed the Reynders Commission to investigate ways and means in which we could promote our exports. It stands to reason that this Government fully realizes the necessity for the export of industrial products, raw materials, etc., because no one realizes better than does this Government that our major export product, namely gold, is getting less and less.</p>

<p>We are all taking note with great interest and gratitude of the fact that the world has at last come to its senses and has realized that the role of gold has not ended: that the world has at last come to its senses and no longer takes any notice of the so-called official price of gold. We are grateful for that, but in spite of the fact that we are seeing how gold is once again playing its rightful role in the world, in spite of the fact that we realize that the higher gold price will enable us to mine lower-grade ore and that the mining of gold may now continue for so much longer and that the export of gold will play a so much greater role in our exports, we are still very well aware that we shall in the future have to rely more and more on exports of our industrial products, raw materials, agricultural produce and minerals. It is for the very reason that this Government is so well aware of the fact that these exports will have to play an ever greater role, that it appointed the Reynders Commission. And, what is more, it has already begun to give effect to recommendations contained in the interim report of the Reynders Commission. <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_0698"/>Surely one cannot expect that, so soon after the Reynders Commission made its report, this Government should immediately say that it will accept and implement all the recommendations made by the Commission. But the Government has in fact already implemented in part some of the recommendations of the interim report.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis jeeringly asked whether the hon. member for Smithfield had ever read this report. Of course we on this side of the House have read the report. Now I wish to refer the hon. member for Von Brandis to the table on page 287 of the first part of the report, where the Reynders Commission indicated that although the amount budgeted as the contribution to export financing in 1972-&#x2019;73 was R1 125 000, the Government has since then already agreed to this amount being increased to R6 million. I want to stress, Sir, that this Government is responsible for this Commission being appointed, and that it will certainly not just push aside the report of its own Commission. It will of course take time to implement the report, but I am convinced that the Government will give the most careful attention to the report which its own Commission has published for it, and whereas it has already begun to implement the interim report, I have every confidence that it will also go further.</p>

<p>Now I do not want to suggest for one moment that the Government will accept all the recommendations. The hon. member for Von Brandis spoke of institutional changes. There are, of course, various schools of thought concerning these institutional changes. For example, Australia&#x2019;s approach to export promotion differs from that of all the other Western countries. In Australia it is not Government officials who conduct export promotion, but a body which recruits people from the private sector to go overseas for the purpose of conducting export promotion for a contract period of three years. There is possibly a great deal to be said for that. They are people who are drawn from private industry, people who are fully conversant with industries in general and their problems and with the quality of products, and so on, but up to the present no other country has followed Australia&#x2019;s example. That part of the report which was quoted by the hon. member for Von Brandis, probably refers to the conditions which prevail in Australia, because it repeatedly quoted the position in Australia. But there is no doubt that this report will be studied very thoroughly, and if it should then appear to be necessary or possible to follow another institutional pattern, that will be done. But I want to repeat that no other country in the West has up to the present time followed Australia&#x2019;s example in regard to that institutional bias. There must decidedly be major objections to it as well, and that is why the other countries the West have so far not copied it.</p>

<p>Both gentlemen of the Opposition who have spoken so far, have stressed the fact that we can do so much more. On behalf of this side of the House I wish to admit immediately that much more can be done to promote exports, but now we are saddled with the problem that it is in fact that side of the House which, when we increase State expenditure, is continually casting it in our teeth that we must curb State expenditure. As a matter of fact, I wonder how the hon. member for East London City managed to get that motion of his through his caucus. I wonder how it was that they gave him permission to move that motion. [Interjections.] After all, it is common knowledge that the hon. the main speaker on financial and economic affairs on that side, the hon. member for Park-town, and the Leader of the Opposition have repeatedly cast it in the teeth of this side of the House that the Government must curb its own expenditure. However, the hon. member for East London City has said that we can do much more. We agree that we can do much more, but will he not on a future occasion say that the State is spending too much? Because this is so and because this Government is continually aware that it must not simply throw money around wildly, it is continually engaged in determining its priorities. It is also continually engaged in determining its priorities as far as the promotion of exports is concerned. Incidentally, I have the Afrikaans text of the motion before me and I wondered what the difference was between &#x201C;kommersi&#x00EB;le&#x201D; (commercial) and &#x201C;handels-verteenwoordiging&#x201D; (trade representation). Before a government decides that trade representatives are to be appointed in a particular country, it must consider very carefully whether, in the first instance, it is economical, in the second instance, whether the import potential of that country justifies the appointment of trade representatives, and, in the third instance, whether its exporters can meet the demand. The hon. member for East London City dwelt at length on the tremendous potential <span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_0699"/>which exists in the East with Red China&#x2019;s 800 million people and the other countries scattered around it, resulting in a buyer&#x2019;s market of approximately 2 000 million people. Before a country appoints trade representatives, it must very carefully consider the three factors which I have mentioned. I want to ask the hon. member what he wants to export to Red China.</p>

<p>But then, surely, there will be none left. Surely there are not so many of them that they can be exported. [Interjections.] A wise government must continually determine its priorities and ascertain whether it is worth the trouble to appoint trade representatives in a country. The hon. member for East London City has pleaded that we should appoint many more trade representatives in the East. I want to point out to the hon. member that our traditional marketing area has always been Europe. In the first instance, Europe is so much nearer to us, and since the custom has developed to increase freight charges every six months, we must of course give very careful attention to the distance over which our export goods are to be conveyed. Because Europe is so much nearer, it is much more important to have strong trade representation in Europe, as we do in fact have, rather than to appoint all of a sudden a large number of representatives in the East. When we have regard to the tremendous increase in freight charges, I grow cold and foresee that we shall find it more and more difficult to export. Therefore I say it is perfectly correct for us to confine our attention in the first instance to markets nearer home. Here, of course, Africa is the first place that comes to mind, and then Europe.</p>

<p>But I would also like to express a few thoughts concerning the task of the exporter himself, as was in fact done by my hon. friend the member for Smithfield. It is of course a fact that the Government is doing a great deal through its trade representation to promote our exports, but the exporter himself, either as an individual or as a member of certain organizations, also has a very important task. I have in mind an organization such as the K.W.V., which has its own office in London, and which is doing a tremendous job of work in promoting our exports there. I have in mind the Deciduous Fruit Board and the Citrus Board, both of which have their own offices in London and employ a considerable staff for promoting exports there. But an endless amount can still be done by various exporters, either as individuals or as organizations, to promote exports.</p>

<p>A few friends of mine visited Europe last year, and among other things they visited the international food show in Paris. We all know that the Government makes available all the necessary facilities for exhibiting our wares there in order that they may be sold. At that international food show our Government leased a great deal of space to enable our exporters to exhibit their products there and to find buyers. It went further. It addressed letters to 83 export organizations and invited them to make use of these facilities to exhibit their products there. The Government provides the space, the furnishings, the shelving, etc. It pays for the electricity used. All the exporter must do is to exhibit his products there. But what reaction did we get! Of the 83 organizations approached, only 21 considered it to be worth the trouble to reply to those letters&#x2014;and that after an overseas trade representative on home leave had personally approached these exporters and beseeched and implored them to make use of the facilities which the Government was making available to them there for advertising their wares. Only 21 replied&#x2014;the number who exhibited was not 21! Eventually there were only a few oranges, which of course shrivelled up in due course. Not one of the others make use of these facilities which the Government had made available for advertising their products and promoting exports.</p>

<p>There are other ways in which exporters can serve their own cause. Thirteen years ago, when I was still a back-bencher, I pleaded that our exporters would have to act far more rationally and that they would also have to develop the market on the continent of Europe. If they wished to do that, they should of course attempt to develop that market by making use of the languages of those countries in which they wished to promote exports. A certain organization, which I named at that time, complied this year for the first time, after 13 years, with that request which I made at that time. How on earth, Mr. Speaker, can one conduct sales promotion in a country if one does so in a foreign language? <span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_0700"/>Obviously one must do it in the language of the country in which one wishes to sell one&#x2019;s products. If Japan advertised its cars here in Japanese, who would look at them? We cannot understand Japanese. Who can conduct sales promotion in a country if one does so in a foreign language? What have we been doing all these years? We have been trying to promote sales in Germany, France, Switzerland, Holland and Scandinavia, in English. It is time our exporters also came to their senses and realized that one cannot try to persuade a country in a foreign language. Obviously one must do so in its own language.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I touched on at that time, namely that of weights and measures. We tried to sell fruit on the continental market in pounds. The people of the continent are not conversant with pounds; they are used to kilograms. However, we have been selling it in pounds all these years. We do not want to visualize the situation of the customer and we forget the first important lesson to be learnt in trade, namely that the customer is always right. Now, fortunately, we have also accepted the metric system and that problem has solved itself. But why do we always run to the Government to remedy these matters for us, while we ourselves can and must and shall remedy them?</p>

<p>Having said all these things, I now want to acknowledge immediately that the entry of Great Britain into the European Common Market implies major problems for our exporters, and particularly for the exporters of agricultural products. But here, too, this Government immediately proceeded to appoint one of its most senior diplomats, Dr. Naud&#x00E9;, at the headquarters of Euromart in Brussels, to keep a weather eye open and to establish the necessary contacts in order to enable us to enter into negotiations with the Euromart headquarters so as to alleviate and cope with those problems arising after Britain&#x2019;s entry. These problems are formidable indeed, because the import duty, the so-called &#x201C;tariff&#x201D; which the Common Market imposes, has no scientific basis. Those import tariffs are based on the amount of the highest tariff&#x2014;before the Treaty of Rome in 1957&#x2014;imposed by any of the members of Euro-mart. That has resulted in there being no scientific basis for these tariffs. It therefore goes without saying that we must leave no stone unturned in trying to effect at least a change in these tariffs, even though we may be unable to have them abolished completely. Now, with the entry of Britain into Euromart, Britain experienced problems with its own apple and pear farmers. For this reason it requested additional protection in the form of a transitional period of five years for its apple and pear farmers. This has had the effect that our farmers have also been adversely affected by it. For example, we must pay R1-15 on pears, R1-85 on apples, plus the import tariff of 10%. The tariff on grapes is 18%, on peaches 22%, on appricots 24% and on plums 10%. All these things will make things extremely difficult for our exporters. But I want to repeat that in conjunction with the various industries the Government is thoroughly looking into these problems and it will solve those problems as far as possible for our various industries. It is for that reason that I support so wholeheartedly the amendment of my hon. friend, in which we want to express our thanks for what the Government has already done, for what it is still doing and for what we believe it will do in the future for our industries and for our export.</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having regard to the fact that all speakers on this side of the House have stressed that neither are we endeavouring to attack the Minister nor the Government nor departmental officials, I am a little puzzled as to why the hon. member for Paarl seems to have lost his cool. At least from the hon. member for Smithfield we had his usual calm and charm. It has been suggested to me that perhaps the hon. member for Paarl should have come in under the more ebullient and effervescent agricultural motion which preceded this motion. Alternatively, perhaps he is speaking under the wrong motion and is supporting the hon. member for Carltonville in his motion that comes before the House on the 9th March, namely that this House expresses its appreciation to the Government for the guidance it has given and the measures it has taken in combating inflation. As far back as 1957 Prof. Ralph Horwitz wrote a little pamphlet entitled &#x201C;Expand or Explode; Export or Bust&#x201D;. He expressed the viewpoint that only expanding industrialization and agricultural capacity could possibly contain a racial explosion. Our motion is couched in the interests of the economy and of South Africa as a whole, as a unit. The need for positive and constructive steps to improve our <span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_0701"/>export position is highlighted by a study of the statistics as set out in the December, 1972, Bulletin of Statistics. This is my authority for the figures I wish to quote. I think we cannot be complacent with regard to the situation which faces this country unless we do secure alternate markets in the place of the European Common Market, to cover the losses which we may suffer and unless we in any case secure new markets in order to take up our agricultural surpluses and also our manufacturing capacity. The relevant figures were that in 1969, 1970 and 1971 we imported into South Africa R2 128 million, R2 540 million and R2 878 million respectively. What do we find is the position with our exports if we extract the impact that gold sales have? We then find that our merchandise exports, including agricultural products, only benefited the economy to the extent of R1 530 million, R1 533 million and R1 540 million respectively up to 1971. So, without our gold, you will see that our balance of payments position becomes quite untenable and we will have to suffer a lowering of standards for all our peoples unless by energy, enthusiasm and efficiency we can secure additional markets in the fields referred to by the hon. member for East London City. If we break down these exports, we find that to date we have relied heavily on the United Kingdom and the Common Market countries Belgium, Luxembourg, France, the Fedral Republic of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, for almost 50% of our exports have been routed to those countries, making a grand total of R760 million in 1971. It is interesting to note that our exports to the Americas and Canada, collectively, were only R166 million, to Africa R292 million, to Asia R230 million and to Oceania&#x2014;i.e. Austrialia and New Zealand&#x2014;R16 million. Quite clearly, we have to face the problem that because of the threat that we may lose the markets in the European community, we must become more aggressive. My colleague, the hon. member for Von Brandis, has dealt in some detail with the situation of our trading with the Common Market. It would appear that the primary producers in the agricultural sector will be the first to suffer in the short period, but over the longer period&#x2014;and I believe this will be the case&#x2014;the enormous market which is being created by the 250 million population group constituting the E.E.C., will enable us to make a comeback. I think it is not so much a threat in the short-term, but a challenge to our ability to hold our world markets in the future.</p>

<p>My hon. colleague, the mover of the motion which is now before the House, has pinpointed the many opportunities which we are losing in our world markets. I have here a list of our trade representatives in many important markets. In Brazil we have only a councillor (mining) and a consul (commercial). In the Republic of China we have only a consul (commercial) and so on. These market could all be strengthened by more aggressive representation which would give us the sort of government facilities that the hon. member for Von Brandis has mentioned Israel has in the Paris market. I believe that South Africa offers a more exciting future as a country with an economic prospect than many others. If we have regard to our fantastic untapped reservoir of labour upon which we can fall back, our climatic conditions and our mineral resources, we do not have to think small, but we can think big. In fact I believe that South Africa could not only become the workshop for the world, given an improvement in productivity which could be related to the productive output of either Canada or in Europe, but we could also become the Common Market for Africa and what is more we could become the Japan of the next decade. We have everything in our favour if we are not held back by a reluctant Government.</p>

<p>This motion has made reference to the difficulties which South African industrialists and farmers are experiencing owing to the problems of being removed from the Common Market. These problems are very real. I want to make one comment. We have the answer in our own hands. It is interesting to note that the Common Market arose from a realization that a thousand years of warring between the tribes in Europe and ultimately the nations could not go on if Europe was to survive in the face of the tremendous economic blocks which had been created in America in the West and in Russia, China and Japan in the East. The six major nations of Europe came together in order to break down national boundaries to create new freedom of movement for entrepreneurial skills, for labour, for capital and for materials. Arising out of this decision they have created a market which, now that Britain has entered that market, has created the largest trading bloc in the world, consisting of 250 million persons. They did so, hon. members will note, by coming together and not <span class="col_1377-1378" refersTo="page_0702"/>by breaking away. They realized that if they were to exist in a competitive world and if they were to export to other countries they had to have the economies of scale, the economies of size and of capital. This is the tragedy that faces our country in contradistinction. What do we find? From a once-strong consolidated economy, this Government&#x2019;s policy is to fragment the economy, to tribalize it, to balkanize it. Whereas the whole of the rest of the world is realizing that strength lies in power, unity is strength, we have as a policy a desire to break down, not such a tremendously large economy, into a number of separate non-viable units. This is what is making our position more difficult.</p>

<p>The immediate threat to our economy as far as our loss in the short term in the European Economic Community is concerned, lies without doubt in the economy of the Cape Western Province. It is our fruit industry, our canned vegetable industry and our wine industry that will take the biggest knock and it is these industries that we have to protect in the short period. We can only do so if we are conscious of the fact that, as was mentioned by one of the main speakers of yesterday in a maiden speech, we are a world with an exploding population that is eternally hungry. Therefore with our agricultural products, our base metals, our minerals, all of which are needed to build up nations that are underdeveloped, we need have no fear. All we need is imagination, imagination to see the opportunity and determination to take the gap. As has been said before today, one cannot do this merely with private enterprise. The entree at Government level, the creating of a correct economic climate linked with political alliances, can only come from well-staffed embassies and well-staffed legations. The dangers of putting a square peg in a round hole as far as appointment at embassies and consulates are concerned have been shown up all too blantly and tragically only yesterday in the case of our Embassy at Rome. We plead for the selection of the right personnel to be placed in the right organizations and to be given the freedom and encouragement which will enable them to make friends and not enemies. These are the objectives which this resolution before this House is seeking, namely that we should investigate with speed and a sense of urgency every possible and new outlet for our growing manufacturing enterprise. It has been said over and over again that unless we can enable our manufacturers to enjoy the economics of size and scale, unless we can improve our productivity and reduce our unit costs, how are we to compete with the new vast economies which have arisen in the E.E.C., America and the East. We cannot compel our manufacturers to put in the necessary capital equipment to develop the economies of scale and size while they can only rely on a local market potential of three million European peoples. Until we can bring along our non-European people to create an economy of some 20 million peoples, our manufacturers and our farmers have to look to outside sources. Just as the door of the E.E.C. is being closed so we must open new doors. We can do this. There is every indication that we can be proud of our standards of manufacture; we can be proud of the quality of our agricultural products. Our markets, I believe, do lie in Africa; they can be won. They do also lie in the Middle East and they can be won. They are also in the Far East. Hundreds of millions of persons in those areas are waiting patiently for improved living standards. All we ask and all we move which is the main intention with this motion, is that the Government take active steps to improve and increase representation at trade level in every potential country where we can find entry.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens started off very nicely and we agree with him that we must obtain more markets. I think he spoilt his whole speech by his reference to a reluctant Government. This Government is not a reluctant Government. This Government understand the whole position and is very anxious to get more markets. The hon. member also made a personal innuendo about our ambassador in Rome. I think that further spoilt his speech; he should not have done that. This debate has been conducted on a very high level up to now. I think it is just about too much to drag politics into a debate which should be conducted on a high level with the interests of South Africa at heart.</p>

<p>*We shall always have problems concerning exports; this is no easy task. The Government appointed the Reynders Commission and I wish to associate myself with those who have congratulated the Reynders Commission on the work that has been done. They performed a major task and I <span class="col_1379-1380" refersTo="page_0703"/>am sure that this report will for many years be a reference work for students of the export trade, and also for our industrialists and our agricultural producers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis quoted a piece from this report which does not really convey the spirit of the report. I want to quote a paragraph in which the spirit of the report is very well conveyed. It appears on page 668 and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The golden thread which runs throughout the report can be stated with deceptive simplicity: <i>Choose directions for export development and concentrate promotional efforts thereon and in the process make it easier for the exporter to sell in foreign markets.</i> But exporting is hard work and extremely demanding of the individual; it must be approached with great resoluteness and perseverance and requires an entirely different approach than domestic marketing. The Government can assist by providing incentives and the necessary overall promotional machinery and services as well as the required physical infrastructure and a favourable business climate; but in the last analysis it is up to the business man to get out into the market place, to study markets, develop, win, maintain and retain them&#x2014;in short: the hard sell! Stated differently, in the actual marketing of goods and services the Government takes a back seat, the real task of mounting an export drive resting upon the private sector.</block>

<p>That was the final conclusion in this report. That shows us that the private sector has not done enough yet. This appears in the report time and again I want to give members of the United Party the assurance that we are studying this report very carefully and that we appreciate it very much. I want to talk about agricultural products in particular because the E.C.M. was mentioned in the motion of the United Party as well as in our amendment. We have problems with the E.C.M., of course. I want to adopt the standpoint that our agricultural control boards have, in the past, done to a large extent what is being recommended by the Reynders Commission now. They have worked in close collaboration with the Government and have, on their own initiative, given effect to most of the recommendations contained in the report. I may just mention that the Karakul Board for example has professional advertising agents in 14 different countries who attend to the marketing and publicising of Swakaras. They attend to liaison work, advertisements, fashion shows, films, television and so forth. The total expenditure in this respect is R1 049 000. It is a large amount, which indicates that the Board appreciates the value of advertising. In referring to the Wool Board now, I probably do not know as much about it as the hon. member for East London City does. I would however like to quote a few statistics for the record.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>You know more about it, man.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The contribution of the Republic towards the International Wool Secretariat is R3 292 000 out of a total expenditure by the Wool Secretariat of R16 250 000. They have branches in 24 countries. They have promotion campaigns to publicise the woolmark and the wool blend mark symbols. They develop new processes in laboratories. They have fashion services in London for men and in Paris for the ladies. They even have a workshop in Delft for knitting development where knitting patterns and so forth are tested in order to be introduced to manufacturers.</p>

<p>Then we have the K.W.V. The hon. member for Paarl has already referred to it. Last year they spent R213 000 on advertising. Most of it was spent in Canada with the intention of developing a market there.</p>

<p>The Deciduous Fruit Board plans to spend R1 228 000 during 1972-&#x2019;73 in respect of advertising. Now we know that our apple producers in particular will be faced with major difficulties in the near future. The import duty on apples has been fixed by the E.C.M. at R2-15 per carton. This is a tremendously high figure. It is so high that it will be almost impossible for our farmers to sell their apples there. Fortunately, there is a provision that this amount will be reduced after five years. In this connection I want to make a plea to the Government. If the apple farmers find that this tremendously high duty by the E.C.M. makes things difficult for them during the first few years, it may perhaps be necessary for the Government to lend <span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_0704"/>a hand. But in the meantime the Deciduous Fruit Board have not let the grass grow under their feet: they have sent people overseas; they have made contact in the United Kingdom with a very large organization, Home Grown Fruits, and have entered into an agreement with them for our apples to be exported in bulk, that this organization will then repack the apples in smaller containers and then deliver them direct to the retail trade. In this way the D.F.B. hopes to recover the ground lost because of the import duty. It is also true, Sir, that the higher standard of living which resulted from England&#x2019;s joining the E.C.M., has caused prices to rise. Last year the prices of our fresh fruit in England were higher than ever before.</p>

<p>Then I come to the Citrus Board, in which I am interested. I think they have developed a model marketing organization overseas. This year they are spending R2 186 000 on advertising. Sir, they have many fine schemes, for example, the Out-span girls, very pretty South African girls, who go there to advertise our fruit. Why did they do that, Sir? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>About seven years ago the citrus farmers decided that they themselves must do something about marketing. They did not look to the Government to help them. They appointed marketing consultants at great expense. At that time it cost them more than R100 000. They appointed these marketing consultants, and they carried out the plans the marketing consultants submitted to them.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, may I ask a question? The hon. member says that he has taken a great interest in the question of citrus. Has he made representations, for instance to the hon. the Minister of Transport, about the rates on export citrus?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>We hope that this reduction in rates is also going to apply to citrus, but I must tell the hon. member that at the moment, we are paying, on our export citrus, only one-third of the rate payable on local fruit. We have already got a very good rebate.</p>

<p>*Sir, I believe that the example set by the citrus industry should go very far. If these plans they have made are pursued, then it will help a great deal to find overseas markets for agricultural products. I should like to refer to the exhibition in Paris where a large amount of fruit and many products were exhibited. Unfortunately an error was made. The citrus which was exhibited there, had wilted. The citrus industry subsequently instituted a very thorough investigation. Experience has taught us that this kind of exhibition is of very little value. The advice furnished by the economic advisers eliminates the middle man; it eliminates auctions, and the citrus board has done this, and today they sell direct to the retail trade. The eliminate auctions altogether. They lay down a fixed price and insist on getting it. Sir, I believe that we shall get very far with this method. Today it is not easy to sell overseas. We live in a time of specialization when everyone must be an expert in his field. How can one expect an official in an embassy to be an expert on 110 different products? Sir, I believe that if we accept the advice of that commission and if each one of us puts his shoulder to the wheel, we shall have great success with our exports.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am rather disappointed that the hon. members opposite have not seen fit to support the original motion moved by the hon. member for East London City, but have seen fit to move their own amendment. The motion has been put forward as a constructive resolution to help the export trade of South Africa, and to have moved an amendment such as we have before the House is, I think, completely unrealistic in the circumstances of this debate, as also, I think, were some of the arguments used to support the amendment. The resolution we have before this House, I believe, touches at the very heart of one of the most important economic problems which face South Africa and one of the most difficult problems that we have to solve. The hon. member for East London City quoted at length from the report of the Reynders Commission in respect of the need we have in South Africa to develop our export trade if we are going to be able to grow economically as a nation in the future. I think both sides of this House realize how important economic growth is if we are going to solve our social and racial problems. On developing <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_0705"/>and expanding exports in future is going to depend on our ability to import machinery, plant and raw materials which can be used for the development of our country. This motion before the House, because the debate is necessarily a fairly short one, confines itself to one aspect of the solution to the problem of increasing exports. I propose to deal with this question before the House, of strengthening our trade and commercial representation, from one particular angle, but I hope that in doing so I shall be able to put forward suggestions which may be of assistance to the Minister and his department.</p>

<p>Although the general trend in South Africa is for the State to play a greater part in the economic activities of the country and a greater part in its productive activities, it is still true to say that we are basically a private enterprise country. I think both sides of the House support wholeheartedly the principle of private enterprise. That being so, it is true to say that it is private enterprise that manufactures and produces the majority of the products capable of being exported. As it is private enterprise that does this, we have to realize that that private enterprise is motivated primarily by the profit motive, and it will only be moved to export, it will only be moved to take the necessary steps to find export markets, if it is profitable for it to do so. That is a fact of economic life. It is no use exhorting people to export; it has to be profitable for them to export. There are some industries, fortunately important industries, in South Africa where it is profitable for them to export or where their very existence depends on their being able to export. Diamonds, for instance, are exported because practically the whole of the diamond market is in the export field. The same applies very largely to wool, sugar, the citrus industry and the deciduous fruit industry, and, when we have surpluses, the maize industry. It applies to the fruit canning industry and to the fish canning industry. Coal owners would like to export&#x2014;they do export to some extent&#x2014;because they have the capacity to do so profitably if the necessary transport and harbour facilities were available. In other cases businesses export because they can get better prices in the export field than they can in the local field. I refer, for instance, to fishmeal and rock-lobster exporters, and so I could go on. The point which I am making in this regard is that as far as these industries are concerned it is in their interest to export. They make profits out of exporting. They make money out of exporting and because that is the case, you can rely on them to make the necessary arrangements to find their own export markets. Certainly, they would be helped by a strengthening of our trade representation, but as far as they are concerned, that strengthening would be on a general and geographical basis.</p>

<p>It is a completely different cup of tea when we come to those industries which are orientated towards the domestic market. It is in respect of those industries that we need strong trade representation abroad if they are going to develop export markets. There are many of such industries. I would say that virtually the whole secondary industry in this country falls into the category of industries that are domestic market orientated. The consumer industries in this country are domestic market orientated. Take the clothing industry for example. It is one of our biggest industries. Certainly isolated manufacturers in the clothing industry do export, but on the whole the industry does not and, in fact, the great majority of manufacturers in the industry do not. The same applies to most manufacturers in the producer goods industries, those manufacturers which make goods used in other industries, the mining industry and so forth. I refer to the engineering industry for instance. Those industries, again, are domestic market orientated. There are various natural reasons why they should be so orientated. On the whole the South African market is a comparatively small one, with the result that manufacturers in it on the whole and by world standards are relatively small manufacturers. They produce a wide variety of goods. Their production runs on the whole are relatively small, but at the same time, being orientated towards the market, they do make good profits by selling to the local market and they do on the whole enjoy growth. What incentive therefore is there for them to go to considerable expense to develop export markets where their products would be subjected to considerably severer competition than they experience in the local market? If those industries which are not exporting are to export, they are not going to do so oft their own bat. They are going to do so only if they receive considerable sales promotion and marketing aid, but sales promotion and marketing aid of a particular type that will suit their particular industry.</p>

<p><span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0706"/>The trade advisers and the professional officers that we have under the Department of Commerce do perform a very valuable job, but it is by the very nature of their job and by the very nature of the fact that there are comparatively few of them spread over a very wide geographical area that their work must be of a general rather than a specialized nature. If we are to open up markets for those industries which are not motivated to do so for themselves, we need not general men; we need men with specialized skills, specialized knowledge of the industries they are trying to work for, specialized training and specialized experience.</p>

<p>I think a very good example of what I have in mind is what is being done for the tourist industry by SATOUR. Within a very limited budget, a budget of less than R2 million, SATOUR is doing a first-class job of promoting the tourist industry of this country. It has a team of dedicated experts who do an expert job. The job that SATOUR is doing cannot be done by the individual units such as the hotels in the tourist industry. Individual hotels neither have the incentive to do this for themselves nor, except in a few cases, do they have the financial resources. I doubt whether even if the hotel industry as a whole got together and made a combined effort it could do as well as SATOUR does. I have personal experience of trying to get the hotel industry together and I know the difficulties of their working together when it entails putting their hands into their pockets.</p>

<p>I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that one of the most effective ways of opening up new markets for industries which are not exporting at present would be, first of all, to select industries, on a very selective basis, which are producing goods that are likely to be acceptable in export markets and then, after careful market surveys, to select markets where those goods are likely to be acceptable and, working in conjunction with the industries concerned, to send in teams of experts to do the job of sales promotion and marketing on a thorough basis. These teams need not, as is the case with SATOUR, be parts of separate corporations; they can be part of the existing Department of Commerce organization. However, I do suggest that they should not be regarded as permanent; they should be regarded as task forces to do a job of opening up export markets and when those markets are opened up, it should be left to the industries themselves, either on an individual-firm basis or on an industry-as-a-whole basis, to take over from the task force to be sent in by the Department of Commerce. I believe that once a market is opened up, once the industry realizes that there is profitable business to be done in exporting to that market, there will be no problem in the industry taking over, because they will not like to see that market go.</p>

<p>I believe that what I have said is a practical way of promoting exports. I believe that it is the practical way of strengthening the overseas commercial and trade representation for which this motion calls and I have much pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has become obvious to me from this discussion that there is one fact on which all of us are agreed, namely that we are keen to promote our exports. In fact, the speech made by the hon. member for Constantia, who has just resumed his seat, had export promotion as its theme. And in that respect we have no fault to find; but if one takes a look at this motion, it is clear that it actually embraces something else. The motion reads&#x2014;</p>

<p>In other words, his motion asks for the trade representatives, for reasons quoted by him&#x2014;and then he also says &#x201C;wherever possible and necessary&#x201D;&#x2014;to be strengthened by <span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0707"/>the appointment of properly qualified personnel. Arising from the argument on the amendment that was proposed, I just want to tell the hon. member that a motion such as this one is unnecessary. There are no good grounds for coming to this House with such a motion. A motion dealing with export promotion, with what additional ways and means we can employ to promote export, as, <i>inter alia,</i> set out in the report of the Reynders Commission, is a different matter. In fact, I want to say with respect that this is actually what the discussion today was concerned with&#x2014;export promotion. But what the hon. member is asking for here, is being done from day to day and from year to year. The hon. gentlemen quoted freely from the report of the Reynders Commission, but in the passages read out here by them there is nothing that indicates that what is being requested in this motion is not being done. None of these quotations have given the slightest indication that the Government is not doing all that is necessary and possible, as circumstances may require&#x2014;as the hon. member puts it in his motion&#x2014;to bring about trade representations through properly qualified people. It goes without saying, Sir, that nobody will suggest that everything is perfect. How can we, a small country such as South Africa, have trade representation in the world which is comparable with, for instance, that of the United States of America? It stands to reason that one cannot expect that. We cannot reach for the moon, because that is not humanly possible. But what is reasonable and possible in the circumstances, is being done.</p>

<p>Further to one statement that was made here by the hon. member for East London City, more specifically in respect of Thailand, I want to say something else. He said, amongst other things, that we should extend our honorary trade representation further. In that regard we have certain problems from time to time. One of these problems&#x2014;this is applicable to Thailand&#x2014;is that in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs we, too, should like to have permanent representation in certain countries, and honorary trade representation in the country where we should like to have official representation will in all probability thwart the appointment of official representatives there, as the hon. member will probably realize too. In the case of Thailand this is precisely the position. We should like to have official representation there, and in the meantime it is being suggested to us that it may as well be honorary trade representations. We believe that if we were now to introduce honorary trade representation there, it would hamper our chances of having official trade representation there. Such are the problems we experience from time to time and from place to place.</p>

<p>But as far as export promotion is concerned, I do not think that we disagree in any way that this is one of the most important considerations of the Government, as is probably the case with any other government in the world. That is why the Government is in earnest about this matter. Mr. Speaker, this book, the report of the Reynders Commission, is after all proof of the Government being in earnest about export promotion. This commission was appointed by me as Minister of Economic Affairs and, as has already been said in this House today, did a tremendous job of work in producing this report within such a short time. In following up what was said by other hon. gentlemen, I should like to speak highly of this report&#x2014;and I would be neglecting my duty if I did not do so. I had contact with this commission while it was in session, and I know how much work went into this report. This commission performed a tremendous task within a short time, and I should like to express personally my highest appreciation for the work done by this commission. But, of course, this does not mean that all the recommendations contained in the report will necessarily be accepted by the Government. The Cabinet will from time to time consider the recommendations as set out in the report. As they are approved by the Cabinet and as our means permit those recommendations will be implemented. Last year already we approved and implemented certain recommendations made by this Reynders Commission as published in its interim report. A few days ago I made another announcement in regard to railway rates in order to help exporters. In this way we shall from time to time consider and implement the various recommendations wherever it is at all possible to do so.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, whereas we are considering this matter, as analysed by hon. members on both sides, and especially as seen in the light of the motion as it is phrased here and lays emphasis on trade representation, I think it is essential that we make an analysis of the task of the Government as regards export promotion through <span class="col_1389-1390" refersTo="page_0708"/>trade representation in the rest of the world, as distinct from the task of the exporter. I shall simply refer to the exporter rather than the manufacturer, for a very large part of our exports today consists of primary products which are not very closely connected with the manufacturing industry. If I should now, in the first instance, have to make an analysis of the task of the official&#x2014;i.e. of the Government&#x2019;s&#x2014;trade representation abroad, I should like to mention to you, Sir, a few points on which the department is working at the moment. I think it is primarily the task of the trade representative, in whatever foreign country he may be, to make on receiving representations from potential exporters from South Africa, a proper investigation into and a market study of the products which the exporter in question would like to market in the country in question. In that process he should then investigate the conditions as regards the existing or possible demand for those goods which the potential exporter wants to export. In the second instance, I think it is his task to inquire into the existing competition for such products in that particular country on the part of local competitors, and not only on the part of local competitors, but also on that of foreign competitors. In the third instance, it is his task to make a study of the government regulations applicable in the country in question, such as, <i>inter alia,</i> the customs tariffs that are applicable, the import restrictions that may apply in such a country, etc., so that he may inform his potential importer properly in respect of these locally applicable government regulations. Then he should also be able to inform the potential exporter properly in regard to the marketing methods that obtain and are applicable in the country of which he wants the particulars, and in addition he should do anything which in his opinion is in the interests of this exporter from South Africa so as to enable him to find himself a market in that country. Furthermore, he should generally keep us, i.e. his head office in South Africa, informed at all times of the possibility of export to that particular country in which he finds himself. In that process, in his attempts to keep us fully informed, he should, <i>inter alia,</i> examine the development projects taking place in such a country. Let us take South Africa as an example. The Saldanha/Sishen scheme is so extensive in scope that it may not even be necessary for a representative here of another country to inform his country that we have here a scheme such as the Saldanha/Sishen scheme, for I should say that this is probably world news. But it will nevertheless be his task to obtain particulars of this development project here in South Africa and then to inform his country as follows: Look, this is the scope of the project, these are the various sections of it, these contracts have already been entered into. But there are still many other additional things for which a market may perhaps be found as a result of the particular development project taking place here. Therefore I think it is the responsibility of our representative abroad to furnish us at all times with information in regard to scarcities of certain products and articles. A scarcity may perhaps develop as a result of droughts or other conditions, such as strikes or things of that nature. He should then inform his country immediately of the circumstances of those scarcities. Furthermore, it is essential for him to submit a report from time to time and to let his country know if there has been a change in the demand and in the needs of the people. The housewife may have changed her preferences from one product to another product which may in the meantime have become more popular for some reason or other. For instance, at one stage grapefruit was frightfully expensive in Britain simply because the story had been spread that grapefruit was the best remedy for slimming. At that stage grapefruit was so expensive in England that one could hardly afford it. It is information of that nature that we expect from our trade representative. It is equally important that he should notify his Government at all times of the various methods of packaging developing there. As we know, the world is always changing, so much so that the methods of packaging which are popular today and which the housewife likes, may possibly no longer be to her liking tomorrow or next week or next year. Even in respect of labelling, the change in the taste of people in respect of labelling, in respect of all these things, such a representative must at all times inform his head office in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then there is another factor with which he must be acquainted and of which he must be mindful, namely the inquiries he receives from importers in that country. In every country of the world one finds importers, people who import from other countries, and they in turn handle the distribution in their own country. Therefore, in the country in which he finds himself <span class="col_1391-1392" refersTo="page_0709"/>the importers will from time to time get into touch with him. They will ask him whether there is any possibility of their getting a particular product from South Africa. He has to negotiate with these importers and has to maintain contact with South Africa in order to ascertain whether we can supply that product to that country in given and in sufficient quantities. When he does so as a result of inquiries from an importer in a particular country, it is in turn our task here to ascertain domestically, in South Africa, whether there are people who are interested in these products in which that importer in the other country is interested. Then, I think it is also the task of our official trade representative to be mindful from time to time, at all times, of the possibility of complaints which may be lodged in regard to products coming from South Africa and being sold there in his country. If there are any complaints about, for instance, the quality of the products, it is his duty to inform South Africa and, through his headquarters here, also the exporters that there are certain shortcomings in the products they are marketing. It is, furthermore, the task of the trade representative to bring about a dissemination of information on South Africa&#x2019;s products. For instance, he must see to it that advertisements of certain products are placed in local newspapers and magazines, and it is also his task to make arrangements from time to time for displaying products on various shows. Today we heard several hon. members referring here to our pathetic performance at the food show in Paris. That was really tragic. I can understand why the hon. member for Humansdorp feels that one does not always achieve at such a show as much success as is generally thought to be the case. That notwithstanding, it is in the first place the task of the trade representative to arrange for participation in shows, and this is also done by my department. One would nevertheless have liked to see a greater measure of co-operation than was in fact evident at this show. We came out of it in dismay. Furthermore, a trade representative must from time to time send in reports to his department on the general economic conditions prevailing in that country. For instance, when a budget speech is made in his country, he should be able to deduce from it what possible effect the budget may have on the existing export to that country or on potential imports which as a result of the budget may now be effected more easily than was the case before. Finally, a trade representative must at all times assist the head of his mission, the ambassador along with whom he is serving there, in the work performed there by him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the exporter, too, has a task to perform. On this matter there was a difference of opinion &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, then, perhaps not a difference of opinion, but something about which we had arguments today, namely that this is not only the task of the department, but that the exporter, too, has certain tasks to perform. The first thing we must understand, is that it is not the task of the Government, the Department of Commerce and our trade representatives abroad to sell. They have to create the channels; they have to make the contacts and they have to furnish potential exporters and potential sellers with information, but it is not our task to sell. The selling must be done by the exporter himself. In this process I think it is vitally important that the selling or the supply of export goods must be continuous. This was mentioned by one of the hon. members, I think it was the hon. member for Smith-field. The supply of export goods must be continuous, without interruption. It goes without saying that, if one has built up a market and supplied a certain product in a certain country for a year or two, and then breaks off trade for a year, one will have to start all over again. Exporters and potential exporters must therefore make sure that they can supply their goods to such an extent that they will be able to supply the market with those goods on a continuous basis. One of our greatest problems in regard to export is in fact the range of our export. It often happens that when a specific product is placed on the market&#x2014;for instance, in America or in Europe&#x2014;the customers buying the product say that they want five million units of that product, but then the exporter in question has to say: No, I cannot supply five million; I can only, perhaps, supply 500 units. That is one of our problems. When one enters a <span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_0710"/>market, one should not only be prepared to ensure a continuous supply&#x2014;that is important&#x2014;but one should also, if possible, be able to supply in large quantities. Exporters must therefore not expect their export to be based on surpluses. Their export cannot be based on surpluses only, because one year there is a surplus and the next year there is none. The product must be supplied at a constant flow.</p>

<p>The British entry into the European Economic Community forms part of this motion. Recently, if I may mention this, I had to take a very important decision. On the first Saturday of this year I was approached with the question of whether we should at all export apples and pears to England during February and March, because we had been informed that a levy would be imposed on pears from 1st February to the end of February. This levy, so I was informed, would be calculated at approximately R1-45 per box of pears, i.e. the day the box of pears arrived in England, a levy of Rl-45 would be payable on that box. I was also informed that a levy would be imposed on apples during February and March. The levy on apples would amount to approximately R2-16 per box of apples. Now, if one bears in mind that the profit made by a farmer last year was estimated to be 45 cents on a box of apples, then surely it goes without saying that unless wonderful changes take place in the market, this export will run at a loss. We looked at the matter from all angles. We weighed up the advantages and the disadvantages and arrived at the conclusion that even if it resulted in a loss, we would nevertheless have to export, for if we did not export it would mean that the market would be without pears and apples during that time. If that should happen, the housewife or the buyer would buy pears and apples at other places. They might even go so far as to say: No, I cannot get any pears or apples at the moment; therefore I am just going to buy other fruit now. In due course they would be used to eating other fruit, whereas we had over a period of years built up a market in order to accustom them to eating apples. Consequently I said: Let us export. We decided to export even if it would work out at a loss.</p>

<p>The exporters&#x2019; task is, furthermore, that they have to make personal contact with potential buyers. They cannot sit here in South Africa and try to make sales abroad by way of correspondence. They must make personal contact. Another important point&#x2014;and this we must never underestimate&#x2014;is that we must place quality products on the world market. This is probably more applicable to us than to any other country in the world since we are so far removed from the market. After all, it costs just as much to ship a box of bad apples to England as it does to ship a box of good apples there. That is why distance plays such an important role with us. We are seeking world markets. We must supply quality products at all times, irrespective of whether they are manufactured goods or agricultural produce. I can give hon. members the assurance that there are enough rich people in Europe, America and in the rest of the world today. There are many rich people who do not ask what the price is but are prepared to pay anything, but then they want quality. They enter the shop, look at the products and then buy the best. They pay the price charged for it. Therefore our big secret lies in supplying quality products when we want to export. We must also supply specialized products. We have in South Africa certain specialized products which are, as it were, novelties to the rest of the world. Consequently I think we should also concentrate on such products.</p>

<p>As far as the location of offices is concerned, we must remember that our aim is to render service to the exporter. At the place where we are to locate our office, there must be a possibility of sales. In other words, there must be a need for an office to be located there. In this process there are certain principles that must be considered by us. In the first instance, is it a new country that has not been served before&#x2014;in other words, a country in which we can probably promote our exports in a new field? In the second instance, and this is as important&#x2014;the hon. member for East London City also referred to this&#x2014;we must know whether such a country is accessible to us or not. We must know whether we are acceptable there, <span class="col_1395-1396" refersTo="page_0711"/>whether that country wants us there. After all, there is no point in establishing one&#x2019;s office in a country where one is not welcome and where obstacles will be put in one&#x2019;s way. Furthermore, it is as important that we take into consideration the geographic location of the country. We believe to a large extent in centralization, and in taking a look at our representation in Buenos Aires, we shall see that it also serves Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay. Consequently we do not consider it to be necessary under the present circumstances to establish representation in these countries as well. The same applies to certain countries in the East, to which the hon. member for East London City referred. We have representation in Tokyo. As the hon. member himself said, we have three posts there, which I think have all ben filled now. He said there was one vacancy, but that does not really matter. Our representative in Tokyo does not only serve Japan, but also South Korea. Our representative in Hong Kong serves Thailand and Taiwan in addition to Hong Kong. When we locate a trade office, it is important to take a look at the restrictions that may apply in a particular country. When I talk about restrictions, I want to mention a very fine practical example. The hon. member will recall that until recently it was impossible for us to export oranges to Japan because they said our oranges carried some kind of disease or other which they feared would be transmitted to their tangerines. It was only last year or the year before last that we succeeded in selling our oranges in Japan. At the moment we are building up a very good market there. That is why I say that the regulations applicable in a particular country are as important. I also want to refer to the training of officials sent over by us. This is not such an easy task; in fact, it is really a major task. We are now pursuing the policy that no official trade representative is sent overseas unless he has obtained a university degree&#x2014;to be specific, a university degree in economics. Then it is also necessary, and we consider it to be extremely important, that not only he, but also his wife, should be screened carefully. Hon. members will appreciate that in a foreign country the representative&#x2019;s wife is just as important as the man himself. In addition to this we are training them in foreign languages. We have made it our object that they should receive at least two years&#x2019; training before going abroad.</p>

<p>As my time is growing short, I want to furnish hon. members, in conclusion, with a picture of our representation abroad as it is at the moment. At the moment we have 29 diplomatic missions, consisting of 22 embassies, three legations and four permanent missions. In addition we have 21 consulates, two trade missions and, added to that, 34 honorary consulates and two honorary trade missions. We therefore have 88 offices in all. Our representation in the Far East consists of the following: In Japan, a consul-general; in Taiwan, a consul-general; in New Zealand, a consul-general; in Australia, an embassy; and in Hong Kong a consul-general. As hon. members know, we have at the E.E.C. a separate and very strong mission, which was also mentioned in this motion. This mission is under the leadership of Dr. Chris Naud&#x00E9;, who is one of our most experienced diplomats, a person who has spent his whole life in countries abroad. We are paying the fullest attention to what is happening in Brussels pursuant to Britain&#x2019;s entry into the European Common Market, because we know that it is extremely important for us to retain that extensive market, to which reference has been made, that mighty colossus of a market in Europe, which has been our market traditionally and, what is more, will probably remain so for many years in the future because it is our nearest market, and to avail ourselves of this enlarged community which has now come into being. Therefore I say that we are already doing everything that is being requested in this motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak this afternoon at a time when we are perhaps a little more aware of the Press than we were when the debate was adjourned last week. I think the time has come to say just a few words, initially in my speech, on the responsibility or the lack of it to be found in some of the individuals in the Press.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the week began with a report of a certain lunch which Mr. Blaar Coetzee, our ambassador in Rome, had with a certain press reporter. Although I have always differed with Mr. Coetzee politically and although it was very interesting to read some of the things he said&#x2014;as it is to read many of the things said by retired Cabinet Ministers these days&#x2014;it occurred to me that, reading between the lines, there is very little doubt that there was a breach, on this occasion, of confidence and of hospitality by the reporter concerned.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there followed a series of articles in the <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday concerning my party and my leader. Not only was the tone of those articles a disgraceful personal attack on the person of the Leader of the Opposition, about which more will be said on another occasion, I have no doubt, but the key factor which I find impossible to stomach is again a breach of confidence by a person who considers himself the leading newspaper man in the country. And then, Sir, perhaps worst of all, there was an attempt to impeach the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition. If it comes to a comparison between what Mr. Joel Mervis says as to a given set of facts and what the Leader of the Opposition says as to a given set of facts, and there is a clash between the two versions, then I have no doubt whatever as to what version I and the rest of the country will accept.</p>

<p>The Press upon which I wish to comment briefly, is not only the English language Press. We have developments in the Afrikaans language Press. Indeed, these days I cannot wait on a Sunday morning to read <i>Rapport,</i> and very frequently I find it difficult to put off reading <i>Die Burger.</i> If one looks at yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Rapport,</i> one will see that it is not only the Opposition that is under fire. The hon. the Minister of Transport is apparently to be expecting higher things. The hon. the Minister of Defence is reconsidering his position &#x2026; [Interjections.] There are, apparently, tensions within the Nationalist Party. There is likely, apparently, to be a reorientation of policy and events in that party. And, Sir, the skids are apparently under the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Maybe they consulted Hillbrow about that? [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I doubt very much that they consulted Hillbrow; I should say, Sir, they listened to the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister in the no-confidence debate a short while ago. I propose to say a little more about that. We had a major speech from the hon. the Prime Minister just over a week ago. Not only did I listen to that speech with great interest, but I have had the advantage of being able to study it in Hansard. It is interesting, very interesting these days, and in the light of recent events, to compare the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister with <span class="col_1399-1400" refersTo="page_0713"/>the speech delivered by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this House last Friday, about which I shall also have something more to say a little later. These speeches are, I believe, worth comparison because they are a gauge to thinking people of the merits of those of us who sit behind these two respective leaders. In order properly to assess the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister, one must look, I believe, at the circumstances in which that speech was made. He is, after all, the head of a Government whose country, apart from a few traditional friends in the West, is virtually alone in the world. Those Western friends of ours are friends not because of this Government, but despite it. They are friends of ours because of historical ties and associations, nurtured largely in the past by the United Party, most of which this Nationalist Party has condemned. Not only have we few friends, but in the words of Gen. Hiemstra, we alone are incapable of defending ourselves against a worth-while power. And, Sir, there is likely to be a change of Government in the only country from whom we can buy arms at the present time. Furthermore, with Britain now in the Common Market we face in respect of a material part of our exports, some of the most difficult times that we have ever experienced.</p>

<p>Internally, we have a galloping inflation, the worst of which, following successive devaluations, we are still to experience. We have ever-increasing contrasts in the wealth of some of the Whites and the poverty of some of the non-Whites. At the time that that debate took place, the debate in which the hon. the Prime Minister spoke, we were experiencing in our major seaport town and in one of the major industrial powerhouses of this country, industrial unrest on a scale which South Africa has not seen before, industrial unrest involving a large-scale flouting of the law, which no one could or wished to prevent or enforce. In addition, at the time the hon. the Prime Minister spoke a large part of the country was faced with one of the worst droughts in living memory. Total crop failure was the rule. Finally, he spoke at a time when the racial policies of the Government had been in operation sufficiently long for thinking observers in the Press and elsewhere, including observers that support the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister, to be in a position to comment authoritatively that the policy had failed, or at least to put in doubt the likely success of the policy to an extent which necessitated a restatement by the hon. the Prime Minister, both of his policy and of the philosophy behind it.</p>

<p>Well, that is another matter that I shall deal with also if I have time. I could devote a whole speech to that aspect of the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister. As I say, Sir, there was sufficient adverse comment from informed opinion to warrant a restatement of direction and philosophy. Sir, with all this vast field of problems surrounding us, immersed as we are in immense difficulties and dangers, having just emerged from a period of scandals in administration such as we have never had before in the history of government in this country, when even the Nationalist Press is asking for a restatement of direction and philosophy from the Government and from the Prime Minister, what did we hear from the hon. gentleman in a speech of an hour and 20 minutes? He dismissed foreign affairs with the phrase that relations with those countries with which we have diplomatic ties are as good as can be expected. He dismissed the economic field, both here and abroad, with the suggestion that there would be time to talk about this in the Budget debate. Inflation, perhaps the greatest immediate danger in our lives at the present moment, was not even touched upon. The explosive situation in Durban was dismissed with platitudes such as these&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have all learned a lesson. I have learned a lesson; you have learned a lesson; the Wage Board has learned a lesson.</block>

<p>Sir, what was the lesson? &#x201C;The individuals concerned are human beings with souls.&#x201D; That, Sir, is the lesson we have learned from the situation in Durban, perhaps the most serious measure of industrial strife that this country has ever faced: &#x201C;They have souls; they are human beings.&#x201D; That was the sole contribution by the hon. the Prime Minister to this serious situation of labour unrest in Natal. Sir, that certainly is a lesson for some people. But surely the lesson to be learned is that when the urban Bantu workers organize <i>en masse</i> to fight for elementary advantages, they can flout the law with impunity, and that is what the <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0714"/>hon. the Prime Minister should have talked to us about when he spoke in this House last week. The lesson, Sir, is that they did not use the strike weapon to enforce unreasonable demands. They made unreasonable claims, yes, but they settled for increases in their wages which, generally speaking, were not unreasonable. Sir, what did this House and the country want to hear from the Prime Minister? After all, he is not a cabaret star; he is the Prime Minister. We have these debates not to be entertained, but to be informed and to be led. What we wanted to hear on that occasion was the answer to this question: If in future the strike weapon is used, as it was on that occasion, to claim the right to home ownership in the townships, what then? What will the hon. the Prime Minister do on an occasion such as that?</p>

<p>Sir, one could quote a dozen examples of how this type of action could proliferate in the future unless thought and guidance and control is exercised in respect of it at the present time. Sir, the cardinal point, I believe, is that the recent events in Durban have ushered in an entirely new era. Government policies and philosophy, whether successful or not, are entirely irrelevant to that situation. They have been overtaken by events which conclusively demonstrate the total irrelevance of a policy which seeks to neutralize the political pressure of an urban proletariat by channelling it into the rural homelands. Sir, as I said, political pressure was successfully exercised by the Bantu urban proletariat in a White urban area. That is what took place on that occasion, and it is the first time that it has been successfully exercised. It was done for economic gain and, Sir, precisely the same thing can be done for economic gain in other fields in the White urban areas, in fields such as home ownership, secondary education and urban permanence. These problems stare us in the face; they are right here in front of us. They are problems which are cardinal to the position of Government policy and the Prime Minister in particular. And what do we get in this serious situation? We get a hilarious cabaret show from the hon. the Prime Minister, one of the best in town for those who are blind to the events of 1973. The hon. gentleman has once again done what he has done on previous occasions and that is to laugh off the problems of the day and, indeed, to disguise his own inadequacy.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has laughed off problems before, and I have incurred the wrath of the hon. the Prime Minister and of the House for drawing attention to it. It is one of the weaknesses in the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s make-up that when faced with difficulties, instead of dealing with those difficulties, he laughs them off. Sir, to me that spells one word only, and that is irresponsibility, in the true sense of that word. But, Sir, there is something that goes with it which I regret very much, and that is an apparent lack of sincerity, and I say deliberately that it is apparent because I hope that events will show that it is not real.</p>

<p>Sir, let us look at what the hon. the Prime Minister said about the Coloured people. We are dealing with a Prime Minister who has been in office for some time and whose Government has been in power for 25 years, with all the administrative apparatus available to learn the reasonable wants and wishes of the Coloured people. What did the hon. gentleman himself say in regard to the Coloured people? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the course of the year I had fruitful talks with Coloured leaders. At first it was only Mr. Tom Swartz and the Executive Committee. Gradually as time went on we were joined by others: Mr. Brown from the other independent party, Mr. Swarts from the other independent party, Mr. Rooks from Natal, who is no stranger to hon. members opposite, as well as Mr. Swales. We had penetrating talks. This was done in a spirit of no one being subordinate to the other or afraid of the other. We discussed the problems of the Coloureds in a penetrating manner.</block>

<p>And so, Sir, he went on and on for almost a page telling us in the fullest detail how close he was to the Coloured people and the extensive nature of his consultations with them &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; not only one group, Sir, but all the groups represented in the Coloured Council. In other words, we were led to believe that there was nobody in this country who was closer to the Coloured community than the hon. the Prime Minister. The question of liaison with the White Government was discussed, according to the hon. gentleman, in the greatest detail, and what do we find, Sir? We now have appointed one of the most high-powered commissions that the country has ever seen to go into the very problems which, if the hon. gentleman is sincere, he has discussed at great length with the Coloured people and to which he must know all the answers. Sir, as I have said earlier, where is the sincerity? They cannot stand together. Why, if what the hon. gentleman told us in this House on Friday is correct, does he not deal with the question of the Coloured people in this House? We all know why. Because it is the biggest hot potato sitting in his lap at the moment; because he does not wish to commit himself, because if he does, he splits his own party from top to bottom. If there are leadership qualities in a man, then he will overcome problems of that kind as long as he holds the position with the authority and the prestige of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office.</p>

<p>But, Sir, it does not end there. There are other aspects of this question of the Coloured people. There exists at the present time a very old established body, the S.A. Bureau of Racial Affairs, set up, I believe, by the late Dr. Verwoerd specifically to study racial problems in South Africa within the framework of separate development. It is an old established body, consisting of important politicians, intellectuals and academics, a body ideally suited, one would think, to go into this very problem of the Coloured people. But not only is it completely bypassed but not a single member of that body is appointed to this hon. gentleman&#x2019;s Coloured Commission. Why?</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The answer is quite clear. What the hon. the Prime Minister knows, and what everybody else knows in this House, is that that commission is going to bring in a finding and a set of recommendations which are directly opposed to Government policy in respect of the Coloured people. That is why SABRA has been left out entirely.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister toyed in humorous vein and at great length with the policy of the United Party and various newspaper comments on the federal policy of the United Party. Indeed, the greater part of his speech was not original thought but playing about with newspaper comments on the position of the United Party and its policy. But the interesting thing is that within this wealth of banter, at no time&#x2014;and this is the important part, and I read the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech very carefully indeed&#x2014;did the hon. the Prime Minister either criticize the proposed institutions, the legislative assemblies, or the powers that we propose for them. That is the lowest tier of our federal arrangement. At no time did he deal with that critically or speak on it. The second interesting point is that at no time did he criticize the concept of a federal assembly, which is again a cardinal aspect of the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy, nor did he criticize or discuss the powers proposed to be given to that assembly. Finally, at no time did the hon. the Prime Minister discuss the regulating function of this Parliament, another key aspect of our federal proposals. In short, Sir, in a speech of an hour and twenty minutes, at no time did we get from the hon. the Prime Minister any attempt seriously to discuss or criticize the basic essentials of the federal policy of the United Party. [Interjections.] This indicates, firstly, that he was either unable or unwilling to do so, it indicates a triumph for the policy and a triumph for this party and a triumph for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.

There was a packed hall as you can imagine, Sir. There were three speakers there on that occasion, all Ministers. There were the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, Mr. S. P. Botha, Mr. Herman Martins, then Deputy Minister of Transport, and Senator Dirkie Uys, then Minister of Agriculture. The audience was largely English speaking, as is to be expected in that community. Mr. S. P. Botha spoke for half an hour during the initial half of the evening. He spoke entirely in Afrikaans; not a word in English was said. Mr. Herman Martins spoke next for something over half an hour. He spoke entirely in Afrikaans; not a word of English was used. Finally Senator Uys spoke for over an hour; entirely in Afrikaans, not a single word in English.

<p>There were United Party people in that audience and they are aware of these things and there was no objection whatsoever to the fact that three Ministers who spoke for longer than two hours, did not use a single word of English at a meeting where the majority of those present were English speaking.</p>

<p>&#x2020;That is the attitude which should be adopted on occasions like this, an attitude of tolerance in respect of the other man, an attitude which is inherent in the attitude of the United Party on these language questions, an attitude which suggests very <span class="col_1407-1408" refersTo="page_0717"/>strongly to me, as I said in the beginning, that what we have learned from the hon. the Prime Minister in this regard and in others, is a total lack of sincerity. Finally, we hear enough about leadership these days. When you analyse what the hon. the Prime Minister said&#x2014;froth, humour, banter without any attempt to meet the challenges of the day or to project a philosophy or any solution to those challenges, and you compare it with the philosophy in depth by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on Friday last, you find not only an analysis of the problem by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition but also a blue-print which is an attempt to meet them. That is what we want. What the people require at the present time is not froth and banter and a cabaret act, but a serious attempt to put forward solutions to the problems which face us. That is true leadership, and that is what we got on Friday from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Zululand has again this afternoon made one of his potpourri speeches. He spoke a great deal, but in fact said nothing. He said a little about everything and accomplished nothing. At this late stage he attempted to put right what had gone wrong in the no-confidence debate. He tried to detract to some extent from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. In the meantime they had the biggest ever hammering from the Prime Minister, worse than they had ever received in a no-confidence debate before. [Interjection.] They were destroyed from the one side to the other. What did the hon. the Prime Minister say then &#x2026; [Interjection.] Subsequently he read up what the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had said.

Why should he have done so, because those hon. members themselves admitted&#x2014;and this was proved by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;that they themselves did not understand their policy. Then the hon. the Prime Minister said to them: &#x201C;Go back now and find out what your policy is; define certain important points, and when you understand them and know what they involve, come back and then we can debate the matter; in fact, we shall then fight an election on the matter.&#x201D;</p>

<p>There the hon. member is displaying his ignorance again! It is as a result of ignorance that that hon. member makes such statements.</p>

<p><span class="col_1409-1410" refersTo="page_0718"/>I would like to say a few words about this &#x201C;inflation&#x201D; of which so much is being said. Concerning the no-confidence debate and this financial debate so far, I want to say something to the hon. member for Parktown. I would like to say to his credit that he was most responsible in the speeches he made here. He did not make wild statements, although he complained a great deal about our labour policy. He said that our labour policy was limited, but I want to put the other side of the story to him. I want to tell him that Bantu labour is not limited here in South Africa if those who want to use it would only go where the labour is. They are free to do so, but these people go on complaining about our labour being limited, about there being no freedom of movement. They cannot have their bread buttered on both sides. They cannot talk about a free flow of labour so that the businessman or industrialist can have it when he wants it and how he wants it, but at the same time talk about control as well. When we accused them of wanting to free everything and wanting to allow labour to flow through the country indiscriminately, they say that is not true and that is not their policy. They cannot advocate both. They cannot want to have both. Under our policy Bantu labour is available to anyone who wants it, but he must go to where the labour is. There is no limit on that labour. In the border areas as well as in the Bantu homelands it is available to him. So, that is not true; that Bantu labour is not freely available, is an incorrect statement.</p>

<p>I want to come back and just say that apart from this one matter, the hon. member was responsible. However, I cannot say the same for the other hon. members on that side of the House. They made many irresponsible statements here about inflation. In the no-confidence debate the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made inflation one of the main themes on which he attacked the Government. They did so without making a proper analysis of it or furnishing an identification of the kind of inflation prevailing in the country. I want to make three statements here today: In the first instance, I want to say that the National Party is not responsible for inflation, because inflation is not the invention of the National Party. It is an international problem, and we can do nothing about it. It is found in every industrial country in the world. I shall prove that statement. I want to make a second statement: Inflation is in fact an international problem, but the inflation prevailing at present is totally beyond the control of the authorities. It is a cost inflation which could not be curbed by the authorities. This inflation was imported. The third statement I wish to make is this: Although the Opposition attacked us, they presented no alternative. They could not offer us anything; they could not tell us how to solve it. The Opposition has no formula for combating inflation.</p>

<p>To return to my first statement, I wish to repeat that inflation is an insoluble international problem. I want to prove this, but before doing so, I would like us to go back to the days when a subsistence economy prevailed throughout the world, as is also the case today in the Third World. I refer to the days before the Industrial Revolution. At that stage there was an appalling scarcity throughout the world. In spite of all the available resources being utilized, the demand could still not be met. After the Industrial Revolution these times of scarcity started changing; the scarcity disappeared. The market mechanism arrived in the world and a welfare economy made its appearance. Simultaneously imbalances began to appear in economies. The first depression which brought about inflation and unemployment, hit the world in 1870, 100 years after the Industrial Revolution. Demand was one of its major causes. For 60 years the world was saddled with the problem of recurring depressions. The last great depression which hit the world, occurred in 1930. As I have said, demand was the greatest problem. Because demand was not constant, it could not keep production constant. There were periods of high and low demand in the world which gave rise to periods of peaks and lows. Then came the period after the outbreak of the Second World War. What happened then? Then the old depression, as we knew it and which also hit us hard in 1930, disappeared from the face of the earth. After that there were only periods of slight recession, and then we entered the period of continuous growth. Hon. members will ask me: Why have depressions disappeared? As I have said, before that time demand was the greatest problem, the demand was not constant. Economists at that time thought that demand was determined by price and supply. After 1940, as a result of new techniques and theories, they became aware of the fact that demand could be determined by income. Subsequently the technique of regulating demand by income was applied. <span class="col_1411-1412" refersTo="page_0719"/>Thus it was attempted to keep supply and demand constantly in line and to do away with depressions in this way. This was done by way of demand manipulation, which we still apply today. As I have said, after 1940 we had a period of continuous growth. However, what happened then? Out of this process to which I have referred, a new problem arose. The new problem was the rising price index, and this problem cropped up in all developed countries, countries where there is no apartheid and where there is no job reservation. It occurred in all countries and the economic laws operated in the same way. It is interesting to note that in 1870 the international problem was demand. It worked both ways, namely towards inflation and towards under-inflation or negative inflation. In 1973 the problem is still demand, but possibly an excessive demand. That is what happened. That, says the United Party, was caused by the N.P. They say that the N.P. caused inflation. I want to say now that inflation is theoretically not a prerequisite for growth. It is decidedly a by-product of growth which we are unable to eliminate.</p>

<p>I have now proved clearly that this problem is an international one. Now I want to go further and say that the inflation prevailing in the country at this stage cannot be ascribed to the Government. To understand this one must realize that there are various kinds of inflation. One has cost inflation and demand inflation, which I have just dealt with, and then there is also demand-pull inflation, which I shall not deal with now. In order to judge this position properly we must identify the kind of inflation which prevails today, namely the one afflicting us at present. Firstly, I want to say that cost inflation is caused by political reasons, matters outside the economic cycle, by climatic conditions and international monetary problems over which one has no control. It does find that demand inflation is a more internal matter, which we therefore try to control by applying certain measures.</p>

<p>If we want to take a look at the situation which prevails today, we must go back to 1971. As hon. members are aware, we were subject, at the end of 1971, to a high demand inflation. The Government applied measures and they were successful. By the end of that year our rate of inflation had declined substantially. In fact, it had declined so much that the Government began to think in terms of stimulating the demand again. Then our problem began. We know what America did. It took unilateral actions in connection with trade, etc. The rate of exchange was also against us. We could do nothing else, and there were only two methods the Government could follow in order to meet this situation. The one was to apply import control and the other was the well-known method, namely devaluation. And this the Government did. As hon. members know, our reserves dropped to a very low level, with the result that protective measures had to be taken. What happened then? It was a very successful devaluation.</p>

<p>That hon. member should not laugh, because in doing so he is laughing at his own member, the hon. member for Park-town, who admitted this. That is why I have said he is responsible and he knows what is involved. I want to extend my congratulations to the hon. the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Government as a whole, because they read the signs of the times and the economic signs very well. They brought about one of the most successful devaluations in history, and that is why we are in such a strong position today. But to come back to the position at that time, what did this devaluation mean? Devaluation meant that we were forced against our will to make certain sacrifices because we could not help it. Our imported goods would be considerably more expensive. We had to import a large quantity of goods and therefore cost inflation as well. The present inflation is partly the result of that. Then we also have the normal demand inflation, which must and will be present. If one could limit it to 3%, for instance&#x2014;that is regarded as normal today&#x2014;we could be pleased if we could achieve that. Part of the 7% inflation we have now is demand inflation, and the rest is cost inflation. I am not going to tell you today exactly how much the one is and how much the other is. I do not think that there is anyone who can work it out accurately. But our common sense can tell us that cost inflation must form the greater part. Let us assume that our normal demand inflation is 4%, which is not bad, and that cost inflation is 3%.</p>

<p>I say, let us assume that demand inflation is 4%, which is not bad by any standard. The total inflation would then be 7%, which is high. <span class="col_1413-1414" refersTo="page_0720"/>But there is nothing we can do about it. The United Party speakers stood up one after the other and said that the National Party was responsible for the inflation. Now I want to say: We are not responsible for it.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to my third statement, namely that the United Party has offered absolutely no alternative. They attacked us and accused us of being the cause of inflation and of doing nothing about it. But, after all, it is a generally accepted fact that if one moves a motion of no confidence concerning a matter, one can solve that matter. I accuse them, Sir, of political dishonesty.</p>

<speech by="#erasmus">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Speaker. I accuse them of reckless irresponsibility; because they hold up to the people a matter which they cannot solve and for which they cannot offer any solution. We in the National Party have never said to the people that we will eliminate inflation and that there will be no rise in the cost of living. What we have in fact said is that we shall do our best to control it and keep it within limits. That, Sir, we have done. We do not need the United Party&#x2014;because they offer us nothing&#x2014;to come and tell us whether we have done it or not. In order to prove it, we compare what we have done with what has been done by comparable countries overseas. We compare it with comparable data from the major developed countries in the world.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not going to quote those figures. They have been quoted <i>ad nauseam.</i> The hon. the Minister of Planning quoted figures here the other day, and so did the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and the hon. Deputy Minister. We in South Africa have had signal success&#x2014;compared with the rest of the world&#x2014;in controlling inflation and the rise in the cost of living in this country. It stands recorded, and we can defend ourselves against anyone as far as that is concerned, and the people must know this.</p>

<p>I have said that that United Party can offer us nothing. They have said nothing that is worthwhile. I would just like to point out to you certain silly things that have been said. I want to refer here to what the hon. member for Gardens said. They have displayed the greatest measure of ineptness in this matter. The hon. member for Gardens made a statement here in retrospect. He said (Hansard, col. 123)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In retrospect we may inquire why the Government devalued at that stage &#x2026;</block>

<p>Just imagine, he is now asking why we devalued !</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; rather than resorting to more formal conventional monetary measures such as the use of our bank rate.</block>

<p>Sir, I now want to ask him one question. He must tell me, please, how the bank rate would have remedied our exchange rate situation. Surely that is a ridiculous suggestion. I see that hon. member is not here now. That is a pity. I want to say to him: He is still living in the dream world of the gold standard. We are no longer living in the days of the gold standard. The acknowledged method today for remedying this matter is manipulation of the exchange rate. That is the obvious instrument. The bank rate is merely a following rate in South Africa today. It is no longer a barometer rate. Let us hear what else the hon. member had to say. I refer to col. 124, where he said the fol lowing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the old days &#x2026;</block>

<p>Yes, these are the old days&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime, money, like Caesar&#x2019;s wife, was beyond reproach; contracts in money were inviolable.</block>

<p>I do not know what he meant by that, but he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Money retained its value.</block>

<p>This is what that hon. member said. Now I want to ask him a question: Presumably he still remembers very clearly those days before 1948, when there was a certain cost-of-living allowance which was linked with salaries and which was later consolidated by this Government and added to the salaries. Presumably he thinks that that cost-of-living allowance which existed at that time, was just a little gift which the Government gave the people. But, surely, there was inflation in those days, Sir; it was nothing else. How can you therefore make such a statement?</p>

<p><span class="col_1415-1416" refersTo="page_0721"/>Now I come to the statements made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He also spoke about the cost of living and said the following (col. 375)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now we come to the question of the cost of living and what the situation is at present as regards this matter. Last year I warned that unless the effects of devaluation were intelligently controlled and utilized, they could be disastrous to South Africa.</block>

<p>I would just like to ask him the following: How does one control the effects of devaluation? It is a consequential fact; surely one cannot control it? Then he made his second statement (col. 376)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems to me that, if we want to accept the hon. Minister&#x2019;s point of view &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here he referred to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; viz. that devaluation is a blessing, we shall in due course land where Germany landed after the First World War when a wagonload of mark notes was needed to buy a box of matches.</block>

<p>That was his comparison, and then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the Government is still depending on the outdated tactics of regulating consumers&#x2019; demand in order to be able to combat internal problems which, in point of fact, have much deeper origins.</block>

<p>I have just proved that demand manipulation is the method by means of which the world has escaped the dreaded ogre of depression, which caused unemployment and all the misery and wretchedness which that entailed. That is the same regulation of demand to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred. He said, in the first instance, that if we employed that method&#x2014;the modern methods employed by the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x2014;we would be back in the days of the depression, and then he described the position in Germany in 1914. Next he proceeded to tell us that these real methods, which help us today, were outdated.</p>

<p>Actually, it is strange to go on with this matter, Sir, because how can one conduct a meaningful debate on these matters of inflation and finance with such speakers on the other side of the House? How can one do it? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went on to say that we were complaining because they had not put forward an alternative, and then he said (col. 378)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister of Finance will probably remember perfectly well how I, in the last no-confidence debate in this House, came forward with short-term and long-term plans for controlling inflation, especially in a situation when devaluation had taken place.</block>

<p>Then he referred to his speech in 1972, and in 1972 he made a prediction and told us how to control the devaluation of 1973. In that connection he mentioned six points, and those six points were contradictory. One point which he advocated was a limitation of demand; that is disinflationary. On three points he advocated increased demand; that is inflationary. Then he pleaded that our exporters be encouraged, and, finally, he complained about the labour policy.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that it has already been settled in this House that the labour policy has very little to do with the inflation situation. Sir, to me it is as clear as daylight that the United Party have just as little decisiveness and clarity in regard to their economic policy as they have in regard to their federal policy at this stage. That is very clear to me. The United Party is at this stage really without an ideology, nor does it have a message for the people, and if it were ever to come into power, it would never apply unpopular measures such as those which we applied in the past where it was necessary. The reason for that is that they lack that deep-seated, fundamental conviction and daring which the National Party has. Their policy is to try to make political capital out of every situation so as to gain a few votes, but they do not come forward with a long-term policy. Sir, the problem is what we can do in the future in connection with this inflationary situation. At this moment we can do nothing else but sweat out this cost inflation which we imported. We should simply sit and wait until that has happened; we can do nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="col_1417-1418" refersTo="page_0722"/>What the Government is doing at the moment is dead right, and the hon. member for Parktown agreed with that. At present more than 20% of the capacity of the manufacturing industry is not being utilized. All we can do at this stage is to encourage and stimulate production and to encourage demand, and that the hon. the Minister of Finance is doing at this moment. The hon. member for Parktown agrees. Sir, there is nothing else that can be done concerning the cost part of inflation; we shall simply have to sweat it out and wait. Sooner or later its effects will abate, and then we shall return to the normal form of demand inflation, and that will in due course be regulated by means of monetary and fiscal measures, as we regulated it in the past. Sir, we can but hope stability will be brought about on the international monetary level. As long as there is stability, we shall have the opportunity to control inflation. But we are a small country; we have an open economy. We are very sensitive to international influences, and if instability arises on the international front, we shall once again be placed in a position where we shall have to act in the best interests of South Africa, as we did in the past. Once again I want to congratulate the Government on the steps which it took in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance has accomplished miracles, with the result that we have achieved such a position of strength that it was not necessary for us to devalue recently along with America. We only hope that a degree of stability will come about now and that costs will stabilize, but as things are going now, as the price of gold rises and the dollar flees, I do not know whether we are not heading for more international monetary problems and instability in the near future. I say again that we can but hope that we shall sweat out as soon as possible the effects of the cost inflation which we are experiencing now and that we shall once again experience normal conditions.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, something for which one must give the hon. member for Pietersburg credit, is that he has tried this afternoon to bring this debate back to financial matters. He has of course in the process given the Minister of Finance openings and we hope and trust that the Minister will avail himself of those openings. The hon. member for Pietersburg dwelt at length on inflation. It is a matter which is impossible to discuss in the short time at one&#x2019;s disposal, but the hon. member spoke about an extremely successful devaluation. Sir, to me as layman there is only one effect of devaluation which is very clear, and that is the rising cost of living for the ordinary citizen of South Africa which has already compelled the Government to accommodate both Railwaymen and public servants by means of substantial salary increases. But signs of greater confidence on the part of the business community and entrepreneurs similar to those we had after the devaluation of 1933, are still lacking, and a heavy responsibility will rest on the hon. the Minister when he introduces his Budget in a month or so, to give a lead to and stimulate business undertakings in South Africa. One can only hope that in order to do so, he will make use of the windfalls which are coming his way at the moment. If one thinks of the increased gold price and what that will mean for the Treasury in the form of taxes on the gold mines, the ordinary citizen and the entrepreneur in particular can look forward to welcome stimuli on the part of the hon. the Minister to promote the business of our country.</p>

<p>But it is not enough simply to talk in general terms about the question of demand inflation. The State, the Government has done its best to curb inflation by means of the curtailment of consumption and high taxes and credit ceilings, and so on, but this has not worked. It has possibly delayed the process to a certain extent, but it has not halted it. Therefore the Government was compelled to devalue, which in one respect constitutes an acknowledgment that we must accept inflation as permanent and we must adapt ourselves to the realities of what is occurring in South Africa. Now I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us what is going to be done to prevent this from continuing, so that we need not continually and always be weighed down by this ever-increasing burden of a rising cost of living. Mr. Speaker, there is nothing&#x2014;possibly the Minister does not realize this because it is outside his own experience&#x2014;which is so disturbing to the ordinary man who has to support a family or to the ordinary woman who has to feed and clothe a family, if she cannot be certain that she can budget year after year according to her income, if she has no confidence in the value of her money. There is nothing <span class="col_1419-1420" refersTo="page_0723"/>so disturbing for an aged person who has been a faithful citizen, who has saved over the years and had a little capital when he retired and invested it at, say, 84%, and therefore expected an income of 84% a year as the reward of his frugality and diligence, as to experience the phenomenon of inflation at 7% to 7&#x00BD;% a year and find that the actual value of his income and of his savings is only 1% per year. On paper he gets 8&#x00BD;%, but the value of his capital has declined by 7&#x00BD;%. Year after year what he is able to acquire with his income from his savings is less all the time. It is frustrating. It is unfair and the State which is the curator of the currency of the people has a duty to ensure that if there must be creeping inflation, it is kept within reasonable limits and does not continue at a rate of 6%, 7% or 8%. It would be very interesting if the hon. the Minister could tell us something about this.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for us as South Africans the past two weeks have probably one of the most notable periods in our monetary history. Who of us could have expected that within only 14 months after the Smithsonian Agreement, which was described by President Nixon himself as being one of the most significant agreements in the monetary history of the world, that within a space of two weeks the dollar would not only have been devalued once again by 10%, but that the price of gold on the free market would increase from a record price of $70 per fine ounce to a further record price of $90 and more per fine ounce. Admittedly the price of gold did subsequently fall back slightly, but one thing is certain today, and that is that gold has once again proved its strength and its invincibility. In times of crisis and monetary uncertainty it is to gold that people turn. Throughout the centuries gold has proved itself as the currency and as the reserve asset in which man has confidence because it has its own intrinsic value, and because it is not involved in any debt commitment with any other currency. In recent years we have, in the monetary sphere, experienced one crisis after another, and the rulers have tried with all kinds of adroit moves to resolve these crises.</p>

<p>But each time their efforts have failed. One of the reasons the efforts failed was because the rulers of the world refused to accord to gold its rightful place and value within the monetary system of the world. Since the Committee of Twenty is attempting, this year, to create a new international monetary order, I want to say even at this juncture that they will find no satisfactory solution to the monetary problems of the world unless they accord to gold the place which gold deserves. I want to express the hope that those who are entertaining the idea of demonetizing gold and eliminating it from the monetary system, of according it a subservient place in the monetary system, will learn a lesson from the events of the past few years, even of the past few days, and particularly from the recent crisis, which is that man will not allow gold to be dethroned, whatever the learned theoreticians may assert, and that gold will always maintain itself, whatever some politicians desire. I want to express the hope that all policy-makers have learned that, for the foreseeable future at any rate, gold must remain the nucleus of the monetary system of the world and that there ought to be an adequate adjustment to its official price to enable it to play this role. I do not in any way want to suggest that gold is the answer to all problems; we as people and as nations have too many failings for that to be the case. However, I do want to state emphatically that without gold it will not be possible to find any solution whatsoever to the present problems.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the past week&#x2019;s debate. In the first place I want to address the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on the matter of certain observations which he made in the course of the debate and during the recess and which did not reflect any too favourably on South Africa&#x2019;s economy. I have known the hon. Leader for almost a quarter of a century. I know that he is no irresponsible person and for that reason he will accept it from me when I express the hope that when he discusses South Africa&#x2019;s economy and uses figures in that connection, he will use the figures which are the most favourable for South Africa. During the previous year&#x2019;s debates, during the recess and also during the course of this debate, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition compared the <i>per capita</i> income of South Africans to those of other nations in the world. He said that the <i>per capita</i> income in South Africa had, over a certain period, increased by only 2,4%. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do hon. members realize that even Great Britain, the sick man of Europe, was doing better than that? Do hon. <span class="col_1421-1422" refersTo="page_0724"/>members realize that the countries of the Common Market countries were doing twice as well as that and that Japan was doing four times as well as that?</block>

<p>The figures come from the South African Reserve Bank. The hon. Leader read them in a report of the South African Reserve Bank. The figures used by the South African Reserve Bank were in respect of the years 1958 to 1968. But in the meantime other figures have become available. Therefore I say to the hon. Leader that if he knows of more recent figures which have become available he should in his future speeches make use of those figures. I have with me here the World Bank Atlas&#x2014;Population <i>per capita</i> Product and Growth Rates. Here the World Bank furnishes the most recent statistics for the sixties, from 1960 to 1969, of the <i>per capita</i> growth and the population growth of every country. Here South Africa&#x2019;s increase in <i>per capita</i> income per annum is given not as 2,4%, the figure which my hon. friend mentioned, but as 3,8%&#x2014;a considerable difference. This 3,8% <i>per capita</i> increase in the income per annum of our population during the sixties is greater than that of most countries in the world. It is greater than that of the United States, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, West Germany, Belgium, and so I can go on. It is one of the highest in the world.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Pinelands does not understand it, it is not my fault, and he will simply have to go and think about it again. If a family consists of a husband and a wife, and they have a joint income of R6 000 per annum, their <i>per capita</i> income is R3 000 per annum. If a child is born, their <i>per capita</i> income is R2 000 per annum. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I come to a second matter which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition mentioned in one of these debates. He referred, namely, to the devaluation of the rand and asked &#x201C;why does the rand remain linked to the dollar?&#x201D; That was in a previous debate. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why did the Government look on when the rand was forced down with the dollar during the past few days with the result that is was devalued by a further 4%.</block>

<p>He then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But during the past year the total devaluation under the policy of this Minister has run to 20%.</block>

<p><span class="col_1423-1424" refersTo="page_0725"/>The hon. Leader stressed two points. He said that the rand had at that juncture been devalued by 4%. How does the hon. Leader come by that assertion? Where did he find the figures which indicated that the rand had, at that juncture when he was speaking, been devalued by a further 4%? That is not true. The furthest the rand could move in terms of the rules of the International Monetary Fund was to be revalued upwards by 2&#x00BC;<i>%</i> or devalued downwards by 2&#x00BC;%. The most the rand moved was by 2&#x00BC;%, but it did not devalue by 4%. Then the hon. member said even more than that. He said that the devaluation had by then run to 20%.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must not interrupt me; I want to have my say. Hon. members must be careful when they are working with rates of exchange. In December 1971 we devalued by 12&#x00BC;<i>%</i> in terms of gold, but you must always see the significance of your devaluation in terms of the other nations which are also devaluing and revaluing. According to a calculation made by the International Monetary Fund the December devaluation amounted to 12% as against the world as a whole. In October of last year there was a further devaluation of approximately 4% as against gold, but ours was not the only country to devalue. Sterling devalued further than we did. Other countries also devalued. When one takes all those devaluing or revaluing countries and compares the extent of our trade with those countries, do hon. members know what the extent of South Africa&#x2019;s devaluation then was? The 4% devaluation of October of last year is then equal to exactly 1%. According to the calculations of the International Monetary Fund our devaluation after October of last year was not 16%, as my hon. friend said, but exactly 13%. I go further. I told the hon. member that monetary questions were very complicated, and for that reason I understand why he is shaking his head.</p>

<p>Last week the dollar devalued by 10%, but we did not devalue. Some of the other monetary systems also devalued further, but does the hon. member know where the rand stands at present in relation to the monetary units of the world? The total devaluation of the rand is at present 9%. This is in reply to the people who speak of a massive devaluation.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>These are the calculations of the International Monetary Fund which are being presented here. According to those calculations the total devaluation of the rand against the monetary units of the world is 9%. Our position today is better than that of the dollar or of the pound, particularly if we also compare the pound with its devaluation in 1967.</p>

<p>The hon. Leader of the Opposition made a third observation. He presented a plea here for the salaries of Bantu to be increased. I do not want to quarrel with him about this, for it is a matter which has to be dealt with on its own. However, the hon. Leader quoted a very interesting article from a journal, the latest edition of the <i>South African Journal of Economics.</i> With reference to that edition, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which I recommend as interesting reading to all members on the other side of the House. In it the author points out that, if people were to increase the wages of our poorer industrial workers today, even at the rate of 20% per year for ten years, it would result in an increase in inflation to the extent of only one point per year.</block>

<p>I also read that article. As I interpret that article, it arrives at an entirely different conclusion to that which the hon. Leader saw in it. The writer of this article makes it very clear to us&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the various reasons discussed at length in the previous section, it appears that the inflationary impact of raising non-White wages substantially within five years would be too great for such a policy to be acceptable on economic grounds.</block>

<p>The writer then goes on to say that we could perhaps consider raising the wages of <span class="col_1425-1426" refersTo="page_0726"/>Bantu by 12%, the wages of the other non-Whites by 8% and the wages of the Whites by 3%. This we could perhaps do if we were to consider it, but it would mean a loss of profits from 15% to 10,7%. I come now to the most important point the writer made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For substantial pay increases to non-Whites in the South African manufacturing not to prove unduly inflationary, such pay increases would have to be accompanied by a redistribution of incomes from Whites to non-Whites.</block>

<p>In other words, the whole tenor of this article is to point out the tremendous influence it would have on the economy if Bantu wages were increased by 20%</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now want to come to the main subjects of the debate. I want to come to the speeches of my hon. friends, the member for Parktown, the member for Constantia and the member for Von Brandis, who told me he would not be here. These speeches touched on the main points of the economy, namely the effects of devaluation, growth and inflation.</p>

<p>Coming first to devaluation, I think it is correct to say that it has been the general view, particularly of my friend, the hon. member for Parktown, that devaluation has been a great success. I think he admitted that and has even congratulated me on the success we have attained with devaluation. But a new theme and a new way of attack were followed by the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Von Brandis. Last year when we discussed this matter, I asked the other side of the House: Do the Opposition accept devaluation? When there was silence I said that we now had evidence that the Opposition could not make up their mind, of the ambivalence of the Opposition&#x2014;all things to all men. At that stage the hon. member for Parktown rose and said &#x201C;I have told you we are in favour of devaluation &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>But in spite of that the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Von Brandis attacked devaluation, the hon. member for Constantia even calling it an act of insolvency. Again in this debate we find the hon. member for Constantia, in a very interesting speech, and also the hon. member for Von Brandis, telling us that devaluation was not really necessary.</p>

<p>Well, the hon. member for Constantia should not run away from what he said the other day. He said very clearly that devaluation was not necessary because the economy would have righted itself and would have solved its problems of its own accord. The hon. member for Constantia clearly said that the price of the raw materials we exported had risen to the extent that it had not been necessary to devalue the rand. I want to say today that I want to thank the hon. member for Constantia. I have often heard good things about the economy of South Africa, but the greatest compliment paid to the economy of South Africa was paid by the hon. member for Constantia, when the hon. member admitted that our economy was so strong at the end of 1971 that it was not really necessary to devalue in order to solve our problems. The hon. member for Von Brandis went even further and said that it was not necessary to devalue because of the inherent strength of our economy. The hon. member for Constantia said it was not necessary because later on in 1972 the price of metals, minerals, agricultural products and gold rose to such an extent that the economy could have completely recovered. I do want to ask the hon. member if it is true that the price of our export articles rose to such an extent that it could have rectified our economy? What about the price of imported articles? It is true that the price of export articles increased, but why did the hon. member not tell us about the price of the products which we imported? The balance of payments position of the country is determined not only by the price of the exported articles, but also by the price of the imported articles. It is the terms of trade which counts. I make the statement that the terms of trade were not strong enough in those years to make the devaluation of the rand unnecessary.</p>

<p>Let us pause for a moment and see briefly what the position was not, because of our fault, as the hon. member over there said, but because of international circumstances over which we had no control. What was the position? We had the position of falling reserves in 1971. We had <span class="col_1427-1428" refersTo="page_0727"/>the position of an unfavourable balance of payments and of trade. We had the leads and lags as we all know. We had the uncertainty about the rand and the speculation against the rand. I submit here, with all the seriousness I can command, that after the 15th August, when the gold window was closed, and after the 21st December, when the dollar devalued, it would have been completely impossible for the rand to maintain its parity and not to devalue. If we take into account local and world conditions in those days, there was no way out but to devalue, because if we had not devalued&#x2014;which, according to the hon. gentlemen, was not necessary&#x2014;our reserves would have fallen further. Speculation against the rand would have been rife. The leads and lags would have continued. Foreign capital would not have come to the country. The already existing cyclical movement would have gone further down. What is more, the monetary and fiscal policies which we had been applying in order to restrain inflation, would have had to be continued.</p>

<p>But in order to prove that devaluation was successful and had to be undertaken, briefly let me put it this way: Firstly, the balance of payments was immediately turned into a surplus. If we had waited for the future, as the hon. gentlemen wanted to wait, we would have had to wait for months and months to see the prices of our export articles increase and of import articles decrease. But this is not what took place. What did take place, is that we immediately had a reversal of the balance of payments position from a negative to a positive situation. Immediately we had a reversal of the leads and lags. Immediately our reserves increased to the extent that they reached record heights. I do concede to the hon. gentlemen that there were other factors, too; but those factors were not enough and could not act soon enough. In the third place, the cyclical movement, which was downward, was arrested, and the process of cooling down the economy was halted. If we had not devalued in 1971, we might have been forced to continue with restrictive monetary and fiscal policies. Mr. Speaker, devaluation, as we all know, last year brought an economic and financial climate which is favourable to economic growth in this country. It has brought higher incomes for exporters, particularly for the gold mines. It has brought higher income for the State, too, and I think hon. gentlemen are also interested in that. It has broadened the money and the capital markets. As a result of the removal of credit ceilings and the lowering of interest rates, the State loans in the last year have all been very successful. The building societies have received considerable funds. New life has been given to the Stock Exchange and natural protection has been given to industries. Generally, Sir, there was created a new stimulus to economic growth. All these things could not&#x2014;I emphasize that&#x2014;have happened if we had waited, as the hon. gentlemen wanted us to do, and had not devalued at the time.</p>

<p>Although the hon. member for Constantia made a very interesting speech, I must say this: If he had been in my place in 1971 and if he had advised his Government&#x2014;if they had been the Government of the day&#x2014;and if upon his advice his government had decided not to devalue, he would then have gambled recklessly with the fortunes of this country. I say that he would have acted irresponsibly towards the future of our nation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis, who is not here today, also made a very interesting speech. He approached the matter from a different angle. He said that devaluation was not necessary and could not be successful because of the inelasticities, the rigidities, in the economic field. He said that certain things have to be bought by a country, such as coal or oil, and even though their prices increased, these things have to be bought, and for that reason devaluation cannot be successful. Mr. Speaker, there is a measure of truth in this statement, but this also applies to the monetary and fiscal policies, which are the only other alternatives. We know that monetary and fiscal policies do not have the same effect now as they used to have in the past. Hon. members know that interest rates today do not play the role they played in the past. They know that unemployment does not play the role in the economic field that it did in the past. There are rigidities; nevertheless devaluation is one of the methods which has to be used. We find in the international monetary sphere that today it is the tendency to advise nations that they must resort more to the method of devaluation. It is a general tendency which will be included in the new regulations which are to come, that nations, instead of using monetary and fiscal measures too much and thereby dampening their economies too much, will be urged <span class="col_1429-1430" refersTo="page_0728"/>sooner and more often to use the principle of changing the parity of their currencies.</p>

<p>I now come to the second point the hon. member for Constantia made. He made some interesting remarks, following upon the hon. member for Parktown, and then mentioned the matter of growth in the economy. The hon. member for Parktown said that I had succeeded in the first objective in my Budget speech, namely to improve the balance of payments position, but that I had not succeeded in obtaining the measure of growth which I wanted, and which I had set as a goal in my Budget statement. I concede that, for the time being. I think my hon. friends on the other side of the House are in too much of a hurry. You cannot plant a seed today and pick the fruits tomorrow.</p>

If my hon. friend could compare South Africa unfavourably with other countries, I should be allowed to compare South Africa favourably with other countries. Can I not do so? We say that last year we had a real growth rate of just below 4%. Let us look at a few countries, not fifth-rate countries, and compare their growth rates last year with ours, which was just below 4%.</p>

What was the growth rate of Western Germany last year? It was 3&#x00BC;%. There the growth rate was 3&#x00BC;% and then we are attacked here by hon. gentlemen opposite because our growth rate was just below 4%.</p>

<p>And our population growth?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. gentleman does not understand what I am trying to say. The population increase in South Africa is accounted for largely by an increase in the number of small children who are unproductive, whereas the population increase in Germany has been due largely to an influx of workers from other countries. [Laughter.] Sir, if there is anything which shows me that hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House do not understand the elementary principles of economics, it is the laughter on that side of the House. It is known all over the world to every first-year student of economics that if a population grows very fast, the greatest percentage of that increase is made up of children and old people who are not productive. In countries such as Western Germany, the population growth consisted to a large extent of workers who were taken from other countries and who immediately became productive units in Western Germany. Sir, what about this year? The expectations of the large institutes in the world about the expected growth this year in Western Europe are the following: The growth rate expected in France is 5&#x00BD;%, in Denmark 3&#x00BD;%, in Germany 5%, in Britain 5%, in Italy 4&#x00BD;%, in Holland 4&#x00BD;%<i>,</i> in Belgium 4&#x00BE;%. Sir, I do not want to make any forecasts today; there are too many unpredictable and uncertain factors in these matters, but if these are the expected growth rates for the main industrial countries of the world during this year, then I think that by the end of the year we will find that we in this country are not completely out of step.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the hon. member for Constantia. The hon. member says that the &#x201C;slow&#x201D; growth rate in South Africa is due to the fact that there is not sufficient investment in the private sector; that investment is the cause of all growth. He gives four reasons as to why there is not sufficient investment in South Africa to promote growth. In the first place he says that certain durable goods industries are still licking their wounds due to hire purchase restrictions and the sales tax provisions. Possibly it is true that this does happen, but this is the case all over the world. It is the policy today in every country of the world, when an economy becomes overheated, to apply fiscal and monetary policies because no government can allow the economy of the country to become overheated, and in our country too, as is the case in many other countries, as the hon. <span class="col_1431-1432" refersTo="page_0729"/>member should know, the Government was forced, in order to cope with demand inflation, to apply monetary and fiscal measures in order to restrain demand. I know, Sir, that some of our industries did not like this. I know that it was not pleasant. I know that if you want to kill or to curb the dragon of inflation when it rears its ugly head and you apply fiscal and monetary measures, it hurts people, but it also hurts us to apply these measures. It is not pleasant for them, but it is not pleasant for us either. In every country where there is inflation today, you will find that the authorities are being urged to apply stronger fiscal and monetary measures which admittedly are not pleasant and which do hurt industrialists but which are in their interests.</p>

<p>In the second place the hon. member says confidence is shaken due to stop-go policy, for example importing firms in respect of import control, etc. It is true, but this is not the Government&#x2019;s fault alone. I think this is the fault of the importing firms. When firms are importing beyond the capacity of the country, what must the Government do? Every country has a certain limit for its imports and once that limit is exceeded, when imports grow beyond the limits or the ability of the country, something has to be done. Does the hon. member not know that in the year 1971 and before, South Africa was over-importing? He must surely be aware of the situation. Does he not know that there was a time in the history of our country when we imported far more than we could pay for? I am sure the hon. member cannot deny that in the first quarter of 1971 the unfavourable balance of payments on current account, on an annual basis, amounted to R1 500 million. Does the hon. member wish to tell me that we should have allowed it to continue in that way?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But the hon. member has said people are licking their wounds, that they are shaken by the policy of import control when the Government tries to stop these huge imports. I may tell the hon. member that whenever the imports of those who over-import in order to increase their stockpiles rise too much at the expense of the nation, the Government will step in in order to bring imports within the ability of the South African people to pay for them. The hon. member says another reason for not investing is the fear of the investors that they will soon experience the old bottlenecks again when demand picks up. I am not quite sure what he means; it is rather a vague accusation. It is rather difficult to reply to it. I must say, Sir, I do not know our businessmen and our industrialists in this way. Wherever I have gone abroad in the years of my ministry, I have always boasted of my fellow-countrymen and I have always seen the South African businessmen and industrialists as men of enterprise and men of initiative and of daring. But now the hon. member tells me that South African businessmen are people obsessed with fear, afraid of bottlenecks, afraid of what might happen if the demand again picks up. Sir, if they think the demand may pick up or is picking up, it is in the character of our businessmen that they should now start preparing themselves for the day when demand really picks up. If they do not, I am afraid foreign businessmen are going to take the path in our economy and take that opportunity. Lastly, the hon. member has said that one of the reasons why people do not invest is the fear&#x2014;again the fear&#x2014;that inflation is out of control and that there will be no residual buying power in the hands of the public after buying the necessities of life. Mr. Speaker, again this claim has no validity at all. Does the hon. member not know&#x2014;and the figures have been quoted quite a number of times in this House&#x2014;that in spite of inflation, the earnings and the wages and the salaries of our people have gone up faster than the cost of living? Is there any hon. member who will deny that wages and salaries and income have increased faster than the cost of living? As a matter of fact, it is not a lack of money; the money is there. It is not a lack of credit which keeps people from buying. The hon. member talks about demand. It is true that people do not buy so much as before. It is true that there is not the demand desired. My hon. friend, the Leader of the Opposition, used to attack me on the grounds that I had allegedly said in the past: &#x201C;Spend for prosperity.&#x201D; That is what he accused me of. Now everybody, all the economists throughout the country, say: &#x201C;Consume more in order to bring prosperity to the country.&#x201D; But he says nothing about that. I say that in the case of most people there is money enough. People are even saving and our savings are increasing today as the figures show. Unfortunately, <span class="col_1433-1434" refersTo="page_0730"/>however, some of our buying public are buying less, because they are afraid of being exploited.</p>

I want to say emphatically that it is sometimes necessary that the confidence of the entrepreneur should be restored, but I also think that sometimes it is very necessary that the confidence of the purchaser should be strengthened. I want to say why there is not more growth. I want to make the statement that growth has been lacking to the extent that it has been lacking in the past year because of the situation of our balance of payments. I want to make myself quite clear in order that there should be no further misunderstanding.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the year 1971 it was impossible for this government to stimulate growth because we had an unfavourable balance of payments and we had low reserves. Everybody who knows anything about economics knows that it is impossible for any government to stimulate growth when you have an unfavourable balance of payments, because if a country grows economically, there is heavy demand, a pressure on your reserves. We all know that. In the year 1971, when we had the unfortunate position, because of world conditions, that our reserves were low and were falling, we could not stimulate growth. In 1972 we could not do it either, because first we had to wait to build up those reserves to a point where they were strong enough. That is why I said in reply to my hon. friend that you cannot plant a tree today and expect to pick its fruit tomorrow. We have been building up the reserves in the last year and now, for the first time, we have reached the point in our economic development where we believe that our reserves are strong enough and that we can now start to stimulate the economy, as we are already doing. The hon. gentlemen knows what we did about stimulating the economy. I refer to last year&#x2019;s budgetary measures, the tax and labour concessions. I refer to the greater protection of our industries, the decentralization concessions, the lowering of purchase tax, the easing of hire-purchase regulations, the promotion of exports, the freeing of credit, the lowering of interest rates, the repayment of loan levies twice within a few months and the increase in salaries of railwaymen, public servants and the Post Office employees.</p>

<p>Quite a number of steps have been taken by the Government already, and if the necessity arises the Government will take further steps as it sees fit in the months to come to promote stable economic growth. However, the State must be careful not to over-stimulate. We must be careful not to apply the measures of stimulation so strongly that that which should have been a spark becomes a conflagration. I believe that once growth really starts, it will feed on its own strength. I also want to state quite clearly that it is not the task of the Government alone to promote economic growth; it is also the task of private initiative to take over where the Government has stopped. I hereby make an appeal to our industrialists and our businessmen in the private field to see what is going on in the rest of the world, to study the conditions of today and to start before it is too late.</p>

<p>Mention has been made here of another matter. It is strange; on the one hand it has been said that we do too little, but on the other hand it has been said that we are doing too much. Mention has been made, for instance, of the IDC and it is said that it is bringing about a kind of creeping Socialism, which should be stopped. I will not go into this matter fully now, but I can only mention the IDC&#x2019;s share in investments in South Africa since 1940. Their share has been about 3%. That does not show any undue increase in their share of or their hold on economic life of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to conclude this part of my speech by saying that I am extremely optimistic about the economic future of my country.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My optimism is based on the following factors: The first one is the strength of our balance of payments and the high level of our reserves; in the second place, the improved terms of trade <span class="col_1435-1436" refersTo="page_0731"/>and especially the high price of gold on the free market. Thirdly, there are the steps which are being taken by the Government today to protect industry through higher tariffs and through devaluation. Fourthly, there are the low level of inventories. We know the level of inventories was very high, with the result that certain industries and certain commercial undertakings did not buy from industries; they did not place orders. These inventories have dropped to a normal level now and more orders will have to be placed with industry. Fifthly, there is a surplus capacity in industry, a figure of about 20% is being mentioned, in some cases there is surplus capacity even with hoarding of labour. Sixthly, there is the higher disposable income of consumers. Seventhly, more credit is available. Above all, I believe and I have confidence in the character and the quality of our people, of our entrepreneurs and of our employees. I trust that they will not be found lacking when opportunities arise for the promotion of our economy. I am happy to know that confidence is coming back. Wherever we go we find that there is a new surge of confidence in the country. We have it reflected, for instance, in the latest report of the Bureau for Economic Research of Stellenbosch. We find it in newspapers, in the financial magazines. I have foreign visitors here in my office, several every week, and all of them talk very highly of their expectation of the economic future of his country. They have the utmost faith in the future of South Africa. Here in my hand I have a letter which was written by one of the big banks of America&#x2014;I will not mention the name; it was written to me some two weeks ago. This bank was arranging a R30 million credit for South Africa. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have had an outstanding reception on the credit from those banks whom we have asked to participate and as soon as the group is finalized, we will be sending you a letter advising you of the participants. The response we have had is certainly a tribute to the outstanding reputation that South Africa enjoys in international financial circles.</block>

<p>That is the general spirit. I am afraid that our people might sit back; I am afraid that in future with all the confidence of people abroad, we might have South Africans sitting back when others come into our field. I think we can also say that there are already signs of an upturn in the economy. The November statistics from the Department of Statistics show that the index for total manufacturing output stood at 182,2 in November last year compared with 175,6 in November, 1971. This is equal to an increase of 7,2% in manufacturing industries. The index figure for November is also an all-time high one. Though I know that one swallow does not make a summer, in these particular statistics we find an indication that industry is already on the upsurge.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the question of inflation.</p>

<p>*Hon. members will once again have to pardon me for referring to the inflationary position in other countries, and expressing agreement with what was said by my hon. friend for Pietersburg, which is that inflation is not an exclusively South African problem. Inflation is a world-wide phenomenon. We, as part of the world, suffer under the same inflation that is prevalent throughout the world. I have here an article in a magazine which my hon. friends will probably accept, viz. the <i>I.M.F. Survey.</i> In that survey the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inflation in Europe has increased sharply according to the report of the OECD on 15 European members.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2020;Now listen to this&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">Between April and October of 1972 prices increased at an average seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9,6% &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is Europe!&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; 9,6%, twice the rate of the preceding six months and the largest rise since the Korean War. The rate of inflation a was highest in Spain with 12,3% as the annual rate of increase, followed by the United Kingdom with 11,8% and Italy with 10,3%. Most of the other OECD countries were closely grouped in a range between 7,9% and 8,9%.</block>

<p>That was between April and October last year. I have the official figures for the last quarter of last year. They are: Belgium, 7,6%; France, 9%; West Germany, 8,7%; Ireland, 13,7%; Italy, 8,7%; United Kingdom, 10,5%.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>It is estimated that about 400 new chemicals are produced annually. Many of these chemicals are extremely toxic but the toxic properties and their effect on man are not known at the time of their production and availability to industry and the commercial world. It may take years before the toxic effects are known and at that time serious illnesses or even death may have been caused by these chemicals. It is thus imperative that the necessary safety measures <span class="col_1439-1440" refersTo="page_0733"/>be instituted in the Republic to protect man from these toxic substances. Such enlightened countries as England, the U.S.A. and even our neighbour, Rhodesia, have legislation to control these substances.</p>

<p>Many of these chemicals are hazardous substances only used in industry and the workers are protected from their harmful effects under industrial legislation applicable to the particular industry using these hazardous substances. Unfortunately this does not apply to all industries and manufacturing processes using hazardous substances.</p>

<p>When we come to the commercial marketing of these substances, we find that the consumer at present has little, if any, warning of the dangers of these hazardous substances or the methods of handling these substances to prevent injury or to prevent the pollution of the environment, and particularly of the signs and symptoms of poisoning with the more toxic hazardous substances and of first-aid treatment that may be life-saving.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide enabling measures which will not only protect the householder from the dangers of these hazardous substances, but which will enable him to use and apply the substances with confidence and safety, and above all, to protect and safeguard children from accidental poisoning, especially children in the 2-5 years age group.</p>

<p>Clause 2 empowers the Minister to declare any substance, electronic product and radio-active material to be a group hazardous substance and the provisions of this Bill shall then apply to these grouped substances. Provision is also made that, after the declaration of a substance or electronic product into a group, interested parties may, within three months, submit to the Minister motivated reasons why such grouping should not be applicable.</p>

<p>The chemical substances, depending on their hazardous nature, which includes their toxic, irritant, sensitizing, corrosive or flammable nature, will be included in Group I or II hazardous substances. Groups III and IV will include electronic products and radioactive wastes respectively. Clause 3 makes it an offence for a Group I substance to be sold by any person not licensed to sell such substances and under conditions other than prescribed. In the case of a Group III substance, no person may use or operate such a substance unless it is registered and the premises on or in which it is used is also registered, and otherwise than subject to the conditions prescribed or determined by the Secretary. In clause 4 the Secretary is empowered to license persons as suppliers of Group I substances and to register Group III substances and the premises on which they are installed.</p>

<p>The regulations are dealt with in clause 29. These regulations can vary for different chemicals in the Group I substances, depending on the type of hazard of the chemical concerned.</p>

<p>The regulations will include specific labelling requirements which will include&#x2014;</p>

<ul>

<li>(a) the common chemical name of the substance or the chemical name by which it is known;</li>

<li>(b) the toxic route of the chemical, i.e. by ingestion, inhalation or through skin absorption;</li>

<li>(c) the precautions to be taken in handling the chemical in concentrated form, e.g. must rubber gloves be worn, or a respirator be used, etc.</li>

</ul>

<p>This will mostly be applicable to Group I hazardous substances, but a Group II substance will have similar warnings to the consumer.</p>

<p>Certain chemicals will be allowed for industrial use only, because of the nature of the toxic effects of long exposure and the liver damage that can result from chronic or subacute poisoning. A very good example of this type of chemical is carbon tetrachloride, a cleaning agent used in many households. Most of the Western countries have prohibited this chemical for household uses.</p>

<p>Certain of the more toxic chemicals will only be available from persons licensed to sell such chemicals. The sale of such chemicals will have to take place in accordance with prescribed conditions. A register will have to be kept of the name of the buyer and the purpose for which it will be used and such sales will be limited to a certain age. This will apply to many of the poisons listed in Division I of the fourth schedule of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, 1928. These chemicals will have to be stored away from food and other products and will have to be kept under lock and key, e.g. arsenic, strychnine, sodium mono fluora acetate, cyanide, etc.</p>

<p><span class="col_1441-1442" refersTo="page_0734"/>Regulations will also prescribe the container for certain of the Group I substances so that these containers will become associated with a toxic product and will not be used for any other product. In the case of the less toxic products, especially those which will be included in Group II which are used in homes, the container, i.e. the bottle, metal tin can or plastic bottle, will have to include a device which will dispense only a small amount of the contents at a time. This amount will be much smaller than a toxic dose. This will prevent many cases of poisoning in children as a small child will not be able to gulp down huge mouthfuls of the fluid from the bottle or container. This method is the latest in the U.S.A. to prevent the accidental poisoning of young children.</p>

<p>Colouring additives will be added to such substances so that, with the necessary education of the public and especially children in primary schools, these colours in liquids will be associated with danger.</p>

<p>The department has also been requested to make provision for the safe transport of dangerous or toxic chemicals in tankers. Special attention will be paid to this aspect.</p>

<p>Fumigation for pests, whether these pests are in the agricultural field or in urban areas, e.g. flies, cockroaches, bed bugs or fleas, will be controlled. Only fumigators properly trained and equipped with all the necessary equipment and resuscitation apparatus will be licensed. At present fumigation with cyanide is the only fumigation process which is controlled by legislation and that under the Public Health Act, 1919. Many present-day fumigation chemicals are as dangerous as cyanide and their use must be properly controlled.</p>

<p>The application of pesticides both in agricultural practice and home gardening will be regulated after consultation with the Minister and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services.</p>

<p>The content of lead in paint which is to be used on furniture for children, will have to conform to specific standards so as to ensure that the possibility of lead poisoning, due to children chewing their cots or other furniture and swallowing pieces of paint, cannot take place. This will also apply to the paint used on children&#x2019;s toys and to toys in general. Many toys can inflict serious injury to children when they are broken by the child. The retail distribution of fireworks will also have to be controlled for the protection of children.</p>

<p>Chemical sets sold will have to conform to set standards and will have to be labelled with all the necessary safety measures and possible dangers of accidentally swallowing any of the chemicals. The sale of certain chemicals will be limited to certain groups of people and the inclusion of these chemicals in mixtures will be prohibited.</p>

<p>The dumping of hazardous substances, whether it is a by-product, a waste product from some industrial process or the hazardous substance itself after it has been used, will only be allowed if the dumping will not endanger man and his environment. Ultimately most waste will be disposed of by depositions on either land or water. Land is the more likely, and the selection of suitable areas requires considerable care. Such factors as accessibility to trespass, impermeability or absorption characteristics of soil, height of water table, and lie of surrounding water courses, must be assessed.</p>

<p>The electronic products in the Group III substances include X-rays, microwave ovens, T.V. sets, etc. These products are at present controlled in terms of the Public Health Amendment Act, 1971. For practical and functional reasons the existing control measures are included in this Bill and the aforementioned Act is repealed.</p>

<p>The Group IV substances are radioactive waste. This waste will be about 90% the result of the reactor of the Atomic Energy Board and the other 10% the result of medical, industrial and research uses. As this waste is radioactive, precautions for transport and the dumping of the waste will be instituted. At present the disposal of such waste is the responsibility of the Atomic Energy Board, but this function will be transferred to the Department of Health within the very near future.</p>

<p>Clauses 2, 3, 4 and 29 are actually the whole basis of control and the essence of the Bill and they follow the same principles as the Federal Hazardous Substances Act of June, 1967, of the U.S.A.</p>

<p>The control measures in the Bill are largely based on those of the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act, 1972. These measures have proved themselves and are accepted by industry.</p>

<p>Provision for appeal against decisions of the Secretary for Health in terms of clauses <span class="col_1443-1444" refersTo="page_0735"/>4 and 5 is made in clause 6, and in terms of clause 7 the Minister will have the power to withdraw or suspend a licence or a registration if any condition to which such licence or registration is subject has not been complied with. When a licence is granted or a registration made, there will be certain general conditions specified by regulations, and the Secretary will also have the power to specify particular conditions in respect of individual applications, especially for Group III substances, which must be conformed to if the licence or registration is to stay valid, e.g. the time before renewal, the precautions that must be taken to ensure that unauthorized persons can have no access to the premises and that no Group III substance may be modified without the consent of the Secretary.</p>

<p>If any of these conditions are not conformed to during the period of validity of the licence, depending on the seriousness of the breach of the conditions, the Minister can withdraw or suspend the licence or registration.</p>

<p>Because of the technical differences in Group I and II and III substances, the qualifications required of inspectors for these substances are so different that provision is made in clause 8 for the Secretary to appoint two types of inspectors with specialized knowledge of the group of hazardous substances for which they are appointed inspectors. It will be noted that inspectors for a Group III substance will only be appointed by the Secretary for Health. Such inspectors will be required to have either a university degree with Physics as a major subject or be qualified radiographers with a number of years&#x2019; experience. Many Group I and II substances will be sold in all types of stores throughout the Republic and since many of the requirements applicable to these substances will be labelling and other minor requirements it would be impossible to enforce the provisions of this Act without the help of personnel not on the staff of the Department of Health. Provision has therefore been made that the powers, duties and functions of inspectors may also be exercised or performed by officers of the Department of Customs and Excise, local authorities and members of the S.A. Police.</p>

<p>The powers of inspectors and detention of substances are dealt with in detail in clauses 9 and 12 and the preservation of secrecy about information acquired by inspectors in the performance of their duties is dealt with in clause 17.</p>

<p>Clause 10 provides for the appointment of analysts by the Secretary and they are appointed for Group I or II substances. The methods of analysis, forms to be completed, the certificates that must be submitted by the analyst, his powers, duties and functions may be prescribed by regulation. With the rapid advances that are being made in analytical procedure in the scientific world, flexibility is needed if the most recent methods of analysis are to be used, and that is why the aforementioned matters will be dealt with by regulation.</p>

<p>Clause 13 provides for the conviction of a person selling a Group I or II hazardous substance which does not comply with the provisions of the Bill and clause 14 provides for special defences with regard thereto.</p>

<p>Provision is made in clause 16 for the prosecution of the employer or principal of a firm for any offence committed under the provisions of the Bill, but provision is also made for the procedure to be followed by such a person to prove his innocence.</p>

<p>The offences described in clause 18 relate to the duties of inspectors and clause 19 provides for penalties that can be imposed on persons found guilty of an offence under the Bill. Convicting any person of an offence under this Act, the court may declare any grouped hazardous substance forfeited to the State in terms of clause 21.</p>

<p>Provision is made in clause 24 for the enforcement of the Bill by authorized local authorities.</p>

<p>This delegation may apply to such substances or any classes thereof and may contain such restrictions as the Minister may specify. In terms of clause 8(3), such authority will be limited to Group I and II substances. Clause 25 provides for authorized local authorities to enforce provisions of the Bill in their areas of jurisdiction, and to prosecute anybody who fails to comply with the provisions. The delegation of powers by the Secretary is dealt with in clause 26.</p>

<p>The Bill should mainly be seen as enabling legislation with the particular control measures provided for in more detail in the regulations to be framed in terms of clause 29. In order not to be accused of acting arbitrarily or of being bureaucratic, provision is made in clause 29(9) <span class="col_1445-1446" refersTo="page_0736"/>that before any regulation may be made the proposed text shall be published in the <i>Gazette</i> three months before making such a regulation. Interested parties will then have the opportunity to submit representations or comments to the Secretary in writing. The regulations may then be published by the Minister after he has considered the comments and representations submitted.</p>

<p>Other enactments may legislate for a particular type of substance. This Bill will however only control the health safety matter of such substances&#x2014;matters for which the Department of Health is directly responsible and which are the particular aims of the Bill. In terms of clause 31 overlapping should therefore not be possible.</p>

<p>Approximately 250 copies of the draft Bill were forwarded to interested bodies for comments. The comments received were of a positive and constructive nature and a number of very useful proposals were incorporated in the proposed draft Bill. Judging from the comments the proposed measure will provide for a particular need and most of the bodies are eagerly awaiting the publication of the draft regulations.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this, in the main, is a Bill for the protection of the public and for that reason we on this side of the House will support it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has subdivided hazardous substances into four groups. He has Group I, Group II, Group III and Group IV and each of these groups deals with a specific type of hazard. However, he has grouped Groups I and II together, and I would like the hon. the Minister, when he replies, to tell the House why he has one group consisting of Groups I and II. There is no indication in the subdivision how he is going to separate those hazardous substances which he will eventually put into Group I from those he will put into Group II. There is nothing in this Bill at the moment which indicates that. It may be that in the information he gave to the interested bodies this point was made clear, but we on this side of the House did not receive this information and therefore we would like the Minister to tell us what he intends doing.</p>

<p>The other hazards which he takes precautions against for the public are those which deal with electronic products and radioactive materials. Now, if you look at the definitions of hazardous substances in the Bill, then virtually any substance, unless it is absolutely inert, can be included in Group I or Group II as far as we can see. Let us look at what the Bill provides in this respect. Clause l(viii) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;grouped hazardous substance&#x201D; means any substance, mixture of substances, product or material declared in terms of sec. 2(1) to be a harzardous substance &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>In clause 2 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may &#x2026; declare (a) any substance or mixture of substances which, in the course of customary or reasonable handling or use, including ingestion, might, by reason of its toxic, corrosive, irritant, strongly sensitizing or flammable nature or because it generates pressure through decomposition, heat or other means, cause injury, ill-health or death to human beings, to be a Group I or a Group II hazardous substance.</block>

<p>Let us just look around us. We have the inhalation of quartz in the mines. Is quartz included as a &#x201C;hazardous substance&#x201D;? Is that a hazardous substance? If you pump a motor-car tyre and the tyre bursts through the pressure generated by mechanical means and causes injury, is rubber then a &#x201C;hazardous substance&#x201D;? There is no limit to this and I could go on to illustrate in a 101 ways how almost everything around us could be included as a hazardous substance.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. People could be allergic to it. We could be allergic to the atmosphere of this House, for instance, but of course that in any case is hazardous. In all seriousness I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give a better definition of what he terms a &#x201C;hazardous substance&#x201D; and to give illustrations of what he means by <span class="col_1447-1448" refersTo="page_0737"/>hazardous substances. When it comes to Group II and Group III we understand completely what he intends classifying under these two groups. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>I said at the outset that this is a protective measure for the public, but the secret of the success of this Bill will be in its application and it cannot possibly be applied properly and it cannot give the protection that it intends giving unless the Minister has sufficient qualified inspectors. With the present shortage of trained manpower it is going to be very, very difficult for the Minister, with all the good intentions in the world, to find sufficient inspectors to carry out the job he has set out to do. We must try to help him, but let us just take one instance, the instance of the purchase in bulk of sprays, dips, dusting powders that agriculturists use. It is all very well for an inspector in a town or a residential area to go from place to place quickly. One inspector can do a lot of work in one day. However, what happens when he has to inspect farm after farm? The hon. the Minister said&#x2014;I agree with him&#x2014;that every inspector shall be a qualified man. Does the hon. the Minister think that he is going to find sufficient people with B.Sc. degrees who will be willing to visit farm after farm&#x2014;day after day&#x2014;to inspect the farms to see if (the farmers are looking after and keeping their hazardous substances in order? It is going to be very difficult to find suitable staff to do this type of work.</p>

<p>How are we going to help the hon. the Minister to overcome these difficulties? The first thing, of course, is that these inspectors need not only have to be highly qualified, they have to have university degrees, but will have to be paid very well, otherwise he will not get anybody to do this type of work. Then he is also going to delegate powers to other people because he already foresees that in all instances he will not be able to have inspectors on the spot to do the job. Therefore he is going to employ the police and the customs officials, and so forth. If the sergeant of a police station is going to keep himself busy examining hazardous substances either in an urban or in a rural area, he is going to neglect some of his other duties and I think that every policeman today has his hands full as it is. To put further duties upon their shoulders is asking a little bit too much from these people. They are really paid to do a certain job, but not to do the work that the industrial health officer ought to be doing himself. This is a very good Bill indeed, but it can cause very great difficulty in its application. What I have said about inspectors also applies to analysts. To carry out the job properly it has got to mean that we have to have a sufficient number of analysts to do the jobs that are allocated to them. Every inspector, for instance, will be wanting to take a sample of a suspected hazardous substance in order to have it analysed. Then the analyst must be a qualified man as well. Is the hon. the Minister going to be able to find all the analysts that are going to be needed for this type of work? Perhaps I am exaggerating the position, perhaps I am not; I do not know and the hon. the Minister will not know until he puts this legislation into operation. He will not know before then how many cases he will have to deal with. These are problems which I see and which may face the hon. the Minister and I hope he shall be able to overcome them. The hon. the Minister of Finance and the Treasury will have to dip deeply into their pockets to help the hon. the Minister of Health to carry out these functions properly.</p>

<p>Some years ago I spoke about this type of protection, particularly for the worker, and I thought that this type of legislation should have been incorporated in a Bill where we could deal with industrial diseases. However, that has not come about and we now have this, I hope as an interim measure.</p>

<p>There are one or two things which the hon. the Minister said which I want to deal with. He spoke about the protection of children from poison and he also spoke about the suggestion of colouring poisonous materials. He also spoke about the instruction that would be given in schools about poisons. These suggestions are very good indeed, but I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if he is going to colour substances red or pink or green, he is going to have trouble because those are favourite colours used by the cold-drink manufacturers and it is going to be difficult to wean away a child&#x2019;s idea of an attractive drinkable substance. Therefore I would suggest to him to colour the container rather than the substance. The container could be in such a colour and design as to make the child, particularly the child, fearful of its contents. Hon. members know it is not so very long ago that medicines of a poisonous nature were put either into dark blue bottles or they had corrugated edges to them. <span class="col_1449-1450" refersTo="page_0738"/>I believe we should have another look at that form of protection rather than to depend on the colouring method. You could do it by means of a label, but if anybody can tell me that there are many children of five years and under who are able to read the label, I would like to know where these children have had their education. Those are problems which the Secretary for Health and the hon. the Minister will have to sort out as time goes by.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the duties of the inspectors. These are set out in clause 9 on page 10 of the Bill. An inspector may search premises, demand information, weigh count, measure, mark or seal substances, examine or make copies of, take extracts from any book, demand from the owner or any person in charge of such premises, statements or explanations in respect of any operational process, demand any information regarding such operation, seize any substance, appliance, book or statement, etc. These are all very important duties that the inspector will have to carry out. His powers as set out in the Bill are terribly wide. I say that even a university graduate with a B.Sc. degree is going to have difficulty in doing this. My suggestion to the hon. the Minister is that every person who applies and is found suitable for this job should be required to follow a special course of training before he is sent out to do the work. It is a specialist&#x2019;s job. The same applies to the analytical chemist. The analysts will have to undergo special training before being required to do the work set out in the Bill as it stands here.</p>

<p>Talking of analysis, no provision is made here as to how a suspected substance should be examined. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he perhaps by way of regulation determine that, when a substance is taken from a person for examination, this substance is to be divided into three parts; one part will go sealed to the analytical chemist, one part will be retained, sealed by the person who has the substance, in case he wants to appeal against a decision which is not in his favour, while the third part is held by some competent authority. This ensures that the three parts are all of the original substance. That is done in other tests and I think that it is the sort of thing that we should expect in a Bill of this nature. After all is said and done, every action that is taken by the inspector is, or should be, to protect the public. I think too that the person who possesses the hazardous substance should also be given the opportunity of protecting himself, and this is one way in which he can do so.</p>

<p>Those are some of the matters I wanted to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister. When we come to the Committee Stage, we could if necessary have a further talk about some of the clauses. In the main, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that we on this side of the House consider this a good Bill and we shall give it our support. We do hope, however, that the hon. the Minister will be able to elaborate further on those queries that I have put forward to him here this afternoon.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#morrison">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. de V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House are, of course, grateful for the fact that the Opposition, in the person of the previous speaker, intimated that they support this Bill. As usual, when Bills are introduced by this side of the House they are always good Bills. I do not necessarily agree with everything the hon. member said here, but I want to concede that he made quite a few practical suggestions that will most certainly have the Minister&#x2019;s consideration. I agree with him in one respect, i.e. that the Bill must indicate to us the difference in Group I and Group II medicines, hazardous substances. Groups III and IV are reasonably clearly defined, but one has a problem, when one reads the Bill, in precisely defining what is meant by Group I and Group II medicines. As far as I am concerned this is essential because there are clauses in the Bill that specifically deal only with Group II substances, while the question of Group I substances are not considered.</p>

<p>I am also in sympathy with the hon. member when he speaks about the question of a clearer definition of exactly what a &#x201C;hazardous substance&#x201D; is. Here one must, however, also take into account the practical problems. If one defines this too strictly, problems are certainly going to crop up in practice as far as the implementation of this Bill is concerned. One should perhaps incline towards leaving it in this reasonably broadly defined form, simply leaving its implementation in the hands of those who must execute these powers. I believe that with dedication and common sense this specific aspect should certainly not produce problems.</p>

<p>A third point the hon. member made, is the fact that the Minister is going to have <span class="col_1451-1452" refersTo="page_0739"/>problems with the appointment of inspectors to inspect all these hazardous substances. There, of course, I acknowledge that he is right, but I think the hon. member is blundering if he calculates that the idea here is, for example, to send inspectors to all farms to see whether people there are keeping the hazardous substances properly under lock and key. I think the problem can be solved much more easily than this. Usually we find that the public act reasonably as far as this kind of thing is concerned. When specific prescriptions are issued when these substances are purchased, and the containers are properly marked&#x2014;I shall come back to this at a later stage&#x2014;giving proper indication what the dangers are inherent in these substances, one usually finds that people will keep these substances under lock and key without inspections having to be carried out on farms. I think that the task of these inspectors will largely be centered on manufacturers and the outlets where the substances are sold, to ensure that the substances are under such control as is prescribed by the regulations in terms of this measure. The Bill provides, of course, that the Minister may call in the staff of a local authority-one thinks here, in particular, of health officers&#x2014;to help with the inspection of stocks in shops, etc.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that this legislation gives the Minister and the Department of Health very far reaching powers, but actually we are very grateful for that fact. The time has come for us to properly face this question of dangerous and hazardous substances. If one sees what is being done in other countries, we are really lagging behind in this sphere. As one who has been in practice and who has frequently been faced with this problem, it is gratifying to me that we are now coming along with a Bill that gives proper powers to the department to combat these problems and these evils. In contemplating that when, in America, one buys a packet of cigarettes, which is generally available, after all, each packet has printed on it, in bold type that &#x201C;the contents of this package is injurious to health&#x201D;, it amazes one that manufacturers in this country are sensitive and that when they place articles or products on the market, which are poisonous or potentially poisonous, they object to labels indicating that these substances could be dangerous. Sir, when one is in practice, as I was, and one finds a young child who has perhaps taken a substance that appeared on the surface to be quite harmless, and that child is in the deadly grip of convulsions, and one looks at the container in which that substance was, one frequently sees that there are no indications on the tin or bottle to the effect that the substance is poisonous, nor are there any indications of what first aid measures must be applied. There are not even any indications of what a doctor can administer as an antidote in those cases. Sir, on a certain occasion I found that someone had accidentally taken a very dangerous substance. The person was really within an ace of death. That container was simply inscribed &#x201C;Poison/Vergif&#x201D;, without any indication whatsoever of what treatment should be given to save the person&#x2019;s life. I had to make a telephone call to the factory in Johannesburg to find out what the antidote in that specific case was. This ought not to be necessary, because in such cases a few minutes hesitation can at times cause death.</p>

<p>In the past decade highly sophisticated substances have appeared on the market. I am referring, in particular, to the organic phosphates. There are many poisonous ones amongst them, substances that ought to be administered and handled with great circumspection. Therefore we welcome the fact that there is now legislation that gives the Minister the power to compel these people to indicate on their labels the constituent elements, the first aid measures and antidotes that can be applied in cases of poisoning. These substances are sometimes very poisonous, although the public is not always aware of the toxic effects. In actual fact, as yet very little is known of many of these substances&#x2019; cumulative effects in the body. We know that many of these toxic substances, even when taken in small quantities, can nevertheless have a cumulative effect in the body and sometimes concentrate in the liver, which could lead to the eventual collapse of the liver and fatal consequences for the patient. It is consequently imperative that the necessary information be placed on the containers in which these substances are packed in and sold.</p>

<p>Sir, we know, for example, of substances that are absorbed through the skin. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that you recently read that a few children died because they had lain down on a couch, chairs or beds, the covers of which had been contaminated by a certain substance while crossing the sea from Holland. Sir, that toxic substance was absorbed through <span class="col_1453-1454" refersTo="page_0740"/>the children&#x2019;s skin in such quantities that they consequently died. I mention this by way of illustration to indicate the dangers inherent in many of these substances. They are quite ordinary substances. The other day I was looking at a hairspray. Apart from the fact that when in contact with heat, the container could explode, the preparation itself greatly irritates the air passages of small babies in particular. Sir, that container merely indicates that it should be kept in a cool spot. It is not even stated on that container that it is highly explosive if it should land on an open fire. It is not stated that the contents of the tin could be very poisonous as far as children are concerned and could seriously irritate their air passages. There is no indication on that tin of what antidotes must be used against that specific substance. I really want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his intention to provide that even toys that contain lead, or which are painted with a lead paint, must be very clearly marked. The public is entitled to know that a specific toy is made of lead and is a potential danger as far as children are concerned. The public is entitled to know this when they buy a specific substance that is potentially poisonous. This must be indicated on the container, and there must also be indications of what first aid measures can be applied if a child were to be poisoned.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to a general cleansing agent such as carbon tetrachloride, one of the most dangerous substances there are today in general use in our homes for the cleaning of clothes. The mere inhalation of the fumes of this substance can have fatal consequences for a child. Therefore we welcome the content of this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, I also want to broach another matter that I have already raised in this House on several occasions, and that is the question of the sale of methylated spirits, which is certainly as hazardous a substance as any other available on the market. Sir, you will remember that on previous occasions I have referred to the fact that these spirits are increasingly being used, by our Coloured and Bantu populations in particular, as an alcoholic substance.</p>

<p>After my representations to the Department of Customs and Excise, it was decided a year ago to add a substance called bitrex to the ordinary industrial methylated spirits in an effort to make the spirits so bitter that no one would want to drink it. To my amazement I found, in my own town&#x2014;and other cases have also been reported to me&#x2014;that this bitrex additive had no effect upon the intake of methylated spirits. These people simply add a lot of sugar, or they use a very popular soft drink to conceal the taste, and methylated spirits is still being used increasingly by these people as an intoxicant. During the past weekend a minister from a mission station in the Boland approached me and earnestly requested me to again bring this matter to the Government&#x2019;s attention because the situation was becoming completely unbearable in certain places. The intake of methylated spirits as an intoxicant is still increasing, and there is apparently no way in which the public can combat this evil. I immediately want to acknowledge that methylated sprits is still a general cleansing agent for our less privileged in particular. It is still in free and general use as a fuel for spirit stoves, etc. But, Sir, we can no longer overlook the dangers of this, and I want to advocate that very serious attention be given to this matter. I realize that the practical solution of this problem is no simple matter, but it beats me that any child, whether he be seven years old, ten years old or fifteen years old, can be allowed to walk into a shop and buy as much methylated spirits as he sees fit. I feel that initially the solution of the problem lies in the fact that the sale of methylated spirits should be prohibited to children under the age of 18 years.</p>

<p>Secondly I want to suggest that serious consideration should be given to having methylated spirits sold in smaller quantities per purchase than is the position at present. At present it is generally made up in 750 ml bottles, and there is no reason why methylated spirits cannot be made available, in smaller quantities, only to adults. I should like to see the sale of methylated spirits prohibited by our general dealers, but this would be completely impractical, however, for the reasons I have already mentioned. I believe the Department of Health owes it to our people to face up to this problem, and with the wide powers this legislation grants to the Minister and the department, I believe a solution can also be worked out for this problem.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the remarks of the hon. <span class="col_1455-1456" refersTo="page_0741"/>member for Cradock and I stand foursquare behind him in his suggestion that the system adopted in America, in regard to the marketing of cigarettes, could well be given serious consideration in South Africa. He is a medical man and I am sure he realizes that if the tobacco which goes into cigarettes were a recent scientific development, it would have been proclaimed as a potentially harmful drug and it would have been treated accordingly in the various schedules which exist for the treatment of potentially harmful drugs. I do not got so far as to say (that the sale of tobacco should be banned; I merely believe that the people who use it, should be warned of its ill effects. The hon. member for Cradock also referred to the dangers which arose because certain medicines do not carry sufficient advice, precautions, warnings and information concerning antidotes. I believe this is a matter of which the Drugs Control Council is fully aware and which will be dealt with as the Drugs Control Council catches up with the backlog of registrations of many thousands of medicines which are waiting to be dealt with.</p>

<p>As far as methylated spirits is concerned, here again I have no fault to find with the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion, excepting that I do not believe that to go back to the old days of requiring stockists to keep registers and to issue passes will really solve the problem. I believe it is important that there should be an age limit in regard to those persons who are entitled to purchase methylated spirits, and I believe that either a body like the CSIR or some other body, should be asked as a matter of urgency, to find an additive which can be added to the methylated spirits to render it completely unpalatable. I realize that there are certain difficulties in this respect but I feel that that is the way to deal with it, and not only to impose control on sales. In the past I have had personal experience of it and it did not work, and I do not believe it will have any material benefit as far as the problem is concerned in the future.</p>

<p>Then I would like to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for the very concise description he gave in his Second Reading speech of the implications of this Bill. At the same time I believe that this is the first Bill that this hon. Minister has introduced in his present capacity as Minister of Health. I would therefore like to wish the hon. the Minister a good and fruitful term of office in this portfolio of Health.</p>

<p>I would also like to express to the new Secretary for Health, who I believe is gracing the bay for the first time in his official capacity, a happy and fruitful term of office in that position. Now I believe there are certain aspects which we must consider from the Minister&#x2019;s introductory remarks. In the first instance I would like to welcome the indication the hon. the Minister gave in regard to the fact that the sellers or handlers of these various groups of hazardous substances would probably have to register their premises, and that registers will be kept in regard to the supply and sale.</p>

<p>I also notice that the hon. the Minister referred to the question of inspectors. He indicated that not only would the department appoint inspectors, but that departmental officials of the Department of Health would be used, and I understood him to say that customs officials would also be used, as well as the South African Police. I ask the hon. the Minister whether consideration has been given to the inclusion, with the South African Police, of the South African Railway Police, because I believe that in the harbour areas they could quite easily supplement the activities of customs inspectors when it comes to the investigation in relation to the importation and handling of hazardous substances.</p>

<p>I believe that there are a number of aspects which need clarity in regard to the question of the grouping of the substances. I want to refer to the long title of the Bill which states, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To provide for the control of substances which may cause injury or ill-health to or death of human beings by reason of their toxic, corrosive, irritant, strongly sensitizing of flammable nature</block>

<p>I submit that such wording must surely have more than a passing interest for the members of the medical, dental, pharmaceutical and nursing professions. I realize that under the definitions clause the term &#x201C;hazardous substance&#x201D; is dealt with briefly. The hon. the Minister has indicated that various substances will be dealt with under the regulations. However, I want to refer to certain provisions which could be regarded as referring to medicines for human use. My hon. colleague, the member for Rosettenville, quoted from clause 2 and I want to reiterate that clause 2 gives the Minister the power to declare any substance <span class="col_1457-1458" refersTo="page_0742"/>which might cause injury to human beings, to be a Group I or a Group II substance. The hon. the Minister is a medical man and I am sure that he is fully aware of the implications of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, No. 13 of 1928, as it has been amended over the years. I am sure that he is aware too that there exist, in that Act, the fourth, fifth and sixth schedules which will be dealing, as I see it, with many of the substances which could fall within the ambit of this Bill. Let us take for instance the fourth schedule, which lists the poisons. We have there two divisions: Division I poisons&#x2014;the hon. the Minister referred to some of them&#x2014;include arsenic, strychnine, chloroform. They fall already under Division I and are subject to rigorous control. We also have the Division II poisons and here we have preparations of lead&#x2014;I just quote a few examples&#x2014;preparations of mercury, ether and various vermin killers.</p>

<p>When it comes to the fifth schedule we have the prohibited dependence-producing drugs and here we include dagga and heroin and then we have also the dangerous dependence-producing drugs in which are included such substances as morphine, cocaine, pethidine, etc. We also have a further schedule, the sixth schedule, which includes the barbiturates, certain slimming drugs and certain tranquillizers.</p>

<p>In addition to those we have in the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, as it stands, section 82 which deals with certain substances which, I assume, will also be included in the term &#x201C;hazardous substances&#x201D; in terms of this Bill. I am referring to substances such as sulphuric or battery acid, to methylated spirits, to which the hon. member for Cradock has referred, to caustic soda, carbolic acid, rectified spirits, and liquid preparations containing ammonia. All these are at the moment under some form of control under section 82 of Act No. 13 of 1928. I believe that it has been accepted too that the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act has introduced schedules which in the main correspond with the schedules which still appear in the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, but we realize that Act No. 41 of 1971, to which I have referred, does provide stricter control and more severe penalties. I am concerned about the scheduling or grouping of many of these substances which could be regarded as mainly medicinal.</p>

<p>We recently had, in 1971, the passing of the Drugs Laws Amendment Act. I believe that this Act was intended to link the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act and the schedules therein, to the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances Act. As such I believe that a very comprehensive and what appears to be adequate form of control exists as it stands now. I wonder whether, with all this control, it is necessary to introduce in this Bill the suggestion that these substances, covered adequately by other legislation, should be included here.</p>

<p>Hon. members will see that the legislation to which I have referred is already complicated. It has led to frustration amounting to resentment on the part of members of one profession, and there is evidence to suggest that it has led to an almost casual disregard on the part of a section of another profession. Although I can find no specific mention in the Bill of a drug or a medicine, I believe that the question of drugs themselves is fully covered in the Drugs Control Act, Act No. 101 of 1965. Therefore I ask the hon. the Minister to make it clear to me in his reply whether it is the intention in the case of Groups I and II to take over the various schedules which exist under other Acts to which I have referred, and whether he feels that by doing so, the control which he intends to implement, will be more effective and less complicated than it is at present. I ask him this because if it is not his intention, would it not be advisable, in the interests of clarity, for the word &#x201C;drug&#x201D; or &#x201C;medicine&#x201D; specifically to be mentioned and to be excluded from the ambit of this Bill? I ask this question because I find it difficult, from what we see in the Bill itself and from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remarks in his speech, to equate what we have now, with the purport of clause 31 which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other law which is not in conflict with or inconsistent with this Act.</block>

<p>Therefore I repeat: If this new legislation is to streamline administration, I am sure it will be very welcome, but if it leads to confusion and duplication in the field of medicines for human use, I believe it could meet with a mixed reception by most professions which are intimately concerned with the day-to-day handling of medicines.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville has referred to the question of the appointment of inspectors and the appointment of analysts. <span class="col_1459-1460" refersTo="page_0743"/>I must say that I agree with him wholeheartedly it appears to be necessary it be stated somewhere, not necessarily in the Bill, but in the regulations which flow from the Bill in terms of clause 29, that some minimum qualification is required in so far as the inspectors which this department will use in the implementation of the provisions of this legislation, are concerned. The Minister has indicated that in so far as inspectors of Group III substances are concerned, there will be laid down minimum qualifications and I can clearly see the necessity for that. But the powers of the hon. the Minister and the powers of the secretary are broad in this, and not particularly specific. As the hon. member for Rosettenville has said, the powers of inspectors are broad too. They can enter and search, they can seal packages or appliances, they can demand information, etc., and I believe that, in the interests of all who may be affected by the terms of this Bill, there should be a guarantee against the possibility of false pretences or fraud. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not think it would be desirable to establish the <i>bona fides</i> of the inspector, by laying down in the Bill that the inspector should display his identification, establish his <i>bona fides,</i> without being asked to do so by the person he is inspecting but before he makes his inspection itself. It is the intention of this side of the House to table an amendment in this respect during the Committee Stage and I trust that the hon. the Minister will give it sympathetic consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister indicated that more than 250 draft copies of this Bill had been circulated and submitted to interested parties. I want to leave a suggestion with him in this respect. It could well have happened that this Bill came up earlier in the session, in fact, shortly after it had been placed on our tables which would have left us very little time to consider the actual Bill fully. Therefore I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it could be of help to the members on both sides of this House if, when draft Bills of this nature are circulated, members of Parliament themselves could inspect them so that they could be aware of what form of legislation may be coming forward. I think it will help, because sometimes we are called upon at very short notice to debate a Bill which may in itself not be contentious, but may contain many clauses and may require many hours of careful study if one is to be able to take part in a debate intelligently. It would seem that commerce and industry as such are quite satisfied with the provisions of the Bill and if the hon. the Minister can satisfy us in his reply that there will be no problems with control overlapping with the control under Acts which are already on the Statute Book, I am sure that we on this side of the House will be able to support him in this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is also an honour and a privilege for me today to congratulate the hon. the Minister heartily in his new capacity as Minister of Health, and in particular on this occasion when he is introducing in the House of Assembly his first legislation in this new capacity. We know that the hon. the Minister is very well equipped to take upon himself this very important task in South Africa. Hence we are glad that he is the one who must watch over the people&#x2019;s health and over our beloved medical profession. Permit me too, Mr. Speaker, to make a few remarks in respect of our new Secretary for Health, who has already taken his bow as well. In his new capacity as Secretary for Health, we believe that he will also be able to make a great contribution to our national health, something he has already been doing for so many years with so much distinction in his previous capacity.</p>

<p>Last year I said, on a specific occasion: &#x201C;The Department of Health is always on the ball.&#x201D; I also think this is the case with the legislation before us this afternoon. It is so that the hon. member for Berea objects to the fact that he did not have this Bill for prior perusal, but perhaps he is actually excusing the fact that he did not do his homework. I think this is good legislation. I do not want to say that this cannot be improved upon in future, because we are living in a period in history in which there are innovations virtually every day. Therefore it is necessary for laws to be continually adapted and for new legislation to come along to suit our times. This is particularly the case when we take into account the tremendous technological development and the development in the chemical industry, which has been remarkable, particularly during the last two decades. Therefore it is necessary for us to exercise effective control over substances which are being produced at this time and which the public can come into contact with, substances that <span class="col_1461-1462" refersTo="page_0744"/>can prejudice their health and which can also play a role in the pollution of our environment. I should like to quote a portion of the long title of the Bill, because this is, in my estimation, a very important aspect of the whole approach. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To provide for the control of substances which may cause injury or ill-health to or death of human beings by reason of their toxic, corrosive, irritant, strongly sensitizing or flammable nature or the generation of pressure thereby in certain circumstances, and for the control of certain electronic products; &#x2026;</block>

<p>This Bill is going to lay down certain guidelines that we must adopt in future in respect of the handling of this matter. There is, however, one thing that is as plain as a pikestaff. It also holds good for many other matters in our country and relates to the dangers that may threaten the public and the fact that no legislation can eliminate such dangers. It is absolutely essential, as an initial premise, to take as a point of departure the fact that the public must be informed about what can, in fact, threaten them. I think it will become increasingly necessary, in future, to particularly draw the public&#x2019;s attention, at schools and on every possible occasion, in these times in which we are living, to the dangers of their environment and the dangers related to the substances with which they come into contact. If they do not have the knowledge, we cannot expect the public to be able to take the necessary counter-measures. This Bill deals chiefly with substances that cannot normally be applied as medicines. I consequently think it is also a reply to the question the hon. member for Berea put, because those other substances are controlled by the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act and by the Drugs Control Act. Then, of course, there is other legislation, which we dealt with last year, relating to foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants, which again cover that specific category. These, however, are substances that are normally used in commerce and industry and which people can come into contact with. And again, neither does this legislation cover all the aspects of various substances that are controlled by the Atomic Energy Act. It deals only with specific aspects of radiation not covered by that Act.</p>

<p>Many very serious accidents have already occurred in the past, causing disability and death as a result of the negligent handling of potentially dangerous substances, and therefore we also welcome the control, particularly today. But the most important aspect of this Bill is that by means of regulations dealers are being given specific guidelines about how to handle these substances. I have already frequently been struck by the fact&#x2014;and previous speakers also mentioned this here this afternoon&#x2014;that extremely dangerous substances sometimes do not have proper labels. It was my tragic experience to have shared once in the sorrow of a good friend whose two-year-old child took an overdose of a paint-removing substance. Although it can appear to be the negligence of the parents in such cases, in this particular case there was really no indication of the serious toxic nature of this substance. This meant that for many years this child had to undergo several operations, that his oesophagus had to be removed eventually and that transplants from his stomach to his throat had to be done. It is therefore imperative that the labelling in this connection should be handled very correctly. The dealers in these substances are people who must display a great deal of responsibility. Therefore this Bill is also very specific about the protection of the public, but also of the dealer himself. I think the dealers themselves may perhaps welcome it to a large extent, because if they conduct themselves within the framework of this Act they will not so easily expose themselves to possible claims that can result from accidents of this nature. But, Sir, we are living in the atomic age, and therefore this Bill makes provision for the detrimental effects of electronic apparatus and the effects of radiation. Later in my argument I will say something more about that.</p>

<p>There are only a few remarks I want to make in connection with the licensing of persons, which in my opinion must be controlled very strictly. In terms of clause 7 a person&#x2019;s licence can even be suspended if he does not comply satisfactorily with the provisions of this Bill. But on the other hand the Bill is nevertheless very fair in the sense that after reasons have been furnished by the Secretary for Health about why such a licence has been suspended, such a person may appeal to the Minister. We believe and know that in such cases the Minister will hear the appeal very judiciously. We cannot escape the fact that a person, who is dependent upon trading in these dangerous substances, can suffer <span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_0745"/>serious embarrassment by the actions of injudicious inspectors. Therefore I want to associate myself with the remarks made here this afternoon by the hon. member for Rosettenville. I think it is extremely necessary for the training of these inspectors to be given precedence, because in terms of this Bill the powers of these inspectors can be transferred to a variety of persons, <i>inter alia,</i> policemen as well. I therefore ask: Is a policeman, without the necessary training, in fact really competent to act as an inspector?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that provision will be made in the regulations for many of our problems, but I do want to advocate that in the implementation of this legislation, the training of the people, who must implement it, must be given very strong precedence.</p>

<p>I think it is also important that the inspectors should have minimum qualifications, particularly in the light of the fact that clause 28 safeguards an inspector against any action and provides that he cannot accept responsibility for his actions in such cases.</p>

<p>I have also a few remarks to make about another aspect of this Bill that perhaps does not emerge so clearly. You know, of course, that the pharmacological effects of many of these substances are well known. However, there are many conditions that arise as a result of the injudicious administration of certain substances or radiation, which does not have a clearly obvious effect, which can cause minimal disfunction of organs and tissues which can to a minimal extent affect the ductless gland system and can even have certain effects on the central nervous system and also the cognitive system. Sir, I want to give you an example. Recently I saw an article in connection with experiments being done with mice, in which the brain tissue of certain mice, already subject to certain experiences, were fed to mice who had not yet had those experiences. The remarkable aspect of these experiments was that a correlation exists between certain elements, which were present in the brain of the mouse that did have the specific experiences, and which can be transmitted orally to another, i.e. into the system of another organism. Therefore I think that we cannot yet, by any means, realize the full implications of the effects that dangerous substances can have on us. There is the question of mutations. Mutation is in reality the artificial or the natural changing of certain characteristics vested in the human or animal chromosome system. We are, virtually daily, exposed to certain minimal radiation. We take X-ray photographs; this is even done to an excessive degree. Sir, I want to tell you that the control of X-ray apparatus on the platteland is very shocking in many respects. The chromosomes in our body are bombarded by this electronic apparatus that can change our whole system and also our characteristics. I think the time has passed when monsters, physical deviations or new evolutionary forms exist only in the imaginations of writers of fiction. The fact remains that the injudicious use of R&#x04E7;ntgen radiation and also other forms of radiation on human beings, as in radioactivity, could in future have a considerable effect on the future of mankind. I therefore say that the necessity for this Act is not yet properly realized. It will perhaps be necessary to supplement the Act considerably in future to make provision for future knowledge and development in that connection. Sir, therefore I also want to express the requirement that in South Africa additional intensive research should be done in connection with the implications of those hazardous substances and the contact the public has with them. This is a good and an essential Bill which is a great step forward, and we should like to support it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the congratulations which have already been conveyed to the hon. the Minister on his promotion to his new office, and we want to wish him every success. I may just mention in passing that I am only sorry about one thing, and that is that he is no longer the parliamentary head of the Publications Board, because I could have had an interesting chat with him about statues, from Michelangelo&#x2019;s to Tienie Pritchard&#x2019;s; but that is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newcastle mentioned an important point when he spoke of X-ray apparatus used by doctors and dentists and other persons and bodies in our country. It is quite true that a large percentage of those X-ray apparatus is obsolete. The standards which applied when they were bought, no longer apply today and I think it will be one of the important tasks of the hon. the Minister to see to it that an investigation is made, especially into <span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_0746"/>the matter of these obsolete apparatus which is still being used today.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Under the Group III products mentioned in the Bill, and also the Group IV products, are included electronic products in the light of the danger to health, etc., that some of these electronic products may bring about I hope you will not take it amiss, Sir, if I raise the question here of what can happen to our country when inadequate and badly protected television sets are built, distributed and sold in South Africa. Sir, this is no mere surmise on my part.</p>

<p>It has been found in America that a certain percentage of television sets were injurious to health, not in the way Dr. Hertzog said, but injurious in that they gave out rays, radioactivity which could be harmful to the viewer, and one could think how harmful they could be particularly to young children who are exposed to this radiation for many hours a day. It is good to know that the S.A. Bureau of Standards will be laying down very thorough specifications for the building of these television sets, but I take it that their specifications will deal more with the mechanical aspects, the viewing aspects, and I trust that the hon. the Minister of Health will also use his powers to see that the danger of radioactivity from badly designed or badly constructed sets can be combated. This is not a plea, Sir, incidentally against bringing in television because I am sure we all want it, but this is a very important aspect which should be seen to.</p>

<p>Years ago we had these little instruments in the shoe stores which were fluorescent and showed the bones of young children when they were being fitted for new shoes. Those things were known and declared to be dangerous but it took such a long time before their use was stopped. I believe they have been discarded in this country and are not being used anymore, but it is an indication of how sometimes unconsciously some of these things can be pretty dangerous to us.</p>

<p>It is naturally a world-wide problem but I am just wondering whether the hon. the Minister can give us the assurance as to what extent we in South Africa, where we investigate these harmful substances, are working in conjunction with similar organizations in other countries which hand out licences or prohibit harmful substances. There is the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America and they have a list of thousands upon thousands of drugs which are harmful. So they also have in Western Germany and in Britain. Do we see to it that when a drug is declared harmful in one of these other countries it is also tested and examined in this country or, if we do not have the laboratory facilities to test these drugs immediately, do we at least see that we prohibit the sale of these drugs until they have been tested? This sort of thing is important when you think of the tragedy of the thalidomide babies in Western Germany, where a drug taken by expectant mothers led to the birth of these poor crippled little children. Thalidomide was passed in Western Germany but I believe it was stopped in time in the U.S.A. and also in other countries. I do not know whether we ever allowed thalidomide into our country but we can thank Providence for the fact that we have had no ill effects of that drug, which could have caused a tragedy in our country too.</p>

<p>I am very glad that it was not sold here. That was an excellent bit of prevention. I am thinking of the discrepancy you find between different countries in regard to the harmful effect of certain of these drugs in Groups I and II. Take sweatening agents. In France saccharin is sold, I believe, only under prescription while it is freely available in South Africa as a sweetener in cool drinks and in food. On the other hand calcium cyclamate is prohibited in the U.S.A. as a sweetener while in this country it is permitted. You find bottles of cool drinks stating that the contents have been sweetened by calcium cyclamate. Now, this is not an argument against saccharin or against calcium cyclamate but one would like to know whether sufficient attention has been paid to or whether sufficient investigation has been done in such matters. There are so many ways in which poisons and other noxious substances can affect the health of people in our country. Take the question of mineral oil, for instance. Mineral oil can be carcinogenic. Fortunately it was prohibited many years ago, about 20 years ago, from being used in any kind of food, but mineral oil is still very widely used today in sprays and paints and that sort of thing and it could be that some of these carcinogenic elements <span class="col_1467-1468" refersTo="page_0747"/>of mineral oil could be harmful to people using it today. It is a vast problem and I think we all wish the hon. the Minister success in his handling of it.</p>

<p>*It is a never-ending task and I only hope, as I stated at the beginning, that there will be correlation and co-operation with the other countries which can naturally have bigger laboratories than we can and which can sooner detect hazardous substances, in order to enable us to protect the lives as well as the health of many of us in this county.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is a new measure and we must therefore expect that there will be omissions and perhaps defects at the start. We have the legislation of other countries available that can be of help to us in foreseeing some of the problems which we are going to encounter. At the same time I have full confidence that we have succeeded in producing a very effective Bill at the start, because I have great confidence in the ability of those who produced this Bill.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to answer the different hon. members on what they have said about the Bill, I first want to express my appreciation for the good wishes directed at my address by some of the hon. members. I sincerely appreciate it. I know that one is only popular on the first day and that thereafter, after the chocolate has been rubbed off, it is just fighting from start to finish. At the same time I also realize that we need not fight on the scientific plane on which we find ourselves at the moment. It will really be unnecessary. We can add to each other&#x2019;s knowledge. I must congratulate the hon. members on the way in which they have approached this Bill. I think it is an example of the way in which the parties in this House can cooperate and really sometimes produce something worth while.</p>

<p>I also wish to add my own congratulations to the new Secretary for Health, Dr. De Beer, who is here today. He cannot speak on his own behalf, but on his behalf I also want to thank hon. members for the good wishes which they have directed to him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville, as well as other hon. members, did their utmost to approach this Bill in a neutral and scientific way. I think they have all made very good contributions.</p>

<p>I will start by attending to a few of the questions raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville. He was worried a little and was not sure what the difference was between a Group I and a Group II substance. He also is not clear in his own mind as to what the definition of a hazardous substance really means. He wanted to know why it was so wide and why it included such a number of substances. I shall answer him in a comprehensive way; I shall try to make it clear to him and to other hon. members who too may be worried about this. A Group I substance is the more dangerous substance. Group I substances include some medical substances which are in use at the moment, substances like arsenic and strychnine. Group II substances consist of household substances household substances which are used although they are dangerous. By subjecting them to labelling and by prescribing their usage we can at least make them less noxious. As far as a hazardous substance is concerned and the definition thereof, we took our cue from the medical legislation. In clause 2(l)(a) of this Bill you will find the definition. If we look at the American legislation of some time ago, of 1958, we will find the same definition which we have in our Bill. We took it from them, because what they did in the past 14 years has been proved. It is legislation that has proved itself to be very effective. I can tell the hon. members that it is possible at this stage even to find make-up among the Group I or Group II substances. It is just possible. We must start sometime or other and we are starting now. We may at the start group certain substances in a certain way and later decide that they must be grouped differently.</p>

<p>The hon. member is worried about our shortage of manpower. I am also worried about that. I have been worried about that all along. He is worried about the fact that we will not have enough inspectors, but I must tell the hon. member that we have inspectors at this stage to help us to apply the Food, Drugs and Disinfectants Act. Realizing the shortage of manpower at the same time, we have decided that the Department of Customs and Excise, the local authorities and the Police must, with the inspectors they have available, try to help us in enforcing the provisions of this legislation. As far as the agricultural departments are concerned, they might help us with pesticides and we <span class="col_1469-1470" refersTo="page_0748"/>believe that the Department of Commerce and Industry with their manpower will also be able to assist us. We must remember that the new hazards in the world of technology, as my hon. friend, the member for Newcastle, has said, that confront us from time to time will increase in times to come. We must start somewhere and we must use our available manpower to the best of our ability. However, we must not be defeatistic about it. Therefore I do realize the trouble and restrictions, but at the same time I realize that we must make a start somewhere. That was what we are doing as far as this Bill is concerned. As far as the question of colouring is concerned, I think the hon. member for Cradock has already answered the hon. member. I think it is more hazardous for people to identify a substance from the bottle than it is from the colouring.</p>

<p>Hear, hear!</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I definitely think so. Sir, there are more sides to this question and it is not so easy to find a satisfactory solution. I have sympathy for the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion that inspectors should follow a special course. I believe that that will come in due time. We will do our best as we go along carrying out the Act. We may prescribe by regulation that certain inspectors must from time to time see to it that they acquire more knowledge of these hazardous substances. That is something we can consider. At the same time, I do not at this stage want to commit myself to that. I do not think in any event that it is necessary to include that in the Bill. I think there is one other matter the hon. member mentioned, namely, that if a substance is to be analysed, it should be divided into three parts to ensure that each one of the various parties concerned has a sample available of the same basic substance. Well, that is provided for in the Bill. I think if the hon. member reads the Bill carefully, he will see that it is provided for.</p>

<p>I do not want to be too elaborate in my speech today, although I am sure that some of us who are interested in the scientific aspects, may not be unwilling to listen to what is going on in other minds. I noticed at the beginning of my speech that there were few members left in the House in any event. But there are a few more things I should like to say.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Cradock made a very interesting speech in which he spoke of his experience in particular and in which he emphasized that the manufacturer and the people at the outlets of industry will be of great importance. That is so, as I have already said. There are practical problems such as the colour and the shape of bottles, as I have already said, but we shall go into that. It is also true that there are substances&#x2014;and that is why they are labelled and described accordingly&#x2014;which cause certain reactions under pressure. These substances we can also group under Group I, under which these are mostly grouped, or under Group II. Nowadays this is often not done. I do want to mention that hon. members need not be concerned about these groupings, because in this regard three months&#x2019; notice will in any case be given of the Minister&#x2019;s intentions. It does not preclude the possibility of substances being transferred from one group to another. I was particularly impressed by the words expressed by the hon. member for Cradock in respect of methylated spirits. Methylated spirits is something that holds many dangers for our people, particularly for our Coloured people. Arising from complaints received by us we find that these people&#x2014;and probably some other people too&#x2014;sometimes drink methylated spirits and that this has sometimes caused accidental death. We know that it has often caused blindness as well. It appears that bitrex, the substance that was added to combat or to reduce the intake of methylated spirits, has not helped much. I want to tell the hon. member that I do think that if there are representations for methylated spirits to be placed under Group I or Group II of these hazardous substances it will deserve our consideration.</p>

<p>Stronger purgatives could be added.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member would not know, when a man started running, whether it was the result of fear or of purgatives. In any case, I really do not think we can take that risk. We can only aggravate the condition of people who are already ill if it contains alcohol and those other things as well. There are certain people who have some experience of this. I personally have some experience of such people who have come to complain to me; I am so sorry for them that I should prefer not to add this. Rather let it have a bitter taste in that case.</p>

<p><span class="col_1471-1472" refersTo="page_0749"/>&#x2020;I want to thank the hon. member for Berea for his contribution. I think he is a person who interests himself a lot in these matters and I think he made a few very interesting suggestions. The South African Railway Police can be used by the department. They work in the harbours and I think they will be available. I therefore think that the hon. member need not worry about that. The hon. member talked about the various schedules, but we do not include dependence producing drugs amongst the Group I substances. We will include some substances used in medicine such as arsenic and strychnine and substances like that. We are planning to change the Drugs Control Act so that by next year we will be able to control all drugs under the Drugs Control Act. In the meantime, we will have some substances used in medicine included in this measure and under Schedule 4 which the Drugs Control Council may amend. The hon. member was also worried about some corrosive substances such as sulphuric acid and some methylated form of corrosive substances, but I can assure the hon. member that all the corrosive substances and irritating substances, including sulphuric acid, are included. Nearly all of them are included and at the moment I think we have very few left which are not.</p>

<p>As far as this Bill is concerned I want to say that it is not in substitution of any other Act, but in addition to those measures already dealing with these substances. Where there is overlapping this will be rectified in the years to come. By next year I think we will have three measures, one dealing with the medical and dental profession, an Act dealing with the pharmaceutical profession and one dealing with the control of medicines. At the moment we are working on this and are trying to draw up three measures in the place of the old Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, which has become very cumbersome and difficult to interpret nowadays. The hon. member for Berea also made a very interesting suggestion about the <i>bona fides</i> of inspectors and I think it is a suggestion which I will look into. An inspector must be required to produce his <i>bona fides</i> instead of waiting for the person whose premises he is to examine to ask for it. Some become very worried and fearful when they see an inspector and forget about their rights. There is something in which the hon. member for Berea suggested as far as this is concerned. I also made a note of the hon. member&#x2019;s remark about the availability of the Bill. It is sometimes difficult to have the Bill available for everybody in time. I want to tell him that it will not save much time because as was suggested the Department of Health is so on the ball that as soon as a Bill is certified it only takes a day or two before it can be laid on the Table in this House. Therefore even hon. members on the Government side only have a head start on Opposition members.</p>

<p>*I want to thank the hon. member for Newcastle for his fine contribution. He told us a few very interesting things about the practical implementation of this measure. His knowledge shows that he takes a particular interest in this subject and I wa particularly pleased to hear him speak of the future dangers that threaten us as a result of our own technological ability. Then the hon. member for Orange Grove, too, made a contribution which was quite important, although it surprised me that the hon. member for Orange Grove, who has been putting up a tremendous fight for years to obtain television, has now at last found something that counts against it. This is something that counts against television and we have to consider it. A thing is not always to be considered from one side only. I want to tell the hon. member for Newcastle that guidelines will be laid down for dealers. As far as the appeal in regard to licensing is concerned, he can rest assured that the interests of those people will most certainly be considered by the Minister. I am concerned about the training myself, not only of inspectors, but particularly of analysts. But we have analysts in the department already who are doing this work today. They only have to be supplemented to some extent. Then we must remember one thing: There is no such thing as an inspector or analyst just being allowed to do as he likes and being safeguarded against any legal action by clause 28. If he reads clause 28 again, my hon. friend will see that such a person has to have acted in good faith. When you act in good faith the person who takes you to court can still try to prove that you did not act in good faith. But this is so in all cases. In any case, I am very impressed by the wide knowledge he displayed.</p>

<p>Then I finally come to the hon. member for Orange Grove, who indicated that he knew of many obsolete X-ray apparatus. That is so. To me that is not the greatest problem with X-ray apparatus. The problem is that we have already allowed the <span class="col_1473-1474" refersTo="page_0750"/>idea to gain too wide an acceptance that people who are not properly trained may operate X-ray apparatus, that a person has only to look at the instruction book to see how he has to handle it, and that as a result of this proper attention is not paid to the tremendous dangers to which the person taking X-rays is exposed. If a person takes a number of X-rays every day and he stands in the wrong place when he presses down that switch and is exposed to that radiation, it may be a matter of six months before he is suffering from leukemia or something else. Consequently I am glad that the hon. member indicated that there may be obsolete apparatus. It is true that there may be apparatus which may be defective and which may point in the wrong direction and affect other people in this way. But at the same time I just want to eradicate the idea that any person can work with an X-ray apparatus, which is a potentially very dangerous apparatus, and can use it for diagnostic or other purposes. It is true that there have been cases in America of television sets that were inadequately protected. This is something of which we shall take note. The hon. member remarked, however, that in my Second Reading speech I specifically referred to the fact that the Group III substances are electronic products. These include X-ray apparatus and television sets. This Group III will be subject to thorough supervision by the South African Medical and Dental Council. The department will not make and confirm regulations without first having referred them to this council. So hon. members can rest assured that we shall see to it that the public is afforded full protection in this respect as well.</p>

<p>It is not our intention either to work in isolation in regard to this Bill. Hon. members have already learnt that we studied the American and all other laws when this Bill was drafted, and we are certainly going to co-operate with these people so that we may be able in future to bring all the modern developments in regard to the protection of man, of his environment and of his health under the purview of this Bill whenever it may be necessary.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member mentioned something about the cyclamates. It is rather a funny story, but at the start there was this research about the cyclamates, especially into the possibility that they might cause cancer, or some form of carcinoma. Then in the end when it was really brought down to essentials, it was found that in the human being it takes 5 000 of these cyclamate tablets a day to induce a state that is comparable to the state that is induced in a rat to which about one of these tablets is applied.</p>

Sir, by giving the hon. member that free medical advice.</p>

<summary><i>(Second Reading</i>)</summary>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>On account of the ever-increasing and vast changes in respect of medical and pharmacy matters, constant amendments to the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act have become necessary. This is manifested in the increasing way the Act had to be amended during the last couple of years. To obviate this practice it has been decided to revise and to consolidate the Act. A start has already been made with the drafting of the proposed legislation and it will be discussed with the interested parties during the coming months. However, certain amendments to the Act are regarded as most essential and cannot be postponed until the consolidation of the Act is effected and in the circumstances I have no alternative but to come at this stage with these proposals.</p>

<p>Provision exists in section 2(3)(b) of the Act for the appointment of the Chief Health Officer or Deputy Chief Health <span class="col_1475-1476" refersTo="page_0751"/>Officer of the Department of Health as a member of the South African Medical and Dental Council. No provision exists, however, for the appointment of the Secretary for Health as a member of the council, and no stipulation has been made that the Secretary for Health shall also be appointed as Chief Health Officer. It is considered essential that provision be made that the head of the Department of Health could serve as a member of the council and the amendment in clause 1 will give effect thereto.</p>

<p>Section 37 of the Act authorizes a registered chemist and druggist to employ under his supervision, for the purpose of compounding and dispensing drugs and medicines, any apprentice or trainee chemist and druggist in the pharmacy in which he is serving his apprenticeship or is undergoing practical training, or any unqualified assistant. &#x201C;Trainee chemists and druggists&#x201D; are persons who have obtained a degree or diploma in pharmacy and are undergoing practical training before being registered as chemists and druggists. According to the present definition an &#x201C;unqualified assistant&#x201D; is a person who has completed a period of apprenticeship with a chemist and druggist and who has been registered as such. The latter definition is being amended in clause 8 of the Bill to include a person who has obtained credit for the first and second years of study for a degree or diploma in pharmacy. The purpose of this amendment is to enable students who have passed the first and second-year courses to obtain practical experience in a pharmacy during vacations. To enable the board to exercise the necessary control over the employment of such unqualified persons, it is necessary to add &#x201C;unqualified assistants&#x201D; and &#x201C;trainee chemists and druggists&#x201D; to the list of persons in respect of whom the Pharmacy Board shall keep registers and an amendment giving effect thereto is embodied in clause 2. These amendments are consequential to the introduction in 1970 of a four-year academic course for a degree or diploma in pharmacy.</p>

<p>Section 22(2) of the Act provides for restricted registration of medical practitioners and dentists in the Republic. Such registration takes place in respect of practitioners who, for various reasons, do not qualify for full registration in terms of the Act, and is only valid for an initial period of five years and thereafter for such periods as the council may determine and is also subject to such conditions as the council may determine. No such provision exists for restricted registration of chemists and druggists. Certain mission hospitals are employing chemists and druggists who obtained their qualifications in countries such as Holland, Germany and Finland and who are not eligible for registration in the Republic. The Pharmacy Board wishes to regularize the employment of these persons at such hospitals by granting them restricted registration in terms of which they will practise their profession for such periods, in such areas and subject to such other conditions as the board may determine. The board will be able to do this in terms of the proposed amendments in clause 3(a) and (b) and this will put chemists and druggists on the same level as medical practitioners and dentists with regard to restricted registration. The Act was amended in 1969 to make provisions for the introduction in 1970 of a four-year academic course for a degree or diploma in pharmacy. Through an oversight no provision was made that a person who obtains such a degree in pharmacy shall be eligible for registration as a chemist and druggist, as in the case of the holder of a diploma in pharmacy, only after he has completed at least twelve months&#x2019; training with a chemist and druggist in the Republic. Clause 3(b) (the new subsection (5) will rectify the matter.</p>

<p>The nature and duration of the practical training to be undergone by persons who have obtained a degree or diploma in pharmacy in terms of section 22 may be prescribed by regulation. The purpose of clause 4 is to extend this provision to include the practical training to be undergone by a person holding a diploma or certificate prescribed under section 27(1) of the Act.</p>

<p>Section 27(1)(c) of the Act provides that the board may grant a diploma or certificate which shall entitle the holder to be registered as a chemist and druggist, to any person who has passed the prescribed examination and has thereafter undergone practical training for a continuous period of not less than one year. The amendment in clause 5 will enable a person to obtain the diploma or certificate immediately after he passes the prescribed examination, and makes it clear that he may be registered as a chemist and druggist only after he has also completed the prescribed practical training to the satisfaction of the board.</p>

<p><span class="col_1477-1478" refersTo="page_0752"/>The amendment in clause 6 becomes necessary as a result of the amendment in clause 2.</p>

<p>In terms of section 95A the State President may, on the recommendation of the Medical and Dental Council, by proclamation in the <i>Gazette,</i> authorize the council to prescribe an annual fee to be paid by all persons registered in respect of any para-medical profession, provided that the council shall make such recommendation only after consultation with the professional board established in respect of such profession. Provision for the establishment of such boards under the aegis of the council was made in Act 43 of 1971. Professional boards have so far been established in respect of only three of such professions. The proposed amendment in clause 7(a) will enable a fee to be prescribed in the case of a para-medical profession for which a professional board has not yet been established. The amendment in clause 7(b) will enable the council to exempt any such registered person from payment of any prescribed annual fee. A similar provision already exists in respect of medical practitioners and dentists and is applied in cases where a person is unable to practise his profession for reasons such as illness, advanced age, etc.</p>

<p>In terms of subsection (2) of section 96A, Government Notice R.2200 of 3rd December, 1971, will lapse on 6th December, 1973. In the Government Notice the Minister authorizes certain categories of persons, including medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians, chemists and druggists to perform certain acts relating to potentially harmful drugs which are referred to in Part III of the Schedule to the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act, 1971.</p>

<p>As I have indicated in my preamble the revision and consolidation of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act is receiving attention, but as a result of the necessary consultation with interested parties, the draft legislation will not be ready for this session of Parliament. It is therefore necessary that subsection 96A(2) be amended so that the Government Notice may remain in force after the 6th December, 1973, and the proposed amendment in clause 9 will extend the period until the 6th December, 1974.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned amendments have been recommended by the S.A. Medical and Dental Council and the S.A. Pharmacy Board respectively.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House will support the Bill. It is a Committee Stage Bill and we do not see that any further amendments will be necessary to the suggested amendments to the principal Act. I should like, however, to avail myself of the opportunity to make one or two comments on what is happening at the moment. I feel firstly that every encouragement should be given to those people who wish to qualify as pharmacists, especially those who are non-Whites and find it difficult to enter a pharmacy school. They should be enabled to qualify so that, if necessary, they could attend to their own people. There is this deficiency in the educational facilities for the non-Whites and I hope that when the hon. the Minister has an opportunity of going into this matter of education for the para-medical services, the pharmacists, and also doctors and dentists, these difficulties will be cleared up. The hon. the Minister knows as well as I do how few Bantu pharmacists there are at the moment, how few are available to serve their own people not only in the homelands but also in the urban areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Are there any?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The position must be cleared up as soon as possible. The hon. the Minister will know that the pharmacy course is a relatively long one and if we start immediately it will be anything between five and six years before we shall have a proper and efficient team of pharmacists in those areas which are outside the urban areas. As a result of that difficulty which we see in giving the Bantu a reasonable service in the homelands, I welcome the provision which is now made for people who come here from overseas to be given an opportunity to practise particularly in mission hospitals. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that, if it is possible to find positions for these people in places other than hospitals in homelands, they should be allowed to practise. Does it mean that a man who comes from a country with which there is no reciprocity at the moment will be denied permission to open up a chemist shop, but will be allowed to practise in a mission hospital nearby? These are difficulties which the hon. the Minister must face himself, and the hon. the Deputy Minister sitting <span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_0753"/>next to him at the moment will have to give this serious consideration. I want also to say to the hon. the Minister that he must make very effort immediately to provide for the training of more Bantu pharmacists.</p>

<p>Talking about the admission into the country of pharmacists from countries where there is no reciprocity, brings me to the position of the other para-medical services which may require similar assistance. How many of our physiotherapists who have trained in the urban areas would readily go to a Bantu homeland to practise? Can we expect them to? Can the Minister see ways and means of giving these people a salary commensurate with what they would be earning in the urban areas? I doubt it very much. So, if you open a door to pharmacists, I would suggest that the Minister of Health also goes into the position to see whether other para-medical services should not be encouraged to enter our country under the same conditions as those under which pharmacists are being allowed to practise here.</p>

<p>Talking about the para-medical services, I wonder whether you will allow me, Mr. Speaker, to deal with another matter which is not directly in the Bill, but I will only be a minute on this matter. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider the position of those people who have been practising in the para-medical services for years and years. In one case that I know of a physiotherapist, who served through the war as a physiotherapist, who since the war has practised in a large town, who has been acclaimed as an excellent physiotherapist and who has been used by his colleagues in the medical profession, is not recognized as a qualified physiotherapist by the law as it now stands. He is not recognized as a physiotherapist because he did not pass the required examination at that time but studied in a country where there is no reciprocity. These people are now denied a living, and the denial comes at a time when it is virtually impossible for them to sit for an examination.</p>

We shall give it our support, although there will be one or two matters which we might perhaps want to deal with in the Committee Stage. The Minister has already replied to some of the queries I wanted to put to them. He denied me that opportunity of cross-examining him here because he got in first, but with the few remarks that I have made I will again tell him that we will assist the passage of this Bill at the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support the legislation of the hon. the Minister. Although it is not contentious, there are nevertheless a few important amendments. We are pleased that the Secretary for Health will in future serve on the Medical Council. The Medical Council themselves asked for it and the medical practitioners in this country welcome this amendment whereby the Secretary for Health will serve on the Medical Council.</p>

<p>This amendment also regulates the training and registration of pharmacists. In the past the training has not always been well understood, but now proper provision is being made for the training of pharmacists. The Council is also being granted the right now to recognize diplomas and certificates obtained abroad, and to register the holders of the certificates as pharmacists in our country. We hope there will be reciprocity between us and the other countries. We believe it is important that this training of pharmacists should be laid down in the legislation for it could indeed be harmful if doctors are properly trained, nurses are properly trained, but the pharmacists who have to dispense the medicines are not properly trained. One finds many people from countries where the training is rather poor, who practise here, I believe it also offers protection to our own pharmacists if we should close the door a little through which others from abroad are able to enter this country without being properly qualified. There is not much more contained in this Amendment Bill and we support this provision. We thank the hon. the Minister for having effected this amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has given the reason for the introduction of this Bill, which has met with the full approval of the Pharmacy Board and of organized pharmacy. The hon. the Minister made an interesting observation <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_0754"/>when he said that the three professions will be separated and that there will be a separate Medical, Dental, and then a Pharmacy Bill next year. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that over the years many amendments of a much more contentious nature have been suggested to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessors and these amendments have been swept under the carpet. I trust that, when consideration is given to the Bill which is to be introduced into this House in 1974, the hon. the Minister will approach the problems with courage and understanding, because I want to tell him that there is a ferment in the pharmaceutical profession at the present time. I believe that many of the present qualified members of the profession see no professional future for chemists and druggists, with the position as it is at the present. I think that the entrants into the profession are also becoming frustrated. I will deal with this matter a little later on.</p>

<p>I want to refer to clause 3 of the Bill and say that it is welcomed. The hon. the Minister has referred to the position which now arises, whereby chemists and druggists who come from lands where reciprocity is not recognized, will be able to practise in the mission hospitals. I know that this clause has been dubbed &#x201C;the missionary clause&#x201D;. There appears to me to be a paradox in this because, while we have had the provision in the Act for the control of pharmacy schools inside the Republic, the Board now receives permission to control pharmacy schools outside of the Republic. Let us have a look at what is going on in the pharmacy schools inside the Republic. At the present moment there are ten institutions or pharmacy schools, namely five universities&#x2014;two for Whites and three for non-Whites&#x2014;and five colleges for advanced technical education, all of which are training chemists and druggists. In these ten institutions the total enrolment last year stood at almost 2 000 students, taking total enrolment for the various years&#x2019; courses. In addition to that there are more than 90 highly qualified members of the teaching staff providing this training at the ten institutions. What is the result? Between 200 and 300 pharmacists have qualified according to the latest figures at my disposal during 1972. So we have this vast number of students being trained in pharmacy but we have a terrific drop-out rate. I want to suggest that, as this training is taking place at tremendous cost to the State and the taxpayer, the time has come when the drop-out rate in the training of pharmacy students merits very serious consideration, because what must these 200 or 300 students who qualify do to survive and to make a living when they have qualified? They have to become involved in cut-throat competition with patent medicine dealers and cut-price chain stores. This is the main outlet for many of those people who are going in for a long, difficult and expensive course. When they finally qualify, they find that with the situation as it is at present, there is very little hope for them in the future as professional people.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to another question. The hon. the Minister has pointed out that in terms of clause 3 provision exists for medical schools and dental schools and for the Medical Council to deal with medical men and dentists who qualified at medical and dental schools outside of the Republic. This, I realize, is the position but I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that a very serious position now exists in the dental profession. I have a letter here which comes from the Secretary of a branch of the Dental Association and from which I wish to quote briefly:</p>

<block name="quote">Dentists of Indian origin, i.e. those that qualified in India, are not register-able in this country by the South African Medical and Dental Council. To become registrable it is necessary to work in an approved institution or clinic under the supervision of a registered dental surgeon. After a period of two years, they are then able to sit for an examination after the passing of which, they are able to go on the register.</block>

<p>Let me make it clear that I do not find any fault with that, because this is a provision which I believe safeguards the situation and ensures an adequate standard. Put the point that disturbs me is this, and the letter concludes by saying:</p>

<block name="quote">The problem is that there are no posts available at provincial institutions.</block>

<p>Take for example the R.K. Kahn Hospital at Chatsworth in Durban. There they could serve the two years which would entitle them to registration. We know there are a limited number of posts in the Transvaal Administration but the problem exists primarily in Natal, because the Indian population <span class="col_1483-1484" refersTo="page_0755"/>is mainly concentrated there. And so we have this summing up of comment: It is claimed that there is a tremendous demand for the services of Indian dentists to serve their own people, and that the services are not available in the vast area of the North Coast and Durban where many of them live. The claim is made that the King Edward VIII Hospital is fully extended with its existing staff and that they cannot take any more. It is said that the Indian dentists with British and South African qualifications who are registered in South Africa and who are entitled to practise and to serve their own people, are at present dealing with up to 100 patients a day. They are doing it primarily on a humane basis in order to help those who are suffering pain and who need urgent dental attention. They say that the services are stretched. The claim is made that the population is crying out for services. There are people willing to perform that service, but nothing is being done due to a lack of action on the part of the authorities. I commend this position to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice because I believe urgent steps should be taken to ameliorate the position. If we are to rely on the Indians in South Africa receiving their training in dentistry in South Africa we find that they can only apply, to my knowledge, to one university, the University of the Witwatersrand, and I understand that the intake there is two per year. The claim is made by the Dental Association that there is no other dental faculty in South Africa where Indians can be trained. I know that the position exists, as far as overseas training is concerned, that a South African Indian can apply to a dental school in Great Britain or Ireland. I believe there is some reciprocity, so that having qualified there, there would be no particular problem as regards their practising in South Africa. Since the withdrawal of South Africa from the Commonwealth, however, there has been little inclination, I am told, on the part of various institutions overseas to accept students from South Africa, particularly Indian students. So the alternative is that these people are called upon to qualify in India and then they have to seek registration. At the moment, in order to seek registration, they have to be placed in approved institutions in South Africa and it seems as if these institutions do not exist in sufficient numbers to allow the Indian dentists to qualify on that basis. I would like to appeal to the Minister to do something in this regard. I am told that a member of the South African Indian Council has indicated that there are at present seven fully qualified dentists who cannot practise in Natal because they are waiting for the necessary posts to be made available at the training institutions. I know the Minister will regard this with sympathy because I do not think he likes to know of people suffering from severe toothache for example and being unable to receive the services they require.</p>

<p>As far as the other aspects of the Bill are concerned, we know that they are temporary measures; that they have been introduced to serve the wishes of the professions until such time as all the Acts are consolidated next year. We support the Bill.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend wasting any time, because I think in the Committee Stage we can thrash out many of the problems which have cropped up in this discussion. I have listened with interest to the hon. member for Rosettenville, as well as to the hon. member for Berea, who made a very impassioned plea for the dental profession. I do not know whether it is really the right occasion for that at this moment, seeing that our thoughts are more directed towards the pharmacists of which profession he is a member. I can tell him, however, that as far as the Coloureds are concerned, for whom I am responsible, we have introduced a course in dental training in collaboration with the University of Stellenbosch. We have also decided that, in case there are any vacancies available for students of other races to be trained, we might also admit some Indians. I myself am worried about the position in Natal and will give it further attention.</p>

<p>At this specific stage I do not wish to comment any more on the Bill. I have listened with great interest to the worries the hon. member for Berea in particular has about the future of the pharmacy profession, which is turning out about 2 000 students a year, who are wondering and worrying about their future. They are also scientists, you know, after a four year course. Maybe we can try and fit them in somewhere else. Anyhow, we must not lose them&#x2014;about this we definitely agree.</p>

<p>*There are problems in regard to all these cases which have been mentioned, <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_0756"/>and I do not wish to pursue this matter now. I just want to say that I listened with a measure of interest to the matters brought up by the hon. member for Geduld regarding reciprocal recognition between us and other countries. We must bear in mind that we cannot simply open up and allow everybody to enter. We are very proud indeed of the standard of our medical, pharmaceutical and dental services in South Africa, and we must have strict rules. In that process we must sometimes act rather strictly. I want to tell the hon. member for Rosettenville that the services in the homelands are actually the function of the Department of Bantu Administration, with which he had direct discussions. We act as agents there. Regarding the training of dentists, about which he was worried, this, too, is in turn primarily a function of the Department of National Education. As the Department of Health we can only be a department which pleads in this respect. We are intensely concerned with the effects, for should it not be done efficiently enough, we will not get the medical services which we want in the country.</p>

<p>I took note of everything said by hon. members. I want to express my sincere thanks for the support of the Opposition and for the contributions made on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Motion agreed to.</p>
