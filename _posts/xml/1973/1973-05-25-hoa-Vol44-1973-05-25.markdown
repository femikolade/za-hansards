<p>Amendment in Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is the amendment which hands over to the Minister of Sport and Recreation the control of the administration of this Act, the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister would give us the benefit of his reasons for doing so, and tell us whether this has been agreed to by the Minister of Sport and Recreation. In other words, I should like to know what is in fact behind this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the whole idea here is that this sport normally falls under the Minister of Sport and Recreation in any case, and the Cabinet has, therefore, decided that this section of the work of the Police Department should also be transferred to the Department of Sport and Recreation.</p>

<p>Amendment in Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I read with very great interest the statements made by the hon. the Deputy Minister about the amendment which he was going to introduce in the Senate. It just so happened, of course, that during the course of the debate in this House, I pointed out to the hon. the Deputy Minister and to the House that the Orange Street campus of the University of Cape Town would be included in the defined area. I must say that at the time this evinced no dismay from either the Government or the official Opposition, which was supporting this Bill.</p>

<p>We are &#x201C;playing&#x201D; politics, let me tell the hon. member; we are in the House for political purposes. As I say, Sir, this evinced no dismay from either the official Opposition or the Government. I moved an amendment in the Committee Stage which attempted to reduce the defined area. Admittedly me amendment was somewhat more extensive. It did not only cover the campus, but it certainly included the Orange Street campus, the City campus of the University of Cape Town. Of course, there was no support for that amendment and nobody even moved a reduced amendment, shall we say, simply to limit the defined area in such a way as to exclude the campus of the university. Now the Deputy Minister comes along and tells the Other Place that the principal of the University of Cape Town has expressed his misgivings that the wide definition of &#x201C;gatherings&#x201D; would interfere with normal academic and day-to-day activities on the campus.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but the hon. the Deputy Minister is saying that I must read the whole of his speech and I am saying that I am trying to confine myself to the amendment which was moved in the Senate. The hon. the Deputy Minister can read his own speech when he replies to me.</p>

<p>The Orange Street campus, incidentally, as was pointed out at the time by the university principal, includes the Michaelis School of Art and the Drama School of the University of Cape Town, and students, in the normal cause of their academic work, gather in groups on that campus. This is why, of course, the principal of the university was so dismayed at the inclusion of the Orange Street campus in the Bill. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that he did not share Sir Richard Luyt&#x2019;s view that the normal day to day activities on the campus would be affected by the Bill. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, may I please ask for a little quiet&#x003F; I cannot talk above this noise behind me.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Sir. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that such a deduction could not be made if the Bill was read in context, and he went on to say that it was clear that the Bill dealt with particular types of meetings that had become well known. That was his reply to Sir Richard Luyt. Sir, I had occasion during the earlier discussions on the Bill to tell the Deputy Minister something which he should have known, and that is that he cannot pass legislation and then decide that he will exclude certain people from its effects by requests or directions to the Police, and now we have another such example of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s lack of understanding about the functions of this Legislature. Surely, the functions of our Legislature are to make the laws, and the function of the Police is to enforce the laws, to ensure that the laws are obeyed, and the function of the courts is to decide whether there has in fact been an infringement of the law; in other words, to interpret the law.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not necessary; we have heard all that. The hon. member must confine her remarks to the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, as a matter of fact, this House has not heard the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reasons for introducing the amendment. He gave his explanation to the Other Place, and we are now being asked to pass the amendment, which was passed in the Other Place and for which an explanation has been given there but not in this House. I am trying to analyze the reasons for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introduction of that amendment in the Other Place, and I am going to try my best to confine myself to this particular point. Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister, having accepted that Sir Richard Luyt&#x2019;s reservations may perhaps have some <span class="col_7499-7500" refersTo="page_0817"/>grounds, has moved an amendment to the definitions clause, and the amendment states that a gathering now means&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any assembly, concourse, or procession of any number of persons &#x2026;</block>

<p>And here is the amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; relating to or arising out of any demonstration.</block>

<p>I would like to mention at this juncture that the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s interpretation of the amendment which he has moved in the Other Place and which he now asks us to confirm here, is open to different interpretations, and the important thing is whether a gathering is distinctly separate from a demonstration. I do not know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister considers that it is distinctly separate from a demonstration, because if it is distinctly separate from a demonstration&#x2014; and it seems to me that he must consider it to be so, for he has two different definitions, one for a &#x201C;demonstration&#x201D; and one for a &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;, which he is now amending&#x2014;then it seems to me that all that is now being banned, on the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, is a gathering that arises out of a demonstration, but any other gathering, be it a political or a protest meeting, which does not arise out of a demonstration, is no longer illegal. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister will apply his mind to that by re-defining &#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, I wish the hon. the Deputy Minister would give his attention to me just for five minutes. The hon. the Deputy Minister is asking me to put the question again, so I will do so. Is a gathering quite distinct from a demonstration&#x003F; I assume that it is, for there are two different definitions. Under the new definition of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;, if it is distinct from a demonstration, it now appears to me that a gathering, which is a political meeting or a protest meeting, which does not arise out of or relate to a demonstration, is a legal meeting.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, I thought the hon. the Deputy Minister said &#x201C;No&#x201D;. I would like the hon. the Minister to explain to us, when he replies to the debate, whether there is a definite distinction between &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; and &#x201C;demonstration&#x201D; and whether the interpretation which has been given to me by legal counsel is correct, and that is that all meetings now which do not arise out of demonstrations are in fact legal as a result of the amendment which he has introduced in the Other Place. It would be very nice indeed if that were so. Sir, he also informed the Other Place that the Bill, as amended, would now extend to bystanders watching a demonstration; and whether or not they have a common purpose is again something which will have to be decided in the courts of law, but if the hon. the Minister is correct, Sir, how absurd to extend to innocent spectators a Bill of this nature, which will turn them into criminals for watching a demonstration!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! What bearing has that on the amendment&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the hon. the Minister explained in the Other Place that as a result of the amendment which he was moving, innocent bystanders would now be included in those persons who could be arrested for watching a demonstration. Before that, Sir, it applied only to persons who were taking part in the demonstration, but now anybody who happens to stop to watch a demonstration, which has not been declared legal, for which a permit has not been granted&#x2014;and I do not know how a bystander is going to know whether the demonstration he is watching is one for which the Chief Magistrate may have granted a permit or not&#x2014;will have to hurry on about his business, otherwise he is going to run the risk of being arrested. I wonder if the hon. the Minister will explain to us the purpose of extending this to persons watching demonstrations.</p>

<p>Sir, the principal of the University of Cape Town has rightly stated that the Bill, <span class="col_7501-7502" refersTo="page_0818"/>even as amended, is ill-suited to the normal activities of a university, and he has also stated that he is unaware of any evidence having been produced to establish that activities on the Orange Street campus have ever threatened the dignity or the safety of Parliament, with which statement, of course, I heartily concur. No evidence had been produced to that effect, and hon. members sitting here today have not the slightest notion of what is going on on the Orange Street campus right at this moment, and even that now historic character, the messenger boy of the hon. member for Durban North &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 13, after &#x201C;demonstration&#x201D;, to add &#x201C;and shall not include any gathering taking place on the property of the University of Cape Town bordering on Orange Street and Government Avenue&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This will have the definite effect of specifically excluding from the purview of this Bill the Orange Street campus of the University of Cape Town. Sir, I am quite sure that I will have the support of the official Opposition in this regard, since at least two members intimately concerned with the University of Cape Town, that is to say, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Gardens, were themselves perturbed that the Orange Street campus of the university should fall within the purview of the Bill which they supported earlier on.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to enlighten the House on the amendment which it is considering now. My personal opinion was&#x2014;and this is how I explained it in the Other Place&#x2014;that the Bill, as it read previously, stated what Parliament wanted to state, but there nevertheless appeared, to be a slight possibility that our meaning would have been subject to interpretation by the courts, which is of course perfectly normal, I wanted to try and reflect in the Bill quite clearly and precisely what we had intended here in Parliament; and we never intended that people who have nothing whatsoever to do with a demonstration, should be included in the concept of &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;. Therefore the law advisers recommended to me that the following words be inserted: &#x201C;gathering means any assembly, concourse or procession of any number of persons relating to or arising out of any demonstration&#x201D;. In other words, all that happens here, is that the definition of &#x201C;demonstration&#x201C; is linked to &#x201C;gathering&#x201D;. There is a <i>nexus,</i> a connection between &#x201C;gathering&#x201D; and &#x201C;demonstration&#x201D;. This is really the only effect that amendment has, and to my mind this will mean that people who assemble as a result of a demonstration, even though they themselves may not be demonstrating, would then&#x2014; because there is a <i>nexus</i> between them and the demonstrators and because they come to a halt on account of a demonstration &#x2014;be committing an unlawful deed in the area which is to be regarded as being protected for the activities of the public.</p>

<p>With regard to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton, I just want to tell you, Sir, that it was given to me for consideration a quarter of an hour before the House met. I want to tell the hon. member that, as far as this measure <span class="col_7503-7504" refersTo="page_0819"/>is concerned, I was quite prepared to consider any reasonable amendment so that we could give effect to precisely what Parliament had wanted. I had quite an open mind to try and establish precisely what Parliament wanted, and I was quite prepared to consider amendments in that light. But this amendment was only given to me a quarter of an hour before the time. In spite of the fact that it was given to me on such short notice, I examined the amendment and established that, if it were allowed, the effect of it would be that a gathering on university campuses would be allowed, even though it is associated with a demonstration. In other words, if a demonstration takes place on the university grounds and a great many students start milling about there, even though they themselves do not form part of the demonstration, they would, according to the amendment moved by this hon. member&#x2014;be excluded. Why they should be excluded while the rest of the public is not excluded is difficult for me to understand. I was under the impression that students claim to be just at full-fledged members of the public. Under these circumstances, I am therefore not prepared to accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>When I started last night I mentioned that three matters had dominated the year as far as the Department of Sport was concerned, firstly the appointment of the new Minister; secondly, the inadequacies of the strange Government policy in regard to sport which <i>inter alia</i> led to the putting off of the New Zealand tour; and, thirdly, the South African Games. I started with the hon. the Minister. I wanted very much to ascertain his attitude to keeping politics out of local sport in general and out of White sport in particular. I think many of us feel that politics plays perhaps too great a part in the life of South Africans in general and I think we are all united in the view that there is one sphere from which politics should surely be kept, and that is sport. We therefore make a strong plea, all of us, that politics should be kept out of out sport, and that the best man should be chosen to run our sport and to administer it. Let us find unity in our sport where there are many factors which do divide us. It has been a unifying factor in the past. Let it be so in the future. But it will require a conscious effort to keep it out, because politics is so insidious, whether it comes from one side or the other. I say that in some sports damage has already been done. I have here an article which indicates a well-planned campaign to gain control of sport in South Africa in the interest of politics in general, and of Nationalist Party politics in particular. I say at once that it is an article by Mr. J. H. P. Serfontein which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> [Interjections.] I ask hon. members to weigh what is stated in this article on its merits. I believe it is clear that the writer had in his possession, when he wrote this, several secret Broederbond circulars on the subject of sport. [Interjections.] I want hon. members to read this article before they laugh so hilariously. For their information, I may tell them that it was dated the 22nd October. 1972. This article and the contents of it have never been denied by anyone, neither by the Broederbond nor by anybody else. I want to say that having read it, I firmly believe it to be true. Indeed, in so far as I have knowledge it accords with what I know about the matter. [Interjections.] I want to say again that one knows the harm and the suspicion that arise in sport if this sort of thing is true. Now, Sir, I have a great admiration and respect and liking for my Afrikaans-speaking fellow countryman, whether he is Sap or Nat, and I hope that my actions have shown it. I think that anyone who knows the great peoples from whom the Afrikaans-speaking people of this country have descended, and <span class="col_7505-7506" refersTo="page_0820"/>knows their history and achievements of Afrikaans-speaking people cannot but share this admiration. I have great admiration too for the cultural bodies of the Afrikaans-speaking people, and one admires them if one sees how many aspects of life they foster and what their achievements are. But when one finds that a body of the importance of the Broederbond apparently has plans to force sport into politics, then I say we must call a halt to it. This is a cancer in our life. I therefore want to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude is. Does he know of the existence of these circulars&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2026; because this article speaks for itself. There is a great deal in this article which I should perhaps read to hon. members&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A circular of 1970 spelt out to Broederbonders the urgency for Afrikaners to play a far greater part in the administration of sport. The main reason was that sport was becoming a great political issue.</block>

<p>The article now quotes the actual words of the circular&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;In our case sport has important complications with regard to our national and international relations. Therefore it is vital that Afrikaners should play to a greater extent an active role in the control of the various sports. Divisions and individual friends are therefore requested to give special attention to the sports clubs in their areas.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The article continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Broeders were told about the beautiful progress by Afrikaners to win control of rugby, athletics and gymnastics.</block>

<p>Then it quotes again:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;But this did not come by itself; it was achieved by Afrikaners who had exerted themselves in junior positions and who had later joined forces on a national basis.&#x201D; [Interjections.]</block>

<p>Therefore I say that where the hon. the Minister assumes his new portfolio as Minister of Sport, he must give me and the country a full answer on this whole question and on his attitude to this whole matter.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>If he does not do that today, I urge him to lay the portfolio of Sport, which he has just taken up down tomorrow.</p>

<p>This Government, and the hon. the Prime Minister in particular, never stop accusing others of bringing politics into sport. The accusation is further that in doing so, the object is to exclude South Africa from sport. I will be the first man to stand with the Prime Minister in opposing that. However, if the hon. the Minister of Sport and his Government today are not prepared to condemn and promise to do all they can to root it out, then I say that this will be the most blatant example of hypocrisy that I have yet met.</p>

<p>I want to get on to the second matter with which I want to deal, and I shall have to hurry. I believe that this year has shown once again the inadequacies of the Government&#x2019;s <span class="col_7507-7508" refersTo="page_0821"/>strange sport policy. I do not want to pretend that it is easy for South Africa in sport. In some sports it is very difficult, particularly in soccer and the Olympic games. There are many Afro-Asians there and communists who, for political reasons, are against us. But in regard to the IOC, that almost minor United Nations, we were only put out by 35 to 28 votes and therefore we have many friends. In other sports like tennis, cricket and rugby we have many friends. It therefore depends upon the countries that are on the international bodies. The task of the Government is to help the sportsmen in other countries to keep their relations with us and win over further friends. The Government should help to make that possible in every possible way. Therefore it is most galling that this Government, by its actions and blunders, should make it so difficult, and that South Africa and South African sport should suffer as it has. So often we get too little from this Government too late in this regard. Remember that once you are out, it is doubly difficult to get back, and it adds to the difficulties in the field of other sports if one suffers. There was a time indeed when the Nats refused to make any changes at all. They said that it would involve integration at club level. That myth has been exploded now, of course, because we have made progress in regard to tennis and other sports. In some sports, of course, it is permitted today to pick teams on merit, for example, in tennis and golf, and this has proved advantageous to us. In other words, in those sports the sportsmen&#x2019;s wishes have been allowed to govern the position. But cricket and rugby remain the Cinderellas. No less a person than the Prime Minister said that in regard to rugby and cricket there would be no mixed teams representing South Africa. He said that he took full responsibility. Then I ask him today to take his big share of responsibility for the cancellation of the recent tour to New Zealand. There are many lessons to be learnt from this and the first is the danger for our international sport when Governments interfere. I condemn the action of the New Zealand Prime Minister in interfering. He did it for political reasons, too. He said it was in the interests of his country. I am quite certain that that tour could have gone on through New Zealand with perhaps some disturbances, but, in general, satisfactorily, had he been prepared to accept us. But our Government made itself guilty of interfering in sport; it made itself guilty when it said that our team had to be White. Our sportsmen apparently wanted to pick the team on merit. Indeed they went to Pretoria to plead to be allowed to pick the team on merit. But we know that nothing came of that plea. We know that there were hopeful signs in the Nationalist Press and we know that those signs were linked with the hon. the Minister of Sport.</p>

<p>A second lesson that we must learn is that the Government must let this policy of theirs unfold much more quickly than it is happening. We know that the hon. member for Johannesburg West is confident that South Africa will be able to tour New Zealand at some future time. We know also from the Prime Minister of New Zealand that this can only happen if our team is chosen on merit. In other words, the Government, according to the opinion of the hon. member for Johannesburg West, is going to unfold its policy to make this possible. I say, if they have no principle standing in the way, why must they delay it and cause such damage to our rugby&#x003F; Our charge therefore is that the tour was lost and that no fundamental principle was at stake. The hon. the Minister had a chance to make a great name for himself because when he took over the rugby people had already seen the danger signals flashing. The danger signals were flashing not when the present Prime Minister of New Zealand came into office, but already in the time of the previous Prime Minister. The previous Prime Minister of New Zealand said it would make it a great deal easier for the tour to New Zealand to take place if we would pick the team on merit. The rugby people saw the dangers; they went to Pretoria. The Minister made hopeful signs which were reported in the Press, but he was unable to persuade the Cabinet. The Cabinet stuck to its strange policy. I say that the hon. the Minister has lost an opportunity to make a niche for himself in history and get the Government to change its policy. The words of the hon. the Minister were these&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s existing sports policy remained unchanged and people who believe that overseas agitation would decrease if concessions were made were living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>He says: Of course. It shows that he does not understand <span class="col_7509-7510" refersTo="page_0822"/>the whole atmosphere in which he is conducting his portfolio. When we are dealing with New Zealand we are not dealing with whether agitation will decrease. It is a case of whether the New Zealand Government will want us to come and whether the New Zealand sportsmen will want us to come. Of course we are going to have criticism round the world and agitation from demonstrators wherever we play sport. But we don&#x2019;t look to those people. It is to our friends and our potential friends that we must look. The hon. the Prime Minister followed up that statement of August by himself on the 13th September saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our policy would not change now or in the future.</block>

<p>Those are very brave words and very stupid words I venture to say and are already refuted by what the hon. member for Johannesburg West has said. The hon. the Minister of Labour made the even more typical Nationalist utterance on the subject on the 16th September. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We cannot make concessions here, i.e. White and non-White South Africans playing together, because the matter affects the basis of our existence.</block>

<p>This is what we are told. We were told this when it was asked whether the Maoris could come. We are told this again by this Minister. I say that unless the hon. the Minister will change and improve his policy South Africa will suffer further in this regard. One of their own papers <i>Rapport,</i> said that the crucial thing today in sport is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dis &#x201E;een land, een span&#x201D; en klaar.</block>

<p>That is the way <i>Rapport</i> put it and I urge hon. members opposite to face up to that or to face up to exclusion from international sport. If ever a political party had to be dragged into the 20th century it is the Nationalist Party in regard to Bantu affairs and in particular in regard to sport. It is a party that we are having the privilege but also the burden of dragging into the 20th century in these regards. We shall persist in doing it and we shall go on doing it until the get them into better shape.</p>

<p>If time permits I should like to take up the statement which the hon. the Minister made when the tour had been called off. I want to say that the statement he made then shows a degree of irritation and annoyance which has no place in the handling of our sport affairs. Let him decide and let Nationalists decide what their principles are. If they are prepared to have their tennis and their golf teams picked on merit why not rugby&#x003F; Don&#x2019;t let their future actions be coloured by irritation and annoyance of what the New Zealand Prime Minister did.</p>

<p>I also want to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us how his policy is going to unfold and to take us into his confidence and to take the country into his confidence as to what his future intentions are so that we may know. I hope he will view with favour the plea by the president of the S.A. Cricket Association that they should be allowed to pick their team on merit and on the basis that was set out by the president, namely in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s policy on a multi-national basis. The effect would be that they would be able to pick a South African team on merit. We urge the Government to adopt this. Cover it in as many words as you like. Use whatever fig-leaves you like. Let us get to the position that is sensible for South Africa, which is accepted in South Africa and which is required by the world, namely that South Africa be represented by a team chosen on merit.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the short time left I want to move to the South African Games. Let me say at once that we were delighted that these Games took place and that they went off without a hitch.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that. We of course encouraged it. We <span class="col_7511-7512" refersTo="page_0823"/>said long ago that this sort of thing could be done without any risk. But we were not believed then. We were quite certain it would go well. And, for the information of the hon. member for Pietersburg, the Games would have been even more successful under our policy. Let me give him one example. The soccer teams which were supposed to have come from Britain and Brazil pulled out. Why&#x003F; They pulled out because our South African soccer team, under this rigid Government policy, had to be on a basis of communities and they then pulled out. How much better would it not have been had we seen those Games crowned by Brazil or by England playing a whole South African team, as they do in tennis&#x003F; It would have been a case of all pulling together. We have got to pull together in South Africa. But that did not happen. I give credit to the hon. the Minister. He did have one recommendation to make. He did agree that when those teams pulled out that the communities could play one another. It was not in accordance with Government policy. In fact the whole essence of Government policy was that you had to have foreign teams to play them. But it was sense and we applauded it. I say so again today.</p>

<p>This thing of multi-nationalism is purely a label, it is a fig leaf. These Games were not run in accordance with Nationalist theory. We did not have the Zulus, the Xhosas and Tswanas playing; we had a Bantu soccer team. It was not in accordance with Government policy. Nobody can think that. But we do not resent it. If the Government would make advances we would be only too glad to cover it by any fig leaf they care to name if it would make them happy. Had they insisted to the world that the Games had to be run in accordance with apartheid, we would not have had one foreign visitor there. It was only because the foreign visitors believed that they were not going to be run in accordance with apartheid&#x2014;and it was not in accordance with the ideology of apartheid&#x2014;that they came. I say again that the important thing is that the Games took place. It was a wonderful thing for race relations. The hon. the Minister said that. Let him take it to heart.</p>

<p>The fact that there was goodwill on all sides was proof that we could play in a good spirit together. We were playing as equals and we were competing as equals. The common humanity of the various peoples of South Africa was approved and realized. But I want to ask in conclusion: What of the future&#x003F; Has the hon. the Minister had requests for a repeat performance of some of the things that took place at the South African Games&#x003F; What is his answer going to be&#x003F; If for example a soccer team would like to repeat that which was done there, perhaps once a year, is he going to approve of it&#x003F; Are we going to have to wait for another South African Games with a great expenditure of money, before some of the highlights of the Games can be repeated&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. the Minister what his plans are in order to allow all South Africans to take their rightful place in sport. We on this side of the House have shown the way. Under our policy the people will take their rightful place. We ask this Minister to get closer to our policy in which case South Africa can hope to flourish in sporting affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before dealing with some of the arguments raised by the hon. member for Pinelands, I should like to pay tribute to the hon. Frank Waring, the previous Minister of Sport and Recreation. Mr. Waring was appointed as the first Minister of Sport and Recreation at a very difficult time for South African sport, and for South Africa at large. At that time even members on that side of the House objected to the creation of a Department of Sport. But, Sir, Mr. Frank Waring proved himself to be always a good sportsman and a good South African. He was always prepared to play the game. Perhaps he was not loved by that side of the House, but that was for reasons other than sport. We on this side of the House enjoyed working with Mr. Waring &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, obviously that hon. member has never himself had the opportunity of crossing swords with Mrs. Waring. I want to place on record the fact that we on this side of the House appreciate the services of Mr. Frank Waring as Minister of Sport.</p>

<p>*At the same time, Mr. Chairman, I should like to extend my congratulations to Dr. the hon. Piet Koornhof on his appointment as Minister of this department. I particularly want to congratulate him on <span class="col_7513-7514" refersTo="page_0824"/>the way he is handling this department. I want to congratulate him on his energetic approach and on the progress which has been made, not for the sake of politics, but for the sake of sport as such. I want to refer, Sir, to two particular matters. In the first place I want to refer to the recent South African Games, which were virtually a culmination of sporting activities in this country. In that regard the hon. the Minister and his department played a quiet but in fact a dominant role. I want to congratulate them on the way those Games were presented. Those who had the privilege of being spectators at the Games, will agree that they could be compared with the best in the world. I trust that these South African Games will become so popular all over the world in future that we shall find it difficult to cope with everyone who will want to come here on the next occasion. I also want to thank the hon. the Minister for the exceptional insight displayed by him as far as the development of sporting facilities is concerned. I am referring to the allocation on principle of an annual amount to every province and to local authorities for the development of local sporting facilities.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, Sir, I want to come back to the hon. member for Pinelands. The hon. member really disappointed me this morning and last night. He simply repeated his speech of last year; he had nothing new to say. He even repeated the old stories of the late Senator Conroy about the Broederbond. I know the hon. member as a very good South African and as a very keen sportsman, but I am afraid to say that when it comes to politics and when he mixes his politics with sport, he is not in a position to evaluate properly the situation of sport in South Africa against the background of world sport. Apart from starting off by asking the hon. the Minister to keep politics out of sport, what did the hon. member actually do&#x003F; Seventy-five per cent of his speech was concerned with political issues; he brought politics right into sport. This is what the hon. member said last night&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The department&#x2019;s activities were dominated by the fact that the Government&#x2019;s sports policy has again, I believe, been shown to be inadequate to deal with our situation and indeed, highly harmful, as was further illustrated by the calling off of the Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask the hon. member this: Does he really believe that the sports policy of this Government was responsible for the calling off of the tour to New Zealand&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg West said so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, let me remind the hon. member, in spite of what he said here last night and today, and in spite of his comments in the newspapers just after the cancellation of the tour, that it is common knowledge that the New Zealand Rugby Council stuck to their guns all the time. I wish to pay tribute to them for this. Until this very moment they are still prepared to receive a South African Springbok rugby team. They did not ask us to hold mixed trials, to select a team on merit and that sort of nonsense. They invited the South African Rugby Board to send over a Springbok rugby team.</p>

<p>*After all, Mr. Chairman, any sober-minded person who has made a study of the situation knows where the problems arise. Surely they arise with those who have chosen sport as a field for terrorism&#x003F; They arise with the extortionists there in New Zealand. It may be a good thing to tell the hon. member what the standpoint of these extortionists is. I quote from a report of 28th February this year in this regard (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are two organizations which have exerted themselves to have the tour cancelled, &#x201C;even though 28 Coloureds and 2 White players were selected for the Springbok team it would still be undisguised cheating, nor would it save the Commonwealth Games, because the Black countries would see through it&#x201D;. So said Mr. David Wycham, the Auckland organizer of HART, the organization which opposes the proposed tour by a Springbok team.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then he went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another anti-apartheid movement said it would oppose the 1973 tour even though mixed tests were held in South Africa.</block>

<p>Sir, did these people not show that they had the power in their hands to pressurise that Government into an impossible position so that they had to cancel the tour&#x003F; <span class="col_7515-7516" refersTo="page_0825"/>But what is more, we have now repeatedly debated the point with the hon. member for Pinelands that the demand&#x2014;not the requirement, but the demand&#x2014;which is made by these terrorists, and which sometimes finds acceptance among responsible organizations in sporting circles, does not seek to achieve, as the hon. member believes, the selection of a representative team to represent the country; it seeks to achieve mixed sport being played in South Africa right down to the lowest level. Now I want to put a question to the hon. member. Last year he denied it in respect of cricket and the M.C.C.&#x2019;s standpoint until the hon. member for Houghton had to point it out to him; she was in London herself when those matters were discussed at that time.</p>

Here is the evidence from all sides that a relentless demand was made. What was the difficulty in the case of the Olympic Games&#x003F; We obtained permission to go to Mexico, and the hon. member also blames the Government&#x2019;s sports policy for the fact that we were unable to take part in the Olympic Games.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, for the first time since I have been in this House I find myself able to agree with certain things said by the hon. member for Stellenbosch. Firstly, he wished the previous Minister of Sport luck in his retirement. I want to say that we join him; we also wish the previous Minister the very best of luck and health in his retirement. Then the hon. member went on to congratulate the present Minister of Sport, and I say that we on this side also wish him everything of the best in handling what I believe is going to be a very difficult portfolio. The hon. member then went on to discuss the Games. I will also, in the course of my speech, speak about the Games, so I leave the hon. member there.</p>

<p>Sir, before I say anything else, I would like to compliment the officials of the Department of Sport for having drawn up a very neat annual report and to thank them for placing it on the Table timeously.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to comment just very briefly on a few points contained in the report. Firstly, I want to say that it is very pleasing indeed that under the department&#x2019;s policy of sponsoring projects for coaches, participants and administrators, the number rose from 140 in 1971 to 651 in 1972. Mr. Chairman, this is, <b>of</b> course, very important, because all of us who are connected with sport appreciate the fact that the very basis of maintaining sport of any sort at a high level depends on good administration and good coaching, and I would, like to say to the hon. the Minister that I would like to see the total number of projects increased even further in the year to come.</p>

<p>Sir, I am very pleased, too, to say that the report reveals that the Government is continuing with its policy to assist the national bodies controlling sport in South Africa to bring out experts in the fields of <span class="col_7517-7518" refersTo="page_0826"/>various sports. We know how important this is, Mr. Chairman, because these people bring along their considerable knowledge, and their lectures on sport benefit South Africa enormously. Let me say that this is doubly important in South Africa today while all the sporting bodies here have their problems in regard to international sport.</p>

<p>Then, finally, in regard to the report, I want to say that I am very pleased indeed to see that the department is assisting local authorities to build indoor sports venues in South Africa. I think everyone will agree that there is a paucity of indoor venues throughout South Africa. I do not think that we have a really decent indoor sports venue anywhere in South Africa, and we know that there are certain types of sport that have to be played indoors. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to use his influence with the Cabinet to see that a larger amount of money is set aside for this purpose, because with the very high cost of building today the amount set aside here will not go very far. Sir, there is no doubt in my mind that the most important and the most significant event in the sporting calendar of 1973 was the South African Games held in Pretoria. I believe very sincerely that those Games were not only a victory for sport but most certainly also a victory for race relations in South Africa. Here we had a sporting function and at this function we had sportsmen and sportswomen of all races competing with and against each other under conditions of complete equality. It was pleasing to note that the inherent fear which had always been there under the surface that multi-racial sport at any level would be liable to cause race friction, was completely dispelled. I want to say that, because I was connected with a certain sport which was part of the Games, I had a very good opportunity to observe things at close quarters. I want to say that what happened at the Rand Stadium at Johannesburg was truly a revelation. There for a week and for the first time in the history of South Africa, we had a soccer tournament in which all the races in South Africa were allowed to compete. During that week we had attendances of more than 100 000 people and on two occasions we had a capacity crowd of 40 000 people at the Rand Stadium. This is a significant fact, that during this whole week there was not a single insident surrounding the players taking part in that tournament, and during that week the Police, who I must say did a very, very fine job throughout the Games, were not called upon at any stage to remonstrate with or act against a single spectator. Sir, this is very pleasing indeed and I believe that it shows that when people get together with the idea of playing sport, then they go there for that particular purpose. I think, too, that the hon. the Minister must be satisfied now that the sports administrators in South Africa are very responsible people and I think he will admit that they played a great part in making the Games such a success. I want to say this to the hon. the Minister in all seriousness. He has told us on one or two occasions that the policy of the Nationalist Party is not a rigid policy but a policy which is evolving. I want to say to him that after the great success of these Games, I believe the time has now arrived where he should try to remove an anomaly. This of course is the anomaly which makes it possible for certain sports to be played where they have the opportunity of selecting their teams on merit, while on the other hand the three major sports is South Africa, rugby, cricket and soccer, are not given like opportunities. I believe that the hon. the Minister has his feet on the ground and that he accepts with us that until such time as we are in a position to select our teams on merit for international purposes we will have problems in regard to international sport. I believe that after what happened in Pretoria and Johannesburg, the Government must feel that the people of South Africa are now prepared most certainly to accept sport at national and international level, and the ball is now truly at the feet of the Government. I am hoping, and I am certain that every sport lover in South Africa is also hoping, that things will be done in the near future to allow sport in South Africa again to take its rightful place internationally. I say this&#x2014;and I am not bringing politics into it&#x2014;because I honestly believe that there is not a single person in South Africa who would not like to see the Springbok colours again being shown all over the world. We as sports administrators can do our part but we can only do so much, and I believe that it is now up to the Government to act in a positive way and to assist South Africa to get back into international sport.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to compliment the hon. member for Johannesburg North on the positive speech he made today. I regret that I am unable to say the same of the hon. the shadow Minister of Sport of the party opposite. That <span class="col_7519-7520" refersTo="page_0827"/>hon. member had many complaints about the so-called political interference in sport by this side of the House, but the hon. member had half an hour at his disposal, as has become customary every year, and he himself spoke nothing but politics. I should be pleased if the hon. member could mention to me just one thing which he said for the advancement of sport. [Interjections.] Sir, when we discuss mining, we speak for the advancement of the mining industry, and I believe that when we conduct a debate such as this, then we should speak for the promotion of sport. The hon. member spoke politics all the time, but accused this side of the House of political interference in sport. This is a na&#x00EF;vet&#x00E9; which I really find difficult to excuse.</p>

<p>The hon. member very clearly charged the hon. the Minister with the Springbok tour to New Zealand having had to be cancelled as a result of the policy of this side of the House. If the hon. member was being sincere when he said that&#x2014;I must accept that&#x2014;then to me that is further proof of na&#x00EF;vet&#x00E9; in that the hon. member still believes that nothing more than the selection of a team was involved. After all, that is not so. No matter how many non-Whites we included, the tour would not have taken place. I want to give the hon. member one example. He must realize that it is not we who are pronouncing judgment here. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apartheid is logical and there is nothing wrong with it, Dr. Manahi Paewai, a Maori leader and former rugby player of New Zealand, said here. &#x201C;It makes me angry when I hear people say that the Springbok tour must not go ahead because of apartheid&#x201D;, he said in an interview with a local newspaper. He said there was nothing wrong with apartheid. It was logical and it was what the non-Whites in South Africa wanted. It was what they were applying among themselves.</block>

<speech by="#vorster">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>I quote further from the report (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Paewai who visited South Africa recently, said that he felt that he was fully qualified to comment on apartheid. The people in New Zealand who were using their own interpretation of apartheid to prevent the tour through New Zealand, simply did not know what they were talking about.</block>

<p>This is the judgment pronounced by a non-White who is very intimately concerned with this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member also came forward with another story. I did a little research work in Hansard to see what progress we had made in these debates over the past years. I went no further than to refer to the Hansard of 1972, because there I found that a great deal of what the hon. member said this year, he also said last year. He spoke about our political interference. He spoke about the Broederbond. I wonder why the hon. member did not ask the hon. member for Sea Point to put him right as regards Serfontein&#x2019;s stories in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Has he not heard the speech by the hon. member for Sea Point in this regard&#x003F; To me it is very clear that if we continue in this way and conduct this kind of debate, we shall not be rendering any service whatsoever to sport. I think it has become high time for us to get away from this.</p>

<p>The hon. members opposite have known for years and the whole world knows what the policy of this side of the House is regarding sport. After all, we have stated it repeatedly. Those hon. members attack us, however, but they do not have a policy on sport. Right from the start they have only said, &#x201C;We leave the matter to the sporting bodies&#x201D; and that has been the end of it. However, the hon. member continues to harp on politics and political interference. None of it is true, Sir.</p>

<p>I want to raise a matter which in my opinion is of much greater importance. To be specific, I want to make a plea for scientific research in the field of sport. I shall have to make haste, because I do not have much time left. One has appreciation for what has already been done by individuals and bodies, but we feel that there is a great deal more that could be done in this field in the interests of sport. In the first instance I believe that every athlete and participant in sport&#x2014;here I have in mind sport played by terms&#x2014;should be coached in a way which will enable him to give only of his very best. Then he derives the highest degree of pleasure from it, and it enables him to attain the highest level of achievement. This can only be done under certain conditions. It is necessary to do research into the technique required in certain types of sport. For example, an athlete may be exceptionally strong in his arms, but if he <span class="col_7521-7522" refersTo="page_0828"/>does not know the correct technique of putting the shot, he has no success. But take any other type of sport. We can mention many examples, but unfortunately time does not allow me to go into details. It is necessary to determine the correct diet for a sportsman and a sportswoman. When a person plays a sport, and particularly certain types of sport, energy is consumed at a very high rate. It is necessary to know what is good for the athlete and what will provide him with the required energy, and what could be detrimental to him. It is not always necessary for a participant in sport to try to increase his powers by eating a large steak or anything of that sort. A tremendous amount could be done in this regard in other ways. There is something like psychological preparation, the preparation of the person&#x2019;s frame of mind. This plays a tremendous role, quite apart from his fitness, and due regard must be had to this. Sir, at this point you may ask me, what do I envisage&#x003F; I cannot put it here in detail, but I believe, in the first instance, that provision should be made for the necessary funds to universities, even though not to all of them to establish a chair which could undertake this research work on a scientific basis and from where the knowledge gained in this way, could be carried over to the potential coaches of the future. To begin with things would be difficult, of course, and I believe that if we should take such a step, we should regard it as a total research project on a very wide field. For that reason the establishment of a chair or the provision of facilities at a university may perhaps not suffice; it is possible that we should also have to consider the colleges, to enable us to train as many people as possible at such an institution and to prepare them for their task [Time expired.]</p>

<p>On 10th April this year a group of 30 lecturers and 100 students of the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Norman Kirk, in which they asked him to cancel the tour. I have here the cutting containing the names of the students who took part in this, and I quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, the undersigned, being concerned students and members of staff at the University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, wish to express our full support and solidarity with those people who are peacefully attempting to have the forthcoming tour of New Zealand by the Springbok rugby team cancelled.</block>

<p>These students and lecturers of Pietermaritzburg asked that the tour be cancelled. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Noting the recent decision by the United Nations declaring apartheid to be an international crime, we hereby call on Mr. Kirk and his Government to cancel this tour or postpone it until such time that South African sports teams are chosen on merit from all races.</block>

<p>The latter part is precisely what the hon. member for Johannesburg City has just requested, namely that &#x201C;teams must be chosen on merit&#x201D;. These lecturers and students are resident in the constituency of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City who has just entered the Chamber. There is also the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, who has so much to say and who is not in his place today now that this Vote is being discussed.

<p>Apparently the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City was unaware of what was going on in his own constituency and the hon. member was also unable to keep the students and lecturers in his constituency, Pietermaritzburg, under control. Now I want to ask the chairman of the sports group on that side of the House to bring this fact to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition. To be specific, the fact is that there are hon. members on that side of the House who do not know what his sports policy is and who allow the students and lecturers of Pietermaritzburg to drag politics into sport by requesting that our rugby team should not visit New Zealand. They probably feel very happy about it today. I think that it is time for all the rugby players of Pietermaritzburg and all those good rugby players of the Natal team who have always made a very fine contribution to the composition of a Springbok team, to take note of the fact that this hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City and his colleague, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, have failed miserably in their duty by not taking to task those students who asked Mr. Kirk to cancel the tour to New Zealand. That side of the House is therefore directly instrumental in the cancellation of the rugby tour &#x2026;</p>

Does the hon. member understand that&#x003F; I think that the young men throughout the country who play rugby should take note that one of the basic causes of the cancellation of the Springbok rugby tour to New Zealand is directly attributable to the actions and the laxity of those two hon. members from Pietermaritzburg. That is true and they cannot get away from it. Mr. Chairman, just as we were looking forward to seeing the green and gold run on to the field in New Zealand, so too did a multitude of rugby enthusiasts, not only in New Zealand, but throughout the world. The hon. member for Stellenbosch pointed out how the New Zealand Rugby Board stood fast. But now we have seen this morning in the short debate we have had so far what an egg-dance has been performed by the other side of the House. These people are playing straight into the hands of people like Peter Hain, Sanroc and the sport terrorists whom the hon. member for Stellenbosch referred to. Those hon. members are not consistent. What does this appeal by the hon. member for Johannesburg North that sports teams should be chosen on merit, signify&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want the hon. member to get up after I have resumed my seat and tell us how a Springbok rugby team should be chosen on merit. My argument is that the Springbok rugby team has been chosen on merit through all these years. Now I also want to ask him to get up and tell this House and the rugby-playing world that our Springbok rugby teams have not been chosen on merit in the past. He must spell out and explain to us in detail how they would select a Springbok rugby team on merit in terms of their sports policy. It is the duty of those hon. members. It cannot just remain hanging in mid air like that. The hon. members cannot just talk glibly about the composition of such a team on &#x201C;merit&#x201D;. They must explain it to us in detail, because it is not included here in Sir De Villiers Graaff&#x2019;s &#x201C;United Party&#x2019;s sport policy&#x201D;. They must say quite clearly whether they want sport integration down to club level, or not. Just <span class="col_7525-7526" refersTo="page_0830"/>look how they are deliberating now. The policy of my party is quite clear, i.e. no sport integration on club level; no sport integration on social level; and no sport integration on national level. The Springbok emblem on the green blazer and the green jersey is meant for the White South African. So it will remain, and those hon. members know it. Now that hon. member must tell us what his views on this matter are. It is a tragedy today that we as Whites in this country cannot speak with one voice on the application of our sports policy. It is a tragedy that that side of the House, with their opportunistic approach, should continually succeed in playing into the hands of Peter Hain, Sanroc and the others and by so doing bedevil our sports relations. The sooner they realize that they are bedevilling sports relations in this way, the better it will be. I therefore address an appeal to those hon. members to think before they talk about sport in the way they do.</p>

<p>The hon. member for De Aar said it was not because of the policy of the Government that the tour to New Zealand was wrecked. I should like to quote what was said by the candidate for the Nationalist Party, Mr. Dawie de Villiers at present the hon. member for Johannesburg West, during his election campaign. I quote from the <i>Cape Times</i> of 14th September, 1972&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have no objection in theory that White teams compete against non-White teams on the international level. I cannot agree with the view that sport comes before principle, but I will agree that the Government&#x2019;s policies are probably the cause of all our international sporting troubles.</block>

<p>I hope the hon. member will have the courage to get up here and repeat that.</p>

<p>Sport on the International level has always been an important facet of a country&#x2019;s contact with the outside world. Whereas in days gone by our Springboks were able to represent South Africa with honour and glory at the various Olympic Games or on the rugby, cricket and soccer fields of the world, and, in doing so, were able to win friends for South Africa, today, after 25 years of Nationalist Party Government they are just as isolated as the Republic is on the political level. There is no doubt about the fact that when a sportsman achieves international standard, he wants to compete with citizens of other countries on an international level. It is therefore not surprising that a man such as Marcello Fiasconaro had to become an Italian citizen in order to be able to take part in the Olympic Games at Munich.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The fault of the Government.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that a person such as Danie Malan had to go overseas on his own initiative to take part in international competitions. There are of course sportsmen from other countries who come to South Africa and of course there are some of our people going overseas, but the point is that the doors of the Olympic Games are closed to us. The doors to our traditional cricket, rugby and soccer opponents are also closed. The fact is that the domestic policy of the Nationalist Party Government, which includes its sports policy, is the reason for the isolation of our sportsmen today. Our Springbok rugby players would have received the traditional welcome in New Zealand if the team had been selected on merit, as the United Party policy allows. The National Party Government forced the Prime Minister of New Zealand to intervene in a purely sports matter just as our hon. Prime Minister intervened when he told Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira <span class="col_7527-7528" refersTo="page_0831"/>that he was not allowed to visit South Africa as a selected member of the MCC team. He also closed the door to Arthur Ashe to come here as an individual to take part in our tennis championships. We see what happens when a vigorous politican interferes in sports matters. Politicians are not always the best diplomats we have known. There is one thing South African sportsmen must understand quite well, and that is that as long as a Nationalist Party Government is in power in South Africa, and as long as that Government applies its present policy, South Africa will be discriminated against in the field of sport overseas. As long as it is Government policy that a man like Papwa Sewgolum is allowed to take part in a White golf tournament but must receive his winning price outside the club house, isolation will be our lot. Just as sensible Whites in South Africa fail to understand this kind of folly, so our friends abroad are unable to understand it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Our sportsmen, Mr. Chairman, must decide whether they can continue to tolerate Nat Government interference which prevents them from participating freely in all fields of sport on the international level, and whether they are satisfied with the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s compromise policy of warmed-up international competition at our South African Games, or whether they wish to participate, as in years gone by, freely in international sporting events, as would be the case under a United Party government. In making their choice our sportsmen and sportswomen should remember one thing, and that is that the Nationalist Party Government has been granted many years to get away from the unfortunate sports policy as outlined by Dr. Verwoerd in his Loskop Dam speech, and to change and to adapt its thinking and its policies to the fast-changing modern world. This Government has failed our sportsmen and our sportswomen, just as they have failed to combat the galloping rate of inflation or to win political friends for South Africa. The time is fast running out for us to shed our colour prejudices and to bring about change by evolution. An ominous cloud of complete sport isolation is looming on the horizon and the sportsmen and women must understand that the United Party policy of permitting national teams to be selected on merit, should the controlling bodies request this, is the only policy which will ensure that South Africa will again be accepted with enthusiasm and with open arms by all our erstwhile opponents in the field of international sport.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when listening to what hon. members opposite have to say during the discussion of this Vote, one gets the impression that the Opposition thinks that the only task of the Department of Sport and Recreation is to organize international tours and meetings. If that is the attitude of that side of the House towards this department, I want to tell them that this is a blatant failure to appreciate the services rendered by this department. I shall come back to that later. I just want to dwell for a moment on what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central has just said. I think it is a disgrace for an hon. member to get up in this House and defend the Prime Minister for New Zealand. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central said it was the policy of the National Party Government that compelled the New Zealand Prime Minister to interfere in this tour. Surely, this is absolute nonsense. If the hon. member had watched the Press, he should know that the New Zealand Premier tried to place the ball in our court. We know the Minister of Sport and Recreation did not want to give the New Zealand Prime Minister an opening and that it was New Zealand which eventually cancelled the tour, on their responsibility. We also know what their problems were in that regard. I think hon. members can learn something from one of our young stars of a few years ago, Karen Muir. She said the cancellation of a tour was not the end of the world. That is why we on this side of the House agree with the Prime Minister when he says that we shall win our way back into international sport; we shall not crawl back.</p>

<p>I said it would be a failure to appreciate the work of this department were we only to use it to organize international meetings and tours. I should like to dwell for a moment on one of the major services this department has rendered in the past and is still rendering. I think one of the most colourful schemes ever tackled in South Africa, is the national fitness scheme. In the past few years we have had the Water Year in another sphere, and we have our Green Heritage Year at present; these are ventures with which we agree and like to support, but as far as I am concerned this national fitness scheme is one of the most important ventures in this sphere, because <span class="col_7529-7530" refersTo="page_0832"/>it is an uninterrupted project. Sir, I should like to convey my gratitude and appreciation towards the department for the further development of the National fitness scheme. Last year, during the debate on this Vote, I pleaded that swimming should also be included in the National fitness scheme, and I am grateful that in November last year it was in fact included. Mr. Chairman, when considering this national fitness scheme, we realize that we are also dealing here with a project serving more than one purpose. We have in mind the particularly great value it has to make people familiar with the various types of sport; we have in mind the fruits it may bear and which it is already beginning to bear in regard to &#x201C;Run for your Life&#x201D;, while among the youth in particular the Spring Walks are becoming increasingly popular. We have in mind a twofold purpose in regard to swimming, not only for relaxation and fitness, but also for the possible combating of the exceptionally high number of drownings we have in South Africa. Sir, on the basis of the success already achieved by this national fitness scheme, I want to plead this morning for the further extension of this scheme. Sir, I say that it is a multipurpose scheme. When considering the annual report and one of the photographs taken during one of the Spring Walks and also the &#x201C;Run for your Life&#x201D;, one notices how excited and happy these young people are; and an excited group is a happy group. I think that the possibilities of development in this field are virtually unlimited. I also think that it is virtually impossible to foresee the tremendous results this scheme may have in future. Sir, when talking about a further extension of this scheme, I think gymnastics should be the next sport to be included in this scheme by the department. I think that gymnastics, which is proof of suppleness, is a sport which could become an ever greater source of pride for us in South Africa in future. In passing, Sir, the greatest sporting team which has ever left South Africa, was a group of 140 gymnasts who visited Austria in 1970 to compete there. Sir, I think that if one were to choose a slogan for gymnastics which would link up with or fit in with Run for your Life and Swim for your Life, it could be &#x201C;Suppleness means Vitality&#x201D;. Sir, I believe that through this possibility we should not only be able to increase the ability of our people to work, because suppleness usually denotes an eagerness and an ability to work. Sir, this vitality we could fit in with gymnastics through suppleness, could also assist us in South Africa in our everyday life in speeding up our normal actions and reactions and reflex movements. I think one of the most important factors which is being neglected in South Africa to an increasing extent is that our actions and reactions and reflexes are becoming too slow. May we then express the hope and the desire that the national fitness scheme will in future contribute to an increasing extent towards making us vivacious, eager to work and cheerful. Mr. Chairman, this is another field I also want to emphasize which is another indication to me of the importance of this department; which emphasizes once more the multiple aims of this department with its various types of sport.</p>

<p>Then I should like to break a lance for two of the less well-known types of sport in South Africa, which are controlled by the South African Amateur Judo Association and the National Amateur Karate Association. I say that these are types of sport which can be used for more than one purpose, and to support this statement I just want to refer to findings in the United State of America, where it has been found that in 43% of all assaults, where fire-arms were not used and where the attacks did not have any serious consequences, the attacker was physically weaker than the person he attacked. Further tests have proved that in 72% of these cases, the attacker subsequently feared a confrontation with the person he had attacked. In other words, the attacker was physically the weaker, and he was successful in his assault attempt only because he caught the victim unawares; that the victim&#x2019;s reaction was too slow and that his self-defence was not what it should have been. But a further investigation in West Germany indicated that 67% of all motor-car accidents could have been avoided if the actions and reactions of the drivers had not been so slow. Here, then, we have two types of sport which concentrate on speeding up one&#x2019;s actions, reactions and reflexes, and here I want to make an appeal that this department, since it has in the past already given tangible aid to the Judo Association and the National Karate Association by way of funds, aid and organization, I want to ask that this aid should be further extended in future and that consideration be given to the possibility of bringing home to our children at our schools, and perhaps even at an earlier stage, the advantages of these particular types of sport. The history of <span class="col_7531-7532" refersTo="page_0833"/>judo can be traced back as far as the seventeenth century, when it was applied in self-defence for the first time. It subsequently developed into a sport which is not only suited to young and old but is also safe for young and old. I think that we are able to succeed in making our children more familiar with these two types of sport in South Africa, this could in future also contribute towards limiting assaults in South Africa, to speeding up the actions and reactions of our youth and of our older people, and when we could perhaps include this later among our gymnastic exercises, where the emphasis lies on the suppleness of body, among our young people, suppleness and a willingness to work among our labourers, I believe that this Department of Sport and Recreation will come into its own because I believe this is one of those departments which can exercise its beneficial influence in most spheres. I just want to conclude with these words. Let our national fitness scheme come into its own, because it is in the hands of a capable Minister with a capable Secretary and an excellent department.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central delivered himself of so many untruths here that it is impossible for me, in the short time at my disposal, to reply to all of them. In the first instance, I should like to reply here to an interjection he made and which he later supplemented by a quotation from a newspaper according to which I had supposedly said that our sports policy was responsible for the rugby tour to New Zealand having been cancelled. Sir, that is the greatest nonsense I have ever heard. [Interjections.] What that article does in fact say, and for which I accept the fullest responsibility, is that it is of course so that it is the policy in South Africa that also the White people in this country have the right to retain their own identity and sovereignty here and that this policy naturally makes us unpopular among those people who are prepared to surrender us to to a Black majority.</p>

<p>As a result of every aspect of this policy&#x2014;whatever adjustments we might make, which would enable these people to overthrow the existing order in South Africa entirely&#x2014;we would not make any headway with our enemies abroad. I should like to reply to what was said by the hon. member for Pinelands. He said that he had read&#x2014;he had read quite correctly&#x2014;that I believed that the day would come when we would be able to undertake tours in New Zealand once again. I, as someone who was privileged to be able to tour there, fully believe this, because I am a positive person and similarly I believe that the day will come when we shall be allowed to participate in the Olympic Games. If the hon. member for Pinelands had read a little more of that article, he would have seen that I had also said that the decisions were not always in our hands. In that same article I stated that we had a policy of multi-nationalism and that we were only prepared to let our sports policy develop within the framework of our policy of multi-nationalism.</p>

<p>Other members have replied adequately to all the negative remarks made by the hon. member for Pinelands. I believe that this has been a debate which has offered ample opportunity for positive contributions to be made in regard to sport in South Africa. I should like to come to a more positive aspect of sport in South Africa. Unfortunately many people still have the approach that in terms of our national interests, sport should not enjoy a very high priority. That is an incorrect approach, an approach which does not take account of the tremendous mental, physical and cultural value of sport. Sport is a powerful means of education. Not only does it have a formative value for the body, but it also has a formative influence on the spirit, on the personality, on the character, on the approach to life and on the attitudes of the people who participate in sport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The hon. member is incapable of thinking about important things or of talking about them.</p>

<p>The Department of Sport and Recreation with its outstanding services, services to which the hon. member for Johannesburg North referred, too, services in respect of coaching, sport research and so on, must also expand these services and by means of programme planning, assist clubs not only to accommodate the crack sportsmen, but also the masses. A dynamic, countrywide, action of youth and sporting bodies under the leadership of the Department of Sport and Recreation could, in the final analysis, measured in terms of spiritual value, achieve a higher price than our gold price at the moment.</p>

<p>I should briefly like to motivate this idea further. Without going into the matter in detail, the fact can be stated that man today, as a result of the reduction in the number of hours worked per week, has more free time than in any other time in the history of mankind. In many respects we are rightly moving from a working community to a free-time community. In our community more time is continually becoming available, time which is not bound to the essential ties of labour. There is also the fact that in our education at home and at school we are so geared for labour which will have to be performed one day, that we fail to prepare people, particularly young people, also to employ their free time meaningfully. Man is as much a consumer of free time&#x2014;and perhaps to an even greater extent&#x2014;as he is of labour time. The limited provision which exists in regard to the spending of free time, leads to the aimless sauntering about of young people, the gadding about and the addition to superficial pleasure. In this regard I believe that the State has a responsibility and that the Department of Sport and Recreation has an exceptional task to perform.</p>

<p>This task can be summed up briefly as follows: Firstly, the value of sport as educative and formative medium must be utilized more effectively. Secondly, greater participation in sport must be promoted.</p>

<p>The ridiculous ignorance of people who still maintain in our day that South Africa, and particularly the young people of South Africa, are sports mad, is shown up adequately by the fact that barely 20% of the young people in the age group 16 to <b>25</b> years take an active part in sport. There is a shocking erosion in participation in sports by the school-leaver. Mass participation must be promoted. Thirdly: Leadership, coaching and research in the field of sport are essential. This must be initiated and developed by the Department of Sport and Recreation. From this it follows that the regional offices as well as the establishment of the department must necessarily be extended. As much attention as possible must be given in the fourth place to family recreation, particularly at this juncture when the disintegration of the family is causing serious concern. Fifthly: More effective use must be made of existing facilities. Here I want to refer particularly to school buildings which often stand like white elephants in our communities after school hours. I am convinced that school buildings, particularly in regard to after-school youth and family recreation, can be utilized much more effectively in the community. In the sixth place: The benefits of the services of the Department of Sport and Recreation must be extended to all population groups. As a result of the exceptional specialization which research, coaching, administration in the field of sport and the financing of sport demand, it goes without saying that the Department of Sport and Recreation must be the logical focus for all the sporting bodies in South Africa. The exceptional services performed by the Department in South Africa can be extended into a grand attempt in the interests of everyone in South Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this has been a very interesting debate, indeed. I believe that we on this side of the House have achieved something today. Firstly, we heard the hon. member for Pretoria District tell the House that it is not because of Government policy that South Africa is isolated in international sport. He gave many other reasons why we are today isolated in world sport. Now his colleague from Johannesburg West tells us that it is because of Government policy that we are isolated. This we have been telling hon. members on that side for 25 years. We are certainly making progress. <span class="col_7535-7536" refersTo="page_0835"/>I yet want to hear hon. members on that side of the House repudiate the indications that the Broederbond is influencing South African sport today. Not one member on that side has yet raised the issue. They have all steered around it, and no one dare deny that the Broederbond is deeply involved in South African sport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, my time is limited.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Today we find ourselves cut off from the outside world as regards international sport&#x2014;so what can we hope for&#x003F; All we can hope for, is to have smaller and more localized teams, such as the London Counties touring our country at the moment; Newport, which is a Welsh team; and the French team who will also be touring South Africa. But as regards international sport, this is out as long as those hon. members are in control of sport in South Africa. We have now come down to the level of provincial sport. This is the best we can now hope for: Provincial teams against visiting clubs, etc., such as those I have mentioned, from the outside world, and most games on the local club level. I would suggest that, seeing the Broederbond is so interested in South African sport, and has so much to say and has such control over our sport, that the Broederbond should choose a Broederbondbokke team. Let us then send this Broederbondbokke team overseas to play against the Welsh, the Irish and London Counties. It would be very easy for them to send a team and I shall tell you why, Sir. They will be able to take along their own referee, the hon. member for Waterberg. Furthermore, when they arrive at their destination, they need never give the names of the members of their team; this is secret! And they need never give the name of the hotel where they are staying because this is definitely secret too! They need not give their telephone numbers either. I believe they will probably go a long way on this account.</p>

<p>The hon. members on that side are celebrating 25 years of government rule. I do not know what they have to celebrate about. Today we do not have a friend in the outside world as far as sport is concerned. International sport is out for us and we find ourselves going deeper and deeper into the morass in this regard. So there is nothing to celebrate at all. We should all know that the best ambassadors any country can have one finds on the sportsfields of international sport. I think we will all agree that our South African sportsmen are second to none. We can challenge any other team in the world and we will prove ourselves to be second to none. However, for our sportsmen to achieve the standard to which they have risen to date in international sport, they must start when they are young boys and girls at school. Therefore we should concentrate on our youngsters at school. However, what do we find&#x003F; On the Border in the Eastern Cape we have an arrangement which has become traditional.</p>

<p>We have amongst our leading schools, Afrikaans-medium and English-medium schools, a day we call Derby Day, a traditional day amongst all Border schools. These Derby Days are arranged between the leading schools in East London, King William&#x2019;s Town and Queenstown. When Rugby Derby Day is arranged, no less than 15 teams are transported from one town to the other to represent their schools. I do not know of any other place in South Africa where this happens on such a scale, but one has always found it in the Border between the schools of East London, King William&#x2019;s Town and Queenstown. [Interjections.] Please listen, man. I want the hon. the Minister to listen too because I want to ask him to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance for a great favour. What has happened since the Budget was introduced&#x003F; The train fares have been increased to such an extent that the 15 teams together with their supporters&#x2014;this is to say the entire school&#x2014;which used to be transported from one town to the other to take part in this traditional Derby Day, with the increased rail fares the whole proposition is no longer feasible or possible. It is the increased train fares which are in the process of killing this traditional Derby Day for all the schools in the Eastern Cape.</p>

<p>What has been the result&#x003F; The parents and many friends of the schools have had to subscribe to buses; they have had to purchase large buses to transport the teams, which have had to cut down costs to a minimum, and it is no longer possible for 15 teams together with their supporters to take part. These buses now add to the heavy traffic on our roads. I am speaking on behalf of many parents, many supporters of rugby, and generally the people in <span class="col_7537-7538" refersTo="page_0836"/>the Eastern Cape, who are very disappointed that the Government has increased the fares for children playing sport, whether it be rugby, cricket, tennis, swimming or athletics. I plead with the hon. the Minister to give this his serious consideration. I feel sure his department will. It is not the case, as the hon. member for Bethlehem mentioned just now, that we are attacking the department; I know he is trying to find a scapegoat for their policies, but no one on this side has ever attacked the department.</p>

<p>Yes, someone is hurling jukskei pins about again. Never mind, I shall return to jukskei. That hon. member wants to know something about jukskei and I shall tell him about it in a moment. I want to tell him about it because then he will know more about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I did not know the sporting bodies in South Africa as I do in fact know them and if I had not had many dealings with bodies such as the Department of Sport and Recreation and the Federation for Youth and Sport in South Africa, the president of which is the chairman of the South African Rugby Union, I would really have thought that the hon. member who has just resumed his seat was speaking the truth. I dissociate myself completely from what he said, i.e. that sport in South Africa is being controlled from outside, and not by the sporting bodies. I dissociate myself entirely from that statement because I am personally involved in a sport which boasts of between 20 000 and 30 000 players. We arrange our own affairs. We arrange our own affairs in such a way that no offence is given to any one involved in other sports.</p>

<p>I want to go further and say that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central dealt the hon. member for Johannesburg West a slap in the face. Instead of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central rising and saying that he took off his hat to the hon. member for Johannesburg West for joining his team mates in foreign parts in standing up to the most shocking antagonism and provocation, and for being a credit to South Africa, and instead of the hon. member rising and paying tribute to countries such as France where there were no demonstrations against and attacks on our Springboks, he disparaged his own colleague here in the House of Assembly. I really cannot understand that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central is keen to know something more about jukskei, but before I tell him more about it, and before I say something about the sound relations which are created not only at home but also among nations through sport, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to the hon. the Minister and the Department of Sport and Recreation for everything they are doing for sport in South Africa. I think it speaks volumes that the Department of Sport and Recreation has awarded 44 merit sport awards, 31 silver medals and 13 bronze medals to sportsmen and sportswomen.</p>

<p>I come now to the department as such. The work of this department covers a very wide field and is in the interests of White as well as non-White sport. I make so bold as to say that the good relations which prevailed recently during the S.A. Games in Pretoria and Johannesburg were largely attributable to the example of the fine spirit which the officials of this department conveyed to the various population groups, to serve our country in a proper way on the level of relations. We thank them very gratefully for that. The department serves as the initiator of sound relations and also as the catalyst and ensures that those sound relations are utilized to the full. Reference has been made so many times in this House to the wonderful atmosphere which prevailed <span class="col_7539-7540" refersTo="page_0837"/>at the South African Games that I want to refrain from saying anything further about it, for it was a good thing and an excellent thing. One appreciates it when this spirit iis constantly conveyed to others.</p>

<p>I want to state that it has been my experience that most sportsmen and sportswomen in the world are keen to compete with South African sportsmen and sportswomen because they know that if they have not competed against our Springbok teams, they have not pitted their strength against the best in the world.</p>

<p>Now I should like to return to the subject which the hon. member for Durban Central is so keen to know more about. Last year I had the privilege of visiting the northern states of the United States of America together with a group of South African sportsmen and sportswomen. It was an experience. It was wonderful. I can state that an unparalleled interest was shown in the South African sportsmen and sportswomen and also in this variety of sport which is as yet a very humble one and which is perhaps not yet very popular in the sportsfields of the House of Assembly. However it is popular elsewhere in our country. If the hon. member for Walmer wishes to, he can play a set with me. I think he will enjoy it thoroughly. Last year we also had a visit from American sportsmen and sportswomen. It is no use my telling these hon. members what they said. Let me read out what they said. With the approval of the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation and of the Interior, I just want to quote an extract from two significant letters. I have a whole file of letters addressed to me. However, those letters do not carry as much weight as these two. I think I ought to read out these two letters to the Committee. A judge from the State of Ohio wrote as follows to the Minister of Sport and Recreation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My only object in writing to you is to tell you that these seven wonderful people made many friends in America and that they were as good as any ambassadors for goodwill as could have been chosen to represent South Africa. Everywhere they went the people loved them, and we hope they will return again and again and that others will also come to visit us. We were treated with the greatest of hospitality while we were in South Africa and I am sure we were not able to measure up in returning it. However, our hearts were right and we felt you ought to know how we felt about it. We loved them all and recognized them as being very high calibre people, intelligent and of great moral strength.</block>

<p>Speaking of great moral strength&#x2014;those good people asked us to demonstrate the game of jukskei on a Sunday. We conveyed to them our viewpoint on that matter and they respected our viewpoint and consequently arranged no Sunday matches for us. I say that this is an indication of what those people thought of us.</p>

<p>There are a few other passages which I could quote from the letter of the hon. judge. This letter was received on 22nd January this year by the hon. the Minister. These people are still thinking of what occurred in August of last year. Here I have another letter which was also addressed to one of our Ministers, namely to Dr. Mulder. This letter was sent by an American mayor to the Minister of the Interior. He said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We exchanged games together. We lived together. We have even worked together as they visited our city councils and various other city endeavours. As I am writing this I have the fond memory of worshipping God together. This delegation from your country has won our peoples&#x2019; hearts and from a city recognized from past history where the signing of the treaty with the Indian tribes in 1793 opening the north west territory for White settlement, and the home of Annie Oakley who was world-known as &#x201C;Little Miss Shurshot&#x201D; and the world commentator Lowell Thomas. This representation from your country and the introduction of your Juskei to America in this proud and humble city can only result in a relationship between our countries of greater love and understanding never before experienced.</block>

<p>Then he said something significant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Participating in a flag-raising with your delegation and your country&#x2019;s flag on our soil along with our American flag will be an experience never to be forgotten.</block>

<p>I can continue by quoting from further extracts, and could really become lyrical about these people&#x2019;s attitude towards the sportsmen and sportswomen of South Africa. But I think I have said enough to <span class="col_7541-7542" refersTo="page_0838"/>indicate to you what a fine spirit prevailed there. Not only did we discover thousands of friends, but we won thousands of friends for White South Africa. It was a great success. Thousands of friends will still turn up in future to prove to you that what I said here is indeed based on well-founded facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member is a leading light in the jukskei world and I am quite certain that his team were a credit to South Africa in the United States. I am just intrigued with one thought in that I wondered whether the hon. member could tell us whether that team was selected on merit as well. After all it was an international team that went overseas. I therefore do believe that it should have been selected on merit.</p>

<p>I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that I believe that he is deserving of congratulation.

<p>I am listening to the hon. member with great pleasure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; because you have no idea, Mr. Chairman, how much it hurts me as an individual to have to praise anybody associated with the Broederbond. There is no question in anybody&#x2019;s mind that the Pretoria Games were a tremendous success and a great credit to South Africa. It was a milestone in our sport. Of that there can be no doubt. I must temper this thought though, in case the hon. Minister gets a swollen head, and say to him that it took 25 years for the Government to reach the stage where it could hold the Pretoria Games. What we really achieved was merely catching up on the last 25 years. I think it was a great shame that it took so long for this thought to sink in into Government minds. And of course, it was all brought about by the fears in the ranks of Government supporters that people could not play sport together without friction being brought about.</p>

<p>To my mind, the most important thing that the Pretoria Games showed was that people of different races can play sport together, and that the fears, which the Government has in fact propagated and dwelt upon for 25 years, were proved to be entirely unfounded. I believe that if one looks at the Pretoria Games in its true perspective&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister must agree with me from his own experience at the Games&#x2014;it showed that people of different races, of different backgrounds and different cultures, can meet on the sportsfield; that it is a perfectly normal thing to do and that in fact race relations are tremendously strengthened by the very fact that people are able to do this. My appeal to the Government is not to stop at the Pretoria Games, but to go further; to go as far as good law and order allows us to do. I think the only thing that enabled the Pretoria Games to take place was the fact that the Government suddenly discovered the term &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D;. This term &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D; enabled them to find suddenly that the Pretoria Games was possible. Sir, in my book all people in South Africa are South Africans, although we may be multi-racial. I do not mind if the Government wishes to play with words if it enables us to have an event such as the Pretoria Games. Sir, when you think of the years of blustering that we had in this respect, then the adaptation performed by the Minister&#x2014;the almost miraculous adaptation brought about in view of the Minister&#x2019;s record&#x2014;is quite remarkable. One thinks of the D&#x2019;Oliveira incident, the incident of the Japanese jockey and the incident of the Federation Cup. Sir, if you look at last year&#x2019;s Hansard and read the then Minister&#x2019;s attempt to explain how it was possible to select a team on merit for the Federation Cup, it reads like something out of <i>Punch.</i> The team was selected privately with a great deal of secrecy and no Press reporters were allowed to attend the trials. But then suddenly at the Pretoria Games something like 600 athletes, I believe, of all colours from all over the world were able to play their particular sport in front of thousands of people; no one was excluded and the ground was not private ground. I therefore say to the hon. the Minister that I sincerely congratulate him. He has come a long way. Perhaps in the next 20 years he will have advanced far enough to be able to sit on this side of the House with some merit. Mr. Chairman, because the hon. the <span class="col_7543-7544" refersTo="page_0839"/>Minister has seen the light, I would like to put a couple of salient points to him. Firstly, there is the matter of a world champion boxer, who happens to be a non-White, coming out to South Africa to fight, but that tournament has to take place beyond the borders of South Africa. On the other hand, at the Pretoria Games Whites and non-Whites fought against each other and conducted themselves in the best of manners and nobody was able to utter a word of complaint. But when a world champion boxer who, according to my information, is certainly a man of character, comes to South Africa to fight a White South African champion, they have to go across the borders to fight there. I believe that the hon. the Minister is not being logical in this particular approach. I know that this is not his department, but when it comes to the matter of sport I know that the hon. the Minister has a great deal of influence with the Minister of Community Development. Sir, I have heard the explanations of the hon. the Minister of Community Development in regard to the Nico Malan Theatre, and I hope and I sincerely pray that when he tries to give those explanations to the Minister of Sport, he will get the reaction that he (the Minister of Community Development) got from this side of the House when he talked about Mrs. A and Mr. B wanting to dance together, or to have tea together. Sir, I would like to mention this fact to the hon. the Minister of Sport: In various parts of South Africa non-Whites are able to watch White sports as spectators. Let me quote as an example the football matches which are played under the National Football League. In Bloemfontein non-Whites are not allowed to be spectators; in Pretoria they are not allowed to be spectators, and in Pietermaritzburg they are not allowed to be spectators, but the very same non-Whites are quite happily received in stadiums in Johannesburg. Cape Town and Durban. Bearing in mind that the behaviour of these people at these various sports stadiums, despite the heat of the moment, has not at any stage been any worse than that of White spectators&#x2014;I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me in this respect&#x2014;I can see no reason why non-Whites should be allowed to watch sport in one city of South Africa and be excluded in another city. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that it is these things which give South Africa unnecessarily a poor name, because it makes no sense whatsoever. I asked the hon. the Minister to appeal to his colleagues in the Cabinet, when he is not thinking of Nico Malan but of higher things, to make it possible for spectators of various race groups to watch each other play sport. I say to the Minister that the only yardstick at any time should be the question of good law and order. If this is the matter at issue, then of course it is a different matter entirely. But I want him to use his influence to the best of his ability to see that this can take place as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I would like to refer to one of the hon. members opposite who spoke about the students who sent a letter to the Prime Minister of New Zealand in regard to the proposed rugby tour. I do not see the hon. member in the Chamber now but I want to say to that hon. member that I disagree entirely with the action of those students. I do not agree with boycotts. [Interjections.] I want to say that I disagree entirely with those students. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Of these 73 sport associations 37 were hosts to teams from overseas countries and 37 participated overseas. In this report the names of the countries from which sportsmen and sportswomen visited South Africa are furnished, and also the countries which were visited by sportsmen and sportswomen from South Africa. This information is available and if one looks at it one would not say that South Africa is isolated in the sphere of international sports.</p>

<p>During the past year quite a number of merit sports awards were made to our best sportsmen. At the State President&#x2019;s state award on 15th February, 1973, the Minister of Sport and Recreation expressed the idea of making a sports merit award to coaches and sports administrators as well. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what progress has been made with the wonderful idea to which he gave expression on that occasion. I should also like to see the persons behind the scenes, the people who do the coaching and administrative work in regard to sport, also being honoured for the work, zeal, affection and dedication they give to sportsmen so that they may accomplish these wonderful achievements for South Africa. If I may be permitted to make such a sports merit award to sport administrators. I should like to say that the first sport merit award should be made to the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation, to Mr. Beyers Hoek, the competent and dedicated Secretary for Sport and Recreation, and to his department&#x2014;they who have recently meant so much to sport in South Africa.</p>

<p>If we look at the annual report of the department we see that a wonderful, balanced view of the department&#x2019;s task and the performance of its duties is reflected in it. During the past year this department has given a great deal of attention to coaching. There was the coaching offered to outstanding sportsmen, but particular attention was also given to the coaching of sportsmen and women who do not have the physical ability or the aptitude to accomplish great achievements. According to the annual report a great deal of attention was devoted to the coach, the administrator and the sportsman.</p>

<p>A project I want to emphasize in particular is the youth vacation courses and the adventure courses which this department undertook during the past year. In 1971 they undertook 27 youth vacation and adventure courses which were attended by 2 532 young people. In 1972 74 of these courses were offered, which were attended by 6 772 young people. This is an indication to me of the popularity of these courses which are being arranged. Since this department is, with its youth vacation and adventure courses, taking the young people from the cities into the open air, are taking them back to nature where they learn basic skills and their basic interest in certain sports is aroused, sports with which they were perhaps not yet acquainted, I think that a tremendous task is being performed. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to ensure that a great deal of attention is devoted to this aspect in the year which lies ahead.</p>

<p>I accept that the arrangement of these courses and the implementation of the numerous other projects to which various other hon. members referred is not possible with the small staff which the Secretary has at his disposal. I want to make an urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister today for the staff to be expanded, and for more regional offices to be established. Specifically I want to make a plea for a regional office of the Department of Sport and Recreation for the northern Cape and Griqualand West region, which will be situated in Kimberley or somewhere in that part of the world.</p>

<p>There is another important aspect which I also mentioned last year and to which I should like to refer again. I want to raise the matter of the technical journal for our sport and physical education. Our way of life, our eating habits, our overweight problems and the diseases incidental thereto, emphasize the importance of sport and physical training throughout our society. Attention should not only be given to the outstanding sportsmen, but the idea of sport and recreation should be brought home to every citizen of South Africa. As I did last year, I want to advocate to the hon. the Minister that a technical journal with a scientific approach should be introduced as soon as possible which could give guidance in the field of sport and physical training. A technical journal could make a major contribution to publicizing our sport image and to bringing to the attention of the public the findings of scientific sport research, which was advocated by the hon. member for De Aar. Such a technical <span class="col_7547-7548" refersTo="page_0841"/>journal could also serve as a means of communication in the sphere of sport and physical training. There is today an urgent need for such a technical journal among sportsmen and sportswomen, coaches, administrators and also research workers.</p>

<p>I must mention to you that when I was still a physical training instructor in the teaching profession, the journal <i>Vigor,</i> which was published at the time but eventually disappeared, for the physical training instructor, for the sport teacher and coach meant a great deal with its sport research work, coaching work and so on, which it disseminated in that way. For that reason I want to advocate to the hon. the Minister that such a journal be re-established.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we had a very interesting debate this morning, but this side of the House and indeed the whole nation have been waiting for somebody on that side of the House to repudiate the accusation that the Broederbond has had, or still has, an influence in the sport policy of this Government. Somebody on that side must do so. No one has done so yet. Therefore we are entitled to accept that a secret society like the Broederbond is ruling this country, and not the Government.

<p>Well, then I beg his pardon; he did not tell me he was going to the airport. At any rate, we on this side reject the action of those Natal University students and lecturers as does everybody else. We are still, however, waiting for a reply to our question on the Broederbond. All the laughing and all the jokes will not wash that away whatsoever. South Africa is waiting for that answer.</p>

<p>Sir, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his new appointment. Mind you, Sir, he received his promotion just when he saw his famous Bantu policy collapsing. He has now entered safer and., I hope, calmer waters.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say a few words on behalf of the South African Surf Life-Saving Association. This is a body of young, dedicated, highly trained and well-disciplined men who perform a considerable service for this country. I notice in the annual report of the Department of Sport and Recreation that this body was granted an amount of R500 last year when they held their national championships in Durban. I may say it was a very successful function. People may or may not realize that in South Africa there are only 35 White surf life-saving clubs to guard the shores of South Africa all the way from Mozambique on the east coast to South-West Africa on the west coast. This is a vast stretch of coastline. These 35 clubs are to be found on the north and south coasts of Natal, including Durban, at East London. Port Elizabeth and the Cape Peninsula. In addition, there are two Indian clubs in Natal and three Coloured clubs, two of which I understand are in the Cape. The third Coloured club is in Natal, and a Bantu club has been newly formed at Port Elizabeth. I am glad to say that the White clubs give the non-White clubs every assistance both as regards training and equipment. There is a brotherhood amongst these lifesavers which you find throughout the world. The membership of the White clubs is just under 1 700, and it is expanding at the rate of about 10% per annum.</p>

<p>The first surf life saving championships were held in 1936. These championships continued until 1939. Then the war broke out and the championships were resumed in 1947, after the cessation of hostilities. The fundamental aims and objects of this association are to provide men and boys with the knowledge and skill to protect the bathers on the sea shores of the Republic. This is done free of charge. These men risk their lives in this service and they do so free of charge, content in the knowledge that they have done a good job.</p>

<p>The association is the controlling body for all recognized and affiliated amateur surf life-saving clubs in South Africa. It relies entirely on fund-raising efforts, subscriptions and donations from the public for its funds. It would be invidious to name certain oil firms, tobacco firms and the one or two electronics firms which give very generously to the Surf Life-Saving Association, but without this bounteous gesture from these people this association would be in a parlous financial state. Weekend after weekend, holiday after holiday, we find these young men and boys giving their services freely and voluntarily. They ask for no reward, and you would be surprised, Sir, to find that when a person has been rescued he very rarely thanks the people who have saved his life. Perhaps it is a psychological effect. I do not know what happens, but they just disappear without even saying thank you. As I have indicated, this voluntary service is performed without any cost to the taxpayer whatsoever. The efforts and the dedication of these highly trained and disciplined surf life-savers mean that people can relax and enjoy their coastal holidays with greater peace of mind. Without the fearless devotion of South Africa&#x2019;s amateur surf life-saving clubs, hundreds of holiday-makers would be drowned each year. The fine public spirit shown by our country&#x2019;s life safers deserves everybody&#x2019;s admiration and gratitude. I can assure this Committee that the high regard in which our life savers are held is not confined to the Republic, but exists also in Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany, and our life savers are counted among the best in the world. They have won tests against Australia and other countries overseas. Not only have they competed against other countries, but they have attended seminars in the U.S.A. and in other countries where they have shared knowledge, which has been of benefit both to those countries and to South Africa.</p>

<p>Next year the world life-saving championships are going to be held in South Africa. These championships will take place in January and February at Durban and Port Elizabeth, and so far teams from six overseas countries are to take part. They are England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, the U.S.A. and Taiwan. I hope that the hon. the Minister of Sport will prevail upon his colleague, the Minister of Community Development, to get rid of this&#x2014;I very nearly used an unparliamentary word&#x2014;silly and stupid idea of segregation. Some of these people who will be coming in from the other nations will not be White. I want to point out that this will be a world championship. South Africa will be the host and we must show that we are big-hearted.</p>

<p>In the past this association has made very few calls on the Government for financial help, but I hope that in view of the enormity of the task facing this association, the Minister will use his influence to assist them. We know that he has a way of talking and winning people over to his side and I hope that he will convince his colleagues in the Cabinet to open their hearts and, in that way, the purse strings of the Minister of Finance, so that they will be more bounteous in their gifts to the Surf Life-Saving Association, in order to ensure that this world championship in 1974 will be a success.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Now I just want to tell him that he should rather confine himself to playing his kind of sport and leave the Broederbond alone. It is really a pity that he and his party have dragged the Broederbond into this debate, this debate which should really have been a purely sporting debate and which has offered them the opportunity to indicate a direction to us. That is why this debate reveals two facts to me: Firstly there is this side of the House which is systematically creating opportunities for our sportsmen and sportswomen in a hostile world. And then on the other side of the House there is the United Party with their prophecies of doom and <i>laissez faire</i> policy, a policy in terms of which they want to throw open the gates and hope for the best. I leave it at that.</p>

<p>Actually there are two matters I should like to raise on this occasion. Firstly I want to ask whether the time has not arrived for a symposium of sports administrators in South Africa at which the overall planning of South African sport may be discussed, a symposium at which ideas may be exchanged. I believe that if such a symposium could be arranged, it would <span class="col_7551-7552" refersTo="page_0843"/>lend more sparkle to our sport. Secondly, I want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Kuruman and ask whether some award could not be made to sports administrators, not as a reward, but as a token of appreciation for the valuable work done by these men and women.</p>

<p>This debate affords us an opportunity to pay tribute to our sportsmen and sportswomen for their brilliant achievements, achievements of world quality, which are not always recognized by a hostile world. It also affords us an opportunity to express our thanks to the Department of Sport and Recreation for their ingenuity, purposefulness and positive actions. However, on this occasion I also want to pay tribute to those men and women who are working behind the scenes and who, through their successful attempts, enable our sportsmen and sportswomen to take part in meetings. I am referring to our sports administrators. Let me say at once that without the work done by these people no sports meeting would be possible. Therefore I am grateful to learn from the report of the department that departmental sports administrator courses are being offered, on a national as well as on a provincial level. I hope and trust that these will be continued in 1973 as well. I believe that we shall have to realize that sport today, as well as in the future, is going to make ever greater demands on the ingenuity, resourcefulness and organizational abilities of our sports administrators. In this regard I should like to emphasize one aspect in particular, and that is that there will have to be thorough planning. I think that it would also be a good thing for our sports administrators to take cognizance of the fact that the policy of this Government is not merely a <i>laissez faire</i> policy, not merely a policy in terms of which we want to leave the matter in their hands, but that we on this side, and the Government through the department, want to assist these sports administrators and give them all possible assistance in the handling of the wider implications of what they are doing. I believe that sports administrators can play a very important role to meet the needs of not only the sportsmen and sportswomen but also of the sporting public. I also believe that our sports administrators should take cognizance of the fact that spectators have become selective, that boring sports meetings are something of the past, and that particularly the overlapping of large sports meeting in our major centres is something which should be guarded against. On this occasion I want to refer in particular to the outstanding hour event of the University of Stellenbosch. I was privileged to attend it earlier this year. Those sports administrators had the athletes there and because it was an event of this nature, they also had the spectators. I believe that when sports administrators act within the framework of the Republic&#x2019;s sports policy which has been laid down, and do so in full co-operation with the department, they can make a major contribution and achieve great success.</p>

<p>This afternoon I also want to sound a warning that these sports administrators, too, should perhaps be more on their guard, in particular against precipitate statements. One can understand that there is frustration among these people at times and that there are often disappointments when tours must be cancelled, but I do not think that that is the occasion to issue statements left, right and centre. I believe that some of our sports administrators should beware of publicity because they do not always realize the implications of certain statements issued. We have also noted that often there are differences amongst themselves as well as personal differences, which I believe are not in the interests of sport. This afternoon I want to ask our sports administrators to put sport first and to do so with dedication, with unselfish action and with positive leadership. Much has been said in this debate about international sport and tours. I believe that these are not the be-all and the end-all of sport. We must also look at our internal sports meetings and what is offered here. I think that when we do that we can be filled with pride. All our sportsmen and sportswomen have an opportunity to participate and I believe that if we continue to work on our internal sports meetings, we could achieve a great deal of success. In this regard our sports administrators can make a major and important contribution.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say at once, with reference to what the hon. member who has just resumed his seat said, that we arrange five provincial sport administration courses and one national sport administrator&#x2019;s course annually. These courses are in fact identical to the sport symposiums which the hon. member advocated. We made a start with these precisely because we believe that they are very <span class="col_7553-7554" refersTo="page_0844"/>necessary. Someone once said: &#x201C;If a father doesn&#x2019;t look after his son, who will&#x003F;&#x201D; I want to say that my approach and my view in respect of the sportsmen and women of South Africa is that if the Government, I myself, and my Department of Sport and Recreation, do not look after their welfare, who will&#x003F; It is in that spirit and in that frame of mind that we should like our sportsmen and women to be made capable of the best and the highest achievements here in this country. But they must also be made capable of producing the best abroad, in other words on an international level. In that spirit and in that frame of mind it is a wonderful privilege and a very great pleasure for me to have charge of this portfolio of Sport and Recreation. I said on one occasion, and I repeat it now in a very earnest spirit and as coming from the bottom of my heart, that I can honestly say that I am not seeking fame or fortune, nor a long life, nor am I seeking the death of any of my enemies, for I do not think I have such enemies; therefore I am not seeking the death of anyone in the Opposition benches opposite either! However, I am seeking one thing, viz. that I shall cope with this portfolio, which affects so many people and is so important in our country and in the international sphere as well, with the necessary insight, and that this matter shall be handled with circumspection and, if I may say this, in all humility, with wisdom. That is honestly my profound desire.</p>

<p>Against what background are we discussing this important matter today, a matter which arouses so many feelings throughout the country and also, when all is said and done, throughout the world&#x003F; We are doing it here in South Africa against a background of newspaper reports such as the one I am holding in my hand, of January, 1973, and no one opposite can argue this away. No one in South Africa can argue this away. The headline to this report reads: &#x201C;Intensified action against South Africa in 1973,&#x201D; and in this report the following <i>inter alia</i> is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The campaign against colonialism and apartheid will be stepped up on all international fronts this year. Conferences are being called in Germany, Norway, Holland, Geneva and London to plan new action against the White Governments of Southern Africa.</block>

<p>On 31st December, 1972, virtually the same date as that of the report to which I have just referred&#x2014;I have a considerable number of such reports which I could present to this House&#x2014;a report appeared under the headline &#x201C;Plan to Kill All-White sport &#x2014;Sanroc.&#x201D; I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It confidently forecasts that South Africa will be totally excluded from all international sport. Sanroc will attempt to wreck the South African National Games in Pretoria in March, 1973.</block>

<p>So they continue. This is the background against which we are debating this matter today. I have here in my hand one of the constitutions, or whatever you would like to call it, of the Non-racial Sports Council which was established here in South Africa. I want to quote to the hon. House what their declared aims are in black and white &#x2014;and I am not talking politics now; I am stating the facts to the House:</p>

<block name="quote">To get constant support from all Blacks in isolating South African White sport.</block>

<p>That is their aim. Here I also have a report in regard to the United Nations Apartheid Committee. I want to quote from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A number of these participants &#x2026;</block>

<p>of the United Nations Apartheid Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; devoted a portion of their statements to the subject of sport and methods which could be employed to further wreck South Africa&#x2019;s sporting ties with other countries of the world.</block>

<p>This is dated 18th May, 1973. What is the position in South Africa against the background of these facts&#x003F; The position in South Africa is that we held the South African Games here this year under the National Party Government, which could only be described as a triumph for South Africa, for that is what it genuinely was. I agree with every hon. member on the opposite side who stated how this had been conducive to sound race relations. I could tell you wonderful anecdotes of how these Games was conducive to sound race relations. We on this side are grateful for and pleased about that.</p>

<p>I could have made a pleasant little political game of this matter this afternoon, <span class="col_7555-7556" refersTo="page_0845"/>with hon. members opposite on the receiving end. I could, in plain, down-to-earth language have wiped the floor with some of the hon. members there in political terms, but I do not want to do so because we want to consider the more important matter here this afternoon. But I do want to tell you that the S.A. Games were brought about as a result of the sensible and correct policy of the National Party Government. I am saying this because I believe it, and not because I want to make political capital out of it. I am honest enough to have stated it differently if I had wanted to. Good speeches were made on that side of the House today. There were excellent speeches on this side of the House. The hon. members on my side came to this House prepared. They are being activated in the groups, and one is grateful for the fact that they are making such an excellent contribution. One or two speeches were made on that side of the House which I could really, if I had wanted to, have torn to pieces very effectively. I would really have been able to ruin the reputation here of one or two members on that side, perhaps for good, but I would rather not do so. I shall in fact return to this later. I am advocating, and I want to say things today which I hope will have the effect that we will in future have a debate on this matter on a high level, so much so that it will really be of service to sport in South Africa and really be of benefit to this country, instead of the Broederbond and other stories which were mooted here.</p>

<p>I want to reply to the Broederbond story, and after that the hon. member may put a question to me. Let me finish dealing with this first. I want to put an end to this matter once and for all, if that is possible, for if we wanted to be vicious, we would also begin to recount the antithesis of the Broederbond story here and begin to smell out who the Freemasions are, and begin to debate this and everything attendant upon this across the floor of this House. I have told you that I am a member of the Broederbond and that I was Chief Secretary of that organization. When I was elected to the House of Assembly I gave my voters the assurance&#x2014; and that was a long time ago&#x2014;that I would represent the voters who had elected me as a member of the House of Assembly. I gave them the assurance that I would not allow the Broederbond or any organization of which I was a member to prejudice in any way the interests of the voters which I was serving. I have been a member of the House of Assembly for seven or eight years now, and so far not one person in my constituency has been able to point a finger at me and say that I allowed this to happen. Nor shall I allow this to happen, not now nor at any time in the future. Now the hon. members on the opposite side of the House are asking: What about the Broederbond&#x003F; Speaker after speaker rose to say that we should repudiate this organization. Now I am telling hon. members on that side&#x2014;and when I say this, I hope that it will be the end of that ridiculous story of the Opposition&#x2014;that this country is being governed by the National Party Government, not by the Broederbond. Nor does the Broederbond dictate to this Government what it should do. I am telling the hon. member for Pinelands now that the Broederbond will not dictate to me what should be done, for I am here as a member of the National Party Government, and I am here to serve the interests of South Africa: No organization shall dictate to me what is, or what is not, in the interests of South Africa; the Cabinet and the Government shall judge what is in the interests of this country. Therefore let us now put an end to this matter which was raised by a few journalists to exacerbate a matter which is difficult and troublesome enough as it is. The hon. member wanted to know <span class="col_7557-7558" refersTo="page_0846"/>from me whether I would allow sport to be turned into a political issue. I am on record as having said that in so far as it was within my humble and modest ability, I would try under all circumstances to exclude and keep politics out of this matter. Is there anything else the hon. member would like to know about this&#x003F;</p>

<p>I should very much like to reply to that at once and tell the hon. member what the facts of the matter are. I want to say at once to the hon. member that the position is that the sporting bodies in South Africa are autonomous bodies. They may elect to their managing committees whomever they please. No one can dictate to the sporting bodies whom they should elect. I cannot dictate to them; no one can dictate to them. I have already told the hon. member that the National Party Government governs this country, and that we will not allow any organization to dictate to the Government how it should act and what it should do in respect of any matter. Everyone is free to do as they please in this country, except those who are restricted by the law and are prohibited by the law from doing certain things. We shall adhere to those guidelines, and therefore my reply to that hon. member is unequivocal and very clear, i.e. that he need lose no sleep tonight over the possibility that sport and recreation in this country will not be dealt with in an objective manner in the interests of this country by the Government of this country.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I should very much like to deal with a matter which is an important one, and one in regard to which many questions were put, and that is what our sport policy is. I have gained the impression that there are certain bodies that are deliberately trying to create the impression in South Africa that the sport policy of the National Party Government is complicated and difficult to understand. What are the facts, Sir&#x003F; I should like to <span class="col_7559-7560" refersTo="page_0847"/>try, in a few minutes this afternoon, to state and explain our sport policy to hon. members. I want to say at once that I honestly believe that our sport policy is very simple, so simple that even a child could understand it. I want to begin by saying that participation in sport in South Africa should in the first place be seen against the background of the policy of the National Party Government of separate, distinctive development which applies to the entire multi-national public of South Africa. This is not a policy which was created specially to serve sport alone or, as is frequently alleged, to place obstacles in the way of sport. I have already said that our purpose is in fact to help our sportsmen in every sphere. Separate participation in sport is a natural and obvious outcome of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. It is therefore wrong to speak of a new sport policy or a different formula or certain concessions. However, it is in fact correct to speak of a developing policy which was applied and is being applied to new situations. Sir, in a young country like South Africa adjustments in every sphere are constantly being made&#x2014;in the sphere of education, of communications, of science, foreign relations, etc. Announcements in respect of certain points of departure relating to sport should therefore be seen as adjustments, development and progress without sacrifice of principles, and I should like to prove this, giving chapter and verse. In a young country like South Africa there has to be a certain degree of elasticity, for one has to deal with and control the situation here in a realistic way under all circumstances, as the National Party Government is still doing, particularly against the background that we will not allow and do not want to allow ourselves to be isolated from the international world in the field of sport, or in any sphere whatsoever, as our enemies are trying to do. We do not want to be isolated, and we are not going to allow ourselves to be isolated, and the National Party will make its contribution towards ensuring that this does not happen. We are willing to enter the lists against those people who wish to isolate us. We are saying to them in advance that they will not succeed, not with the National Party Government in power.</p>

<p>Sir, then there is a second point I want to make. Sport is important to man, to the individual, nationally as well as internationally, but the National Party Government maintains that there are other things which are considered to be more important than sporting interests. For that reason the interests of sport cannot be placed above the other interests of South Africa, national or international, and I think that every hon. member will readily agree with me in this regard. Sir, the Government lays down certain guidelines within the framework of its policy of separate development. What are these guidelines&#x003F; I maintain that they are perfectly simple. The fundamental standpoint of the National Party Government in respect of sport is that no mixed sport between Whites and non-Whites will be practised locally, i.e. on the club level, the provincial level and on the national level. Every population group plays and administers its sports separately, and the level of proficiency has nothing to do with this aspect of National Party Government policy. South Africa is a multi-national country, with each one of the different nations on a course of separate development. Sport integration under the National Party rule is therefore not possible, and consequently it is logical to accept that the further development of sport will take this fact into account. Sport integration under National Party rule is not possible for it is practised separately on club level, provincial level and national level. What this approach amounts to is that for the sake of internal order and peace South Africa therefore continues to practise sport separately as far as the various population groups are concerned. Secondly: That all population groups are afforded every opportunity to develop and to practise their sport on a distinctive basis&#x2014;no ceiling is placed on opportunities for international competition; and lastly: South Africa does not resign itself to demands from elsewhere, specifically from abroad, to have arrangements in regard to sport on the basis of alien political objectives forced on South Africa. For an examination of the developing sport policy it is therefore of importance that the policy should be seen in its entirety. But it happens that people quite frequently single out portions of this policy, as it suits them, and read into those certain concessions which do not exist at all. The interpretation of the sport policy should constantly be consistent with the country&#x2019;s fundamental policy of separate development. If this is not done, it is not only erroneous and meaningless, but also causes confusion.</p>

<p>Let us now, in the first place, consider snort administration. As far as the administration <span class="col_7561-7562" refersTo="page_0848"/>and control of sporting activities are concerned, these should be in accordance with Government policy, i.e. that non-White associations should exist and develop alongside the corresponding White associations. The non-White nations of South Africa are being afforded every opportunity to develop their own relations with international countries by means of their own sporting bodies which have existed separately on club level, provincial level and national level alongside those of the Whites, and have done so for 300 years up to this point where we find ourselves today.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that the White sporting bodies in South Africa were the bodies which in the first place organized themselves into a cricket council, a rugby council, into an athletic association, etc., and established certain relations in this connection with overseas countries. In time the Coloureds, the Bantu and the Indians followed the same course and began to establish their own bodies separately. For that reason I maintain that it is now the task of these non-White bodies, in accordance with the traditional policy, to establish their own international relations. For that reason it is clear that in respect of the control and administration of sport in South Africa, the control as well as the administration on club level, on provincial level and on national level will, under National Party rule, take place separately. For the sake of international liaison, a liaison committee on a high level, presided over by the White body, may exist, on which officials of the various peoples in regard to the particular sport may have representation in an advisory capacity. In other words, it is very easy and simple: One has separate Bantu organizations, one has the Coloured organization and the Indian organization, and one has the White organization, and over these there is a liaison body on which all these organizations have advisory representation, and the inter-national arrangements are made there. I am not going into detail because I think it is clear and simple. Therefore the control and administration is separate and simple, and everyone in this country can understand and comprehend it.</p>

<p>I come now to the basis of our policy, and that is participation in South Africa. I shall deal later with participation by sportsmen in sport outside South Africa. Participation in sport in South Africa takes place separately in terms of the policy of multinational development, on club level, on provincial level and on national level. Now I find in practice that once one has said this, many people do not understand what you are saying. For that reason I want to define this a little more clearly. It means the following. It means that Whites and Coloureds and Bantu may not, on club level, or on provincial level, or on national level, play together or on a mixed basis in the same team and in the same leagues.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am trying to state very simply and to explain to the House a matter which is causing unnecessary confusion. It would be in the interests of this country if this point which I am now making were thoroughly understood and comprehended. In addition it means that a non-White club team or a non-White provincial team may not play against a White club team or against a White provincial team. Only inter-national competition on the highest level is allowed in terms of National Party policy and principles; i.e. under no circumstances will mixed sport between the various population groups take place on the club level, on provincial level or on national level. [Interjections.] I want to try and state it even more simply for hon. members. This is the difference between &#x201C;multi-racialism&#x201D; and &#x201C;multinationalism&#x201D;. On the one hand there is multi-racialism which those hon. members advocate, if I understand them correctly&#x2014;I do not think even they are certain what they are advocating in this regard&#x2014;and on the other hand there is multi-nationalism. What does multi-racial sport in South Africa mean&#x003F; It means that on the club level you will have a soccer team which will be able to consist of a miscellany of Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu of the various Bantu nations together. This is then a multi-racial soccer team. We say that at club level this is not at all possible under National Party policy. Nor is it possible at provincial level, and not on the national level either, while if one advocates a multi-racial sport policy, one has Whites and Coloureds and Indians and Bantu mixed up together in one team on club level. Consequently <span class="col_7563-7564" refersTo="page_0849"/>you will have this on the provincial and on the national levels as well: Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu mixed up together in one team. This is multi-racialism.</p>

<p>That is your own definition of it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But it is the only definition there is. [Interjections.] The multinational policy of the National Party means the following: On club level such a mixed team will not or cannot exist. In soccer one will have separate Bantu nation teams on club level, separate Coloured teams, separate Indian teams and separate White teams. On club level the different teams of the different population groups will not be able to play against one another either. A Bantu team will not play against a White team and similarly an Indian or Coloured team will not play against a White team either. Precisely the same applies on the provincial level, and so, too, on the national level. However, there is the exception in that you say that on the highest inter-national level you will have what we recently had at the South African Games, and which is completely consistent with the policy of the National Party Government. You will then read on the score-board, as we read in the case of soccer: &#x201C;A South African representative White team&#x201D;, which consists of Whites only, which plays against a South African representative Coloured team consisting solely of Coloureds. The South African representative White team will also be able to play against Indians in an Indian team consisting solely of Indians and it will also, if our policy is carried to its logical conclusion, be able to play against a South African representative Zulu team, a South African representative Xhosa team and against a South African representative Tswana team, etc. Since we have up to now, owing to the high standards which are set, not yet been able to have a representative Zulu or Xhosa or Tswana team which complied with the standard, as the hon. member for Johannesburg North will be able to confirm, the Government has arranged that in the interim period we will allow a South African representative Bantu team to play at the Games for example.</p>

<p>I now want to say something about international teams. When a South African sporting body issues an invitation in respect of a team sport to a country with whom the Republic has traditional sporting ties, that country may select its team on merit, and South Africa will not interfere with the composition of such a country&#x2019;s team, just as long as it is not done with ulterior political motives. What is involved here is clearly inter-state relations, and for this purpose personal relations are not important.</p>

<p>Hon. members will realize that not all sports developed in the same way. Most sports in South Africa were developed by the White sporting bodies. During the interim period, therefore, we must regard these matters in a very realistic way.</p>

<p>I come now to the inter-national meetings on the highest level. I have now stated the policy very simply, I think. Now what about inter-national meetings&#x003F; From the policy statement I have just made, it therefore follows that in South Africa itself this, under National Party rule, is done on a separate basis. At the highest level international meetings will take place. International meetings therefore indicate unequivocally that the competition is in principle open to any participant who qualifies on the basis of laid down standards. Certain basic requirements are set in regard to this type of meeting, of which the following are the most important: The basic idea of non-mixing of the population groups on the various levels, remains. In the case of inter-national competitions the only possibility of multi-nationality participation against one another is on the highest level of competition, namely the international level. In view of this a basic principle, which has to serve as condition of participation, is obviously that of proficiency and the necessary standard or quality which has to be attained. Consequently only participants, South African or foreign, who comply in advance with certain minimum standards (qualifying times or distances, or achievements on the basis of a laid down criterion), will participate. They will be classified in advance and will then qualify in this way to participate in such inter-national meetings on the highest level. Therefore, in terms of National Party Government policy, it is not a case of any participant, White or non-White, being free to enter for such a competition, but as matters stand in the international world, only those people who comply with the necessary qualifications are free to do so. A further requirement is that such an international <span class="col_7565-7566" refersTo="page_0850"/>meeting should have the necessary prestige value and should be open to any participant and/or country, and should be proclaimed as such. It will be possible for both White and non-White spectators to attend such an inter-national meeting, and such meetings shall be presented in approved stadiums with adequate facilities, etc. There are other requirements which are also being set, but in regard to which I need not go into detail now, since I should now like to dispose of this aspect.</p>

<p>In this connection I should like to point out two other aspects. Firstly, I want to raise the question of the participation of South Africans in sport abroad. I have now stated the policy to you. It is simple: On club, provincial and national level, participation is on a separate basis. On the international level any person who has attained the standard and who has complied with certain set requirements, may participate. All that remains now&#x2014;I really think this is very simple&#x2014;is participation by South Africans in sport abroad. In 1962 the Olympic Games and certain tournaments of world class made it necessary for South Africa to state its attitude in regard to this matter very clearly through the late Dr. Verwoerd and the then Government, viz. that every South African sportsman, White or non-White, who had attained the necessary standard of proficiency, would be allowed to participate in the Olympic Games under one flag and the Olympic emblem&#x2014;not the Springbok emblem. Such a team was in fact chosen at the time to participate in Tokyo. This decision was taken on the basis of the stipulation by the International Olympic Committee that only one team from a specific sovereign country would be allowed to participate in the Olympic Games. This participation takes place on a national basis and not on a team basis. This standpoint, I am just repeating here, confirms that the designation and emblem of &#x201C;Springbok&#x201D; will for the present and the future apply only to White sport and White teams. As long as I occupy this position, and as long as the National Party is in power, this will certainly remain the case. It is the emblem of the Whites, and it will remain White. In cases where the rules and regulations of international world sports meetings require that only one team from a country may participate in the meeting, a representative South African team, which may therefore include non-Whites as well if they should qualify for that, will participate under the South African flag as one team or contingent, as the late Dr. Verwoerd stated it in 1962. It has remained unchanged since that time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It may be determined by the various bodies, which may then decide about this in conjunction with the Department of Sport and Recreation. Up to now no resolution has at any stage been adopted in regard to such an emblem. This arrangement may be made applicable to certain tournaments of world class, such as the Canada Cup in golf and the Davis or Federation Cup in tennis. It is therefore clear that in terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy of multi-nationalism with regard to the matter of sport, mixed trials are completely superfluous and will therefore not be held under any circumstances, now or in the future, for they are not necessary. The policy of inter-nationalism makes this completely and utterly unnecessary and impossible. I hope that is clear. All that finally remains for me to do is to say something about international meetings. South African White and non-White sporting teams may play against international teams abroad.</p>

<p>If one were to summarize this entire matter which I have stated very simply, one would see that the Government is affording every inhabitant of this country, in accordance with the official policy, an equal opportunity to participate in sport right up to the top, locally as well as on the international level, but not on an integrated and mixed basis. Both White and non-White sportsmen of international standard may participate in inter-national meetings within South Africa, and also beyond South Africa&#x2019;s <span class="col_7567-7568" refersTo="page_0851"/>borders. In spite of general common features which are typical of sport in general there are nevertheless fundamental mutual differences among the 70 odd varieties of sport, and aspects which are made applicable to the one cannot always simply be made applicable to the other. I therefore want to advocate that people should not talk so readily of concessions for one sport, while that same concession cannot be made for another. Surely the nature of a multi-national meeting in an individual sport, such as golf and athletics, cannot be compared to a team sport such as rugby or cricket. In this regard I conclude by saying the following: The department is encouraging national sport control bodies to ensure that sport administrators on national, provincial and club level are fully conversant with the sport policy of the Government, and to consult the department before precipitate, and possibly erroneous, interpretations are given to the policy. On this occasion I should therefore like to issue a friendly invitation to all bodies in this country dealing with sport, regardless of race or colour, to co-operate with my department and myself so that we may make our sport in South Africa and for South Africa what it is supposed to be, i.e. something pleasant and something wonderful. I think it is in fact possible to do this. Against this background of what the Sport policy is, the hon. member for Pinelands asked me: &#x201C;What of the future&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x2020;In regard to cricket, I am aware that the South African Cricket Association is desirous of staging an international Gillette Cup competition in South Africa next summer, that is the summer of 1973. If suitable arrangements can be made by that association, I believe it is intended to invite Gillette Cup winners in England to participate in the tournament. I wish to state that provided there are no political motives behind the selection of any player, the Government will in no way inhibit the County concerned in so far as the selection of its team to play in South Africa in such an international tournament is concerned nor for that matter, any other team in this category. I had the pleasure, secondly, of meeting Mr. Derrick Robins during his tour of South Africa last summer and understand that he is very keen to repeat his cricket tour, only with a stronger team. In similar conditions applicable to the suggested international Gillette Cup competition, the Government would place no restriction on the selection of his team if the best interests of South African cricket are served by such a tour and if the normal conditions I have stated here are adhered to, namely that no politics be made of it, that it creates no internal problems for South Africa and that relations between respective countries will not be disturbed. I believe it will happen in this way, and I think I have reason to believe that it will happen in that fashion. With regard to double-wicket teams, there was an item in the newspapers this morning, the Government has decided on principle that if double wicket teams from international sources can be fielded here in South Africa, they can come and play here and if a Coloured team, a Xhosa team, a Zulu team or an Indian team can be staged, there will be nothing in principle against these different teams playing in such an international double-wicket competition on a multinational basis in South Africa.</p>

A South African representative White team, a South African representative Coloured team, a South African representative Indian team and a South African representative Zulu or Xhosa team or a team representative of any other nation can compete in the tournament. Any other international teams wishing to participate in this open South African national tournament will be most welcome if that can be arranged.</p>

I have dealt with a definite fact which has been placed before the Government and about which a decision has been taken. That decision is in regard to soccer.</p>

<p>*As far as athletics are concerned, the Government has given its consent to the South African Athletics Union arranging two international meetings in 1974, one probably in the north and one in the South, on condition that at least two countries beyond the borders of South Africa participate. This will take place on an inter-national basis in 1974, and all athletes from South Africa who meet the stipulated requirements will be able to represent their various nations there at two international and inter-national athletic meetings, which will be held in South Africa next year.</p>

<p>In respect of cycling, permission has been granted for an international cycling competition, similar to the famous &#x201C;Tour de France&#x201D;, from Cape Town to Johannesburg, provided at least two countries from beyond the borders of South Africa participate. Whites, Coloureds, Indians and the Bantu nations who meet the laid down requirements, will be able to participate on an inter-national basis in this international South African cycling competition, corresponding to the &#x201C;Tour de France&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In respect of other varieties of sport, the following world series will be held in South Africa during the period August 1973 to March 1974: A world squash tournament here in South Africa; a world trampoline tournament here in South Africa, and a world lifesavers&#x2019; competition, to which the hon. member referred a moment ago, here in South Africa. In 1976 the world bowls championship will be held in South Africa. An international women&#x2019;s hockey team will undertake a tour of South Africa during the second half of this year, and the same will be done by an international women&#x2019;s netball team. World series in certain other sports are being arranged.</p>

<p>With this I think I have disposed of the most important matters. I have, I think, replied to all the important questions put to me. Questions were put to me from this side of the House. Owing to lack of time I shall not be able to deal with them now. I had to deal with these matters fully, and I want to assure hon. members that I will give the necessary attention to every matter which was conveyed to me. I want to express my appreciation for the fine things which were said about the Games and my department and myself. I cannot now reply to each member&#x2019;s individual questions adequately. I hope that I have also replied to the questions of the other hon. members. If there is a member who has a specific question to which he wants a reply from me, I shall furnish him with a reply. I took note of every matter which was raised and, even if I do not reply to that now, simply owing to the fact that I think that I have already spoken for too long, I promise that I will give attention to all these matters and that I will, where necessary, subsequently give the hon. member in question a written reply.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making two appeals to hon. members. The first one is &#x2026;</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F; I raised the question of the attendance of different race groups at sport meetings and how it varies from city to city.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The position is as follows: The Orange Free State has its own authority to deal with that aspect and it does it in accordance with its own ordinances and as the people of the Free State wish. The Government does not interfere with that. The same applies to the other cities. The hon. member is expecting too much of me as Minister of Sport and Recreation to dabble into that matter and to force them away from what they in their own local towns find is an accepted practice. But I will go into the matter. At the moment I cannot say anything more than I have already said in this regard.</p>

<p>*Because this is a difficult matter I want to make a friendly appeal to hon. members to try to acquaint themselves with what the policy of this Government in respect of these matters is. I tried to state the policy very simply, and I should like hon. members to understand the principles of this matter clearly. They must trust us in this matter, who are dealing with it, and I can assure them that the application of this sport policy will not become the thin end of the wedge to force integration upon us in South Africa. I am also convinced that if this policy is applied to its logical conclusion it will enable us to participate freely on an international level in every sport. I am saying this because we adhere to an international standpoint of an inter-national arrangement which is universally <span class="col_7571-7572" refersTo="page_0853"/>accepted throughout the world. Secondly, we say that we do not intervene in the private affairs of other nations, and therefore we have the right to ask that other nations should not interfere in the private domestic matters of South Africa.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to make a friendly appeal to all, also to the &#x201C;non-racialist&#x201D; groups in South Africa to co-operate with us, with my department and myself, so that we can compete with one another on the highest inter-national level. In that way we shall create sound relations in South Africa, but we may not throw overboard the tried and true methods which we have adopted for 350 years in South Africa. We must adopt these methods, and then I think all of us together will be able to make of sport what it should be in South Africa &#x2014;something fine and something wonderful. I therefore say: &#x201C;Let us get on with the game&#x201D; in this spirit and in this frame of mind, and then South Africa will again excel in the world as every hon. member in this House would like to see happen.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; what the object of it is and what our policy and our approach are in respect of the agricultural industry, and on what principles our policy is founded. We want to do so with a view to making it possible for us to have a good debate and so that the hon. the Minister, his Deputy Minister and other hon. members on that side of the House will also be able to state their standpoint to us in a proper manner. Up to now we have had for the most part an <i>ad hoc</i> approach on the part of the Government, without there having been a broad view in respect of our agricultural problems in South Africa. I say this against the background that at this very stage we ought to have a practical yet enlightened approach to agriculture in South Africa, for the simple reason that it is being calculated that by the year 1980 there will be millions of people in the world who will be dying of hunger. In this way, for instance, it was calculated, some years ago that between the years 1830 and 1980 the world population would increase by about 450%. This calculation was made seven years ago, and seven years ago it was determined that from that time on until 1980 the world population would increase by another 40%. This will not only make demands on the world. This population explosion will also make demands on South Africa itself, and we shall not be able to escape from them. We shall have to feed this increased population in South Africa, and in addition to that we shall have to be able to play our role in the world when it comes to agricultural exports. That is why I say that it has now, more than ever before, become necessary for us to have a practical yet also enlightened approach to our agricultural situation. For that reason the United Party committed its policy in this respect to paper as long ago as 1968. Since then the basic approach has not changed in any respect. Some of the statistics, some of the figures mentioned in that brochure, may perhaps no longer be applicable, but otherwise the principles have remained just as forceful as they were then.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note that many of the predictions we made five years ago came true sooner than was expected. I refer, for instance, to the shortage of red meat. This is not the only kind of food in respect of which a shortage is being experienced. Many others can be added to the list. With this tremendous population increase to which I referred, we shall have even more shortages in the course of the next decade or so. In addition to that <span class="col_7573-7574" refersTo="page_0854"/>the demand has also remained tremendously strong as a result of a sophisticated taste which is developing amongst members of the consumer public every day.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Therefore, Sir, we feel that both sides of the House should strongly reaffirm their approach to agriculture. Nothing over the past 15 to 20 years has happened to stem the depopulation of our rural areas. Many of our smaller towns have become villages where older people and pensioners live. Such villages may have the infrastructure such as post offices, railways, schools, police stations, etc., but for all practical purposes these towns have become completely dead. The younger people are becoming fewer. Why is this so&#x003F; Because there are no longer enough young people left on our farms. The experts tell us that the average age of the South African farmer is today between 55 and 60 years, and it is progressively going up. I believe that this particular feature of the South African agricultural industry has up to now been completely ignored by the Government, or at least they have done very little to try to change this situation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that hon. member knows that these figures are obtainable at the South African Agricultural Union and the Department of Census, etc. He merely has to take a look in his own district, and then he will find that this is the position there.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to propose in this debate that we should stop thinking that it is not wrong for one farmer, especially if he is a no-good farmer, to sell out to the next farmer. This next farmer, by enlarging his farm holding or his farming operations, will not necessarily be more economic or more productive. It has already been proved scientifically that the moment farming operations go beyond a certain scope, then the supervision suffers and the production costs per unit produced tend to increase. I believe that when the no-good farmer has had a chance, when his training has been improved, when we have provided extension services for him and he still does not make a success of his farming, then by all means let us take him out of farming, but let his place be taken by another farmer, a good farmer. Sir, this is how we will get back on to our farming land new farming entrepreneurs and younger farmers.</p>

<p>*Not for a single moment can I believe that one can have a prospect for one&#x2019;s agricultural industry unless one is prepared to encourage younger people to enter that industry.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I believe that this is the method that we should apply to stem the tide from the rural areas to the urban areas; to stop the depopulation of our rural areas. I also know that we can re-populate our rural areas with White people, and I also know that farming is not the only method. We on this side have often suggested to the Government and to the hon. the Minister and to other Ministers that we should have light industrial development in our rural areas which have the potential for industrial development, but I do not want to discuss that at this stage. Sir, a further reason why we must reaffirm our approach to agriculture is the deterioration which has taken place in our agricultural land and also our pastoral land over the past 25 years. South Africa is not over-endowed with agricultural wealth. Approximately 12% of our total land can be cultivated, and we place a tremendous premium on this land available to us when we think that by the year 2000 we will need annually for local consumption something like 100 million bags of maize, 24 million bags of wheat, 4 million slaughter-cattle, 11 million slaughter-sheep, and more than 1 200 million gallons of milk. Sir, our approach is that our soil is the heritage of the generations to come and that we must leave it in a better and a more productive condition than we received it ourselves. But, Mr. Chairman, one is filled with anxiety and actually with despair when one views, for example, the land in our major agricultural and pastoral areas and when one sees that very little headway has been made with regard to soil conservation. Our approach is that South Africa cannot produce agricultural products at the expense of our soil <span class="col_7575-7576" refersTo="page_0855"/>and at the expense of its fertility. But I also believe that one should never talk about agricultural exploitation; that is the wrong term; we believe that we must only harness our agricultural resources for our common good and for the benefit of those who will come after us.</p>

<p>*Sir, nobody will deny that a stable and a well-anchored rural farming papulation is essential.</p>

<p>We say that over and above the fact that this stable and well-anchored rural farming population is essential for the development for our rural areas, we may also need these people in times of emergency, in times of terrorism, in time of hostilities. These people could then be the outposts in maintaining the security of our country and State. I can mention to the hon. member for Carletonville a splendid example, of which he ought to be aware, and that is Israel, which is going out of its way to develop its rural areas and to settle its people there.</p>

<p>Sir, a further object of any agricultural policy should be to provide one&#x2019;s population with protective foods, because tremendous amounts of money are being spent annually on things for preserving and promoting our health, which would not be quite as necessary if there had not been a certain measure of malnutrition, if I may put it this way, in this country.</p>

<p>Underfeeding is to my mind not such a big problem, although it may become a problem.</p>

<p>Sir, we all want to promote South Africa&#x2019;s industrial development, and in this regard our agricultural products and agricultural raw materials are playing a very important role. We on this side believe that these two industries should be complementary, for the good of both and for the benefit of the country as a whole. When we so often have an adverse balance of payments, it is not always attributable to a large volume of imports, but often it is also a case of poor agricultural crops which have caused a drop in our exports.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I have mentioned these things in order to emphasize the importance of the agricultural industry, and hon. members on that side and other hon. members on this side will quite possibly be able to mention many other reasons for its being so important. There ought to be no difference of opinion on the importance of the key role which this industry must play, but, Sir, how is this key role to be played&#x003F; In the first instance, we must have an agricultural price policy. The diligent farmer must be assured of a reasonable dividend on his capital investment, after due regard has been had to the risk factor, and furthermore there must be an incentive for this farmer to improve production methods. There must be a motivation for the farmer to be able to produce and to produce well, and it cannot be expected that the farmer with a bigger turnover will also be able to make a bigger profit. This may be a sound business principle in the world of commerce, but it does not always work out in the agricultural industry. As a result of climatic and all sorts of other factors&#x2014;such as droughts, etc.&#x2014;his turnover may be reduced overnight to the minimum. We on this side of the House also disapprove most strongly of price manipulation. One often finds that when surpluses develop, the State enforces prices which cause the farmer of South Africa a great deal of embarrassment. If there will be surpluses of one product, surely the accepted thing is rather to encourage the production of another product of which there is no surplus.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>For that reason price determination should not <span class="col_7577-7578" refersTo="page_0856"/>necessarily be effected independently. We on this side believe that a co-ordinating body may bring about effective correlation in this regard. Furthermore, production costs may not be allowed to get out of hand, even if production costs plus price are guaranteed to the farmer. In this respect the Government is often very guilty. The latest increases in railway rates are a splendid example. These have caused production costs to soar, over and above the effect they have also had on the cost of living. Our approach on this side makes provision not only for the risk factor to be duly taken into consideration in price determination, but also for unstable agricultural income to be avoided as far as possible.</p>

<p>By determining prices at the beginning of a production cycle instead of on a seasonal basis, it will also be possible for the risk factor to be pinned down properly. If the farmer knows from the start what he may expect in the form of a minimum price which is adjusted regularly, it will be possible for him to plan accordingly. For years now the authorities have been concerned about the gap between what the farmer gets for his product and what the consumer has to pay for it. However, up to now precious little has been done about this.</p>

<p>Therefore it is by no means unheard of that in some cases, such as in the case of perishable products, the consumer has to pay up to eight times more than is received by the producer. This year still this happened to an item such as tomatoes in Johannesburg. There the consumer paid eight times more than was received by the farmer. I believe that there are a number of ways open to us for coping with this situation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We on this side of the House believe that the interests of the consumer and that of the producers are not necessarily conflicting. Speculation in essential foodstuffs should not be allowed. Exorbitant consumer prices can build up consumer resistance. High meat prices which were experienced recently in America, made consumers fuming mad and resulted in boycotts. It forced prices down, although temporarily, but it also engendered hostility between producer and consumer. We believe that if prices are to be kept artificially stable for the consumer, then it must not be done at the expense of the producer. We realize that a substitute for consumer subsidies has up to now not yet been found. This is done all over the world and it is also done here. If it is necessary for us to increase consumer subsidies then we should be prepared to do so in order to keep the price stable for the consumer. Unfortunately the Government has recently not seen its way clear further to increase the subsidies on bread and maize for the consumer. It is regrettable and will have and has had a tremendous impact on the rise in the cost of living. Such consumers&#x2019; subsidies must be paid, as we have stated so often, by the Consolidated Revenue Account. It is not unusual for industrialists to become involved in farming or in commercial business and <i>vice versa.</i> We want everybody to have his legitimate share of the economic cake of South Africa. However, at the same time the farmers&#x2019; duty should not necessarily stop at the production end of things. When the farmer has the training, when he has the knowledge and the willingness, he should play a far greater part in the processing and marketing of his own products. This then will cut excessive costs in the distribution chain and also at the same time ensure a more reasonable price to the consumer in the country.</p>

<p>I have mentioned some of these aspects of United Party approach to farming in general. However, a very complex one, and often also depressing, is the position of agricultural finance. It should not be difficult <span class="col_7579-7580" refersTo="page_0857"/>for us to work out that a farmer, who competes on the open market for his finance, will not be able to exist when he receives a low dividend on his investment. When the farmer therefore borrows at current rates, he will need vast increases in producer prices. The slightest rise in production costs must be recognized in the price structure. When this should happen, then the South African consumer will never be able to afford the things which the farmers of South Africa produce. Therefore agricultural finance, if done on a reasonable scale, can go a long way towards keeping our production costs as low as possible.</p>

<p>We have often pleaded with the hon. the Minister that the State must take a strong stand in agricultural finance. We have often pleaded that the Land Bank should be in a position to spread its wings a little wider. We have often pleaded that the Department of Agricultural Credit and the Land Bank should be organized under one roof; that is to say under one department or one division of a Department of Agricultural Finance. It is not difficult to predict that urgent attention will have to be given to this particular problem.</p>

<p>Nobody wants State assistance if it can be avoided and nobody wants to interfere with private enterprise. We all know that private enterprise should really tackle the job. However, private enterprise does things at a price. The South African consumer and, I believe, also the South African farmer cannot afford that price. Furthermore, there is enough evidence which points to one inescapable fact, and that is that private enterprise is these days becoming less and less interested in long-term agricultural financing. One is then entitled to ask: If they are not prepared to do it, who must do this job&#x003F; I think that we as members of this House should be prepared to give the answer.</p>

<p>*We have tried to give the answer by saying that the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and the Land Bank will have to play their part in this respect. But what is necessary for restoring the general confidence in the industry, is not only these things which I have mentioned now. I also believe that as far as the matter of an agricultural planning council is concerned, about which the hon. the Minister should like to know more, we should, on this occasion and in this debate, see whether this proposal is acceptable to the hon. gentlemen on that side. Let us try to ascertain what such an agricultural planning council will be able to do for South Africa. We have already pointed out that we have for the country as a whole an economic advisory council which has to advise the hon. the Prime Minister. A Department of Planning has already been established on a national level.</p>

<p>In respect of industrial development we have the Industrial Development Corporation, which has for decades been a major propelling force behind our industries. Such an agricultural planning council would, in the first instance, have to provide for proper mutual co-ordination between the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and, in addition, for the conversion of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure into that division or the Department of Agricultural Credit which I mentioned a moment ago. Furthermore, it ought to make more streamlined and effective bodies of those public institutions which have to provide for the agricultural industry. We believe, furthermore, that such an agricultural planning council could provide for proper co-ordination of action and for the elimination of administrative bottlenecks. This is an important function which this council could perform. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park came along with his generalizations once again. He did not say anything new in this debate. The matters mentioned here by him are matters which have been raised by him time and again over the past number of years during which he has been the main sneaker on agricultural matters. We had expected him, now that they are experiencing such difficulties in their own <span class="col_7581-7582" refersTo="page_0858"/>ranks, to come forward with a new vision in order to capture the imagination of the farming community.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to bring a very important matter to the notice of the House, a matter about which a great deal is being said in the private sector today. I am not going to waste time now by replying to the trivialities raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>In the time at my disposal I should like to express a few thoughts on the agricultural co-operative undertakings in our country. There are other aspects in this regard which will be dealt with by members on this side of the House. In our view it is an indisputable fact that agricultural co-operatives in our country are steadily growing and flourishing. This is proved by the following figures: The total turnover of agricultural co-operatives in 1971&#x2014;these are the latest figures&#x2014;was R1 383,8 million, an increase of 6,6% as against 2,8% the previous year. The total assets increased by R39,l million to R743,l million.</p>

<p>These figures are gratifying to us, but the opponents of the co-operative movement do not feel very happy about them, so much so that they have been using their powers for breaking down and hampering the co-operative movement. They have been doing so with one end in view only, namely to get their hands on a certain part of that trade. It has therefore become necessary for thought to be given to the task and the function of the agricultural co-operative movement in South Africa so that we may have clarity on the place which the co-operative movement ought to take in the economy of the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>In order to do that it must be borne in mind&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;that the co-operative movement in South Africa was born because a need existed for it in practice. Consequently it received strong support from the State in the past, because it was regarded as a valuable element in the agricultural industry. Co-operatives cannot and may not be equated with profit-seeking undertakings, for it has a distinctive character. What is significant is that co-operatives moved into certain fields because there was a need for that to be done. I want to put it even more strongly: They moved into certain fields because at certain points there had been tremendous exploitation of the producer as well as the consumer. Whereas co-operatives have gained for themselves a niche in the economy of the country through standing united and working hard, co-operatives will not easily give up the rights and privileges they have acquired over the years. The co-operative movement is not fighting the profit-seeking undertakings.</p>

<p>I believe that there is room in the economy of South Africa for the co-operative movement as well as other forms of undertakings. Nor does this rule out the possibility of co-operation and agreement with non-co-operative movements. There may be differences of opinion on the method and the way in which this has been done or ought to be done. If this is the case, it is something which must be ironed out so that there may be clarity on the action to be taken in this field. However, there are certain aspects which must be set in their proper perspective. To my mind this is the matter about which there is a great deal of misunderstanding and prejudice and in regard to which unnecessary reproaches are being levelled at the co-operatives. The reproach is being levelled that co-operatives are in a privileged position because this form of undertaking is not subject to income tax, and that the working capital consists of inexpensive Land Bank capital. Now, let us analyse these reproaches a little more closely.</p>

<p>I have no argument with the fact that co-operatives are not taxable, but have the critics ever given any thought to the fact that co-operatives are providing the producer with means of production on an economic basis, are enabling the producer to raise his profit margin&#x003F; In this way the co-operatives are indirectly causing a major flow into the Treasury. As far as the Land Bank capital is concerned, the opponents of co-operatives tend to overlook certain facts. People do not bear in mind that co-operatives also have their own funds. In this connection I read the following in the latest report of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of the exceptional increase in own funds&#x2014;the highest for the past five years&#x2014;this was not sufficient to cover the increase in fixed investment, which was <span class="col_7583-7584" refersTo="page_0859"/>R28,3 million. Fixed assets rose by R96,4 million, or 64,3%, during the past five years, increasing especially rapidly during the last four years.</block>

<p>But here the following fact must be borne in mind: More bulk storage and handling facilities had to be created. Furthermore, expansion had to take place in manufacturing activities. The attendant rapidly rising costs of buildings and equipment of the type required, necessitates ever-increasing investment. Here we must emphasize that the investments made by the co-operatives were not made for the purpose of making profit. It must be pointed out in this respect that the investments made, have been made because it is in the national interest to do so and because this is essential owing to the fact that one is dealing here with the storage and processing of basic foodstuffs for the country.</p>

<p>The aim here is not to enrich the cooperatives, but to render a service of national interest with&#x2014;and this I want to emphasize&#x2014;moneys obtained for the most part from their own funds. Therefore it is encouraging to read in the report that there are indications that, with the awareness of growing capital requirements the accumulation of own funds has become an important feature of the policy of agricultural co-operatives. In a few cases statutory authority has already been granted for the establishment of members&#x2019; interests funds to be built up from contributions from crop realizations, dividend and bonus appropriations, and interest on existing members&#x2019; funds. When this has been said, it must nevertheless be conceded that the Land Bank is still the main source of financing for both the long-term and the short-term requirements of the agricultural co-operatives. The long-term financing is effected by way of instalment loans, which are intended for durable capital works and equipment. The short-term loans are intended for the seasonal requirements.</p>

<p>What is important to me, and should be emphasized, is that the loans provided by the Land Bank are supplementary to the co-operatives&#x2019; own funds. The impression is being created that the co-operatives obtain all their money from the Land Bank, but this is not true; such loans are only supplementary to the co-operatives&#x2019; own funds which consist of contributions obtained through its paid-up capital levies and also from reserves built up annually out of surpluses. On this point the report of the Land Bank is very clear, for the Land Bank says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the Bank&#x2019;s policy to encourage co-operatives to obtain as much money as possible by way of contributions from their members and also to strengthen their reserves yearly in order to augment their own funds.</block>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, the hon. member wants to know whether I support it 100%. We on this side of the House have no quarrel with any of the statements the hon. member made.</p>

<p>In dealing with this agricultural debate under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, we do so under certain special circumstances. In the first instance we have two brand-new Ministers, or at least a new Minister and a new Deputy Minister. Recently those in this House interested in agriculture had a trip organized by the Department of Agriculture. We were taken to see certain important aspects of the activities of the Department of Agriculture in the Western Cape. For more than a year now we have had the benefit of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture and we have also had some reactions from the hon. the Minister in respect of this report. Another very important event has taken place. The final blasting of the Orange-Fish River tunnel has taken place and it means that water from the Orange River will flow down the important Fish River valley in about a year&#x2019;s time. We have also seen a dramatic recovery in the wool industry. I think that it is something which we when we gathered here last year could not have anticipated. We have also had another <span class="col_7585-7586" refersTo="page_0860"/>season that has demonstrated again the extreme unpredictability of the South African climate and the harshness of the conditions with which the South African farmer has to contend. Probably the most important situation of which we must take note is that there is a greater realization today of the importance of agriculture as an industry that has to feed the nation. In previous debates we have emphasized agriculture from a point of view of the farmer alone, but I believe that that phase is something of the past. We now realize that the consumer and the housewife are as interested in the agricultural industry as the farmer on the land is himself.</p>

<p>In respect of the two new Ministers the chairman of our group has already expressed his good wisses to these two Ministers and I would like to be associated with those good wishes.</p>

<p>*The other day the hon. the Minister described the drought as a two-tooth drought. I think I can say that these two Ministers are two four-tooth Ministers. They are old enough to have been able to gain considerable experience in agriculture, but they are still young enough to be very productive.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Anyway, I wish these two hon. Ministers the best of luck with their term of office. We are not so fascinated by their politics, but what we do like about them is that they are two dedicated agriculturalists. I think that they will serve this portfolio very well indeed.</p>

<p>*The problem, however, is that the wagon they are drawing is a very old one. It seems to me that that wagon has become somewhat ramshackle, because its wheels are coming apart and its rims are falling off. What they need is a new wagon with golden wheels and a green body. It will be a United Party wagon which will save agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>I am sure that the Ministers learnt a great deal. It also gave us an insight into the dedicated way in which the officials of the Department of Agriculture tackle their task. I want to express my appreciation to them for showing us what they are doing in this part of the country. However, I hope that that will not be the last of this kind of trip. I believe that we should have a trip of this kind every year and it need not necessarily be during the parliamentary session.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to the Orange/ Fish tunnel. I believe that the near completion of this great project is one of the most important things that has happened to the agricultural industry in recent times. I mention this project because it is going to have a great effect on the future of agriculture throughout South Africa.</p>

<p>I mention it because one wonders to what extent the hon. the Minister is giving his attention to planning how that land will be used. I wonder too whether he is giving consideration to ways in which young farmers who are interested in finding a living on the land, may be accommodated in that area. I wonder whether he is doing all he can to ensure that proper crops will be grown, and that sufficient attention will be given to the growing of lucerne, because in this way, coupled with our great maize surplus, we will be able to eliminate the instability of the pastoral industry which is centred in the Karroo and the Free State areas which adjoin this vast project. Mr. Chairman, one mentions these things because although one is impressed with the overall functioning of the Department of Agriculture, one is not always certain that the co-ordination of the activities is anything like it should be. I think that planning in advance, with particular reference to a <span class="col_7587-7588" refersTo="page_0861"/>great project like this, one which is about to be completed, is something that is of great importance.</p>

<p>The dramatic recovery of the wool industry is something about which we are all very pleased. I think we can applaud the efforts of the Wool Board in trying to stabilize the price of wool to the farmer. I think they have met with a measure of success, but I want to sound a word of warning here. I believe that more has to be done to try to stabilize the price of wool in so far as it affects the buyer and the manufacturer. I do not say that this will be easy, and other members will have more to say on this subject, but I do feel that we must stabilize the price of wool to the buyer and ultimately therefore to the consumer. This is a great challenge that lies ahead for the planners in the Department of Agriculture and especially those connected with the wool industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have suffered another season of changing agricultural fortunes. We have had droughts and we have had reasonably good rains in some parts but this emphasizes the fact that the agricultural industry, above any other industry in South Africa, needs proper long-term planning if there is to be any stability whatsoever.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it seems as though the hon. member for Walmer, as well as the main speaker on that side, the hon. member for Newton Park, wishes to discuss agricultural matters with great responsibility in this debate. I said that this seemed to be the case, Sir, but if one goes back a little, one finds that the hon. member for Newton Park, who has now discussed agriculture in a very responsible manner, had the following to say on 26th April this year when he spoke at Maclear&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s farmers have only themselves to blame for their economic difficulties, leading to the depopulation of the platteland, because they allow themselves to be represented in Parliament by people who could not give a damn about these problems.</block>

<p>Sir, this does not sound to me like responsible debating on agricultural matters. If one wants to act with great responsibility in this House, then surely one has a duty in this regard on the platforms outside the House as well. But, Sir, in the second place I believe that this is the most blatant contradiction I have ever heard, for funnily enough not one of the hon. members of the Opposition who are now sitting here represents a rural constituency.</p>

<p>Sir, I have no fault to find with the way in which those hon. members conducted the debate today; it just struck me, and this is something one merely wants to mention in passing. However, I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Virginia, and I should also like to refer to the question of the co-operative movement in South Africa. I think it is essential, in the light of recent events. I just want to begin by saying that it should be very clear in the year 1973 that this movement has become permanently established in South Africa and that there can be no doubt about the survival of the co-operative movement in South Africa in its present form. Up to now 330 agricultural co-operatives have been registered, with a membership of 309 000 members. Twenty-five years ago about 100 fewer cooperatives, i.e. 235, with a registered membership of 184 000. So there has been tremendous growth in this respect. Sir, this is the only method by which the farmer is able to exercise his bargaining power as an individual. It is a self-help scheme which has developed in South Africa. It is a way in which the State is able to assist the farmer, not only in his own interests, but also in the national interest. The hon. member for Virginia mentioned several aspects in this regard, namely that it can be a channel for financing by the Land Bank and that it assists the farmer in difficult times. In this respect I think in particular of the fluctuating interest rates we have just experienced and of the scarcity of capital. The Land Bank was able to use the co-operatives as a channel for financing, especially in respect of short-term credit, at a fixed interest rate. This eliminated the tremendous fluctuations in the open market. But another very important function performed by the co-operatives, something we certainly cannot lose sight of in discussing this arrangement, is the enforcement of the provisions of the Marketing Act in South Africa. I think that if it had not been for the agricultural co-operatives, it would have been very difficult for us to enforce the Marketing Act. Sir, in the wheat industry <span class="col_7589-7590" refersTo="page_0862"/>in particular the co-operatives play a very important part in respect of the storage of foodstuffs. We see that in the past year the turnover in agricultural products amounted to R1 044 million, out of a total of R1 300 million. Sir, we are glad to hear that the Opposition agrees with us on the principle of the co-operative movement in South Africa, but unfortunately this is not the position in the commercial world outside, and for that reason I suppose it is necessary for us to address these people as well on this occasion. I am referring now to a report in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 5th April, 1973, under the heading &#x201C;Co-ops still privileged&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Government is at sixes and sevens over the knotty question of whether to put co-operatives on a similar footing to private enterprise by taking away the coop&#x2019;s tax concessions.</block>

<p>This article then proceeds to quote several people, including people from the Department of Commerce and Industries and the Minister of Agriculture, and then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is, however, high time government gave a lead. The co-ops are getting bigger and more influential.</block>

<p>It then concludes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Industry, it is clear, would prefer to compete on this basis. So why can&#x2019;t government at least give this aspect of Steenkamp&#x2019;s report its approval&#x003F; Other points such as Land Bank credit and the appointment of members to control boards could be dealt with gradually. Meanwhile, the co-ops get ever larger.</block>

<p>Sir, these people are terribly worried about the co-operatives which have grown ever larger. The growth of co-operatives in the previous year, in 1970-&#x2019;71, was only 2,8%; in 1971-&#x2019;72 it was a little more, 6,6%. So there was no very rapid growth. I think that the growth of the industries was much more rapid and much more impressive. But, Sir, these people have suddenly found a new source of taxation in South Africa. They think that if this source of taxation could be utilized, the other people in the world of commerce would not have to pay so much tax. But let us analyse the position of taxation. If we were to suppose that co-operatives were taxable, and we made as analysis of what the value of this source of taxation would be, we would find that in the past financial year a profit, if one may call it a profit, of round about R40 million was made by the 330 co-operatives in the country combined, and that a loss of approximately R1,61 million was suffered. If we now take into consideration the fact that it is the right of the farmer to build granaries by way of providing for the storage of his wheat, and that, if he had done so as an individual, he would have had the right to make certain tax deductions; if we were then to deduct this from this profit of R24 million, there would certainly be very little left of the R24 million or R25 million which would have been taxable. But if something were left and one subsequently had to pay it out in the form of a bonus to one&#x2019;s members, one would not be able to tax it again. In other words, the farmer would then simply pay less in the way of taxes in the end. But the statement I want to make is that the taxpayer in the co-operative set-up is the farmer or member, because the farmer is an extension of the co-operative movement. In order to prove this statement it is necessary for us to look at the Co-operative Socieites Act, and here I am referring to section 6 in particular, which provides that a co-operative may only do business with a member. It is not allowed to do business with non-members. In other words, if I as a farmer do not take my requirements, the co-operative cannot sell them to someone else. If I do not supply my products to the co-operative to be stored, it cannot market them; in other words, it cannot look for another market to dispose of them. So if my support is withdrawn, the co-operative goes out of business. This is an undeniable link between the farmer and his own enterprise. This is one of the big differences between a co-operative and a commercial enterprise, for a commercial enterprise can compete in every respect in several markets. Another very important section which embodies an important principle is section 15, which deals with the distribution of the profits of co-operatives. The section provides that there are only three ways in which these profits may be distributed. The first is that of the interest on the member&#x2019;s paid-up share capital, which may not exceed 8% and on which the member has to pay tax. If there are any funds left, the co-operative has to pay them into a reserve fund, in accordance with a resolution taken by the members at the annual meeting. Then, if <span class="col_7591-7592" refersTo="page_0863"/>any balance is still available, the co-operative may, in the third place, pay it out to its members on the basis of the operational activities of every member within that co-operative. This differs from a company. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken spoke about the co-operative movement. I understand he is the chairman of a big co-op in the Transvaal and he obviously knows the subject very well. I believe on another occasion it will be necessary to debate the subject because there will be legislation dealing with this matter, so I will leave my comments until that time.</p>

<p>I was talking about the important effect which drought has on our farming life in South Africa. The hon. the Minister will know that there has been a change in the production of maize between two seasons of over 100%, caused very largely, I suppose, by drought. But I pose the question to the hon. the Minister whether this is entirely due to drought, or is it possibly due to incorrect planning in so far as agriculture is concerned&#x003F; I believe it is an expression of improper and incorrect planning. I say this because I believe implicitly that we are planting cash crops in areas in which cash crops should never have been planted, and this obviously will cause greater fluctuation in production and greater difficulty in estimating crop disposal, etc. This is only happening because there is not the proper price structure in so far as other pastoral commodities are concerned and the farmers are therefore forced to plant cash crops where they should not in fact be planted. This is a theme which is raised right throughout the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture, the improper use of land in South Africa. I raise this point because I think it is something to which serious attention will have to be given in the near future.</p>

<p>Then we come to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture. I believe this report is the most important document ever produced in respect of agriculture in South Africa. For the present we have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to these reports. I have no doubt that in due course we shall have the reaction in greater detail, but in the meantime we must use the statements that have been forthcoming. It is impossible in a debate of this kind to discuss all the implications of these reports, but one can make an assessment of the general implications and the recommendations.</p>

<p>My impression is that what the department needs most urgently, according to the message these reports bring to the hon. the Minister, is a body to co-ordinate and plan the agricultural industry on a long-term basis. I believe this is the message. As far as I am concerned and as I read these reports, this comes through most clearly.</p>

<p>I believe that lack of planning, lack of co-ordination creates malfunctioning and inefficient use of the vast resources available to the department. This department, in fact, has vast resources, not only of personnel, but of buildings and equipment that must be as good and as up-to-date as those with which any such department anywhere in the world has to operate. However, in spite of that, the problems which remain unsolved are far too many. There must be some problem somewhere and it must be in the field of co-ordination and in the field of proper planning. That is why I am supporting the hon. member for Newton Park when he pleads, as he so often has done and as my hon. leader has done, for a statutory planning council for agriculture.</p>

<p>I cannot mention all the cases during the time at my disposal where lack of planning has resulted in bottlenecks in the agricultural industry. I am only going to mention one or two. We start with the meat industry and more in particular, the beef industry. At the present time we are sitting with a shortage of beef in South Africa. Figures which the hon. the Minister gave me tried to imply that the supply is meeting the demand. Perhaps this is what the hon. the Minister tries to imply. However, I believe that were there more beef available today, it would have been readily bought up and consumed. I believe there is a shortage and the fact that there is such a shortage is entirely due to the fact that there was not proper planning way back in 1966. That was the time when it became obvious that we were going to run into a short-supply situation. At that time the department failed to produce the proper incentives towards greater production. Had they taken proper remedial action at that stage, we would not have been in a short-supply position at this stage.</p>

<p>We have only to look at a couple of comments that appeared in the Press recently. Here I have a statement by the Chairman of the Meat Board&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7593-7594" refersTo="page_0864"/>South Africa should aim at a 45% increase in its beef production over the next 12 years.</block>

<p>This should have happened before. We realized then years ago that we were going to have a position of short supply, but nothing was done. He said&#x2014;mark these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This could be done through co-ordinated programming and planning.</block>

<p>I believe this is a remark of which the hon. the Minister must take note. Here I have another report which states that an important gentleman in the Department of Agriculture&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; said South Africa exported on the average about two million tons of maize per year in the past five years. The Manager of the Maize Board estimated that by 1980 the country would export on an average five million tons a year. These massive quantities of maize are used for animal production overseas; why could it not be used internally to produce meat for export here, he asked.</block>

<p>South Africa should stop producing cash crops, such as maize and wheat, in marginal areas where cattle ranching could be the main enterprise. I believe this is the direction in which we must move. I believe that there should be proper incentives towards production. During the last week new prices for beef and mutton were announced. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister does not think that we took too long to come to the decision to provide prices that would in fact be an incentive to increase beef production. I think we have dragged our feet in this matter, and that is why we are experiencing this short-supply situation at the moment. The other day, I asked the Land Bank if they are providing short-term or medium-term hypothec loans to encourage beef production in South Africa.</p>

As my hon. Leader produces milk, this is producing beef for the consumer.</p>

<p>I have a document here from the S.A. Federation of Meat Traders.

The point I want to make is that he asked that we should state the National Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of the agriculturalist very clearly. The question more specifically dealt with was the question of the people on the platteland. We on this side are saying that we should like to keep our farmers on the <span class="col_7595-7596" refersTo="page_0865"/>farms. We should like to make it possible for them to remain there by making cheap production means available to them or by trying to negotiate these for them. Thirdly we want to keep them there because they are the ones who feed the entire population. They must ensure that there is enough food, and even a surplus amount of food, so that we can earn export currency with it. But here I want to confine myself to the provision of the means to be able to produce at a reasonably cheap price. In recent times it has become clear that millions of rands are being spent annually on advertisements by business undertakings who may claim this as a reduction from their income tax, business undertakings that are actually geared to competition, not only with their own colleagues, but also with agricultural undertakings, particularly co-operative societies. In support of that I just want to quote from the <i>Farmers Weekly</i> of 29th September, 1971. It is illuminating that that publication, which is supposed to be a purely agricultural publication, thinks fit to place such an article. This brings me to the basis of my discussion. The article reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Government attitude will change. Small farmers will increasingly become problem children in the eyes of the Government and public sympathy will harden against them. Extension services will eventually be withdrawn and financial assistance will have to disappear. The Government does not pamper small shopkeepers or small fertilizer companies&#x2014;why should it pamper small farmers&#x003F;</block>

<p>The point I want to make here is that it is broadcast to the world that the farmer is responsible for the high cost of living in this country. This is the reason why organized commerce and industry have passed resolutions at virtually every congress asking the Government to take steps against this great force which is emerging in the co-operative world, the operation of which they do not actually understand very well. It remains common knowledge, though, that a co-operative society, whether it be an agricultural co-operative or another co-operative, or a central co-operative&#x2014;and I am going to confine myself more to the central co-operatives &#x2014;is a consequence of the farmers&#x2019; activities on his farm. The fact is that the world has changes. If things were now the same as they were in the old days when the farmer could harvest his own maize, could grind it, package it as the packers today want it and could then offer it to private people at depots for which he had to pay rent, there would possibly have been no problems. But that is really thinking that has grown rusty; old-world thinking. These major price fluctuations are caused by people who establish large profitable businesses in competition with our food organizations, meat organizations, implement organizations and with our co-operative societies. The time has also come to give the ordinary man the opportunity to inspect these peoples&#x2019; books. It is a fact that in the co-operative world the books of co-operative societies are given for inspection to any interested party, with the result that people know what the internal workings of those co-operative societies are. In this connection I should like to quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Co-operatives will change. Within a few years it will become apparent that big agri-business will be by-passing them. This will have three simultaneous significant effects. Firstly, they will no longer be as powerful in influencing the shape of the industry; secondly, they will become associated in the mind of the Government with the very farmers whom they wish to see out of business (the small farmers living on credit) and, thirdly, they will start to suffer from significant bad debts, as their weaker members succumb to economic pressure. Government attitude will have to harden towards them. Their supply of cheap credit will dry up and their preferential tax privileges will come under review.</block>

<p>The idea being conveyed to our public is that the co-operative societies, which are continuing their activities in terms of the Co-operative Societies Act, are doing so in terms of so privileged a position that they are regarded as such a power factor that the Government ought to hold them responsible eventually if things are not going well with food prices and related articles. I now want to say something about what agricultural co-operatives and the co-operative home industries in the smaller towns mean to our housewives. In this respect I want to say thank you very much to the hon. the Minister for the cudgels he could take up for women throughout the country who belonged to these co-operative home industries, so that they can now again freely register provided certain requirements are <span class="col_7597-7598" refersTo="page_0866"/>met. It was, in the first place, an encroachment upon the right which housewives also had to furnish their own contributions to the downward trend we want in the cost of living. In addition, the whole concept we are dealing with here is that of higher costs, the higher cost of living for which that section of the population, which is active in agriculture, is supposedly responsible. It has been mentioned on this side of the House that agricultural co-operatives have found justification in serving as a means by coming between the producer and the consumer at a profit which is as low as possible. This is important because it keeps the cost of living low. Whether they get all their capital from the Land Bank, or whether they do not, is not very important as far as I am concerned; the fact remains that the majority of agricultural co-operatives work on a net profit of about <i>2%.</i> I challenge any commercial undertaking which is not going bankrupt, and which has to pay these large dividends to their shareholders and directors, to show us their statements in all honesty and tell us: &#x201C;We are working at a 2% profit.&#x201D; The moment the sources of provision are cut, it would mean that these co-operatives would have to go and get their money on the open market at an increased interest rate, which would eventually result in the prices of the products they produce taking an upward trend. In connection with this aspect the hon. member for Springs appealed here the other day to the Minister for an investigation into the high repair costs of motor cars. I want to link up with the hon. members&#x2019; plea. I want to go further and ask that, if possible, the Government should institute an investigation into the tremendous increases in costs in accessories and repairs to tractors and pick-ups and those articles which have an important share in the farmers&#x2019; production costs. Then this must be divided up into two parts, i.e. on a co-operative level and a non-co-operative level. Our books are open. We have come to the point of establishing central co-operatives registered throughout the country, for example the manufacturing division at our purchasing central co-operatives for agriculture and the central co-operatives for the handling of building matters, the erection of buildings and for importing.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the agricultural industry is probably one of the most hazardous industries in our country. And consequently agriculture is also saddled with many problems. We have in mind, for example, a problem such as changing natural phenomena like droughts, etc. Another very great problem is one which the hon. member, who has just spoken, touched upon, i.e. the high production costs. I should like to say a few words about that. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services is doing a great deal of research, and we are very grateful for the research they are doing, but there is one sphere in connection with which the department could do much better research and concentrate more on extra research, i.e. in the field of high production costs. We must see whether we cannot bring those production costs of the farmer down slightly. It is well known that the production costs are high. Over the past few years we have all been talking, as it is, about the high production costs of the farmer. It nevertheless seems as if there is not much that can be done about that. I just want to quote a few figures to show what I actually mean in this connection. The spending on short-term requirements increased during the past year to an estimated amount of R480 million, which is about 14% higher than it was in 1971. We can also look at a publication by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, i.e. <i>Trends in the Agricultural Sector,</i> in which we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1972 R121 million was spent on fertilizers, which was R32 million more than in 1971. Expenditure on repairs and maintenance of machinery and implements was R5,8 million higher, and that on fuel R4,4 million more.</block>

<p>Let us look at the producer prices. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The combined index for producer prices for agricultural products rose by about 10,4% in 1972.</block>

<p>One can take a look at this and bear in mind that production costs have increased by a great deal more. It has already been mentioned here that production costs increased by 14% in one year. The farmer&#x2019;s production costs are also much higher in many other spheres. The hon. member has already mentioned that the costs of repairs and accessories have also increased a great deal. I am also thinking of bags, artificial fertilizers and other production means, which the farmer also has to deal with. There is one sphere I should like to point to in this House this afternoon, a sphere in which the farmer, in my opinion, could still be accommodated to a large extent. <span class="col_7599-7600" refersTo="page_0867"/>The sphere I am referring to is the supply of electricity to the platteland. This matter is one of national importance, and I think that everyone who is a farmer regards it as a matter such. The provision of power is a tremendous cost item as far as farmers are concerned. In analysing this matter, we ask ourselves where the farmer must obtain his electricity from. In the first place he could obtain it, for example, by acquiring a power-generating system, a battery system. In the second place there are certain municipalities that supply electricity to the platteland and thirdly they can also obtain electricity from Escom. As far as the provision of electricity is concerned, there is a serious injustice being committed against the farmer. When a farmer obtains his electricity by way of a municipality or by way of Escom, he must erect those powerlines himself at his own cost. He must provide his own capital for the erection of those powerlines, for the transformers and for getting the electricity to him. Then he must still pay a basic levy over and above his unit costs. If one now takes the urbanite or factory man, one sees that he only pays for those units. Those initial capital costs are overhead expenses financed by Escom or by the municipality. One asks oneself why the farmer has to provide this capital. One asks oneself why he must finance Escom while Escom itself lends the capital to finance the urbanite. In my opinion this is a very great injustice. One also thinks of the fact that the electricity provided to the industrialist and the urbanite is very much cheaper than the electricity provided to the farmer. Then one must also think of the fact that the industrialist draws a very good salary from that industry. For example, he obtains dividends on his shares and, in addition, he obtains very good interest on his investments. The farmer, on the other hand, must pay more for his electricity, must finance his powerlines himself and obtains a very low return on his investment. All the farmers who are dependent upon one powerline simply cannot make use of the power and they cannot contribute their share to the erection of that powerline. If there are a few farmers who would like to have electricity, they apply to Escom for the supply of electricity and must then pay for that powerline. As more farmers wish to be connected to the powerline, they must contribute their share towards paying for the erection of the powerline. At present there are about 20 000 farmers in the Republic making use of electricity. This is about one-fifth of the total number of farmers in this country. If one were to look at what the national gross domestic product of the farmers is, one would see that it amounts to more than 10% of the country&#x2019;s total gross domestic product. For that reason one feels that the farmer is entitled to his electricity contribution. In his report, from which I have just quoted, one also sees that the total gross value of local agricultural production in 1972 was an estimated record amount of R1 654 million. One then asks oneself whether it would not be fair for the farmer to be treated in the same way as the industrialist as far as the provision of electricity is concerned. With a view to the fact that he is such a great asset to this country, he ought to be given the same treatment as the industrialist and the urbanite. One also asks oneself the question: To whose benefit would it be if cheaper electricity were provided to the agriculturist&#x003F; Would it not also be in the country&#x2019;s interests&#x003F; Would it not also be in the interests of the consumer&#x003F; Would it not help the farmer to produce more cheaply&#x003F; That is why I want to ask very seriously today that the hon. the Minister should really consider instituting an investigation into this whole matter, into the high production costs and the high costs of providing electricity to the agriculturist. I think the time is ripe to go into this matter thoroughly and to see whether we cannot reduce the production costs for the farmers. The whole country would benefit from that.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the maize industry has frequently in the past been singled out as the scapegoat for specific bottlenecks encountered in the economy, particularly since the word &#x201C;inflation&#x201D; has taken up a permanent place in our everyday conversation. This year it is again the case. In the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 5th April this year I read the following under the heading &#x201C;Now it&#x2019;s maize&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Only last week Dr. Diederichs said there was good reason to expect that the rate of inflation will before long decline. He must have been joking. The <i>Financial Mail</i> now learns that the Minister of Agriculture, Hendrik Schoeman, will announce next that it has been found impossible to avoid an increase in maize prices to both the producer and consumer. If this is the kind of thing <span class="col_7601-7602" refersTo="page_0868"/>we are in for in 1973, we would like to bet Dr. Diederichs that the consumer price index will rise faster this year than last year&#x2019;s 7,4%.</block>

<p>Sir, I should like to say that there must be an end to this nonsense about the slightest increase in producer prices, granted by the Government as a result of increasing production costs about which the farmer has no say in any case, being seized upon to try to make the country aware, each time, of the so-called increase in the cost of living which the farmer is causing the country. The hon. member for Newton Park was guilty of that again this afternoon. On the other hand, no-one is apparently concerned any longer about the tremendous burden of production costs that are piled onto farmers chiefly by commerce and industry.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Agriculture has already frequently expressed his opinion about an issued warnings against the increases in the selling prices of maize products which cannot be justified. In the 10 minutes at my disposal I do not have enough time to draw a comparison between the increase in the selling prices of maize products over the counter, <i>inter alia,</i> and the increase in the producer prices in respect of maize over the past five years. I am referring, in particular, to the past two years, since the control over the selling price of maize products was abolished.</p>

<p>The United Party must never again come and pose in this House as the so-called champions of the farmer, because they are not. What did they say this year when the hon. the Minister of Agriculture increased the maize price for the farmer in, I may say, an emergecy&#x003F; What did they say then&#x003F; &#x201C;United Party horrified at maize price&#x201D;, one heading reads. In the <i>Argus</i> of 13th April I read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Commenting on yesterday&#x2019;s announcement on increases in the price of mealies, grain sorghum, ground-nuts and sunflower seeds, the United Party agricultural group &#x2026;</block>

<p>They are the ones sitting there, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; said it deplored the increases.</block>

<p>That is the United Party, Sir, the people who pose here as the so-called friends of the farmer. I am telling them that it is altogether scandalous.</p>

<p>In the 10 minutes at my disposal I should also like to appeal to the Minister to reintroduce that control over the selling prices of maize products which was abolished. Sir, I should like to do so on the grounds that the farmer has a direct interest in the fact that there should be control over the selling prices of maize and maize products. I am doing it firstly in the interests of the consumer as well, because maize is still a staple foodstuff. I am doing it in the interests of the maize producer himself, because he would like to develop the local market to its maximum instead of having it bleed to death as a result of high prices. I am making this appeal to the Minister in the interests of the maize industry as a whole.</p>

<p>I should also like to say a few words about the position of bags as production cost items in the maize industry. In the past the view has frequently been adopted that the price of bags is not of any importance to the maize producer because the maize price is determined without consideration of the price of bags, the price of bags being added to the maize price subsequently. In various ways the maize producer does, in fact, have a direct interest in the price of bags. In the first place his interest lies in the fact that the Government subsidizes the consumer price of maize. Sir, this high price of bags must be paid by someone. If the producer does not pay it, then the consumer must&#x2014;someone must pay it, and because the consumer has to pay it, this is one of the reasons why the Government is compelled to subsidize the consumption of maize. Secondly the producer&#x2019;s interest lies in the fact that a high price for bags, which the consumer must pay, could build up purchaser resistance against maize, while the maize producer, as I have said, would like to see the local market developed to its maximum rather than have it bleed to death as a result of high prices. Thirdly his interest lies in the fact that the actual price which the farmer must pay for the bags is frequently higher commercially than the amount for which provision is made in the maize price. Sir, I want to emphasize that in my opinion jute bags are one of the most expensive of packing materials in which a cheap product like maize is packed. We must look for a cheaper packing material.</p>

<p>If a cheaper and more efficient plastic bag cannot be developed for the maize industry, something which I have previously advocated in this House, then I want to ask that a positive research programme be instituted as quickly as possible in respect of alternative fibres, and their cultivation, from which bags can be manufactured. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, the remark is made here that a plastic bag already exists. That may be so, but it is not yet being allowed to the maize industry. If it exists, we must be given the concession of using it in the maize industry, but we are not allowed to do so.</p>

<p>Sir, you are aware of the fact that in the early fifties the Government agreed to phormium tenax remaining the standard grain bag until 1980. I immediately want to add that this was done for good reasons. I do not have the time to outline those reasons, but I want to say that having its own bag industry is and can be of the utmost strategic value to this country. But the cultivation of phormium tenax was not very successful. Today, for example, we can import jute bags at a lower price than bags manufactured locally from phormium tenax, and for that reason we must see whether we cannot obtain an alternative fibre plant. I have also read in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 6th May, 1973, that there are only 34 of the original 68 phormium tenax growers left in the country, and this shows that, in actual fact, phormium tenax has finally failed as a fibre replacement for jute. There is an alternative plant, i.e. kenaf, and I think that we should now get away from the initial prejudice which obtained in relation to kenaf when it was still decorticated by decomposition and was not quite suitable for the industry. But with the new chemical decortication process, kenaf has become a competitive fibre, and the manufacture of bags from kenaf, or compounds of kenaf, can be undertaken quite economically in relation to phormium tenax bags and imported jute bags. There are many farmers in the Lowveld and elsewhere who are eager and keen to cultivate kenaf if they could find a good market for it. I think that the market could be created and that this market could be developed in such a way that we could even think of export possibilities. Therefore I should like to make an urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and the departments&#x2014;I see the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is also present&#x2014;for the green light to be given to those who are interested in manufacturing bags for our local industry from this fibre. I think it is time for us to seriously start making this possible. If we could bring that about and also succeed in developing a cheap plastic bag for the maize industry, I think we would furnish a great contribution not only towards helping the maize producer but also towards making maize available to the consumer more cheaply.

<p>That remark means very little, for it is not the truth.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I was dealing with the question of the planning in the agricultural department and I indicated to the Minister certain problems which had arisen in the meat industry. In the dairy industry we are in exactly the same situation. We suddenly found ourselves with an over-production of dairy products, so what did the Government do&#x003F; They lowered the price. After they had lowered the price, they suddenly found themselves with a shortage, so what did they do then&#x003F; They tried to import butter from overseas. While they were in the process of importing butter they suddenly decided, through the good offices of the Minister of Health, that yellow margarine should be manufactured. The net result of that was that many of the dairy farmers in South Africa decided that the dairy industry was not worth while. The result was that thousands of good dairy cows in South Africa were slaughtered. The result is that we now find ourselves with a shortage of butter, but because of unfavourable climatic conditions and a shortage of oilseed we have now also a shortage of <span class="col_7605-7606" refersTo="page_0870"/>margarine, and now we are again in the position where we have to look to overseas countries to supply our needs.</p>

<p>What is one of the most important things in any department which renders technical services&#x003F; I want to make special reference to this aspect. I refer to the extension officer. What do we find&#x003F; We asked the hon. the Minister how many extension officers they have available in the country at the present time. The answer is that there are 280 professional officers, but 37 posts are vacant. There are 281 technical officers, but 152 posts are vacant. In the answer I received from the hon. the Minister he worked it out that there is one extension officer to every 164 farmers in South Africa. For that hon. member&#x2019;s information I want to say that there are only 81 000 farmers left in the whole of South Africa. I hope he realizes that. That is how far the population of the rural areas has already progressed. I say that if the figures are worked out correctly, one will find that there are 180 extension officers in South Africa available to the department at the present time. If you divide 180 into 81 840 farmers, you find that there is one extension officer to every 420 farmers. If an extension officer tries to spend one day on one farm, he cannot visit all the farmers in his area in the course of a year. This is one of the problems the department has to contend with and this is why we are not making any progress. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to come back to the point in connection with the organization in the department. The hon. the Minister has accepted certain recommendations put forward in the report by the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture. If one looks at what he has accepted, one finds that he has to have an advisory board on agricultural credit. I am merely trying to indicate to the hon. the Minister all the boards which he will have to create. First there is this board to which I have already referred. The next one is a study committee of experts to investigate the hiring and letting system of agricultural land in South Africa. Then he will have to have a study commission which will be appointed to look into land tenure. The next is that he will have to have a control body to look into the control of the acquisition of land in South Africa. He will also have to have an institute of land-use planning. These are some of the recommendations which are made in this report. In addition he will have to have a national advisory board for the planning of agricultural production. In this connection it should be borne in mind that the hon. the Minister already has an agricultural advisory board. There is also an agricultural adviser to the Prime Minister. I want to ask the hon. the Minister <span class="col_7607-7608" refersTo="page_0871"/>whether this is not going to be a top-heavy organization that will find it quite impossible to function on a properly co-ordinated basis. Does it not lead him to think that somewhere there must be a central body at the top to co-ordinate all the activities of all these advisory boards that are recommended to him in this commission&#x2019;s report&#x003F; I cannot possibly see how his department can function on the basis which is being adopted at the present time. In addition to that, he will know that many of the activities and schemes administered by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, for example the bull-testing scheme, artificial insemination, fleece-testing schemes, the studbook associations, the activities of all the breed societies in which the department has an interest, the import and export of livestock, etc., are controlled by Acts of Parliament which were passed by this House. I believe just to properly control the breeding of animals in South Africa, whether cattle, sheep or goats, we need a proper body of control. The time may well have come when a special Act of Parliament has to be passed to consolidate all these Acts already applying in respect of these aspects of agriculture. I cannot possibly see how the Minister can control all these activities on his own, unless he establishes an agricultural planning council that can give proper, cool, calm and collected attention to the activities of this vast department of which he is the Minister.</p>

<p>What is worse still, is that the department has three separate Secretaries. There is a Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, a Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services, and a Secretary for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. Surely, a ministry of this size needs one person who can co-ordinate the activities of these different departments. It seems to me illogical. The hon. the Minister will know that there appears in this report that has been published by the department &#x201C;&#x2019;n kort begrip van die departementele aktiwiteite en prestasies van 1958 tot 1972&#x201D;. On page 10 of that report comment is given as regards &#x201C;vordering op landbou-tegniese gebied&#x201D;. It is reported how the Minister&#x2019;s department attempted in three instances to reorganize itself. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Then the hon. member stated the old, old policy of the United Party, the one which we already know and by means of which they have made such progress in the rural areas over the years that there are virtually no members opposite who are representatives of rural seats! This policy of theirs, which is stated in that yellow booklet and was once again repeated here this afternoon, namely that we should guarantee the farmer production costs plus profit, has often been debated in this House. But for the sake of the record I just want to ask him again: In a year such as this year, when the maize industry is virtually experiencing a complete crop failure and certain areas produced no maize whereas others had a reasonable crop, what price would the hon. member have given the maize farmer under his policy, seen in the light of the present circumstances,</p>

<p>You did not listen to what I had to say about how one could remedy the position.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must tell us whether R4-50, which is the price we determined this year, is too low, whether he would have determined the price on the basis of the average production in as exceptional a year as this year, or whether he would also have guaranteed production costs plus a profit to the farmer who could not even plant anything and whose fertilizer was lost as a result of the drought. Then the hon. member said&#x2014;this is their policy&#x2014;that prices for agricultural produce had to be announced beforehand. Now, if it had to happen this year that the hon. member, according to his policy, had announced a price for the maize farmer of South Africa before we were hit by this disastrous season, I wonder what he would have done at the end of this year with the price he would have announced beforehand; for, surely, this could never have been in the interests of the maize farmer.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the depopulation of the rural areas again. In <i>Die Vaderland</i> of 13th December, 1967, there was a report of what had been said by the commission which had dealt with that matter, namely that the drought conditions of 1966 could be regarded as being one of the main reasons for the migration from the rural areas. This year&#x2019;s drought will definitely not have that effect again, and this will be the case because of the <span class="col_7609-7610" refersTo="page_0872"/>policy of this Government and because we appointed in the meantime the commission of inquiry into the agricultural industry, which analysed the internal problems and bottlenecks within the agricultural industry. We have taken the necessary measures.</p>

<p>I should like to come to another important matter, and that is the question of the maize industry as a whole. The maize industry is our largest single agricultural industry in this country. The weal and woe of approximately 30 000 maize farmers is very closely connected with what is happening in this industry. This year we were faced with tremendous cost increases, as my hon. friend also said. On the other hand we were also faced with price increases for the consumer. Now it is my pleasant privilege to extend my sincere thanks to the hon. the Minister for the most responsible manner in which, on the one hand, he gave the farmer his due, namely a 20% increase in his price, whereas, on the other hand, he did not allow the consumer price to rise excessively. Recently quite a big fuss was made in the newspapers by the United Party&#x2014;this was pointed out by my hon. friend for Odendaalsrus&#x2014;in which they said that these prices should have been subsidized to such an extent that there should have been no need for the consumer to pay more.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. member that the National Party, after assuming the reins of government in 1948, started with a subsidy on maize for the consumer, which amounted to R2,6 million in that year. This subsidy was gradually increased to R38,5 million, which is the amount in respect of the past year. I want to extend my sincere thanks to the Government for having done its duty in respect of the consumer in this country over the years. The consumer and the producer in this country go hand in hand and should not fly at each other or try to steal a march on each other. However, the United Party wants to have the best of both worlds. On the one hand they want to butter up the farmer, but on the other hand they also want to butter up the consumer.</p>

<p>A case has now been made out here to the effect that, by way of this increase in the maize price, we are doing an injustice to the underprivileged section of our population. In the 21st report of the Bureau of Market Research a market survey was published in which reference was made to the consumption and the domestic spending of the Whites and the Bantu in the urban complexes. According to that survey the Bantu are spending 22,5 % of their money on cereal foods. Now, if one bears in mind that the price of a bag of maize has been increased by 70 cents, this increase comes to only 6 cents per month for such a Bantu. This matter is being blown up as if this were an impossible position.</p>

<p>Maize is still the cheapest source of energy for any person in this country. We merely have to consider the achievements of the sportsman who eats maize porridge. Then we may also have regard to the beneficial effect which it has on the cholesterol content in our blood. Because maize used to be cheap in the past, people thought that it was an inferior product. We must raise the maize price, for then people will also buy it more easily because then they will know that it is worth something.</p>

<p>In respect of the 50 cent emergency payment which the Minister granted the farmers this year, I want to extend my thanks to him. I just want to say a few things in this regard. On the other side of the House the argument was advanced that devaluation had not been in the interests of South Africa. I just want to say that as far as the maize farmer is concerned, last year alone we saved R3,4 million on an export of 1,6 million tons of maize. The figure for this year is much higher. On 1,6 million tons the additional revenue was R3,4 million, and on this year&#x2019;s export the amount of money benefited was such that we were in a position to pay out R45 million to the maize farmer of South Africa. The success with which the agriculturist of South Africa has been able to practise agriculture&#x2014;and I say this in a responsible manner&#x2014;is attributable, on the one hand, to the policy of the National Party Government and, on the other hand, to the fact that he has organized himself in a co-operative structure. Our co-operatives have performed a tremendous task in this country over the years. This was pointed out by hon. members on my side, and I do not wish to elaborate on it. I can but say that as far as the maize industry is concerned, they received more than 87% of the maize crop last year. Just think of these co-operative organizations in terms of employers; in terms of an instrument for, also, promoting orderly marketing in this country; in terms of the stability which they have guaranteed to us as farmers; think of the large storage facilities provided by them, <span class="col_7611-7612" refersTo="page_0873"/>for which they pay out of funds which they borrow from the Land Bank and which they pay back by way of storing maize and providing it to the consumers of our country. I think our consumers do not always realize what a major asset these cooperatives were to them in the past. I also want to bring something to the notice of the hon. the Minister: An amount of approximately R25 million or R26 million goes directly to the consumer for the storage and handling of maize in this country. This is referred to as a subsidy, which is confusing. Many of the people think it is only the maize farmer who is benefiting by it, whereas it is actually the consumer who is getting the benefit of that storage subsidy.</p>

<p>I should like to mention another matter which is very important to my mind. The other hon. member also referred to it. I refer to the advanced age of people in the agricultural industry. I have here the latest figures in that regard. The number of farmers in the agricultural industry, expressed as a percentage, are: under 20 years of age, 1,3%; 20 to 24, 4,8%; 25 to 34, 15,5%; 35 to 44, 18,9%; 45 to 54, 21,7%; 55 to 64, 23%; and over 65, 14,8%. I admit that the average age is too high. I should like to see far more of our young people entering the agricultural industry. However, it is an expensive industry, but the Government is doing everything in its power to help. Now I want to point out that the Government had confidence in the young man of South Africa when, in 1957, it granted him the franchise at the age of 18. Now I ask that the Government should also have confidence in the young farmer of South Africa and that we should grant the person who has the franchise&#x2014;in other words, all of them who are 18 years of age&#x2014;the legal authority to be able to do business if his case can be dealt with on merit by the Department of Agricultural Credit. In a year of calamity, such as this year, these are the very people who do not as yet have substantial security with their co-operatives or other organizations, and who land in the greatest difficulties. Let us have confidence in these people and also create legal authority for them. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I take pleasure in availing myself of this particular opportunity to join previous speakers who expressed their congratulations to the hon. the Minister and also to the hon. the Deputy Minister on acting here today in their new capacities as Minister and Deputy Minister, respectively. Therefore we also want to avail ourselves of this opportunity to wish them every success and all the best for the years ahead.</p>

<p>The farmers of South Africa are good, hard-working and honest people, but there is one thing I know about South Africa, and that is that its climatic conditions are the harshest in the world. That is why a Minister of Agriculture in South Africa also has tremendous problems to solve in regard to the agricultural industry. However, we hope and trust that the severe droughts we had in past years will not recur during the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s term of office, but that during his term of office we shall have fine and good years so that we may look forward to a good future for the agricultural industry in South Africa. Therefore I want to wish the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister success and good luck for the years ahead.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with a resolution that was adopted recently at a North-Eastern Cape agricultural congress, namely to request the hon. the Minister to declare next year to be an Agricultural Year, and to celebrate it as an Agricultural Year. Having listened to the sad tidings being spread on the other side of the House, I feel that it really has become time for us to sell the agricultural industry. The agricultural industry is a dynamic industry with a dynamic economy. When one speaks to the consumers outside, one realizes that they are under the impression that the agricultural industry is just like a day-old sparrow which is only fed from above. They are of the opinion that the agricultural industry is being subsidized entirely by the State, whereas this is not the case. The agricultural industry has an economy which stands on its own legs. The hon. member for Virginia mentioned the huge amount of R780 million, which is the amount of the annual turnover of agricultural co-operatives. What about the R700 million in foreign exchange which our agricultural industry is earning&#x003F; Today the agricultural industry is still the most important earner of foreign exchange, and for that very reason the agricultural economy is one of the most important economies of South Africa. We must familiarize the consumer and everybody in South Africa with the agricultural industry, for it is of very great importance. Whenever I listen to the hon. members on <span class="col_7613-7614" refersTo="page_0874"/>the other side of the House, I think of the Wailing Wall of Jerusalem. Every year they come together here in order to complain about the conditions in the agricultural industry. As a practical farmer I am the last one who will not concede that there are in fact bottlenecks in the agricultural industry. It is true that bottlenecks do exist, but what economic industry in South Africa does not have them&#x003F; The agricultural industry is no exception. For that reason, therefore, I want to refer to it today. The hon. member for Newton Park spoke about our young farmers. Let me point out to the hon. member for Newton Park that recently, three weeks ago, it was my privilege to address a young farmers&#x2019; association in Griqualand East. Of the farmers who attended the meeting of that farmers&#x2019; association, 95% were under the age of 35. Why is this the case&#x003F; This is the case because that area still has inexpensive land and because that region has a good rainfall. Nobody can expect young farmers to move to places which are over-capitalized and also expect such farmers to make a proper living. These are things we cannot expect of our young farmers. Therefore, in that part which has not been over-capitalized, the young farmers are making a good living. South Africa&#x2019;s young farmers are prepared to farm provided that the opportunity to do so is created for them, but they are not prepared to farm on an uneconomic basis.</p>

<p>I have already said that there are bottlenecks in the agricultural industry. Farming has developed into a self-supporting, vital industry, and it is founded on commercial principles today. In view of the fact that the agricultural industry is founded on commercial principles, it is no longer a way of life, as it used to be in the olden days, but more in the nature of a business undertaking. Since this is the case, I feel that there is a deficiency in the long-term financing of the agricultural industry. I should like to dwell on this for a few moments.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is welcome to say &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;, but I am at least being positive and not negative in my approach. I really feel that the agricultural industry should now bring home to our people a positive approach, and that we should not always be negative in respect of everything we do in the agricultural industry. As far as long-term financing in the agricultural industry is concerned, we must have a new approach, we must provide for a new dispensation. In this respect, I think, it will be of interest if I referred briefly to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Agricultural Matters, which was tabled last year. The Land Banks&#x2019; percentage investment in agricultural mortgages is 28,9, that of Agricultural Credit is 9,3, that of insurance companies is 10,4, that of the agricultural co-operatives is 2,2, that of banking institutions is 15,4, that of other financial institutions is 13,6, that of other persons is 13 and that of other organizations is 1,6. One of the biggest problems I have encountered in my constituency, developed as a result of the terrible droughts that prevailed. Especially during the years 1968 and 1969, when a great deal of money was in circulation in South Africa, the banks were saying, in spite of the mortgages which farmers already had, &#x201C;Purchase another piece of land. We shall grant you a 100% mortgage&#x201D;. This was not only done by banks; it was also done by other financial institutions. The effect this had was that when the interest rates rose, the agricultural industry could not keep up; and that was when those financial institutions called in the mortgages. At that stage the poor farmers had to turn to other organizations in order to obtain mortgages. Many of our farmers experienced problems in this respect, and many of them can still not be financed today as a result of the fact that these long-term funds do not exist. Therefore I want to plead today that a different course be adopted. I have already mentioned that the Land Bank&#x2019;s percentage investment in agricultural mortgages was 28,9; today it is already more than 30. I feel that that percentage should systematically be increased further, so that the Land Bank may play a bigger role in the financing of mortgages in South Africa. This matter is of very great importance, for in order to bring about a sound agricultural economy and to keep it sound, we must have a sound system of financing. Especially in South Africa, with its risky farming conditions, where nature periodically strikes at the agricultural industry, we must have a sound system of financing. I think the Land Bank is the obvious body which is in a position to comply with this basic requirement.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was interested earlier on to hear <span class="col_7615-7616" refersTo="page_0875"/>the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet say by way of interjection: &#x201C;You cannot blame the Government for bad farming.&#x201D; I would suggest to him that you cannot blame the farmers for a bad Government. In the short time at my disposal I want to discuss the country&#x2019;s agricultural shop-window, the agricultural society shows. When any breeder in this country requires stock from overseas to improve his own herd or his own flock of sheep, or even his own thoroughbred horses, he knows that the only way in which he can choose the best stock from overseas countries is to time his visit overseas to coincide with agricultural shows in other parts of the world. This is done, and it is only natural that buyers overseas who want to improve their stock with pedigreed stock from our country, should time their visits to South Africa to coincide with our shows here. Now I want to mention something which has been brought to my notice in this regard. During this session, and especially after the recent budget&#x2014;and after all is said and done we are discussing the Budget here today and how the money should be spent&#x2014;we have found that the Government is working directly against the agricultural shows. The tariffs and railway rebates in respect of these shows are no longer satisfactory. In this year&#x2019;s Budget the rail tariffs on all stock sent to agricultural shows were doubled, and in many cases more than doubled. I mentioned earlier on in the session the problems which some farmers encountered when sending their red poll cattle to the national championships at Goodwood, and how much extra they have had to pay. Now this has gone even further. Due to the increased rail tariffs the number of pedigreed stock at the Bloemfontein show, for instance, decreased alarmingly this year. The hon. the Minister of Transport said earlier in the session that because pedigreed stock being sent to shows was of a very high quality, he saw no reason why the farmers should not pay increased rail tariffs in respect of such stock. I believe that that is no argument at all. There are many enterprising young farmers in South Africa today who are starting from the bottom and who want to advertise their pedigreed stock. It is indeed very unfair that we should call upon these young farmers, and in fact all farmers sending stock to agricultural shows, to pay these tremendously increased rail tariffs. I am pleased to see that the Minister of Finance is here to hear this.</p>

<p>During April we had the horse yearling sales in Johannesburg. What did we find there&#x003F; Today, because stock is so badly handled on the railways, and has been badly handled on the railways over the past few years, breeders of thoroughbred horses no longer choose to send their horses to the yearling sales in Johannesburg by rail. They transport them by motor lorry along our main and national roads. I know of a very well-known breeder from Dordrecht who transported no less than 47 horses to the yearling sales in Johannesburg in April.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the 47 horses realized R350 000, but this is not the point. That breeder was prepared to pay far more to transport his horses to the Johannesburg yearling sales by road instead of by rail, and he did so. Those 47 horses were transported by road and it cost him R200 extra. In other words, it cost him R200 more than it would have cost him had he sent his horses by rail, but at least when they arrived in Johannesburg&#x2014;a couple of days earlier than they would have arrived had they gone by rail&#x2014;not one of those horses was injured. This has not been the case in the past. Mr. Chairman, surely it is only reasonable to suppose that the Railways are losing out in this respect&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am pleading with the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to consider the question of railway tariffs on agricultural products, livestock, and&#x2014;this is more important&#x2014;to make recommendations on behalf of the agricultural industry to the Minister of Finance. After all, we are discussing the Budget, Mr. Chairman. We are actually losing out in respect of finance, because the people are no longer using the Railways. They are using motor transport instead, which is not really desirable, bearing in mind the heavy traffic on our roads today. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture must bear in mind, too, that there are certain items in our economy in regard to which we must get our priorities right. This is one item in agriculture where the agricultural societies should be <span class="col_7617-7618" refersTo="page_0876"/>assisted and where the farmer sending pedigree stock to the agricultural society shows should be assisted by reducing this tariff. After all is said and done, if it was brought down to what it was before the last Budget, the Government will not go broke on it at all; it is not such a big item when it comes to our national Budget, but it means a lot to the young farmer who is starting in life.</p>

<p>While I am on the question of tariffs, I want to deal with the tariff on one of the main items used in the production of fertilizer, and that is agricultural lime. Agricultural lime today is being marketed by Centramark or Amcor at the rate of R5 per ton, and last year it cost R14 per AZ truck to transport agricultural lime from Meyerton to Tarlton, which is only about 25 or 30 miles away. As we know, Sir, there is a great demand for agricultural lime in the Tarlton area, and today it costs no less than R7 per ton from Meyerton to Tarlton on the S.A. Railways, and this makes the proposition hopelessly uneconomic.</p>

If need be, Sir, I could produce a petition with many names within a week to lend weight to such an appeal, through the Minister of Agriculture to the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with the rebate on feeding, and here I am thinking of a large meeting which was held at Calvinia only recently by a group of agricultural union farmers who were concerned about this item.

<p>Sir, many of the problems which the hon. the Minister is usually saddled with in this Vote are caused by factors beyond his control. However, one problem remains in respect of which I think he cannot evade responsibility and complicity, and that is the drought we have experienced in this House the past few days. In that connection I have very seriously asked myself how the Government, the hon. the Minister and his colleagues could do such a thing to this country, i.e. how they could give the United Party men such a thrashing that we had what we have had here the last two days. Sir, a natural drought is an alarming disaster, but a spiritual drought, such as that which prevails amongst the United Party men at the moment, is almost unbearable, and it is fatal to this country. The hon. the Minister will have to give very serious consideration to this situation. Sir, I note that in Germany there is a very urgent demand for eggfruit and pumpkins but the condition is that they must, however, be juicy and not altogether shrivelled up. If the hon. the Minister bears that in mind, he is slowly going to have to start moving.</p>

<p>Sir, I am just standing up to present for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consideration the fact that we must avail ourselves of the opportunity which has presented itself in recent months, i.e. the demand for fresh South African agricultural products&#x2014;fruit and vegetables &#x2014;in the Euromart countries, and particularly in the light of the very positive steps which the Government has taken in connection with the promotion of exports. We recently had a visitor, Prof. Manty of the University of Berlin, a technical university, who stated in very strong terms that the marketing possibilities for South African flowers, to take one example, are virtually unlimited. Sir, the demand for, the turnover in, the consumption of eggfruit, green peppers and pumpkins is increasing by as much as 226% per year.</p>

<p>The opinion of the learned visitor from Germany in this specific case was that, although they are at present attempting to negotiate and liaise with other countries of Africa, also with a view to making specialist knowledge and capital available to them so that they would be able to provide for this very serious need on the Continent today, i.e. the lack of vegetables and fresh fruit, Germany would not be prepared to go further with the negotiations with and capital investments in the developing countries of Africa if countries like South Africa, with whom trade ties already exist, would give attention to this problem. I <span class="col_7619-7620" refersTo="page_0877"/>want to tell the hon. the Minister that this is a very serious matter as far as I personally am concerned, particularly with a view to the future of our gold mines in South Africa, and the very strong need there has been, until recently, to obtain foreign exchange.</p>

<p>I think South Africa is in this favourable position because of the advantage of its seasons in so far as it has a longer and slightly later season than competing countries in these markets to which I have already referred. This places South Africa in a very favourable position for sound competition, when one views this in the light of our sunshine and space and the scattered distribution of our vegetable producers in this country, this distribution being a significant factor in regard to losses suffered as a result of droughts and frost. I think we are in a very favourable position to be able to develop, but then we must act quickly and on a broad basis. We must not only provide fruit and vegetables for South Africa&#x2019;s kitchen and for a large part of Africa: we must, in the full sense of the word, supply the Continent of Europe&#x2019;s kitchen Euromart. I personally view this as a very serious matter. I think we have the farmers and the areas, and now we have the opportunities with air transport to be able to get these products on to the markets of Paris, London, Hamburg and other cities within 24 hours and in a perfectly fresh condition. I think we would be neglecting our duty if we did not take this opportunity.</p>

<p>There is a small group of farmers who have already taken the initiative in this respect and established a co-operative society with a view to the marketing of fresh products in these Euromart countries. Sir, you know yourself that as far as our uncontrolled agricultural products are concerned, we already export on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, through small local and overseas agencies, to the tune of more than R100 million per year. I foresee in the establishment of this co-operative society a specialist service which could then handle and develop the export of all agricultural products in such a way that the producer and the consumer can have the best possible service and quality. I think the time is very convenient. My friendly appeal to the hon. the Minister is that he and his department, in co-operation with his colleagues, the Minister of Economic Affairs and, in connection with transport rates, the Minister of Transport, should lend a characteristically friendly ear to and adopt a sympathetic attitude towards the producers who are attempting to render a service not only in their own interests but also in the interests of the nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened carefully to the solutions which the hon. member for Newton Park furnished for our farming problems, and if I take a look at these solutions it becomes clear to me that he has lost all confidence in the South African farmer. He wants the State to support the farmers in every possible manner. Let us take a look at just a few of those things. He mentioned a cost-plus basis. Is that not a motion of no confidence in the farmers&#x003F;</p>

<p>He speaks of a subsidy on railway rates. He also referred to a State-supported insurance scheme. In addition he asked for guaranteed minimum prices which should be adapted from time to time. There are probably some good points in those cases, but I am merely mentioning them to point out that the United Party has lost confidence. I am consequently glad that the hon. member for Randburg spoke about the great possibilities which farmers are latching on to. We still have many farmers with initiative in the country. There are many farmers who are farming progressively.</p>

<p>This evening I want to confine myself, in particular, to the extensive foreign exchange earnings of our farmers who venture into the export market. In spite of the very changeable climate that we have in South Africa, we can say that our farming products are amongst our country&#x2019;s biggest and most profitable export means. If we think of the export products furnished by our mines, we have to acknowledge that these are vanishing assets. In farming, however, we have an asset which we can build up for the future.</p>

<p>Over the past year we have had an increase of almost 34% in the export of farming products. This has ensured an improvement in our balance of payments which has created a basis for the economic boom we have had in the Republic. We see, in addition, that as a result of these foreign exchange earnings, agriculture in this country has also become indispensable as an employer. It is also indispensable as <span class="col_7621-7622" refersTo="page_0878"/>a supplier of raw materials for other export articles and, of course, also as a provider of food. Agriculture is also a good client. It purchases production means, mechanical equipment, fuel and all the other farming requirements. There is a tremendous business potential in agriculture which is being injected into the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<p>During the past 25 years&#x2014;the period also happens to coincide with the National Party&#x2019;s period of rule&#x2014;our agricultural production has increased by 4% per year while the population increase in the corresponding period was 3%. This indicates to me that agriculture is also able to keep pace as far as these essential services to our people are concerned. By means of modern methods and the initiative, which I spoke about initially, we shall also succeed in keeping ahead in future.</p>

<p>In future the emphasis will fall increasingly on greater and better production. This is not a rich agricultural country, but in spite of that I say that we shall succeed in providing what is necessary. We shall also succeed in competing on the world markets. We are already doing so. In this connection I want to refer to a few products. There are our karakul pelts and fruit such as apples which are doing well overseas in spite of high rates. There is also our citrus fruit which has succeeded in competing on the world markets as a result of good advertising. Last year our citrus fruit was sold at an average of R1 more per box than other competitive fruit. By virtue of good quality our maize farmers are creating markets overseas and they are not experiencing any problem in selling overseas when they have a surplus. I am thinking of our wool industry, with its very good organization and its liaison with world organizations, which succeeds in competing on the world markets.</p>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. the Minister of Agriculture that we must get away from the idea that surpluses are a danger. Surpluses can be sold and they can be converted into foreign currency.</p>

<p>We have our control boards which link groups of farmers together and which, with effort and good advertising, create new markets for us and build up contracts for us with countries abroad. This is of great value to the country.</p>

<p>However, the State must also do its share, and in that connection I want to refer to the concessions which are, in fact, made by the authorities. There is, for example, the concession made by the Railways as far as export products are concerned. The value of this is estimated at R22 million. Export financing is also taken care of for the industries. I also want to refer to the Reynders report in which quite a number of recommendations are made for benefiting industry. I want to ask whether agriculture would also be able to share in the benefits to the extent recommended for industry in that report. I think it is important that those benefits should also be obtained for agriculture.</p>

<p>I also want to mention the matter which my hon. friend, the member for Randburg, broached in connection with airlines. There is a great potential in export by air. I am glad the hon. the Minister of Transport is present in the House at the moment, because I want to thank him for the concession that was made last year in that the rate for air transport from Cape Town to countries abroad was made equal to that from Jan Smuts Airport to countries abroad. It was virtually impossible for the farmers of the Western Cape to compete on the foreign markets with their strawberries and other products, but then he agreed to air freight rates from D. F. Malan Airport being made equal to those from Jan Smuts Airport. Since it is possible to export products by air, this enables us to produce a greater variety of export products. This also results in our being able to have a greater spread in our seasons and can result in our being able to bring our products to the markets earlier and in a better condition. This could also result in seasonal surpluses being eliminated. In that connection I am thinking, for example, of our grape production, there being certain varieties which we have a surplus of during certain months of the year. If we could get some of those grapes on the market three weeks earlier, we would bring about a better utilization of the product and more beneficial distribution. There are many products for which there are great marketing possibilities if transport by air could be used. In that connection I am thinking of strawberries, sweetmelons, peaches, plums, cherries, egg fruit, green peppers and the tropical fruits such as avocado pears and mangoes, and in addition there are cut flowers and wild flowers. There are many possibilities along these lines and I am glad that our Government is also giving attention to these matters and helping where it is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="col_7623-7624" refersTo="page_0879"/>Agriculture is not asking for favours. We are prepared to compete on the open markets of the world, because we have the people with the necessary initiative and perseverance. However, we find that other countries&#x2019; export industries are protected. I would consequently be glad if the hon. the Minister would also give thought to this. We see, for example, that American citrus fruit is sold at simply any price on world markets. They virtually &#x201C;dump&#x201D; the fruit there with the idea that they would thereby be able to maintain a good price in their own country. In Argentinia, for example, export products are classified as &#x201C;promotion products&#x201D; and the producers then obtain credit facilities and advances at low rates of interest. These are all methods that are employed to make it possible for their products to compete on world markets. I think it would be a good thing if we in this country were also to make a study of this, continually bearing in mind, in particular, the recommendations of the Reynders Commission so that we shall also be able to obtain the necessary benefits for our agricultural products.</p>

<p>However, I am not asking for protection where it is not necessary. I am only asking for it where it is necessary for us to compete and develop new markets. I am also requesting it in the light of the possibility that we shall encounter boycotts, &#x201C;dumping&#x201D; and disproportionate rates in certain markets for political reasons. I have in mind, for example, the E.E.C., which has virtually established a prohibitive import right on apples of R2-15 per carton. It would have been completely impossible for our apple farmers to have continued with the export of apples if it were not for the very high prices we happened to obtain overseas. I think we should also give attention to this.</p>

<p>If we look at the various advantages recommended by the Reynders Commission, I think it is a good thing to focus attention on the fact that the following advantages, <i>inter alia,</i> are being recommended for the industry: reduced railway rates, concessions on interest on the shipment of products and on the advance payment of fees in that connection, reduced rates for the transport of raw materials to the harbours and a State contribution of 40% for market research.

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the outset of his speech the hon. member for Humansdorp spoke about creditworthy farmers and said, quite rightly, that there were many creditworthy farmers in our country. I agree with him wholeheartedly. There definitely are many creditworthy farmers in South Africa today; but there are also many farmers in the country who are not creditworthy.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, Sir, what is the solution to this problem&#x003F; I want to suggest that we must see to it that those farmers who are creditworthy are kept creditworthy in South Africa. The farmers who are not creditworthy must be kept on the land, I would almost say, at all costs, in order that they can continue producing more and more food for our ever-growing population. There is a growing shortage of food staring us all in the face. Having said that, how do we go about it&#x003F; I do not make a habit of offering the Government solutions, but I want to suggest a few points which I believe need careful consideration.</p>

<p>We want, first of all, a long-term rebate in order that farmers can build up their own fodder-banks for the next drought, which is coming. If the feeding loans can be frozen over a period of, say, five years, farmers can reduce their local debts first. The feeding loans are increasing with accumulated interest rates. Or I suggest that the feeding loans be paid off over a period of 10 years at 2&#x00BD;% interest, making loans available at a lower rate. Other institutions also get loans at lower rates than the farmer is paying on feeding loans at present. Why should the farmer not enjoy a lower rate of interest&#x003F; These loans should, as I say, be frozen for 10 years.</p>

<p>Then I suggest an insurance scheme to cover feeding debts. It can be on a voluntary basis. If we have an insurance scheme to cover feeding debts, a farmer&#x2019;s family will not be left embarrassed with a drought-feeding encumbrance should he pass away. I believe this is something, too, which we should seriously consider. There are still many farmers experiencing a very difficult time. I know that they will not be able to redeem their drought feeding debts in the very near future either, because there are still large areas of South Africa suffering under a severe drought.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I just want to touch on the stock reduction scheme which we on this side of the House have always supported. I believe it is a wonderful scheme, and it will be a sad day when the Cabinet decides to do away with it. I sincerely hope there is no thought of that. I know the problems <span class="col_7625-7626" refersTo="page_0880"/>facing the hon. the Minister and the department in this regard, but I do make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to carry on with this scheme as long as he possibly can. To me it is a strange thing that when a farmer qualifies for the stock reduction scheme because his farm is situated in a scheduled area, he invariably is not interested.</p>

<p>*Then many farmers say, &#x201C;No, I do not want the Government to tell me how I am to farm; I am master of my own concern.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x2020;I know this is said, and it is wrong. On the other hand, there are many farmers who would like to subscribe to the scheme, but because their farms are not situated in a scheduled area, they do not qualify. But it is a great pity that there should be so many farmers today who are not prepared to volunteer to go in for this scheme at all. Ever since the scheme started, I and many of us on this side have tried our best to persuade some farmers to consider going in for this scheme. Now, how do we encourage them&#x003F; Surely, there must be a way of encouraging every farmer to go in for this scheme&#x003F; I know it is a difficult proposition to these farmers who are so stubborn and will not entertain this scheme. Of course we agree that the scheme is not a short-term money spinner at all. This scheme was not introduced to bring money into the agricultural industry. In very many cases we find that the subsidies paid out under the scheme barely cover the interest which many farmers have to pay. But nevertheless, despite all this, as a long-term policy it is an excellent scheme. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has any ideas as to how we can persuade more farmers to consider the scheme, but I would suggest that the Government tell the farmers that it will be very sympathetic towards those farmers who subscribe to the scheme when the next drought hits them. Those who have concentrated on this scheme will enjoy the Government&#x2019;s sympathy. I do not say the Government needs to commit itself in regard to those who refuse to join the scheme, but it is comforting to know that if you subscribe to the Government&#x2019;s scheme and the Soil Conservation Act, you will always enjoy the support and the sympathy of whatever Government is in power. This is something which I think we should exploit. While dealing with this scheme, I want to say as my colleague, the hon. member for Walmer, mentioned, that there is a great shortage of extension officers. There must surely be a reason for all the vacancies in the Service. Of course it is a matter of rands and cents. Why do so many of our young extension officers, with a B.Sc. (Agric.) qualification, work for a short while in this country and then settle in Rhodesia&#x003F; Obviously they must be paid more in Rhodesia. I am not suggesting that we must raise the salaries, but it is quite evident that they regard the salaries as not good enough. I would suggest&#x2014;I know it would meet with the approval of many of our men in the Service&#x2014;that when they want to acquire a house to live in, money should be made available to them to purchase the house at a lower rate of interest. They should receive some concession. This would not have an inflationary effect. I believe it would stabilize the cost of living to a certain extent and keep many of them happy. This, I believe, is one reason why they are leaving our country. They leave the country because they believe they cannot come out on their salaries. I know that some of them cannot, but if the Government would consider making this concession to them, I believe we would keep far more of them happy in the service of soil conservation. We all agree that they are doing a wonderful job. We could never do without them. We have far too few of them in South Africa. But at the same time I want to suggest to many of my friends in agriculture that they make more use of the services of our extension officers. They are qualified men; they know what they are talking about, and it is a great pity that more of us do not accept their sound advice.</p></speech>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, several hon. members on this side of the House have come along this afternoon with very good arguments and proof to the effect that farmers, producers and the Government are not always to blame for the increasing living costs or the increase in the prices of agricultural products. I should like to discuss here for a moment an agricultural product in the Boland, i.e. wine. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister &#x2014;and I want to say immediately that I am speaking here on behalf of 6 000 or 7 000 producers&#x2014;how there are bodies who take tremendous advantage of this agricultural product of ours as far as prices are concerned. I want to try to prove this. I want to say at once that the hon. the Minister of <span class="col_7627-7628" refersTo="page_0881"/>Agriculture is not to blame, because he does not control the price of this product. We know that he is certainly the best Minister of Agriculture in the world &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and therefore I know that he will give attention to this matter. I want to invoke his help in this connection. I must just say quickly why he is saying &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D; so loudly. He &#x201C;threatened&#x201D; me with the fact that if I did not say so this afternoon he would not grant me any more interviews in future. I am just mentioning this little joke. This wine industry forms the basis of the economy in the Western Cape, and this industry is being threatened as a result of what the K.W.V. and the Liquor Board and other bodies call the excessive profits being made on this product. I should like to give one or two examples, and then I want to ask to be permitted to give reasons for why this is taking place, in my view.</p>

<p>We have here an agricultural product which unfortunately does not fall under the Minister of Agriculture&#x2019;s control. This is consequently something I also want to advocate, something to which he must give attention. The farmer produces wine, natural wines. Those natural wines have various qualities, of course, depending upon the grapes and the type of preparation. Let me mention two examples. There is the popular kind of wine. I do not want to call it cheap, because this noble product can never be cheap. We in the wine industry detest anyone who abuses this agricultural product. In asking for the protection of this industry, we do not in any way want to imply that we are advocating that people should drink more&#x2014;we are advocating that they should use this noble product in a civilized manner. There are certain light wines which are supplied by the wholesaler to the retailer at 20 cents. Then that same bottle of wine is sold by the retailer at 90 cents, in other words, at a profit of 450%. There are more expensive kinds of natural wines which are supplied by the wholesaler to the retailer at R1-06 and which are then sold by the retailer at R2-95 per bottle, a profit of 248%. A well-known type of wine, Vermouth, is supplied by the wholesalers to the hotel industry at 85 cents per bottle. If one buys that wine in an hotel at tot prices, one is paying R7 for that bottle. A bottle of brandy costs R2-81. The farmer gets 20 cents of that R2-81, the State gets the share it requires, the wholesaler gets 37 cents and the retailer 63 cents. But if one drinks that bottle of brandy in an hotel this evening by the tot one is paying R13-50 for that bottle of brandy. I want to say again that the farmer only gets 20 cents of that amount. When these bodies, who are making these profits, were spoken to, they said two things. They said, firstly: &#x201C;It is not in the interests of the public to know what we make. This is trade information.&#x201D; They also said&#x2014;and now I am actually speaking of some hotel owners&#x2014;that the State obliges them to incur heavy expenditure in connection with the classification of hotels. I think the time has come for us to tell those specific hotels that they cannot only count on the big profit they make on the liquor which they sell there, but that they should also provide meals and services and also try to make their profits on those. I think the solution to this problem is&#x2014;and here the hon. the Minister of Agriculture must help us&#x2014;for us to convince the Liquor Board that the freer distribution of our light wines is absolutely essential. In other words, if someone wants to have a meal in a restaurant, that restaurant must be allowed to serve that person this agricultural product, a glass of wine, with his meal. This is not allowed. I think that is the solution, i.e. that the Minister must help us to make it possible for an agricultural product, which must be used in a civilized manner, to be used in selected restaurants. Before a restaurant can obtain a licence at present it must virtually offer a five-star hotel menu and comply with other prescribed conditions. This matter is important to us, because only when one has freer distribution of our natural wines can one reduce the price of that liquor, and this will ensure the extreme gratitude of millions of consumers, and it will ensure the gratitude of our producers. Today in the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg one can buy a tot of brandy for 45 cents. On can buy a cup of coffee for 55 cents in that hotel. If you do not want to buy that coffee, you could walk around the corner to the first restaurant, a very decent place, and also get a cup of coffee there for 20 cents or 15 cents. Why is it not also possible for us to have this agricultural product&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;agricultural product&#x201D;&#x2014;with our meals in restaurants which could be selected so as to try to reduce this high price structure.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is only a die-hard, such as a Free Stater, who could keep on with such a debate. If it were not for the Minister sitting here on my left and having such a lovely time eating biltong and giving us nothing, I would perhaps also have left already. I sat here full of expectation, but I get nothing. But look now at the hon. members on the right. If only one of them had stood up and said that the Broederbond should take over agriculture, we could at least have got somewhere with something. But just look how they are sitting there at the back: an old Railway pensioner, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, and old Police pensioner, the hon. member for Umlazi, a person who has to walk ahead in the funeral procession, the hon. member for Constantia and the chap at the back there who usually knows more about what is going on in any other man&#x2019;s constituency than in his own, the hon. member for Benoni. Then there is one farmer who is unfortunately sitting in Port Elizabeth, the hon. member for Walmer, and the only farmer amongst the lot who represents a farming constituency, the hon. member for Albany, does not even want to give them a turn to speak. Then there is the hon. member for North Rand who has so much difficulty with his provincial farming in his constituency. Matters are such that we have really come to the stage where we look forward to the agricultural speech of the hon. member for Yeoville. That is really something to get nostalgic about. One consequently asks oneself whether one has done the country any good by getting the poor U.P. men to the point where one lands up in a debate like the one this afternoon. To have sat and listened three times in succession to the hon. member for East London, is surely murder! And now he is also gone again.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to speak about a few small things in the part of the world in which my constituency falls, things which are very dear to my heart. I see the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has just returned; he is the first farmer. In the dam basin area of the P. K. le Roux Dam there is still a considerable area that consists of land which is superfluous and has been bought up by the State for the State water scheme. We in that area are anxious for those lands to be divided up as quickly as possible, for them to be cut up and allocated to farmers who have to settle themselves in that area so that farming may proceed there normally. I should very much like to know from the hon. the Minister what progress has been made in connection with this area.</p>

<p>Then I want to broach a second matter here, and this concerns a new product which is now taking shape at the confluence of the Riet and Modder Rivers under the Kalkfontein and Krugersdrif Dam schemes. I am referring to the allocation of more than 200 wine quotas, the kind of thing my friend, the hon. member for Worcester, wants to sell in a caf&#x00E9;.</p>

<p>No, since you have left that area, we no longer have any sour grapes. I want to express our great thanks, on behalf of those farmers, firstly the K.W.V., not so much for the quotas but for the very specific assistance which those farmers have obtained from the K.W.V. I also want to express my thanks to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services for the assistance they gave there to the farmers by way of the wine Research Institute. But I do not think it can be said with certainty that the varieties being planted in that specific area are going to be completely successful. We hope so, but that necessary research does not exist yet. I believe it will come, and we are looking forward to it.</p>

<p>This brings me a little closer to the point I want to raise in all seriousness. If one travels by air from Cape Town to the north it is remarkable how the canals from the Vanderkloof Dam or the P. K. le Roux Dam are taking shape towards the <span class="col_7631-7632" refersTo="page_0883"/>Free State side. This induces one to wonder what the farmers in this area are going to plant.</p>

<p>One wonders what the farming pattern is going to be, what the size of the plots are going to be and what the Minister is planning for that area. The whole of South Africa looks forward to the development of that area. One also wonders if the time has not also come to do research on an intensive scale in connection with what must be planted in that specific soil. We cannot afford to begin with the cultivation of vegetation in that area which firstly does not do well there and which, secondly, South Africa has an over-abundance of, and, thirdly, which would therefore not be economical. I therefore think it is extremely essential for us to begin to do intensive research in this area and for us to begin already to determine what products must be cultivated there. I know there are many farmers in that area who are already planting citrus on a large scale. The oranges from that area are some of the nicest oranges imaginable, but I am not sure whether their cultivation will be successful. The same applies to the question of the planting of grapes. I am thinking, for example, of the planting of high protein foodstuffs. The hon. member for Lydenburg also spoke about that, and he specifically referred to soya beans.</p>

What is the potential there, where are we heading and exactly what are we going to do&#x003F; There is already a plot in the Riet River area which belongs to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. The plot in the Riet River area is not far from this area, because a large portion of the irrigation water is going to be supplied to the Riet River area. This plot is lying unutilized at the moment. One wonders whether it is not possible, and whether it would not be a good policy, to appoint extension officers in that area. I would prefer extension officers to be appointed in every area. We ought to give extension officers the opportunity, particularly in irrigation areas, to carry out local experiments with various kinds of vegetation. This can be done, and it must be done under the guidance of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. I think that the University of the Free State could also furnish many valuable services in this area which is under discussion at the moment. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would think along these lines and if he would give the matter his consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned on Friday night, I was quoting from the annual report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to indicate that, owing to the fact that certain stock inspector posts had been abolished, and because the transport allocations had been curtailed, it was not possible to keep a watchful eye on the stock-disease position throughout the Republic, while at the same time controlling serious outbreaks of disease. Sir, this is a shocking admission that a topsy-turvy policy is being followed. We hear about a shortage of staff, but there are reductions. We know the shortage exists, and therefore the Minister must explain to us why these posts were abolished. Furthermore, we know that an official is expected to fulfil his duty towards agriculture, the farmer and the State and to visit the farmers. If these officials&#x2019; transport allocations are curtailed, how can they reach the farmers to do their official work&#x003F; We know the farmers as well as the officials are complaining about this. The officials complain because they cannot do their work. We know there was a shortage of money, but in this case there are curtailments with regard to the source of information on agriculture in South Africa. There are curtailments with regard to agricultural technical services and veterinary science, and it is the source of information which is being affected. In other words, there are curtailments with regard to the transport of officials to the farmers, to agriculture. I should very much like the Minister to give us a full reply in this regard.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to a very important matter. The other day, during the discussion of the Vote of the hon. the Minister of National Education, I had a few words, to say about the training of veterinary surgeons in South Africa. Although this matter does in terms of the provisions of the University Education Act (Agricultural and Veterinary Matters) belong under the Vote of that Minister, I should like to say a few words more with regard to our veterinary surgeons and possible methods of meeting the critical shortage of veterinary surgeons, and at the same time suggest something for promoting our research work in this field. To my mind we can do a great deal in this direction in South Africa if we act in a practical manner and adopt practical lines of action in our policies. In my previous speech I spoke about the possibility of a year&#x2019;s &#x201C;housemanship&#x201D; for veterinary surgeons who have completed their university courses. Perhaps that was the wrong term; the word &#x201C;internship&#x201D; may be a more appropriate word. This is done in the medical profession, and the young doctor then has the opportunity of gaining practical experience while he is being paid for his necessary and essential contributions to our hospital and medical system. I feel that the same can be done with regard to our veterinary surgeons as well. This can obviate this reduction in staff, and also help us with research. I sometimes wonder how our large hospitals would have been able to function without these young interns. To my mind this system can also be used in the case of veterinary science in this country.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, it could be arranged, I am sure, that a similar period of internship could apply to our young veterinarians. An arrangement could be made between the departments of National Education and Agricultural Technical Services and the South African Veterinary Medical Association whereby students, on qualifying at university, would be sent out into the field for a year. They could be attached to our extension offices or to State or private veterinarians. They should be expected to send weekly reports on the cases they have handled and the experiences they have had in the areas to which they have been sent, to their university or universities&#x2014;I add &#x201C;or universities&#x201D; because I still hope for a second faculty at some time in the future, <span class="col_7635-7636" refersTo="page_0885"/>particularly under this Minister, who is interested in this field. In this way they would not only assist greatly in alleviating the shortage, but they would be gaining practical experience and could contribute greatly to new fields of research by means of these reports they would send back to their university or universities&#x2014;I use the plural again&#x2014;for analysis and checking.</p>

<p>If you read what is said in the annual report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services on veterinary matters, you find that there is a widely diversified field in which research is needed at the grass roots, and not necessarily at the headquarters of our veterinary services at Onderstepoort. We could have young vets continuing their education, going out into the field, and furthering experimental and research work simply because they would be in contact with animals which may have different forms of a disease which is already known. They would also be in contact with people who know more about that form of the disease than the professor at a centralized research institute. I would urge the Minister seriously to consider this suggestion. I want to ask him to give us the assurance that he will discuss the matter both with his colleague, the Minister of Education, and the Veterinary Medical Association of South Africa. Sir, I believe that so many of our young veterinarians in South Africa today go into the cities because they have not had the opportunity of doing this field research. I have heard from so many of them that they are afraid to take themselves out into the agricultural field where they know there are differences and difficulties for the private and the State veterinarian. They are afraid of doing this, so what do they do&#x003F; They go into our cities and attend to the dogs and the cats of the wealthier people in our country. It is a lucrative business. But if we gave them a year in the field, then they would get the feeling of field work; they would get the feeling of agriculture; they would begin to understand what they have to contend with; they would know more about the practical application of their science and they would know more about the people with whom they have to deal.</p>

<p>Sir, you will find that a lot of young veterinarians go into the field and give it up after a year or two. They give up because of their lack of knowledge. A farmer pays for good service, of course; he does not pay for bad service. But if you gave this young veterinarian a year under a scheme organized between the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, the Department of National Education and the Veterinary Medical Association, he would gain experience which would make him a veterinarian who would give 100% service, a service that would be appreciated by the farmers and a service which would pay that veterinarian himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have purposely avoided speaking about a second veterinary faculty in South Africa. We realize that the creation of a veterinary faculty is an expensive business, but I believe that the Minister should also consider this aspect of the matter very seriously, because it is not only our White farmers in South Africa who require veterinarians. What we require is adequate veterinary and extension services, and I am speaking now about South Africa as a whole. I know that under many of our agricultural Acts the Bantu homelands are excluded, but unless we have adequate veterinary services in our Bantu homelands, we will perpetually be sitting with problems of inadequate control on the borders of the homelands, and I would appreciate it if the Minister would listen quietly to this. I think he understands this problem. Sir, we need a veterinary faculty that will train non-Whites as well as Whites. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to begin by replying to the representations made by the hon. members for Virginia, Bethal and Vryheid in regard to co-operatives and the important role which co-operatives have played in enabling the farmer to produce very economically. I want to agree with them that ever-increasing pressure is now being exerted for co-operatives to pay tax and for certain provisions of the Co-operative Societies Act to be rewritten. I can give hon. members the assurance that it is the standpoint of the Ministry of Agriculture that the rights which co-operatives have at present should not be easily or lightly amended. When I think of inexpensive food production, I have to agree with the hon. members that if there had been no co-operatives, production costs would have been far higher today. I am thinking here, for example of repair work to tractors and pick-up trucks, for which the co-operatives charge R3 per hour, and private garages R8 per hour, to mention only one example. I am thinking of the Western Cape fruit <span class="col_7637-7638" refersTo="page_0886"/>farmer, who in the past did not have a control scheme for the fixing of the price of his product. If one had not had a canning co-operative here, which acted as a stimulus to determing prices and setting the pace, many of these farmers would have been in financial difficulties. In this way I can mention many examples to you, and for that reason I am pleased that the hon. members for Virginia, Bethal and Vryheid elaborated on the co-operative concept and also pointed out that the profits of the cooperatives are only in the region of R25 million, and that it would not be a major source of revenue for the Treasury if these people were to be taxed. And seen as a whole, co-operatives only make a 2% profit; but it is true that co-operatives wish to enter certain new fields, and those cooperatives are prepared to pay tax. We also gave the Co-operative Council of the S.A. Agricultural Union the undertaking that we would consult them in the drafting of the new legislation as far as co-operative tax and the financing of certain co-operatives by the Land Bank are concerned. We will consult them because we do not want to hurt this enterprise, which is one of the finest in the country. But because they are practical people, they realize that certain adjustments have to be made to the Act, and we envisage introducing the Bill in this House next year. Commerce is kicking up a great fuss at their congresses about the alleged favouring of cooperatives. I am very pleased the hon. member for Walmer agreed with what the members had said about co-operatives. Therefore, the Opposition also agrees that one should preserve the co-operative spirit in its present form. But commerce is kicking up a great fuss because co-operatives are allegedly restricting private trade. In reality there are other things which are affecting private trade, such as supermarkets in the rural areas. I now want to inform commerce that once we have amended the Co-operative Societies Act, and the cooperatives are prepared to pay tax, they are going to climb in, boots and all. It is then going to be a free for all, and then you will really see something. That they must also bear in mind. Take a little town like Bredasdorp, where a consumers&#x2019; co-operative was established which pays tax in full on its profit and receives no financing assistance from the Land Bank. There the small shops disappeared, and today one finds only the one consumers&#x2019; co-operative there, which is in fact operating actively. Private trade must therefore be very careful about saying to the co-operatives: Very well, you may no longer use Land Bank money and you therefore have to pay tax, and then still try to impose restraints on that co-operative. My point of departure is always that here one finds 500 or 1 000 farmers who are making a combined effort, where each one has a say in electing the management; it is, in other words, a jointly-owned business, as against a private company with five or six directors who are perhaps millionaires. Here, on the other hand, you have a group of farmers who axe active in the industry. It is this idea which we would like to protect in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Potgietersrus referred to Escom power and the high price. I want to say it is a good thing the hon. member brought it to our attention; his facts were quite correct, but he should have put the matter to the Minister of Economic Affairs. He is in charge of Escom power. A farmer pays for the line to his farm. Under some of the schemes the line is paid off over 25 years, while power is supplied to the premises of the industrialist at a completely different tariff. It is a good thing he mentioned it, so that it may also be realized that the farmer is not always being given preference over the other bodies.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus referred to the price of bags, and requested that we find a cheaper packing material. The Maize Board and the Wheat Board are definitely desirous of finding another packing material, even if it has to be of plastic. Tests were carried out in the past and plastic bags were not a success. Research is now under way with the object of finding a cheaper bag. I should like to inform the hon. member that we have now received an additional R4,5 million, for 1974 from the Minister of Finance for the construction of silos and the total appropriation is R12,6 million. At the end of this season we will in aggregate have borrowed R90 million from the Treasury for the construction of silos, and this is the course we should adopt to get away from this difficulty of expensive bags. At present we are able to store half of our grain in bulk, and our aim should be to store 100% of our grain in bulk.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus also requested that we reintroduce price control for maize products, as in the past. In practice we find it difficult, in Pofadder for example, to tell a man: This is the price <span class="col_7639-7640" refersTo="page_0887"/>you have to pay for a pound of mealie-meal. For it has to be adjusted from one place to another, depending on transportation, and we felt that the competition was keen enough, especially in view of the co-operative mills which we have. There is a process of price-cutting in progress, but I can give the hon. member the assurance that if we should establish that there are people who are making unwarranted profits, we will definitely reintroduce price control. At present no complaints have yet been made to us, and we have asked the farmers and consumers of mealie-meal to bring it to the attention of our department, or to that of the Mealie Board, if unwarranted profits are being made.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron requested that we should encourage our younger farmers and should give them loans. Our experience at Agricultural Credit has been that if one has to give a farmer of 18 years a loan, you do not as yet have any record of his achievements, and we have to give him a chance. If he is 18 years old, and he wants to farm, our first question is why he did not attend an agricultural college; if he does not have any money, there are bursaries available. But there is an anomaly in this entire matter, the hon. member is quite correct. If he is married, the situation changes. We shall look into this situation and talk to the Minister in question who administers the Act to see whether we can make adjustments there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Randburg referred to the air freighting of fruit and vegetables. I could just inform him that the Select Committee on the Marketing Act will look into all these marketing aspects of non-controlled products. There are tremendous possibilities. Last year we exported fruit and vegetables to the value of R10 million, most of this by air freight. With the advent of the jumbo aircraft and with the concessions we envisage obtaining on air freight tariffs, we believe that we will be able to succeed, through this method of export, in earning foreign exchange. I want to point out that air freight tariffs at present are as high as 25 cents per kg. The eventual price of the agricultural produce which has to be exported at such a tariff will of course be too high, and for that reason we are making attempts to obtain a concession in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Humansdorp referred to the Reynders Report. That committee, as far as I know, did not go into the question of promoting the export of agricultural produce intensively, but dealt mainly with commercial commodities. We shall see whether we can effect certain encouragement. This is of course very important. My standpoint is that our gold mines are in fact a dying industry, for you only extract, you put nothing back. Agriculture on the other hand is a growing industry. Last year, we exported agricultural produce to the value of R652 million, but we must attempt to double this amount. If it is therefore necessary for us to encourage the export of agricultural produce, I know that the Cabinet will consider this very favourably.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Worcester discussed wine. This is, however, a matter which falls under the control of the hon. the Minister of Justice, and not under me. The hon. member referred to the restrictions on the serving of wine in caf&#x00E9;s, etc. I see no reason why the control over wine could not fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. The hon. the Minister of Justice is present here, and I do not want to trespass on his domain. However, there are certain adjustments which will perhaps be made in due course. There are many bodies which will have to be consulted. I also have to point out that millions of rand have been invested in the wine industry. This matter will subsequently have to be taken further with the bodies concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fauresmith referred to the vacant land at the P. K. le Roux Dam. He also asked how we were going to allot land under the Orange River and other schemes. I want to inform the hon. member that we have been working on this matter for a very long time. From time to time we hold conferences in regard to it. The feeling is that we should give a person an economic unit, but it is possible that the economic unit of today will no longer be an economic unit in 20 years&#x2019; time. There is even an idea that we should allot 60 morgen to such a person, with the possibility that he will in time receive an additional 20 morgen, depending upon his potential, to what extent he can save on water, etc. We are working on various ideas. Considerable progress has already been made with the canals. Considerable progress has been made with the soil surveys. We should try to prevent the mistakes which were made at some of our previous irrigation schemes being made here. The size of the land is important, but what the person is going to cultivate <span class="col_7641-7642" refersTo="page_0888"/>on it is equally important. This is an area in which frost is prevalent, but will we allow such products as wheat, cotton and groundnuts, certain of the products of which there are shortages at present, to be produced there&#x003F; It will also depend on whether we think that the person who applies for the land is or is not able to farm profitably.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of farmers we want to settle there. In the first group are those farmers who have to be taken by the hand and given guidance. To them one has to give a previously developed site. The next group consists of persons who have a little capital of their own and who are perhaps able to construct their own houses with their own capital so that there will be no possibility of the usual smallholding complex. The third group consists of those prosperous persons who can afford to buy land offered at an open auction if they want to produce lucerne there for a sheep farming concern for example. There was the idea that we should give preference to the Karoo farmers, but it will not be possible for us to make an exception by, for example, giving a Karoo farmer a piece of land on which he can produce lucerne. It will have to be done on another basis. We want to try to act as fairly as possible in this case.</p>

<p>The hon. member made inquiries about the wine quotas allocated to 200 farmers in the Riet River complex The K.W.V. in its wisdom saw fit to extend the allocation of wine quotas, but we feel that it is not quite fair to apply a quota system within a specific area only, while other farmers are also exerting pressure for the allocation of wine quotas. We have to be very careful in this regard, for in the meantime we are also doing research at Roodeplaat for the development of early varieties of table grapes.</p>

<p>We have developed grapes which ripen in the vicinity of 3rd November, and such grapes are at present being cultivated in Groblersdal. Those farmers also received quotas, but in my opion one cannot give a farmer in a summer rainfall area with an average rainfall of 25 inches a wine quote. One should encourage him to produce table grapes instead. However, the K.W.V. has allocated those quotas, and perhaps this will cause problems in future. We must through agricultural extension inform the farmers not to exert pressure for the allocation of a wine quota if they can make more money from the cultivation of table grapes. The market for table grapes is tremendously favourable, and our population is growing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park discussed an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to agriculture, and was rather critical on this score. He said that we should have long-term planning instead. He said that we should inform the farmer, before he starts planting, what his price is going to be, and that we should announce minimum prices before planting commences. He said that we were not taking the risk factor in agriculture into account. It is very easy for the hon. member for Newton Park to say a thing like that. But if the hon. member had to apply it in practice, he would see for himself what wrong thing in allowing maize production the situation was. After the hon. member for Newton Park the hon. member for Walmer rose and alleged that we had done the wrong thing in allowing maize production in marginal areas. I can inform the hon. members that if one were to say to the South African farmer now that you will pay him at least R4 per bag for mealies next year, they will plough up the marginal areas left, right and centre, from Mafeking down, and plant nothing but mealies. It is a quite unpractical approach to say at this early stage to a person that it makes no difference what he harvests, a price is being announced for him at this early stage. These matters simply do not work that way. The hon. member also said that we should establish an agricultural advisory council, a planning council with statutory powers. In the past there was a time when South Africa had three ministers to whom the various aspects of agriculture were entrusted. There was a Minister of Lands, a Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and a Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. Today there is one Minister and a Deputy Minister to co-ordinate all these different aspects of the administration of agriculture. The Minister and his Deputy have three departmental secretaries who confer with the Minister almost every day about certain matters. In addition the three secretaries are supported by an Agricultural Advisory Council. Last year I asked the hon. member and the Leader of the Opposition to give me the names of the people who could serve on this agricultural advisory council. It would be better for these people to have been known as &#x201C;Madam Rose&#x201D;, for they would have to know precisely what is going to happen next year so that they could be of assistance with planning at this stage already. <span class="col_7643-7644" refersTo="page_0889"/>I am now asking the hon. members whether they can remember how concerned they were about the maize surpluses when we met here last year. Now that we have made the final estimate we are afraid that we might perhaps have to import a million bags of white maize this year. As against that we had an enormous surplus of white maize last year. I shall now give hon. members the names of the people who are serving on our agricultural advisory council today. The hon. members must tell me now whether they are satisfied with these people. The members of the advisory council are: Dr. Du Plessis, Dr. Verbeek, Dr. Van der Merwe, Mr. P. L. Steyn, Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers, Mr. Franz Van Wyk, Mr. Louis Burhmann, Mr. N. C. van Huyssteen, as well as Mr. A. P. Pretorius from South-West Africa, Mr. Sinclair from Natal, Mr. Chris Cilliers, Mr. Albert Basson and Mr. P. D. van Rooyen. These are the people who are serving on our Agricultural Advisory Council. Do the hon. members merely want us to give this Advisory Council another name&#x003F; Apart from this Advisory Council we also have the Soil Protection Advisory Council, and in addition there is a total of 21 separate boards, and then I am not referring to control boards which furnish advice in regard to the cultivation of various products. For example, there are advisory boards which advise us in regard to the cultivation of tobacco, potatoes, wheat, cotton, dried beans, maize and pineapples&#x2014;to mention only a few. In all there are 21 different advisory boards.</p>

<p>In addition there is a Marketing Council which has under it 21 control boards, and each one specializes in its field. For the rest there is also a central committee which consists of the departmental heads of the three departments. There is also a ministerial central committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of Water Affairs which from time to time discusses among its members and in conjunction with the departmental heads, matters concerning agriculture, water affairs and forestry. They undertake long-term planning. I am asking hon. members whether it is really necessary for another similar council to be appointed. Then, too the hon. members want this council to be a statutory council. In other words, this council must take over my job. Is that what it amounts to&#x003F; The hon. members are making it more and more difficult.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the subsidy on bread should not be withdrawn, that we should subsidize agricultural produce to an increasing extent, but on the other hand that we should in addition at least give the producers higher prices. I can inform the hon. member that previously we subsidized bread very heavily. When we increased the bread price some time ago, we again, as always, gave the undertaking that the higher costs to the bakers and the millers would be borne by the State. As matters stand at present, after the 20% increase in the bakers&#x2019; wages, the subsidy this year is again going to be almost R40 million, and almost R50 million next year. We are not contemplating raising bread prices again soon, but sooner or later we will have to be realistic. We had a survey made in a Bantu location and our findings were that 85% of the Bantu in a certain location ate white bread only while brown bread in fact has more proteins than white bread. When we compare the consumption of brown bread to the consumption of white bread, we will see that the consumption of white bread is twice as much as that of brown bread. If these people are really suffering such hardships, why are they not paying two cents less and eating brown bread&#x003F; I am just mentioning this to hon. members. Of course, I am by no means unsympathetic towards the consumers. The hon. member is very dissatisfied, and nags away at me every time about the bread prices which were increased. It is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member is saying that we have done nothing to stem the depopulation of the rural areas.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>For three days I fought hon. members opposite to get the legislation on egg production through this House. The hon. member is laughing about that now, but he should really be ashamed of himself. At the time I pointed out repeatedly that they wanted to enable a major company to oust the small egg producers from the rural areas; they asked why we could not have cheaper eggs by getting rid of the small farmers. But now hon. members are reproaching me and are saying that we did nothing to prevent this <span class="col_7645-7646" refersTo="page_0890"/>depopulation. In agriculture I did not talk politics, but the strength, the soul, of our people, whether they are U.P., or N.P. supporters is, in my opinion, and I say this with all due respect to the State, still the people in the rural areas. In order to keep them there, we are doing anything which is practicable. We cannot hoist a person up by his shirtfront and tell him that he should make farming his career. Here a firm like Savage and Lovemore is advertising for a young man with matriculation to operate heavy machinery for a salary of R300 per month in the city, where the bright lights are, the swimming baths, the drive-in cinemas and all the comforts. Must I now tell him that he should make farming his career while there is a manpower shortage in this country&#x003F; The hon. member cannot use that argument here.</p>

<p>The hon. member also discussed co-ordination. We are installing a computer in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services which will be used with effect from March of next year, and which will in fact do the necessary co-ordination. It will keep a record of production planning, with which is incorporated the department of Water Affairs, Agricultural Economics and Marketing and with which we will eventually have programming all along the line to the farmer on his farm. This computer will be able to supply the figures pertaining to very important and interesting particulars in a jiffy. The hon. member also asked whether we would, by the year 2000, be able to feed 50 million people in this country. I want to give the hon. member the assurance, when I look at the production figures during the past 10 years and see how there was a twofold increase in many respects with the type of research and extension services we have today, in spite of all the deficiencies, that it will in fact be possible to do this. One need only read the wonderful reports of the Departments of Agricultural and the bi-annual publication <i>Trends in the Agricultural Sector</i>, to see what research we are doing to improve production. In the light of this I am very hopeful that we will in fact be able to do this.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that we should not use the increased profits of the farmers to force them to increase their turnovers and in that way their profits. That is an entirely fallacious argument. The greater a person&#x2019;s turnover, the more effective he is, the more it will affect his profit and determine the eventual price of his produce.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It can disappear, as happened in the case of mealies, that is true. The hon. member says, however, that to render assistance to an industry suddenly, is <i>ad hoc</i> assistance. One will always have <i>ad hoc</i> assistance, for one does not, after all, obtain one&#x2019;s information in advance concerning what is going to happen in regard to certain commodities. I come now to the price determinations and efficiency. To my mind this is most important of all. Let me mention an example. A price has to be determined for a certain product. But now one has to have a general price for the efficient as well as for the inefficient farmer. The hon. member was referring in this case to the need to feed a great number of people, but I know a young Afrikaner, a pig farmer, who has a few thousand pigs in one shed. His entire system has been automated. There is a conveyor belt across the floor of the shed which is in constant motion and which removes all the waste products. Six thousand pigs are controlled by three labourers. The system has been automated to such an extent that every young pig had its own pen into which it just fits and which gradually increases in size as the young pig grows. It is pitch dark in this shed; you cannot see your hand in front of your face. But every six hours a blinding light comes on automatically. Every young pig is startled and stands up, and at that moment as much food as it can eat in four minutes is deposited in front of it&#x2014;all automatically. All one hears then is the sound of all the pigs eating at the same time. It is an experience to see this. Within four minutes that light goes off again, and then everything is quiet; every pig lies down again. It only uses energy to stand up and lie down again. It uses no energy to walk around. That person&#x2019;s pig-farming enterprise shows a profit which is 32% higher than that of the old type of pig farmer where the farmhand went trundling along with a wheelbarrow load full of pumpkins <span class="col_7647-7648" refersTo="page_0891"/>to feed the pigs. This is a completely new departure. In this way there are various branches of our agriculture which are developing in the direction of mass production, factory agriculture. With this kind of encouragement, and with research, I foresee that we will very easily be able to support an increased population in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer referred to the excursion to Stellenbosch which was arranged. I find the hon. member&#x2019;s thanks, as expressed to the Secretary, Dr. Verbeek, praiseworthy. We decided this morning that the Secretary should make arrangements with the various farming groups to arrange a similar excursion&#x2014;when it suits you&#x2014;to Pretoria. There are so many things we should like to show you in Irene, at Nelspruit and at Roodeplaat. We shall make arrangements for you to see more of the undertakings, such as the tobacco research and the dairy institute.</p>

<p>The hon. member discussed the land in the vicinity of the Fish River Tunnel. I can inform the hon. member that the first phase will have a bearing on the irrigators who are already irrigating, who already have their feet in the stirrups, and for whom we just want to make it possible to acquire larger units. It will be a consolidation. It is a complicated process to ensure that the water which is available is distributed correctly. Proper soil surveys are being made, and we are working in very close conjunction with the Department of Water Affairs, which will eventually allocate the water.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the insurance scheme and guaranteed prices for which the hon. member pleaded. If you ask for a compulsory insurance scheme which is supported by the State and you link this to a guaranteed price, you must bear in mind that it is also going to result in a person in a marginal area producing because he knows that he is insured in case of a crop failure, although he may only have one crop every five years. We must sort out considerations of this kind very carefully. Personally I am afraid of a compulsory insurance scheme, sponsored by the State, for one will have to draw a line somewhere, and will have to decide that the one person qualifies for the scheme and the other not because he is a marginal case. The person who will have to draw that line, will have a very difficult task. In the same way we find with the stock withdrawal scheme that the carrying capacity at one place is 24&#x00BD; morgen per sheep, and at another place three morgen. Consequently there are always problems in having something like this applied. The Agricultural Union have also addressed a request to us, and we shall see whether we are able to apply it.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Albany that there are too few extension officers. The hon. member asked for a new scheme to get more veterinarians. We can discuss the matter with the Minister of National Education. It was a practical and positive suggestion, and we will look into it, but you must bear in mind that the extension officers in our country are not being utilized correctly by the farmers. A sifting process has occurred here. Many of the young fellows we have in the rural areas today are no longer as dependent on extension services as was previously the case. As I have said before, farming has become a business. What has remained after the sifting process occurred&#x003F; The business man, the man who has a basic knowledge of engineering; the man who can repair a tractor; who is an economist and his own bookkeeper; and the man who married the right woman. If he did not do that, he would have had it, for he has to have co-operation. That type of man is not all that dependent on extension services, and more and more of these farmers are becoming active in agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London North apologized to me for not being able to be here. He discussed agricultural shows. We feel that the railage tariffs result in some of our agricultural shows&#x2014;and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is thoroughly aware of this&#x2014;having a discouraging effect; the farmers no longer want to enter. We are considering a scheme which will be based on achievement and posterity tests. We do not simply want to render assistance to everything remotely resembling a show animal, but where the animal can be entered on the basis of achievement and posterity tests, we want to see whether we cannot introduce a rebate on the railage for farmers who want to specialize in that direction, so as to be able to help them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in connection with the question of land below the Orange River project I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that <span class="col_7649-7650" refersTo="page_0892"/>I am glad to learn that the hon. the Minister and the department are already exchanging ideas about how the land will be divided up, how large the units will be and to what type of farmer they would like to allocate it. Since they are now exchanging ideas in connection with this matter, I should like clarity to be reached as quickly as possible. Shortly after the Orange River project was announced, the then Minister, Minister P. K. le Roux, and others were urged to give attention to this matter. Well, it is now about five or six years ago that that request was made. Now the hon. the Minister tells us they are exchanging ideas and that complete clarity has not been reached yet. We on this side of the House would welcome it if we could get something more definite about this from the hon. the Minister as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says it is very easy to say that the risk factor must be taken into consideration. He says, in addition, that it is also very easy for the Opposition to say that the price for a specific agricultural product should be announced at the commencement of the season. I have told the hon. the Minister that it is not only a question of the price of a product at the commencement of a season. I have said that one must also think of something like one&#x2019;s cattle farming. It is necessary to encourage meat farming in South Africa, and one must not only think here in terms of a price announcement at the commencement of the season, but rather at the commencement of a production cycle. There is a small difference. I shall come back later to the point which the hon. the Minister made in connection with the determination of prices at the commencement of a season. It is specifically one of these points that would encourage the South African farmer, particularly the meat farmer, if a projection could be made from time to time and an indication be given of the requisites and the needs of the future. An indication must be given to the farmer about what he can expect after his product is placed on the market. I do not think that is such an impossible task. The hon. the Minister asks how one can say initially what a farmer is going to obtain for his product. The moment there is a tremendous harvest, one would simply be saddled with the surplus and it would be essential to offer the farmer a low price. As far as my memory goes, the wheat farmer has, until recently, been told at the commencement of a season what the price was that he could expect that season. This policy has already been adopted for decades. Why was it done&#x003F; Specifically with a view to encouraging the production of that specific product. I also want to come back to the point about the Agricultural Planning Council. If this is possible in the case of one product, why is it not also possible in the case of other products&#x003F; The hon. the Minister can tell the milk farmers and the cream farmers at the beginning of the season what they can expect. The principle we are therefore placing before the hon. the Minister is no new principle. Now the hon. the Minister wants to know from me what more this Agricultural Planning Council could do than what its Advisory Board is doing. In the first place his own Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture recommended that there should be an Agricultural Planning Advisory Council. The hon. gentleman tells us he has dozens of advisory boards. For a relevant sector it is probably essential for one to get the necessary advice, and I have no objection to that, but it seems to us as if the scientific nature of agriculture and the intensive economic nature of this industry results in one need and that is that there should be general planning not only in respect of the departments, but throughout, in respect of almost every facet of agriculture. I specifically see this function in the Agricultural Planning Council. Hereby the necessary correlation can be obtained with regard to the cultivation of certain products in respect of which there could possibly be surpluses, and other products in respect of which shortages may exist. It is specifically to carry out this type of planning properly that I think that an Agricultural Planning Council is absolutely essential. Now the hon. the Minister gives us the names of the people on his Advisory Board. Sir, I have no objection to those specific people, but the hon. the Minister knows what their function is. It is merely advisory, and as the Agricultural Advisory Board they do not even have the right to express any opinion about the question of the prices of products, etc.</p>

<p>Exactly: there the hon. member for East London City is now giving us the answer&#x2014;he draws up the agenda. That board has merely an advisory function. What I am speaking about, however, is an Agricultural Planning Council. If we had an agricultural planning council, <span class="col_7651-7652" refersTo="page_0893"/>it would fulfil the functions embodied in the word &#x201C;planning&#x201D;. The hon. gentleman knows how he must take young farmers by the scruff of the neck so that they will go farming, since they are being enticed by the lights of the city and the tremendous salaries. That, the hon. gentleman says, is the sifting process that takes place. In other words, the farmers who remain, who have married the right women and for whom conditions are right, will then not &#x201C;go to the dogs&#x201D;; they will then have a future. This same argument has been used in South Africa for the past 30 or 40 years, and after every sifting process, after a drought or two, we find that that sifting process has to repeat itself. The hon. member for Carletonville, shortly after the hon. gentleman had held the meeting at Wolmaransstad, said in an interview with a newspaper that a matter which this Government ought to investigate is how farmers could so quickly, after two good years, be in a position where they almost have to come to the Minister and to the Government with their hats in their hands for help. Sir, here lies the basis of our problem in South Africa; here lies the reason for our so-called sifting process. I can mention examples to the hon. the Minister of farmers who have diplomas and degrees and who are competent farmers, but who, as a result of economic circumstances, have been brought to their knees. I have those examples, and the respective departments of the hon. the Minister frequently get some of those examples. Sir, I just want to mention one thing to the hon. gentleman: We have frequently heard, in recent times, that interest rates in South Africa must be decreased. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister how many farmers, who have mortgage bonds with private bodies, have had interest rate decreases in recent years. Now I am not speaking about interest rates on overdrafts. There are dozens of cases that I know of, and which that hon. gentleman also knows of, where farmers are still paying 9&#x00BD;, 10&#x00BD; to 11% interest on mortgage bond loans.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The problem of the hon. member who has just spoken, with agriculture still is that he looks for aspects in regard to which he can make political gain, and that he still cannot view agriculture in broad perspective.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to come back to a matter raised here last Friday by the hon. member for Worcester, namely the exceptional problems of the wine industry which arise, <i>inter alia,</i> because of the fact that there are so many bodies which exercise control over or have a share in matters of concerning the industry. This afternoon I should like to draw attention to one particular aspect of this industry, i.e. the investigation instituted by the Board of Trade and Industry in 1968, which subsequently submitted a report in 1969, in which it was confirmed that it was historically and economically justified for wine spirits, and brandy in particular, to be protected by means of excise duties against spirits derived from other sources. This commission of inquiry recommended that the suspended duty on cane spirit be partially introduced, but as a result of the problems which arose in giving effect to that recommendation, another commission of inquiry was appointed last year by the Board of Trade and Industry in this connection, a commission which had to inquire into the degree of protection wine spirits should enjoy as against cane spirits, and locally produced spirits as against imported spirits. Sir, the point is that the competitive position concerning wine spirits, which is held out as one of the bottlenecks, has weakened considerably as a result of excise duties which have gradually been introduced, particularly in 1971, with the result that the privileged position of wine spirits as against other spirits has gradually been watered down. One does not want to anticipate the report of this commission of inquiry, but it is striking that another interdepartmental investigation has since been instituted by the Departments of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, Agricultural Technical Services, and Industries, a commission which is concerned specifically with the production and price of distilling wine. Sir, if one considers this matter more losely, it appears that there should be some concern somewhere among the variety of bodies as to whether the extent and the price of distilling wine is justified. May I just point out on this occasion that the price of distilling wine, which is distilled into wine spirits, is always determined in close collaboration with the Minister of Agriculture, and, in addition, that the increase in the price of wine spirits is due only in very small measure&#x2014;to an insignificant extent &#x2014;to an increase in the price of the producer, although it is really due to the increase in excise duties. Sir, the point I really want to make is that the effect on the wine industry <span class="col_7653-7654" refersTo="page_0894"/>of this latest interdepartmental inquiry I have just referred to, following in the make of previous inquiries, has been to cause uncertainty; and if we take into account that this is an industry which operates on a long-term basis&#x2014;because vines planted today only come into full production after five years at the earliest&#x2014;we shall appreciate that this factor of uncertainty has a detrimental effect on an industry which virtually forms the basis of the economy of the Western Cape. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister of Agriculture whether he could not do something in this regard to bring about certainty and stability in this key industry.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another associated point I should like to deal with, a point the hon. the Minister has also referred to in connection with a plea made by the hon. member for Fauresmith, and this concerns the allocation of quotas in areas which are traditionally not wine producing areas. Sir, our legislation provides that quotas may be extended from time to time and consequently new conditional quotas were granted during the past decade or so, in 1963, and again in 1970. As the hon. the Minister has just said, it is rather uncharitable only to allocate quotas in the traditionally established areas. I want to agree with him that one should not discriminate. This is one of the disadvantages of the quota system we unfortunately have here. But, Sir, there is another point. When one is dealing with an industry which operates on a long-term basis and one sees that production is falling short&#x2014; and today production is falling short particularly in respect of our red wine, which has won a good name for itself, for which there is a great demand and which can be sold at a competitive price, particularly in the younger countries of the world, in the United States and Canada, and of which consumption has increased locally to such an extent that we are simply unable to supply the demand&#x2014;then, surely, it is unrealistic merely to allocate quotas from the point of view of superficial justification in areas where these quotas cannot be fulfilled, whether in terms of real production or particularly in terms of quality products. I therefore want to plead that we should consider anew our legislation in this regard; I think that on occasion we shall perhaps have to be more inclined to think in terms of an extension of quotas in order to keep pace with the increasing demand, particularly for quality wine, but I want to add that in this process we should guard against the allocation of quotas&#x2014;although it may sound pious to say that we should not discriminate&#x2014;in areas where the climatic and other circumstances do not lend themselves to the production of wine. Sir, while I am discussing this aspect, I should like to address a word of reproof to our agricultural press, which in recent times has on several occasions been popularizing the idea that estate wine cellars would be established in parts of the country which do not lend themselves to the production of quality wine. Sir, the net result of this, together with the allocation of quotas in those areas, is that people are going to invest money in something which is not going to materialize, and after a number of years the problem is going to be laid at the door of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, at the door of the managing director of the Land Bank and at the door, too, of other bodies &#x2014;also at the door of the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, because it has come to my notice&#x2014;and I do not want to criticize quotas which have been allocated in the Riet River and the Modder River areas&#x2014; that under our present dispensation, in terms of which quotas may not be refused, quotas have also been allocated in districts such as Victoria West and elsewhere, where the only water supply consists of boreholes. After all. Sir, it does not require a flight of the imagination to foresee, while the Minister of Water Affairs is also talking about a falling water table experienced in our country, that this is going to create problems, and that is why I want to plead for our farmers to be thoroughly informed about this matter before anything of the kind is encouraged and stimulated and also commended by our agricultural press and before senior research workers in our wine research institute&#x2014;who are unable even to fulfil the task entrusted to them in this wine producing area&#x2014;are called away for weeks to investigate the provisional quotas allocated there. This uncertain development in agriculture will simply not work out in the long run; let us rather concentrate in those areas, as the hon. the Minister suggested a moment ago, on the production of fresh table grapes and things of that nature. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to bring some influence to bear and to take the necessary steps to stabilize our wine industry in view of the tremendous demand for our quality wines and that, in the process, where there is still room for expansion, consideration should in the first place <span class="col_7655-7656" refersTo="page_0895"/>be given to that part of the country where the Creator made available the soil and the climate available for this purpose.</p>

<speech by="#reinecke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Those were fine words we heard a moment ago from the hon. the Minister in regard to co-operative agricultural societies. We are pleased and grateful that a co-operative of his stature occupies that post to keep his hand on the reins of our co-operative agricultural societies. Because we in agriculture become deeply concerned when we read in magazines such as the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 5th April what a prominent man such as Mr. F. A. du Plessis, had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Government recognizes that there is a problem. How we are going to solve it is not yet clear, but we are definitely working to eliminate any unfair competition from the co-ops.</block>

<p>This kind of language sends cold shivers down the spine of the agriculturalist and the co-operative, and we are very pleased that our Minister of Agriculture adopts this very strong attitude. We want to tell him that in this respect he not only has the support of the farmers of South Africa, but also the consumers of South Africa in so far as the rationalization of food distribution is concerned.</p>

<p>My colleagues have already requested investigations in regard to increases in the price of means of agricultural production in various fields and have made some recommendations, some of which the hon. the Minister has already replied to, recommendations which, if they were to be implemented, would bring about a great deal of relief for the farmer as well as the consumer of the agricultural product. We realize that these increases in the price of means of agricultural production constitute a long-term problem, but we think this year is a good one to take the bull by the horns.</p>

<p>In this respect I want to refer to a particular segment of the increased cost of means of production, and that concerns the intensive small farmer in my constituency and also in the constituencies of other hon. members, mainly flower, vegetable and fruit producers. There is one phenomenon which is really becoming a curse on these small farmers. Firms issue colourful countrywide advertisements of certain makes of well-known tractors and garden implements of a good quality from Germany, which they import. These are ingenuously sold by high pressure methods as units, portable power plants, which also include subsoilers and harvesters, and so forth. These are really useful and versatile implements, until a part of that machine gives way. Then all kinds of stories are told and excuses made on the part of those firms who sell these machines. The spare parts are not available and the unfortunate owner of that machine is told he had better buy an entire unit which will cost him R30 instead of the 40 cents or 50 cents or 80 cents the small spare part would have cost him. I want to ask the hon. the Minister that the import permits in respect of such machines should be withdrawn altogether from such firms importing agricultural implements until they can prove that they are carrying an adequate supply of spare parts for all models, all those models which they import so lavishly and sell and for which they are unable to provide adequate after-sales services.</p>

<p>The other matter of importance in this debate has already been dealt with briefly in passing, and that is the relationship between the agricultural producer and the consumer of agricultural products, particularly processed food products and particularly in regard to the price aspect. As we said in the Budget debate, I can furnish rational replies to questions regarding the increase in the price of bread, in the price of milk and other dairy products, in the price of maize and other controlled products where both the producer and the consumer serve on the control board and recommend a price to the Minister. I am once more unable to reply to questions about the strange price increases of processed agricultural products sold over the shop or caf&#x00E9; counters to the public. This is where control falls away to a large extent and where the consumer himself should really play the role of policeman. I want to ask how it happens that the price of a tin of &#x201C;bully beef&#x201D; or tinned peaches or processed maize products which have been standing on the shelf for six months is increased by 15% overnight after an announcement the previous day of a railway tariff increase of 15%, or something of the sort has been made. I ask: How are such price increases justified&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Agriculture and our farmers are blamed, while neither the hon. the Minister of Agriculture nor the farmers have anything to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="col_7657-7658" refersTo="page_0896"/>I want to know how to reconcile the fact that immediately after the increase of the price of bread by the Wheat Board, the latter, when it suddenly sent out some of its inspectors in the Cape Peninsula to various sales points one Saturday, found that underweight bread was being sold at the full price. I ask whether this is not a scandal of the worst kind. How can it be reconciled that the value of milk rises so rapidly from the moment it is delivered in the caf&#x00E9; to the time it is served with tea or coffee in the caf&#x00E9; that it almost becomes a luxury commodity which is so expensive it can barely be afforded&#x003F; Surely, neither the agricultural producer nor the National Party Government can be blamed for this state of affairs.</p>

<p>As a result of these increases in the prices of agricultural products the consumer is often under many false impressions. Often he or she is not in possession of all the facts and simply accepts the stories from the side of the Opposition and particularly from the hon. member for Wynberg that it is the fault of the Government and the farmers. [Interjections.] The hon. member appears to be very surprised, but she does it all day.</p>

<p>I therefore ask the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to entrust to his department, organized agriculture and the Co-ordinating Consumer Council the task, in consultation with one another and by means of thorough and scientific study, of keeping an eye on these problems of price manipulation of processed food products on a permanent basis and submit recommendations to him. Strong and effective steps must then be taken.</p>

<p>The food producer and consumer are interdependent on each other, and it is in the interests of both these sectors and in the interests of the country that they be co-ordinated in such a way for them to be able to consult each other all the time so that both of them will benefit. In this regard I quote once more what Mr. Raymond Ackerman, head of a very large chain store, wrote in <i>The Argus</i> recently and stated specifically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the main causes of the spiralling cost of living was that the majority of food suppliers were getting together on price increases preventing competitive forces from determining price levels.</block>

<p>Since the co-operative sector is now being accused by Assocom and FCI, I want to ask the hon. the Minister explicitly to have this aspect advanced by Mr. Raymond Ackerman as the reason for the abnormal increases in the price of many of the food products, investigated very thoroughly by a joint committee on which, perhaps, organized agriculture and the Consumer Council may serve and which could be under the leadership of the department.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Stellenbosch spoke about the wine industry. Wine-farming is practised in his constituency and the hon. member is therefore acquainted with it. I therefore find nothing wrong with what he had to say. The hon. member for Pretoria District spoke about spare parts of farm implements, and I must agree with him wholeheartedly in that respect. I want to take this further by saying that I wonder whether the time has not arrived for us to standardize our tractors in South Africa because the exploitation which takes place in that sphere, can only be described as shocking. The hon. member for Pretoria District went further and referred to the exploitation which takes place in the sphere of agricultural products. I may remind the hon. member that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has been saying for the past two years that he would keep an eye on the situation and he is still keeping an eye on it. The hon. member for Pretoria District says it is not the duty of the Government while the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs says he will keep an eye on the situation. However, all the Minister of Economic Affairs does is keep an eye on the situation.</p>

<p>I want to come to the hon. the Minister. He ignored completely the suggestions made by the hon. member for Newton Park on Friday. The hon. member for Newton Park said that, if necessary, foodstuffs should be subsidized even further. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister a question. He increased the price of bread and he increased the price of maize products. Has the hon. the Minister considered the effect this will have on the wage-earner when he has to pay those increased prices&#x003F; All he can do, is ask for higher wages; as a matter of fact, we already have another wave of demands for higher wages. Then the Minister of Transport comes along and increases the railway tariffs. So it will continue. It would be much cheaper for the Government to pay the subsidy so that the prices of foodstuffs could be kept low. In this way we <span class="col_7659-7660" refersTo="page_0897"/>shall be able to check the insistent demand for higher wages. What did the hon. the Minister do as far as the price of bread is concerned&#x003F; He increased the price of brown bread by 22%, but he also increased the price of white bread by 18%. At the same time he reduced the price the farmer gets for a bag of wheat by 20 cents per bag.</p>

<p>Very well, by 30 cents per bag. The hon. the Minister then submitted that he had done so because the price of the protective clothing for the millers&#x2019; labourers had risen by 26%, because the maintenance of the vehicles had risen by 24% and because the price of fuel had risen by 8%. But has there not been an increase in the expenses of the farmer in these spheres as well&#x003F; Notwithstanding this the hon. the Minister found it necessary to reduce the price of wheat.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister went further and said that without the assistance of a planning advisory council the Government will be able to feed 52 million people by the turn of the century. He said a planning advisory council was not necessary at all because the necessary planning already exists. What planning do we have&#x003F; Let us take the position of mutton.

<p>Why did he do it&#x003F; I shall tell hon. members why he did it. Two years ago we gave meat away at 18 cents per pound. I pleaded and the hon. member for Prieska assisted me in my plea for the floor price to be raised. We said the floor price should be raised slightly and in this way the farmers would be encouraged to produce meat. However these farmers have been thrown to the wolves and as a result they have stopped production. The upshot is that there is no meat. Now the hon. the Minister comes along and says the price will be increased. I want to thank him for accepting our advice in that he has increased the floor price now, but it is too late! What is the position with mutton in this country&#x003F; There are 30 million sheep in this country, 13 million of which are breeding ewes. The year before last, 9,3 million sheep were slaughtered; in other words, 70% slaughtering took place. Our lamb crop came nowhere near this figure.</p>

<p>Seventy per cent of the ewes. [Interjections.] The number of sheep slaughtered amounted to 9,3 million, while the number of our ewes was 13 million. Therefore we need a 70% lamb yield if we want to maintain our flocks, but we do not have this number of sheep. What is more important is that consumption over the past ten years, from 1960 to 1970, has increased from 4,5 million to 9 million. In other words, consumption has doubled in ten years. But with the population explosion it will now double within five years. In other words, we need a lamb yield of 18 million within the following five years and then I am not even referring to the higher wages the non-Whites are going to receive which will push this figure up even further.

<p>I shall tell the hon. member. After all, we submitted our plan two or three years ago, but at that stage the hon. member did not listen. The floor price must be increased. Now the Minister has done something about it, but it is too late. For years and years the housewife will have to pay for what this Government has done to the meet position in South Africa. For years and years the farmer of South Africa will have to suffer as a result.</p>

<p>But if you do not have mutton, you obviously have to import it, because, after all, you cannot let the people go without meat. The hon. member is also one of the agricultural leaders who was chosen by the Broederbond and afterwards did not give the Minister the proper advice.</p>

<p>I shall also discuss the question of wool now. Three years ago I pleaded in this House for the Minister to subsidize wool by 10 cents per pound and simply to tide the farmers over this difficult period. He did not want to do so. We had to plead for two years. Now wool prices have shot up, but what has happened to the production&#x003F; It is 20% less.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>From last year, yes, but surely these matters are not of recent origin. We have always produced a million bales of wool in South Africa in the past, but now we are not even producing 800 000; i.e. 200 000 bales fewer. We lost more than R35 million in foreign exchange as a result of the fact that the Government did not plan properly. I do not blame the Minister for this, because at that stage he was not Minister of Agriculture. When we make suggestions, the Minister simply ignores them. If the Minister would only listen to this side of the House, things would go better with agriculture.</p>

<p>I want to go further and refer to the drought conditions. Let us just look at the aspect of planning. How has the Minister planned&#x003F; He has allowed rail tariffs for livestock to be increased by no less than 60%. Is that what one calls planning&#x003F; In regard to vegetables, the increase was no less than 57%; butter, 31,7%; cheese 31,7%; eggs 59,2%, and mealie-meal, the staple food of the Bantu population, 36,4%. Was the hon. the Minister unable to see at that stage what was going to happen&#x003F; Could he not see how this would affect the cost of living in South Africa and how it would affect wages in South Africa&#x003F; But then the Minister of Planning speaks. He does not want an advisory council; he knows everything. But is this, then, the way to plan&#x003F; Anyone who has experienced the most severe drought in human history in this country during the sixties will know the effect it had on us.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, complained about the shortage of mutton. It seems to me, according to his story, that he has been so impressed and confused by the high prices of wool, that he is now slaughtering his breeding ewes. In other words, he has decided to keep his hamels because of the high wool prices and slaughter his breeding ewes. The hon. member asks what can be done. I want to give him some simple advice, namely that he should keep his ewes and slaughter the hamels. He will probably restore the proper balance then.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the price of bread and the price of wheat. In this regard I should like to express a few thoughts. If one considers the conditions prevailing more than 25 years ago, in the forties, we know that at that time mealiemeal and soya-beans were added to bread flour to make it go further. Those were the days when the United Party was in power. At that stage we had a chronic shortage of wheat, and therefore bread flour, too, and it was in fact accepted that we should never reach the stage when we should be truly self-sufficient as far as our wheat production was concerned. And yet in later years, during the &#x2019;fifties and the &#x2019;sixties, under the leadership of the Ministers of Agriculture of the National Party Government, the position changed so radically that South Africa became self-sufficient in regard to its wheat requirements, so self-sufficient that <span class="col_7663-7664" refersTo="page_0899"/>we even have a considerable wheat surplus today. If that is not a fine testimonial for the wheat farmer in South Africa, and for the Department of Agriculture, in regard to excellent agricultural technical services, soil conservation, research and agricultural advice, then it is most unlikely that one would ever find such a thing as a good testimonial. I just want to quote a few figures. The hon. member for East London City can also listen to these because he has already forgotten many of the things he used to know at one time. In the year 1970-&#x2019;71 our wheat production was 1,36 million tons; in 1971-&#x2019;72 it was 1,643 million tons. In 1972-&#x2019;73 we had a crop of 1,7 million tons. This has given us a considerable surplus for this year, a surplus estimated at 611 000 tons. This emphasizes to us the efficiency of our farming community. It is true that we have experienced favourable weather conditions in certain parts of the country, but what this does indicate to us is that we have had a steady growth and that the production, even of fewer farmers, has increased to such an extent that today, in spite of our population increase, we have a considerable wheat surplus. Hon. members will do well to note that while they are continually complaining about the fact that the farmers in our country are becoming fewer and fewer, it is striking that with improved means of production and improved wheat varieties and cultivation of the soil, it has been possible to progress towards such a considerable wheat surplus.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of the storage of wheat. Since we are a country with varying climatic conditions and periodic droughts, one feels that it is imperative for us at least to move in the direction of being able to store sufficient supplies for about one year. Here too, we have proof that the hon. the Minister and his department have for along time been making provision on this score. The hon. the Minister mentioned the round figure. I just want to point out that up to March, 1960, R10 million was appropriated for storage facilities, and in the following year another R10 million was appropriated. In the five year period from 1965 to 1970, R21 million was voted. It is estimated that for the five year period from 1970 to 1974, R48,6 million will be appropriated for storage facilities. This amounts to a total figure of R89,6 million. This is an illustration or a demonstration of the extent to which provision is being made for our growing population, particularly in view of the fact that our production is not all that stable as a result of periodic drought conditions.</p>

<p>Then I just want to say something about the price of bread. The price of bread was in fact increased in recent times, but in order to keep the price of bread at its former and present low levels the Government has had to pay heavy subsidies over the years. In 1970 the subsidy amounted to almost R29 million; in 1971. R29,5 million and in 1972, R41 million. If the factors of cost increases the hon. the Minister referred to are also taken into account, the subsidy for 1973, which is estimated at R36 million, would amount to between R40 and R50 million. The question is not whether bread has become more expensive. Bread has become more expensive. However the question is whether rising wages were keeping pace with the increase in the price of bread. Now I want to point out to hon. members that the section of our population which is consuming more and more bread is the Bantu population. Bantu wages increased by 67% in the past eight years, from 1963 to 1971, while the price of bread has increased by 20% during that period. It has therefore become increasingly easier for the Bantu, who are consuming progressively more bread, to afford it. And this is what they are doing today. It is convenient for them and it is the fashion among them. They even buy white bread instead of brown bread.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am afraid my time has almost expired. The hon. member had better resume his seat. We have proof, therefore, that the wages of our low-income group have risen substantially in proportion to the increase in the price of bread. It has therefore become easy and convenient for these people to afford bread. The hon. the Minister referred to the fact that it is even the fashion to buy white bread instead of brown bread. I think we must address an appeal to our people, Whites, Coloureds and Bantu, to eat far more brown bread instead of white bread. If I have enough time left, I should like to tell hon. members a story from the First World War. The German battleship, <i>Kaiser Wilhelm,</i> sank various Allied ships and eventually it was very heavily loaded. One day they sank another Allied ship and wanted to transfer some of its cargo but <span class="col_7665-7666" refersTo="page_0900"/>they noticed it was a cargo of whole-meal. They simply allowed the ship to sink. Shortly afterwards the crew of the <i>Kaiser Wilhelm</i> became seriously ill and hundreds of them died within a few days. They had to surrender in Boston harbour. At the hospital it was ascertained that the crew died of a deficiency disease and if they had loaded the cargo of whole-meal on board and made bread from it for their crew to eat, it would not have been necessary for the <i>Kaiser Wilhelm</i> to surrender. They would then have received the vitamins which would have kept the crew healthy. I think this is an illustration that our people should make a point of eating brown bread otherwise we are likely to become a weak-kneed, unmuscular people which will have to capitulate.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to venture to identify the most important problem or dilemma of the United Party. Something I am definitely sure about, however, is that the support of the United Party among the farmers of South Africa is disappearing at an ever-increasing tempo. One of the most important reasons for this is that the members of the United Party no longer speak the language of the farmer of South Africa. But what is more, the United Party has lost contact with the farmers of South Africa to such an extent that they no longer understand the language of the farmer. To my way of thinking that is a further reason why the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal has decided to direct his attacks on the Government at the Witwatersrand complex, because there the United Party can mar relations between the farmer and the consumer to their heart&#x2019;s content; that is something that does not matter to that side of the House, and something we in South Africa cannot afford. This year the hon. member for Maitland, who has just left the Chamber, raised a hue and cry about present meat prices during the discussion of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. Then he referred to the period 1970-&#x2019;71 &#x201C;when the prices were reasonably normal&#x201D;; those were his words. Unfortunately the hon. member is not in the House now, but we can pose this question to that side now: Were the producer prices of meat &#x201C;reasonably normal&#x201D; at that stage&#x003F; Were they fair&#x003F; The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, who sits behind the hon. member for Maitland, said a moment ago that two years ago we were giving meat away at 18 cents per pound. Mr. Chairman, just as that party is unable to speak with one voice when it comes to agriculture, the producer and the consumer, so cannot speak with one voice in this case, and in this way mar relations between the producer and the consumer.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave me conclusive proof to indicate that that side of the House have lost contact with the farmer. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also said during the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote that, from discussions under that Vote, he had come to the conclusion that this Minister of Agriculture was not the friend of the farmer. Sir, only a political party which has lost contact with the farmer will make a foolish statement such as this. In the past the hon. the Leader of the Opposition occasionally made a speech in my constituency. He is welcome to do so again, but then I challenge him to say in that farming community that this Minister is not a friend of the farmer. Not only did the hon. the Minister prove to us that he is a friend of the farmer. The hon. the Minister has already proved to us that he is also very fair towards the consumer in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, attempts have been made to make political gain in regard to the increased price of bread which has been announced. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, who has just resumed his seat, tried to redicule this increase in the price of bread. He said that the Minister was supposed to have said that the price of bread was increased because the price of the employees&#x2019; clothes increase and because there was an increase in the maintenance costs of vehicles.</p>

<p>The Minister said so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Surely, Sir, those are not the only reasons the Minister advanced. The Minister said in that speech that as a result of devaluation and an increase in the cost of machinery and apparatus used in the baking industry, the Government had given the industry the assurance that the 2 cent increase could be used to keep the baking industry on a sound basis. The increase in the price of clothes for the workers in the baking industry is therefore not the only consideration. Sir, let us consider the question of the price of bread in perspective. When discussing the price of bread, I want to say at once that this side of the House does not want the day to come when the price of bread will be <span class="col_7667-7668" refersTo="page_0901"/>on the same level as in those countries where the price is dangerously high. In fact, the farmer in South Africa wants the bread price to be the lowest in the world, and the price of bread in South Africa is in fact the lowest. Let us consider briefly the price of bread and the measures this Minister, this department and this Government have implemented, not only to provide cheap bread and not only to improve hygienic conditions in the baking process, but also to increase the quality of the bread. This is of vital importance, so much so that a low price of bread and rationalization, as a result of registration in the baking industry, are inseparably linked. In fact, the price of bread cannot be kept low without having registration in the baking industry. To appreciate the full effect of registration on the bread price, we must compare the price of bread in South Africa with that in other countries of the world. If the price of bread in South Africa is compared with that in other countries of the world, allowance must be made for the effect of the local subsidy. Allowance must also be made for the lower extraction flour used overseas. Allowance must be made for the fact that overseas bread is sold packed and sliced. But in spite of all these things the price of bread in the Republic is still the lowest in the world. Let us consider a few prices for packed, sliced two-pound loaves in comparable countries. In England the price is 19,2 cents for a 1-3/4 lb. loaf of bread. For a 2 lb. loaf of bread the price will, therefore, be 21,7 cents. In France it is 19,6 cents &#x2014;these are South African cents&#x2014;in the Netherlands 21,2 cents, in Belgium 21,7 cents, in Italy 24,4 cents, in Australia 25 cents, in Luxembourg 25,6 cents, in the United States of America 30 cents, in Canada 35 cents and in Germany 38 cents. Sir, this also includes countries which are self-sufficient, and in spite of the fact that they are self-sufficient, some of these countries pay the producer almost half as much as the price of wheat to the producer in the Republic of South Africa. Sir, the quality of our bread is decidedly not among the lowest of the world, but in fact of the highest, and that is why the Wheat Board recently expressed itself in favour of a lower extraction flour and also the dry substance determination for the mass of bread. The council went even further and put its laboratory facilities at the disposal of the baking industry, where they even go so far as to analyse one single grain for its, baking qualities, and so forth. Sir, in contrast to the Opposition, we on this side of the House say that the consumer in South Africa has much to be thankful for, because it was the wheat farmer who not only succeeded in making South Africa self-sufficient, but who also gave the assurance that there would be a sound, tasty loaf available for the children of South Africa in every home today. Sir, it is this same producer who ensured that South Africa is not vulnerable to boycotts, as is the case with Australia and Rhodesia, and I therefore believe that the consumer cannot be grateful enough towards the producer. But, Sir, whereas we have explained the reasonable attitude the Minister adopts towards the consumers, we also take the liberty to plead with the Minister in the interests of the producer. Sir, for the wheat producer in the Free State, particularly in the north-eastern Free State, the risk factor is higher than in the Swartland &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and that is why we want to ask for this particularly high risk factor to be taken into account. We also want to ask that a more realistic value of the land be taken into account when the price of wheat is determined. At this stage the producer contributes 35 cents per bag to the reserve fund in order to stabilize his own industry. As a result of world conditions under which the surplus is being exported, this fund has been exhausted and we therefore ask the hon. the Minister to appeal to the Treasury for the latter, as a partner of the Wheat Board, to contribute its share to reduce these costs to us. Sir, in simple language, we want to appeal to the hon. the Minister for an increased producer price for wheat.</p>

<p>No, Sir, when pleading for an increased price for the wheat producer we on this side of the House do not lose our perspective as that side of the House does because we regard the farmer, the producer, as a partner in a much wider circle, and we therefore want to ask that all possible steps be taken to maintain this healthy spirit in this partnership between the State and the producer, the co-operative societies, the researcher, the Wheat Board and the consumer. Sir, if it is possible to bring about a saving in one of these spheres, <span class="col_7669-7670" refersTo="page_0902"/>let us by all means bring about that saving and apply it to the benefit of the producer in South Africa. Sir, we want to express our gratitude towards the researcher in South Africa, who has made it possible to bake our bread in South Africa today of good quality corn. If we consider the rapid progress which has been made throughout the world in regard to genetics, and if we consider the various congresses, where the genetics of small grains in particular are discussed&#x2014;I think that there will be another one in Missouri at the end of the year; I think this is a congress to which Prof. Pienaar, one of our geneticists, has been invited&#x2014;we want to ask that all possible steps be taken not only to enable our researchers who have been invited there to attend the congress and deliver their papers, but that they should also be afforded the opportunity to bring back with them to this country any knowledge gained in other countries as a result of research, so that we may apply it in South Africa in practice in the interests of the partnership I referred to.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>I find the first half of his speech, and the speech made by the hon. member for Piketberg, quite interesting. The hon. member for Bethlehem may be a little young to remember what happened in the election of 1948, the days when, under the Smuts Government, mutton was very scarce and expensive and there was only brown bread. [Interjections.] Now they are pleading that the people of South Africa should eat more brown bread and should eat the expensive mutton or go without. These are quite interesting speeches, and it is always in agriculture where the political <i>volte-face</i> eventually occurs. If the hon. members on that side now say that we no longer have the ear of the farmer, I can tell them that we understand clearly the language of the farmer; we talk with him and we hear him. But if the hon. the Minister should stop hearing and stop listening at this stage he really is in trouble.</p>

<p>But I really want to say something arising from what was said here by the hon. member for Vryheid on Friday. He said that we should like to keep our farmers on the farms. There I agree with him wholeheartedly and there we must consider two things: The optimal utilization of our agricultural land and the elimination of uneconomic units. Now I can clearly see the hon. the Minister becoming alarmed because he thinks that I am going to talk in a wrong direction, wrong as far as the policy of my party is concerned, but I am not going to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park laid the basis for this policy in his first speech, but I want to emphasize here that one cannot start talking about these two matters, which are indisputably linked to each other, until our extension service and our approach to agriculture as a whole has been drastically revised and extended. I want to refer here to the contents of the latest annual report and the contents of each annual report we have had through the years. These reports contain everything technical, everything about livestock, everything about the soil, and everything about vegetation, but they contain nothing about our financial or labour control. Now I know that courses are being offered at Stellenbosch where one can take farming economy as a field of study and that one of the subjects at the colleges and at the universities is &#x201C;businesss control&#x201D;. But this is not enough because not every farmer&#x2019;s son can afford this&#x2014; and now I am not only referring to being able to afford it financially, but sometimes one is also unable to afford the time&#x2014;to take that course. I feel that these two points, labour control and financial control, are cardinal factors which must be fundamental to our farming.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, they are basic and cardinal factors in industry and commerce. Good labour relations and a happy and contented staff, and good financial and business control <span class="col_7671-7672" refersTo="page_0903"/>are essential. Without this it is absolutely impossible to carry on.</p>

<p>*There are farmers, as the Minister said here himself, who have taught themselves. I was pleased to learn from his last speech that farmers have taught themselves to apply business control on the farms. But it is not only business control which is required, but also labour control. I want us to expand our agricultural, technical and extension services drastically to teach the farmer how to carry on his business, how to exercise financial control over his business and how to apply his labour productively and keep them happy. So often in my life I have seen farmers who are outstanding in field husbandry, animal husbandry and in soil science, but are unable to practice farming because they do not have the slightest idea how to control their financial matters.</p>

<p>What happens to them&#x003F; They go bankrupt. Originally they went bankrupt under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board and now they go bankrupt under a different body. They borrow money until they are down and out. But potentially they are outstanding and productive farmers, and if they have lost their farms because they are bankrupt, they go and work for another farmer or a company and there they do outstanding work. But so many of them are completely lost to agriculture and then, as the Minister said, they work for Savage and Lovemore, or at the drive-in cinemas, for R300 a month. But if those people had been trained in business techniques and if they had the services of an extension officer who could tell them: &#x201C;Look, you are wrong here; it is not necessary to take a new tractor; use the old one for another year and plan your farming activities because you have the knowledge and you can go on without buying the new tractor,&#x201D; then the man would have progressed and he would still have been a farmer. Labour control is another matter. Some people have the ability to control labour.</p>

<p>Now I am not only referring to Black or Brown labour; there are many farmers who also have White labour on their farms. But one gets a farmer who does not have the slightest idea how to control labour. He has neither a foreman nor labourers and then he complains because he cannot obtain labour. Then he must employ migrant labour, as they do in my part of the world. Migrant labour is also used extensively in other parts of the country, but one can also keep one&#x2019;s migrant labour happy if one knows how to handle one&#x2019;s labourers. It is most important for our department to inform the farmers as far as these two important aspects are concerned, and I should be pleased if short courses could be introduced for that purpose. I do not know how this could be arranged because it is not an easy matter; however, it is already being done in the business world. The business people and those in industry arrange courses to instruct their employees in these two matters. I should think that it is very important in agriculture today that short courses should be arranged regularly for our young farmers in the same way as the large companies and industry do for their own people today.</p>

<p>On 14th June, 25 years ago, the hon. S. P. le Roux took over the portfolio of agriculture from Adv. Strauss. The fact that it is a record for one party to have governed a country in the Western democratic world for a period of 25 years, renders this period an epoch in the history of our country. In the short time at my disposal I want to set myself the task of making a short survey of the period.</p>

<p>On the ministerial level these 25 years have been exceptional for agriculture in that two Ministers have given the longest service ever to agriculture in South Africa, i.e. ex-Minister S. P. le Roux, who was Minister of Agriculture for almost 11 years, and ex-Minister Dirkie Uys who was Minister for almost 14 years. These two <span class="col_7673-7674" refersTo="page_0904"/>covered almost the entire period of 25 years of National Party rule&#x2014;and that in agriculture, which is perhaps one of the most difficult portfolios. Besides all other achievements to their credit, these record periods of service in themselves bears testimony of steady and sound agricultural administration. The fact that at the end of last year&#x2014;in other words, at the end of this period of 25 years&#x2014;the hon. the Prime Minister took the step of appointing a dynamic, young and active personality like Mr. Hendrik Schoeman as the first farmer of South Africa because he is a farmer in South Africa in his own right who offered himself for this post, attests to the fact that, politically speaking, the National Party does not yet intend to hand over Government and that it is entering the second period of 25 years with confidence.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is certain that agricultural representation in this House has never before been at such a high level as it is now. Never before have there been so many young farming M.JP.s as there are at present and in saying this I am rather reluctant to refer to the other side of the House. Never before have there been so many trained, academically grounded M.P.s who have made agriculture their prime interest as are now sitting in this House at the end of this period of 25 years. I do not want to draw a comparison, but I am definitely convinced that the National Party is entering the second period of 25 years with the manpower potential in Parliament which will enable it to achieve even greater heights than those achieved over the past 25 years.</p>

<p>Viewing the Department of Agriculture over the past 25 years, we are presented with a very encouraging picture. In 1948 the Department of Agriculture was sound, but over the past 25 years this same department has been developed into something which is totally unrecognizable today. It has been developed into something which the people of 25 years ago only dreamt about. In spite of all the technological means of aid available, the number of officials increased to such an extent that their numbers have more than doubled. The department has been so reorientated that the people of 25 years ago will not be unable to recognize it today at all. The department has been streamlined and is definitely far more efficient. For example, we have in mind specialized institutes of which there are not less than ten today and which are simply doing a wonderful job. We have in mind education and the students in agriculture. In 1947 there were only 304 students, when there was plenty of work for these people and also more opportunities. In spite of all these things, we have succeeded in increasing the number of students at our colleges to 485 today.</p>

<p>If I consider the achievements in the field of breeding in this country, I can only describe them as phenomenal. One need only call to mind such crops as wheat, maize and potatoes. I only want to mention a few of the varieties released recently. In the case of potatoes there are the Vanderplank and the Cedara varieties as well as two others. In the field of plums there are the Sungold and Harris Pickston. In the case of peaches we have quite a number of additional varieties such as Golden Dawn, Sunray, etc. In the case of strawberries there are Robyn, Karmyn, Klaradyn and others. Next on the list are new wheat varieties: Flammex, Quarta, Skemer, Bertha and Bella. There are 29 South African types of hybrid maize appearing on the list of varieties. All these developments have taken place only in the course of the past few years.</p>

<p>I should imagine that if one were to mention all these names in the course of a discussion with an old farmer of 1948, he would become confused and might even think that one was pulling his leg. The industry has shown so much progress over the past 25 years that if the past half-century is considered, the first half, from 1922 to 1948, compares so poorly with the second period from 1948 up to the present, that historians will describe it as the golden quarter-century of the country. My time is very limited but I should like to furnish hon. members with a few figures.</p>

<p>The gross value of agricultural production was R357 million in 1947. In 1972 it was R1 657 million. When compiling an index figure we have a basis for comparison and according to the criteria of that basis, one gets an index figure of 67 for 1947 as against an index figure of 169 for 1972. This is truly an achievement The farmers and their organizations have progressed and the other day this was very ably indicated by the hon. member for Odendaalsrus. He said that co-operative societies have grown into giant organizations. Agricultural organization has developed <span class="col_7675-7676" refersTo="page_0905"/>and realized the dreams of such people as Dr. Giepie Rossouw, the then president of the South African Agricultural Union. I have in mind, for example, the marketing boards, which have grown up from shaky little organizations into organizations which today have introduced orderliness into marketing to the benefit of the whole country.</p>

<p>It was an excellent Act and we want to thank the United Party for it. The efficiency of the South African farmer in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture by means of agricultural organizations, including marketing organizations and the regulatory hand of the State, has been to the benefit of the South African consumer. That is why South Africa is one of the countries which produces the cheapest food in the world. We mention these things not out of false pride or because we want to boast; we do not mention these things for the sake of bragging, but we do like to mention them as facts by way of survey. We mention these things out of gratitude; we mention these things in humility because many faults remain to be rectified. Mistakes have been made over the period of 25 years&#x2014;there is no doubt about that. I understand it is only the United Party that does not make mistakes. We on our side should like to regard agriculture in future as an industry on which rests the heavy burden of feeding the people and performing the task which lies ahead and to do so as one partnership in which the following bodies and people should be included: the Ministry of Agriculture, officialdom as a whole and in all its facets, the farmers and the agricultural organizations, including the marketing boards and the co-operative societies as well as other bodies concerned with agriculture.

<p>There are few countries in the world where we have a similar situation, so much so that in fact we have a whole team of financial organizations which have to assist the farmers. In spite of this, half of the applications made by applicants for agricultural credit are turned down. As far as the department is concerned they are no longer &#x201C;savable&#x201D;. I do not want to spend too much time on the speech by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I thought that he was going to talk about agriculture and not just sing a paean of praise. He has now finished singing it, and he is welcome to it. I should like to use my turns to speak to deal with three facets of agriculture, facets which I believe have not been dealt with yet but which, to my mind, are very important.</p>

<p>The first is that the hon. the Minister thought fit to appoint a committee in regard to marketing. We all know the terms of reference of his investigation. One thing which was not included in the terms of reference of his investigation is agricultural financing. Because I regard it as such an important facet for the progress of agriculture, I want to speak now about agricultural financing. I do not want to make political capital out of this matter. When we deal with agriculture and its advancement, we are fortunate enough to be dealing with an hon. Minister who can talk <span class="col_7677-7678" refersTo="page_0906"/>frankly and is able to understand reason and give one a straight answer. It is not necessary for me to play politics with this matter, nor do I want to do so. When I discuss agricultural financing, I want to say to the Minister that the establishment in this country of an agricultural financing corporation, or whatever we might want to call it, under which all agricultural financing would fall, is long overdue. At this stage we have the Land Bank, which is doing a wonderful job of work, but which on the one hand is dependent on the State for its money at a low rate of interest of 2% and on the other hand must go to the private sector and borrow there the further R700 million or R800 million it requires. To have maintained the levelling of the high and the low rates of interest, rates of interest of <i>6%</i> and 6&#x00BD;%, is an achievement. This is a reasonable rate of interest in comparison with the other rates of interest on loans, particularly those of merchant banks. For agricultural producers, however, this is by no means a low rate of interest. I can mention many agricultural financing bodies in the rest of the world which undertake financing at a much lower rate of interest, but I do not want to argue this point at this stage. This is the best we can do in this country, because we have to borrow the money on the free market, and even for loans our rate of interest is so high that foreign capital is flooding in. If money has to be borrowed from the private sector at a higher rate of interest we surely cannot expect the rate of interest on loans to producers to be low. I do not, therefore, want to discuss the rate of interest as such at this stage. However, I do want to discuss the necessity for all agricultural financing to be combined and co-ordinated under one organization. Then, too, I want to go further and in this respect as well I do not wish to play politics. It will clearly become necessary for each man who applies for agricultural financing, to maintain his activities within reasonable limits, otherwise it should not be possible for him to become a client of the Land Bank. I know that now I am making an unpopular statement, but how can we expect someone who has for example paid an unrealistically high price for land and finds himself in difficulties, to become a client of the Land Bank&#x003F; It does not work out like that. We shall succeed to some extent in controlling this situation if there were one agricultural financing organization which would indicate in its policy that it would be prepared to grant loans and render financial assistance where the client who applies for a loan has remained within reasonable limits in regard to his production costs. When I refer to reasonable limits, I am referring in the first place to the price of land, which is always the most important item in a farmer&#x2019;s production costs. If a farmer has paid too much, I do not think that any institution, State institution or whatever the case may be, should finance him, nor should he expect to receive assistance. When someone has acted so unrealistically and landed himself in difficulties, he cannot expect assistance from a financial body. This would have another beneficial effect, as well. I see that my time is going to expire before I can state my case in full, but I should just like to mention that to some extent this would balance and control the situation in so far as unrealistic prices of land are concerned. The hon. the Minister knows what would happen, even under these circumstances. This may not happen this year simply because wool as well as meat has risen in price to such an extent, but if the position were to remain like this for two years, the value of those same grazing lands will soar. Surely we know what may happen in one or two or four years&#x2019; time&#x2014;then both may be back at ground-level again. Then those very same clients who paid such high prices for the land, are going to come back to the Land Bank. That is why I want to make a very earnest plea for us to put our heads together and give consideration to having, instead of two agricultural financing corporations, namely the Land Bank and Agricultural Credit, only one agricultural financing corporation which would cover everything and would have a moderating influence on production increase. It is most important that we in South Africa should learn something about the agricultural economy which my hon. friend, the hon. member for Albany, has referred to. I cannot say that there should be more schools and more lectures, because there are many methods which could be employed, but it is essential that the young farmers in particular, as well as the old farmers who have made mistakes and are still doing so, should learn what agricultural economy is, what he as a farmer may do and ought to pay, how he can protect himself, how he should produce and what he should produce, and so forth. All these aspects can fall under the auspices of one financing corporation or financing body, which could exercise some degree of influence over <span class="col_7679-7680" refersTo="page_0907"/>these matters. I do not suggest that it will be in a position to exercise all the necessary influence because many measures will have to be taken before we get the farmer in our country to realize that he should produce economically, quite apart from the temporary fluctuations in prices, which soar one day and are low the day after. Surely this is done in other countries too. There one finds the situation that the value of land is exorbitant just because the price of one of the commodities on the market has soared temporarily and has dropped later. It is to that end, therefore, that I very strongly suggest that it is time for us as farmers to discuss this matter across the floor of this House. But just do not say that this is our policy and that we have been advocating it for so many years. We must develop a method according to which all of us in South Africa&#x2014;and that includes myself&#x2014;can learn to farm economically and not pay high prices for land just because the market is at a temporary high.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with another aspect if I have any time left. It is as essential that we should use the farmer&#x2019;s money to invest in the Land Bank or in an agricultural financing corporation of this kind. Methods should also be employed to enable the farmer to invest his savings with the Land Bank. Many of them possess savings and they invest these in building societies all over the place but not with the Land Bank. If methods could be employed to make the farmer&#x2019;s investments with the Land Bank tax-free, we shall receive that assistance from the farmers as well. If not only the boards, but also the farmers are allowed to invest with the Land Bank, more funds would be made available for our own agricultural financing. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for East London City said that we should not play politics with agriculture in this House. There is a very good reason why the hon. member for East London City says this. He is aware of the fact that they have no defence in this House against the arguments of the hon. the Minister and members on this side. Outside this House, however, the United Party is chronically engaged in discrediting the agricultural policy of this party. As far as I am concerned, the hon. member for East London City also cast a reflection on the Land Bank. The Land Bank&#x2019;s valuations are based on agricultural values and not on market values. When one looks at the report of the Land Bank, it is interesting to note that there are very few bad debts affecting the Land Bank. The agriculturists in this country are honourable people; the number of bad debts is minimal.</p>

<p>In the first place, Sir, allow me to congratulate the hon. the Minister very sincerely on this appointment. In 1966, after an election in which we crushed the United Party, we came here together. He was my bench-mate on the back benches. Despite the fact that he caused me quite a few grey hairs, I want to say with great loyalty that I am exceptionally proud of him as Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<p>My wish for him is, since his surname is Schoeman, that he will enjoy the same respect from the farmer in South Africa as that which Mr. Schoeman, the Minister of Transport, enjoys from the railway worker in South Africa. That is, to be specific, that the railway worker takes it upon himself to criticize his Minister. It is my wish that the agriculturist in South Africa will retain the right to criticize the Minister, but will not allow other people, for example the members of the United Party sitting here in front of me, to disparage him. The agriculturists in South Africa have a particularly heavy responsibility. They are responsible for the production of a primary product, the basic food. Now it is a fact that in our country with its varying climatic conditions, farming is a very difficult industry. Although I am not involved in the industry, I share in the ups and downs of the agricultural industry. It is an industry where efficiency must definitely be placed first and foremost for farming operations to be successful. The price increases which occurred with the approval of the Government, were completely justified and fair towards the agriculturist. These increases must be seen from the consumer&#x2019;s point of view. Now it is unfortunately so that when there is an increase in this industry, it has a direct effect on the consumer. The agriculturist was entitled to these increases. However, it is essential that the cost structure and cost increases in this industry be limited to a minimum, in order to make the industry profitable for the agriculturist. In this process I see the co-operative movement in South Africa as one of the most important factors which will enable the agriculturist <span class="col_7681-7682" refersTo="page_0908"/>to enjoy a sound income. If we do not entrench the co-operative movement in South Africa, we shall encounter problems. Today my own M.K.T.V. in Rustenburg is, as far as the tobacco industry is concerned, a jewel among co-operative societies. In the course of the past two years they have managed, through efficiency, to decrease the unit costs considerably. Despite inflation the M.K.T.V. has managed, through the loyalty of its members and that of its directors and staff, to decrease the unit costs of handling. The M.K.T.V. has also had other achievements. It was founded in 1909. The industry enables the aged who retire, to receive compensation which enables them to live a decent life. We must guard against tendencies to undermine the co-operative concept. Because I am not an active farmer today, I can afford to say that the private dealer in South Africa must guard against the undermining of the co-operative concept. This co-operative movement enables the agriculturist to produce efficiently and, because of that, to make a profit which gives him buying power which he, in turn, spends at the private dealer. In various directions in the agricultural industry which is growing and developing economically, the co-operative movement is a prerequisite. What should be a motivation not only for the farmer, but also for the people of South Africa, is that efficiency should be placed first and foremost and that the co-operative concept in the agricultural industry should be encouraged so as to entrench the future of the agricultural industry as an important industry.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rustenburg pointed out that the co-operative movement played a very important part in regard to the tobacco industry. I agree with him wholeheartedly for I believe that the emergence of the tobacco industry in South Africa is indissolubly connected with the emergence of the co-operative movement in South Africa. What the farmer does individually on his farm he does collectively in his co-operative. The co-operative is the farmer and the farmer is the co-operative. That is why I am so glad that we have a Minister of Agriculture whose heart beats in harmony with the heart of the rural population and that he is also a great advocate of the co-operative movement. Someone who acts detrimentally towards the co-operative movement in any way whatsoever or who does the co-operative movement a disservice, is undeniably doing the farmer in South Africa a disservice. The co-operative movement has achieved a great deal, as the hon. member said. About 30 years ago I myself started as a tobacco farmer at Brits, and in difficult times of crisis it was the farmer who acted through his co-operative who faced up to that crisis. I am thinking, for example, of the time we were faced with a chronic surplus, and also of the time when we had a shortage. Later on there were the plagues and diseases with which we had to contend. In this connection I think of the research that had to be done. Here the co-operatives joined forces with the State; they acted together to combat those plagues, such as powdery mildew. But I think especially of the time when we were faced with a chronic surplus, and when we had to switch over from the poor, old type of tobacco to the right type of quality tobacco with which we built up an export market. This was due to the collective action of the tobacco farmers.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I did not really rise to discuss this today. I rose to address a few words to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. I have often seen that when this Minister of Agriculture has to contend with many difficulties, he is a great supporter of the tobacco industry. I have seen him walk out of the Chamber with his pipe, and I have seen him enjoying himself filling and smoking his pipe behind the Speaker&#x2019;s chair. Sir, I may just say that this was outside the Chamber and not in the Chamber; I want to give you that assurance! The two Ministers Schoeman in this House have two things in common. The one was referred to a short while ago. As far as the other is concerned, I refer to the handsome container here in the House which is filled with snuff. I have noticed Mr. Schoeman, the Minister of Transport, always passing by this container when leaving the Chamber and helping himself to some of its contents when he is faced with difficult problems. This is a great honour he does to the tobacco industry. I think that handsome container, that snuff-box, contains the only agricultural product used here in the House. This just goes to show you the high esteem in which the tobacco industry is held in South Africa. That is why, when the tobacco farmers were in trouble this year, steps were taken to protect their interests. It is not my intention now to give a pathetic description of the terrible disaster <span class="col_7683-7684" refersTo="page_0909"/>by which our tobacco farmers were struck this year. Hon. members saw it in the newspapers. The hon. the Minister and the members of the Cabinet also saw the pictures which showed how the beautiful tobacco crop was almost totally destroyed, virtually within half an hour&#x2019;s time. That crop, which had shown such promise and on which the hopes of the tobacco farmers had been set, was almost totally destroyed. I would not like to describe that state of mind experienced by our people. They were virtually plunged into a state of crisis. Since 1939 those farmers had been building up what we call &#x201C;assurance&#x201D; to eliminate the risk factor to some extent, for this is a very delicate industry. But overnight this industry was struck not only by hail damage, but also by damage caused by other calamities. For that reason I am now raising this matter on behalf of the tobacco farmers. The other day I attended one of the biggest meetings I have attended in 30 years, and I attended those M.K.T.V. meetings every year. More than 800 people were gathered there. At that meeting there was really a feeling of gratitude to the Minister. If they are as unanimous as this at the next meeting, nothing will be left of the United Party; of this I can assure you, Sir. [Interjections.] Do not put me off my stroke now; I am in a very genial mood today. I am filled with gratitude when I think back to that great disaster, and how the Minister of Agriculture, together with the Minister of Finance and the Cabinet, gave the tobacco farmers R1.4 million in their hour of need. What is more, an increase in tobacco prices was announced, which has already been referred to by the secretary of our tobacco group, the hon. member for Rustenburg. A 25% increase in tobacco prices was granted, the biggest increase the tobacco farmer in South Africa has ever had. We are very grateful for the way in which this was done. Nor can it be otherwise, for if the tobacco farmers are in trouble, our economy will also be in trouble. [Interjections.] Why are you laughing now&#x003F; One does not laugh like that at the truth. If you do not take care I shall smoke you out in a minute and really make things hot for you! [Interjections.] I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. I just want to bring home the fact that the Treasury is a big shareholder in the tobacco industry. Last year we supplied the Treasury with more than R12 million in indirect excise duties. To any Minister of Finance this is almost a golden goose. It is the best indirect average taxation you can get, and it is something you can also justify then for certain social reasons.</p>

<p>But I am thinking, too, of the way in which we built up an export market. When we had large supplies of unmarketable tobacco in 1928, we had to set fire to some of it; that was how big the surplus was. Then Mr. Havenga, the then Minister of Finance, said: &#x201C;You have the wrong type of tobacco.&#x201D; Then the farmers switched over to the right type of tobacco, to tobacco of the right quality. We built up an export market and over the past five years we have earned R37,6 million in foreign exchange for our fatherland; the tobacco farmer is a patriotic farmer, as all farmers are.</p>

<p>I am very glad, Sir, that I have been able to avail myself of this opportunity, on behalf of the tobacco farmers in the areas of the M.K.T.V. which have been so badly stricken, to express my thanks for the fact that the hon. the Minister acted in such a sympathetic way. The word &#x201C;Christian&#x201D; was used a short while ago, and I want to say that the hon. the Minister really shows Christian sympathy. He did not only pay empty lip service; he turned it into a mighty deed. He gave us R1,4 million, as well as a 25% increase in tobacco prices. We are much better off now under this National Government than under a United Party Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow up on what was said by the hon. member who has just spoken. I do not think he expects me to do so either, for when he said that one did not laugh at the truth, he turned round and said, &#x201C;Not so&#x003F;&#x201D; That is bad enough, of course, but when he said that he was going to smoke us out and make things hot for us, I thought that he was not a smoker, after all! He went further and spoke of tobacco that had been set fire to. What else does one do with tobacco&#x003F; Of course, there is one exception to which the hon. member did not refer, and that is chewing-tobacco. He told us about the Minister of Agriculture enjoying a smoke outside the Chamber and about Minister Ben Schoeman using snuff at the back of the Chamber, but what he did not tell us was that he liked having a chew around the corner every now and again. This is the only form in which he enjoys his tobacco. But I think the farmers of Rustenburg are grateful for the fact that <span class="col_7685-7686" refersTo="page_0910"/>chewing tobacco is in demand now. Sir, I just mention this in passing.</p>

<p>I should like to discuss another aspect in general. In the first place I know that the Minister, as a practising farmer, knows that South Africa is not a rich agricultural country. We have tremendous problems. Our soil is poor; the hon. the Minister knows that we do not only have poor soil, but that we have climatic conditions which make things difficult for the farmer in South Africa. We have rain, in abundance sometimes, and we have droughts, also in abundance. South Africa is probably the only country in the world which has an Act called &#x201C;The Farmers&#x2019; Drought and Flood Relief Act&#x201D;; a contradiction, but nevertheless true. In addition, Sir, we have a warm climate, as a result of which our humus is burnt practically every summer, particularly here in the Western Province. I assume that this is also the case where the Minister farms; he must know this. Where one has all these difficulties such as droughts, floods, hot sun, stock diseases, etc., one would like to eliminate as many as possible of the other things which can make the farmer&#x2019;s life even more unpleasant. It is a fact that the rural areas are being depopulated as a result of several factors. One of the factors may be the fertility of our soil. Sir, it is quite interesting to compare the production in other countries with the production in our country. I do not know whom I am to congratulate in this regard &#x2014;I think it is the Department of Agricultural Technical Services&#x2014;but I see that the position has improved slightly in recent times. But let us take the production of wheat per hectare in South Africa as compared with the production per hectare in the rest of the world. In France the production is 2 080 kg per hectare, in Italy 2 030, in West Germany 2 800, in East Germany 3 010, in Russia 1150, in England 3 080, and in South Africa 560. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that these few figures are very illuminating. Let us look at the position in regard to the production of maize. The production of maize in America is 3 250 kg per hectare as against South Africa&#x2019;s 1 010 kg.</p>

<p>That is what I said; does the hon. member not understand this language&#x003F; The difficulty with which we have to contend is that we are a poor country as far as agriculture is concerned. As I said, the position has now improved slightly. The only way of which I know to increase production, apart from better cultivation and improved technical knowledge, is by using more artificial fertilizer; and when we speak of the use of fertilizer, I want the hon. the Minister to compare the fertilizer position in South Africa with the fertilizer position in England, to take a country we know. Let us see what the Government there is doing and what our Government here is doing as far as fertilizer is concerned. Sir, at the beginning of this session a question was put to the Minister of Economic Affairs in connection with the price of fertilizer in this country. He was also asked whether he was aware of the fact that agreements in regard to the production as well as the distribution of fertilizer had been entered into here between the various fertilizer companies. The Minister of Economic Affairs replied that he was not aware of this. Sir, the Minister of Agriculture is aware of it, is he not&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I want him to talk to the Minister of Economic Affairs, for he is aware of this and the Minister of Economic Affairs is not. I put this request to the Minister of Agriculture, our Minister. I just want to tell him that we love him, although this may not always seem to be the case. We like him, but we do not want to praise him too much, for then some of his colleagues will discover that he has already become a supporter of the United Party, but that he is just too scared to admit it. I just mention this in passing, and the hon. the Deputy Minister should not be so pleased at my saying this of the Minister, in the hope that this Minister will be fired and that he will then take over his office; he will come over to us together with the Minister, for he, too, is a practical, practising farmer. Sir, I say that the time has come for the Minister to go into this whole question of the production and distribution of fertilizer. The Minister told us that the only way in which he could bring down the price of fertilizer was by means of subsidies or price control. Sir, we know the subsidies that are paid in this country; let me read out a few to you: The subsidy on urea is R9-89 a ton, but on the other hand the railways rebates that used to be <span class="col_7687-7688" refersTo="page_0911"/>granted have been taken away, with the result that the farmers are no better off. On CNP the subsidy is R6-73 a ton, but on the other hand the railage rebate, which used to be 90%, has been taken away. Then I come to the subsidy on phosphate: On super phosphate the subsidy was R4-48; on double super it was R10-58. Sir, the point I want to make is this: If we want to compete with England, to mention just one country, which is now a member of the E.E.C., and our position in regard to fertilizer and our low production per hectare remains as it is, it will be a physical impossibility for the South African farmer to compete. I want the hon. the Minister to go into these agreements that are entered into. We have been told across the floor of the House that fertilizer companies are allowed 13% for marking up profits. The profit they were allowed was 13,3%, but the same fertilizer company declared a dividend of 20%. This does not seem right to me. Somewhere there must be something wrong.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. I asked them what investment they had in mind. They said that the investment they had in mind was the capital of the company. Now, how can one get only 13% on the capital of the company, while the company pays out a dividend of 20 %&#x003F; Surely this does not work out. Somewhere there is something seriously wrong, and I think the Minister should go into it, for here you have the biggest monopoly South Africa has ever seen, a monopoly which will not be dangerous, however, if there is sufficient control. Now I ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that there is sufficient control. That is all, Sir. I do not want to take the matter too far. But there are other aspects of farming which make things impossible for us. They do not fall under this Minister. This Minister is a practising farmer and he will understand the position. But take the position of the labourer, the Coloured man and the Black man, on farms in this country today. I suggest that as the rural areas are being depopulated of farmers, they are also being depopulated of Coloured labourers. The younger and better type of labourer is moving to the cities, and I do not blame them, for the farmer is not enabled today to provide facilities in any way comparable to those the industrialist can offer him in the cities. Because we do not have the profits we cannot provide them. There is another point, the question of housing. This minister must see to it that the farmer is able to give his farm-labourers houses of the same quality and on the same conditions as those provided by the industrialist to his employees in the cities.

<speech by="#weber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. WEBER</person>:</from>

<p>In rising today to make a contribution in this debate I want to advocate to the Minister that we should assist the farmers in their struggle for existence and that we should arm the farmers with knowledge so that they may emerge victorious from this struggle. Like the hon. member for Albany, I believe that the greatest deficiency in agriculture today is the lack of managerial knowledge on the part of farmers. But the hon. member for Albany stated this case in such a clumsy manner that I have no option. I shall try to formulate the same subject more clearly to the Minister. I believe that the training in agriculture today concentrates too much on technical production instead of on economics. If the farmer finds himself in an economic desert today in the midst of surpluses in almost every field of agriculture, I want to ascribe it directly to an agricultural training policy which concentrates too much on technical production instead of on economics. In saying this I do not want to make any reproaches and I do not want to level any accusations, but I mention these things because this is a fact of which we must take cognisance. I readily concede that there was in fact a time when a knowledge of technical agronomy and stock-breeding practices was sufficient to enable the farmer to make a good living on his farm, but that was years ago when the farmer was still self-sufficient and when production costs did not play the part they play today. But since then there has been a development from subsistence economy to the sophisticated market economy, where production costs and the prices of products are of overriding importance. It is not enough today to have knowledge only of technical production methods. That used to be the solution, but today the modem farmer has to make a success of his farming operations by making a profit. It is no use increasing and improving production. Today the difference between input and output is the decisive factor. If the modem farmer aims at physical maximum production today instead of <span class="col_7689-7690" refersTo="page_0912"/>at the economic optimum, he may find that he has had a record crop on his farm but has nevertheless suffered a financial loss.</p>

<p>The farmer of today is not a stockbreeder or agronomist. No, the farmer of today is an entrepreneur. He is a manager of his farm. If we train him, we should not train him to be an agronomist or stock-breeding expert, but we must train him for his task as a manager. We must train him to be an entrepreneur on his farm. When the farmer of today commences his farming operations, he does not begin with an unlimited supply of capital. Capital is short in supply, and that capital he must apply in such a way as to enable him to realize the maximum profit from it. For what reason we must arm the young farmer with economic training when he starts farming, so that he may have financial success, for this is the decisive factor today.</p>

<p>I readily concede that a background knowledge of agricultural techniques is indeed essential, but if we over-emphasize these aspects, if we make them the central theme in the training program, we are most certainly aggravating one of the biggest problems in agriculture today. Therefore I want to advocate to the hon. the Minister that the syllabi at agricultural colleges and training centres should be oriented more towards economic management. I want to make this very clear. It is not enough for economic management training allegedly to have its rightful place within a broad framework of agricultural technical training. No, the training must be training in economic management, and within that framework we must build in an agricultural background.</p>

<p>If I may criticize the universities, I find no fault as far as the syllabi themselves, their presentation and content are concerned. However, I want to criticize in all sincerity the guidance in respect of these syllabi. We must bring home to the prospective agricultural student the fact that certain courses are offered to train specialists in certain subjects, but if a young man wants to be a farmer himself, he must choose a study course which concentrates on economic management, for this is what he will be on his farm&#x2014;a manager. He will not be a researcher, after all; he will not be a specialist on agronomy or stock-breeding on his farm. After all, he is going to be a manager, and if we train him, we must train him specifically to be the manager of his farm. I want to suggest that this guidance should be extended to the parents as well, so that they, too, may know which course is suitable for the training of the young man for his task as entrepreneur on and manager of his farm. It is only when we are able to equip our young farmers with management expertise that we shall be able to extricate agriculture from its predicament. It is only when we are able to turn our young farmers into businessmen that we shall be able to stabilize a prosperous farming community in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the limited time still available to me I should like to raise another and quite a different matter. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that it has now become clear that there is uncertainty about the question as to whether permission was obtained from the British sovereign at the time to call the Natal Show the &#x201C;Royal&#x201D; Show. So I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister withdraw the subsidy to that show, which is in the region of R2 600, until such time as it has been ascertained whether permission was in fact granted for this or until such time as it has become a fully South African show.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to dwell for a moment on a few remarks made by the hon. member for Newton Park. This member, as well as the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, asked whether the Government was aware of the population increase, or the population explosion, as he called it, and what the position by 1980 and by the year 2000 would be. Surely this is a very na&#x00EF;ve question. How can one ask such a question&#x003F; The Government is not only thoroughly aware of this, but it is also making projections to determine the demands that will be made on the South African agriculture in future. The Government is thoroughly aware of all these matters. The Government knows that if we are to provide for the meat requirements of the country by 1980, we shall need 3,3 million cattle carcasses. The Government also knows that in order to provide for those requirements by 1980, we shall need 18 million sheep and two million pigs a year. We also know that if the present production tendencies continue, there will be a shortage of approximately 1,3 million cattle carcasses a year and most probably a shortage of five million sheep carcasses a year.</p>

<from><span class="col_7691-7692" refersTo="page_0913"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>What are you going to do about it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_toit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. DU TOIT</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. If we take the projections further, we know that the South African population by the year 2000 will be approximately 56 million. If the present <i>per capita</i> consumption continues, we know that by the year 2000 between five and six million cattle carcasses, between 24 and 36 million sheep carcasses and between three and four million pig carcasses will be required. This means that not only the farmer of South Africa, but also the Government of this country will be presented with a tremendous challenge. Apart from the problems we shall have in supplying red meat, we shall also have problems in supplying sufficient food with a high protein content. The principal foodstuffs in this category are red meat, white meat and fish. The extent to which the South African food resources will be able to cope with this enormous demand cannot be determined now. Every means is being put into operation now to meet that tremendous challenge with which we are faced. The authorities are thoroughly cognisant of these future requirements and they are planning accordingly. I am convinced that the farmers of South Africa will face up to this challenge and that they will succeed in meeting it, provided that two prerequisites are complied with. The first is that they must get a good price for food. The second is that there must be sufficient facilities for marketing the products of the farmer. What has the Government done in this connection&#x003F; In the first place there is the question of the price. It is very easy for the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town to take on here about prices, but he knows, after all, that as far as meat is concerned we are dealing with a floor price scheme. It has been said repeatedly that this scheme is a scheme of free supply and demand with auctions on the hook. The control board only announces the floor prices and buys up the meat if the market is below the announced floor prices. I want to ask the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town whether he would have wanted the hon. the Minister to announce a price higher than the auction prices at the time. I ask this because we are dealing with a market of supply and demand, after all. One was also struck by the fact that the chief spokesman of the Opposition, the hon. member for Newton Park, only referred to meat briefly in a few lines. The problem is that the Opposition is again finding itself in the age-old dilemma where the one is asking for price increases while the other raises a hue and cry about the high meat prices. This is what happened during the Second Reading debate, when the hon. member for Salt River and the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens complained about the exorbitant meat prices. Today the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town is speaking from the opposite point of view. I want to thank the Minister very much today for the considerable increase in the meat prices. Has any hon. member on the other side thanked the Minister for this&#x003F; All I have heard is complaints about the high floor prices. They do not say what they should be, however, and no one has thanked the Minister. In an auction scheme such as I have mentioned one cannot announce a higher price than one&#x2019;s current auction price. The announced floor prices are approximately 15% lower than the auction prices, which we consider to be a very good percentage. In addition, the hon. the Minister has also retained the support scheme, and we cannot thank him enough for the support price scheme he has introduced. It prevents these tremendous price fluctuations in the markets every day. I hope that the current floor prices, which have already been announced, will provide more incentive to the farmer in South Africa to increase our beef and total red meat production.</p>

<p>I now come to a further point, namely facilities. Restrictions in the past have understandably discouraged production. How can a farmer produce if he does not have the market facilities&#x003F; But what did this Government do&#x003F; This Government had the matter thoroughly investigated and appointed an Abattoir Commission. Positive attempts were made to establish abattoir facilities. The Abattoir Commission was also authorized to build abattoirs itself. Negotiations with the municipalities have produced results. In Durban, for example, the Abattoir Commission has decided to build an abattoir itself, at Cato Ridge. In Johannesburg the Abattoir Commission is going to build at City Deep. The following abattoirs have already been taken over by the Abattoir Commission: Germiston, Benoni and Springs. In Pretoria considerable improvements have already been made by the municipality, but the Abattoir Commission itself is also going to build here at a later stage and a site has already been <span class="col_7693-7694" refersTo="page_0914"/>purchased for this purpose. In addition, improvements have been made in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Bloemfontein, and the municipalities of Kimberley, East London and Krugersdorp are investigating the possibility of building their own abattoirs. These are decided improvements which have been made in the facilities for producers. A further announcement by the Minister which we welcome is that permission has been granted to six companies to proceed with the establishment of private abattoirs. It is hoped that these abattoirs will be completed within two or three years. The farmer must be sure that he has the facilities, then he will be encouraged to increase his production. This in itself is not the only reason why I know that the farmers will meet the demands of the future. When we look at the Meat Board&#x2019;s report for 1971-&#x2019;72, and specifically at the supply of cattle, we see that in 1938-&#x2019;39 the index figure was 100. In the year 1955-&#x2019;56 the index figure was 159. In 1938-&#x2019;39 the index figure in respect of lambs, sheep and goats was also 100, but by 1955-&#x2019;56 the supply of these had increased to 120 in controlled areas. The total supply of cattle had increased from 100 to 177. In that year it was also announced that a new scheme had been introduced, that the old scheme of full control up to the consumer had been abolished and that a scheme of auctions on the hook had been introduced. Since those years we have had a considerable increase in this index figure. The total figure has increased from 177 to 288, an increase of 111 points in a corresponding period of 16 years. This in itself proves that when farmers are encouraged, they do not lack initiative.</p>

<p>I want to tell the producers of South Africa that they must continue, in co-operation with the Minister and his department, to produce the necessary red meat for South Africa, for it is still possible to make much better and more judicious use of our pasture. We can increase our percentage of calves. At the moment it is not even 50% in South Africa, compared with 90% in America. Secondly, we can lower the marketing age in South Africa. We find that in the United States they market the calves when they are between 15 and 20 months old. In this country they are marketed when they are between 28 and 30 months old. As far as intensive stock-feeding is concerned, the United States had 10 million head of cattle in feeding stations as far back as 1955. By 1971 this figure had increased to 26 million, which represents 80% of the meat supply of the United States. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand that the hon. member for Wakkerstroom comes from a United Party home, for just as the United Party has always done, he pleads for better educational facilities, something which the United Party has been advocating for years. In every provincial and in every general election we advocate that twice as much should be spent on education in agriculture and in the schools. Now we see that the Nationalist Party is joining us by the mouth of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom. As a gesture, just to show that he remains a Nationalist, he attacked the Royal Agricultural Show near the end of his speech, just to pay lip service to the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>The farmers of South Africa have one of the most impossible responsibilities to meet, i.e. keeping down the cost of living in the country. In the first place they have to feed all of South Africa in an economic manner by making their products available at low prices, so that the cost of living to the consumer may be kept down. Then the farmer has to contend with constantly increasing production costs, but at the same time he must remain economically independent and self-supporting. These are the demands that are made on the farmers today. I think the demand for food will more than double within the next 20 years, as a result of the tremendous population increase and as a result of the fact that a larger percentage of the non-White population will be able to afford and will want to buy meat, dairy products, vegetables and fruit. A factor which complicates the demands made <span class="col_7695-7696" refersTo="page_0915"/>on the White farmer in particular is the fact that approximately 90% of the agricultural land in the areas with a rainfall of more than 500 mm are Bantu homelands, where the production is particularly low. So there will be a growing temptation to over-exploit our natural resources of land, soil and water. This is the problem we are faced with. Already there are serious problems with lixiviated and brackish soil, overgrazed land contaminated with weeds, and intruding vegetation and water shortages are evident everywhere. The aim must be: Maximum production without soil or veld deterioration. This is a tremendous challenge to the Department of Agriculture. I know that they are thoroughly aware of this. No wasteful exploitation can be allowed or tolerated in the farming sector in South Africa. It is in the light of this that we see the stock reduction scheme as a good and positive attempt to arrest the deterioration of the grazing land. So the Soil Conservation Act, as well as the Soil Protection Division, has our full support. The support given to the scheme by the farmers exceeds all expectations. In all, 7 648 farmers have participated in the scheme. They were the owners of 28 863 000 ha of land from which the stock has been withdrawn. Of the estimated 3 million units of small stock redundant in South Africa, approximately 5 million will be withdrawn in future. I know that no further participation in this scheme after 29th February, 1972, is being considered. At the end of February, 1972, an amount of approximately R8 850 000 had already been paid out. We believe that there are positive advantages attached to the scheme. In order to achieve veld improvement, lighter grazing is definitely necessary, together with pasture rotation to support it. This is the most efficient way of restoring the veld. I have experienced this myself on my farms. Stock reduction is definitely the most efficient way. Within a very short time the veld responds and improves. One is constantly surprised at what is achieved by this method, even in those arid regions. The industrious and dedicated farmer who has heavy mortgages covered by insurance is assisted by the scheme in reducing his stock and still maintaining a reasonably high income level in order to meet his obligations. To me this is one of the very important advantages of this scheme. It helps to keep the young farmer on the land in spite of his obligations. It also assists him in restoring his land. It makes the farming concern more resistant to drought and prevents high expenditure on drought forage. The scheme also has great educational advantages, for many farmers have seen their lambing and calving percentages improve, have seen the downward trend in the death rate among the livestock and have found that they get a quicker turnover from lambs which are finished for the market at an earlier age and which weigh more. Such a farmer will not easily return to the old farming methods. I believe that he has become a lifelong supporter of veld conservation. I should like to request the hon. the Minister to have an evaluation of veld improvement under the stock reduction scheme carried out every year. I believe that it is not necessary in all the regions to have the land entered under this scheme for a five-year period. There are many areas that are restored to their optimum condition in a much shorter period of time. I feel that one may perhaps streamline this whole scheme to some extent. I should also like follow-up work to be done after the five-year period has expired, when the farmers may carry on their operations on their own again without the discipline of the stock reduction scheme. I believe that most farmers will remain under this discipline, especially if they have experienced the advantages and received a larger income from increased production. However, I know that there are still farmers who will return to their old ways. It will be quite interesting to know what percentage of the farmers will yield again. I should like to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approach is in regard to this scheme. Is the Minister going to introduce the scheme again in five years&#x2019; time, or is he perhaps considering the introduction of a stock reduction scheme without provision for compensation, which would force the inefficient farmers who overgraze to participate in it&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to express a few ideas about co-operative meat marketing. In view of its organizational composition, it was clear to the farmer that he had created a force and developed a mouthpiece through which he could speak in the common interests of so many thousands of farmers in our country. They have thereby taken joint action to enter the commercial world and to earn the highest income for their products. The idea of co-operative marketing was the foundation stone in driving them together for self-preservation. <span class="col_7697-7698" refersTo="page_0916"/>A hundred years ago a small group of wheat farmers got together, and today the membership of such co-operative societies totals more than one million. In our country co-operative societies developed a few years before the advent of Union, in 1904. In 1922 the Co-operative Societies Act was passed. In 1910 the membership of these co-operative societies was 7 065. Today there are more than 300 000 members of co-operative societies.</p>

<p>As I have already said, the co-operative societies developed to obtain security for the producer&#x2019;s product. The same applies to livestock and the meat industry. In the years 1929 to 1932 an alarming situation developed in the meat industry. The income from the meat industry was not sufficient to cover the interest on the capital that was invested in the industry. At the time the Government had a thorough investigation instituted by the department. With this investigation it was found that the Johannesburg market, which had to indicate trends and price levels, was in reality not a free market. At that time chaos reigned in respect of the supply of slaughter stock to our large markets. Disordered marketing simply cultivated poverty and bankruptcy. It was the auctioneer who could supply the credit over the longest period and the agents who could take the biggest risks who kept up. Competition was of such a nature that it could not be called competition. Steps had to be taken to increase the farmer&#x2019;s income and to prevent bankruptcy. At the time the producer simply had to accept the buyer&#x2019;s offer and in those years the producer simply had no say at all. The farmer had to watch his pride, his labour and his sweat greasing the palms of persons who had not worked for their money. This drove the producer to self-defence. As a result of that we reached the stage where we established the central meat co-operative in 1932, the then <i>Kaapsentraal.</i> The situation was such a difficult one at the time that the <i>Kaapsentraal,</i> a co-operative organization, was established without capital, without a single penny. Since then matters have changed a great deal, and with a steadfast will, faith and confidence in co-operative marketing these organizations reached great heights. In 1932 there were no meat co-operatives, while today there are 36 of them. In 1932-&#x2019;33 we were only marketing 18 000 sheep and 259 head of cattle. Today we are marketing 656 000 head of cattle annually, 2 200 000 sheep, 250 000 pigs and more than 50 000 calves. The central meat co-operative&#x2019;s turnover is about R229 million per year. This is really big growth achieved by our co-operative societies over the years. The slaughtering percentage of the central meat co-operative in the controlled areas is today 43% in the case of cattle, 47% in the case of sheep, 34% in the case of pigs and 36% in the case of calves.</p>

<p>Sir, then I just want to say a few words about various aspects affecting the livestock and meat farmers&#x2019; marketing interests. I shall mention a few of the benefits which the co-operative movement has brought to the meat farmer: Through the co-operative service a method of handling has been developed. We obtained guaranteed floor prices and support prices, and we obtained a scheme for the marketing of hides and skins. Unparalleled services are being rendered by the co-operative societies on the platteland. The co-operative policy of meat marketing is still in its infancy; it must still be developed for the greater benefit of producers and consumers by every faithful co-operator, something which is indispensable for a sound community and a sound economy. Sir, co-operative meat marketing must still be developed into a co-operative pool system, into a co-operative processing system and into a co-operative distribution system for the benefit of producers and consumers. Then and then only will the producers and the consumers have the full benefit of co-operative ordered marketing. Sir, we have hundreds of marketing agents who keep the farmers in South Africa divided with the slogan that competition is a good thing, and consequently force them to sell their products and not to market them. This is a threat to the economic prosperity of agriculture and thereby also a threat to the economic future of South Africa. Sir, I want to appeal to our meat producers to support their co-operative organization for the sake of self-preservation, because the co-operative marketing system has proved itself to be a friend to both producers and consumers.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that today we have a Minister of Agriculture who is doing wonders for us, and who has the interests of the farmer and the agriculturist at heart. We want to express our thanks and gratitude to him for his action on behalf of the agriculturist and his approach to the problems of agriculture, and we want to say thank you very much to him for the fine things he has already achieved and state that under his <span class="col_7699-7700" refersTo="page_0917"/>guidance we shall go to meet the uncertain future, as far as agriculture is concerned, with great expectations.</p>

<p>I just want to respond briefly to a few statements made here by hon. members of the Opposition. I think it was the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town who lodged a plea here for a crop insurance scheme for agriculture. He expressed criticism because there is no such scheme in operation today. He stated this as if it were a brand new suggestion in this House, but I want to refer him back to 1963 when I myself, together with the then member for Christiana, advocated a production cost insurance scheme or a crop insurance scheme for agriculture in this House. On that occasion we gained no support from the Opposition in that connection. Sir, the hon. member for Walmer spoke here of &#x201C;a shortage of beef&#x201D;. I want to quote to him what appears on page 28 of this report. In the first part of this paragraph reference is made to shortages in connection with the supply of beef, etc., and then the paragraph reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Beef exports are at present, despite the considerable rise in local prices, still profitable, and the interest in export has accordingly increased considerably. For this reason it was found necessary to control exports quantitatively, and an export quota of 319 000 carcasses was laid down for the export year from April, 1972, to March, 1973.</block>

<p>Sir, it has irrefutably been proved that the Opposition is completely out of touch with what is taking place in agriculture. But I shall leave the Opposition at that. I want to point out another aspect of the meat industry. I know that a popular misconception prevails to the effect that excessive profit-taking in the industry is one of the biggest causes of the high prices which the consumer must pay for meat. The Opposition has already made tentative, hushed references to a possible subsidizing of this industry. Sir, we know that under the present dispensation it is out of the question to subsidize the price of meat. The National Government is also being blamed for the high prices which the consumer must pay for meat today. Sir, the accusation that there are excessive profit-takings within the industry, and that the National Government is to blame for that, are devoid of all truth. There are various bodies concerned with the question of profit-taking within this industry; the first is the producer; the second is the wholesaler and the third is the retailer. We know that the producer today receives about 65% of the net income which is obtained from the carcass of an animal which is sold on the hook. The wholesaler, as a result of the important task he has to perform, makes about 4% to 8% profit, while the retail butcher makes a profit of 25% to 27%. This 65% means no great profit for the producer, because from that the producer must finance his production costs; he must pay the marketing agent&#x2019;s commission out of that and he must pay railage, etc. This 65% which the producer collects is his gross income, and in my opinion his net income is very meagre. The wholesaler, who makes a profit of 4% to 8%, has a very important function to fulfil. He must purchase these carcasses on the hook at auctions; he must furnish the meat to the retailer and, in addition, he must also finance the retailer, because these transactions are not always cash transactions. The retailer&#x2019;s profit margin is 25% to 27% of the consumer price, but the retailers need R15 000 to R20 000 just for the installation of the necessary apparatus; they must pay rent, and their profit is therefore a very meagre one, because 20% of a beef carcass is sometimes offal. I am mentioning this to prove that the allegation that there is excessive profit-taking, is a malicious allegation and that it is not based on facts. For example, take the floor price at which a carcass of beef must be marketed. It varies from 50 cents per kilogram to 70 cents per kilogram, depending upon the grade. As far as mutton is concerned, the floor price varies from 60 cents to 70 cents, and here I want to emphasize that I am very grateful for the fact that a support price has been made applicable to mutton that is sold on the hook, as in the case of beef, where a support price has already, for some considerable time, been made applicable in the interests of meat producers. We heartily want to thank the hon. the Minister for that good step. Sir, it is said that a price of R1-30 or R1-40 per kg for mutton is an excessive price, Sir, if one takes into consideration the fact that certain cuts are sold for 76 cents per kg, one realizes at once that the retail trade does not make a big profit.</p>

<p>Sir, my time is almost up and there is another matter I should like to mention in connection with a telex message which came from the department in February in <span class="col_7701-7702" refersTo="page_0918"/>connection with the steps the Wheat Board wanted to take. It concerns the home industries of the womens&#x2019; agricultural unions in our country. Sir, at present there are 16 registered branches; there are 19 other associations, and there are also 36 associations on a co-operative basis. There have been applications from 15, two of which have recently been approved. I should like to quote to the House the contents of this document I have here. It states, <i>inter alia</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the increasing rate in the recent registration of housewives continues, it may lead to disruption. It may also be unfair to registered, full-fledged bakers and confectioners who, at considerable cost, must comply with many more local and other regulations, which impose high demands.</block>

<p>In this I see a threat to the home industry, and I know that the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister are very sympathetically disposed to this Women&#x2019;s Agricultural Union&#x2019;s home industries because the quality product which they make available to the town and city housewives for certain occasions, entertainments, etc., is something which the wholesale baker simply cannot compete with. These home industries not only provide the baking, the delicious products, but they also sell vegetables and meat, such as chickens, eggs, etc. They also do needlework which they offer to the public on a small scale in their shops. If these home industries must be curbed at the insistence of these bakers and confectioners and they can no longer furnish this delicious baking, it would deprive not only the housewives of the platteland but also those of the towns and cities who take part in it, of a small but very handy income. After all, these people cannot bake on so large a scale that it could have the slightest adverse effect on the full-fledged bakers and confectioners. Therefore I want to say this afternoon that it is unnecessary for me to lodge a plea with the Minister. I can just say that I appreciate the fact that up to now the hon. the Minister has protected these people, because they are carrying out a tremendous function in the Republic. It is consequently as a result of that that I also want to take this opportunity of saying that not only as far as this facet of agriculture is concerned, but also as far as every other facet is concerned, the farmers of South Africa are right behind this Minister of Agriculture and his deputy.</p>

<p>I should like to reply first to the hon. member for Stellenbosch in regard to the allocation of wine quotas. I think we agree that it is necessary to act very judiciously in regard to the areas in which we want to encourage wine production. But the hon. member has asked whether we should not at this early stage make provision for a possible shortage of wine by allocating larger quotas at this early stage. I wish to add to that that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, in conjunction with some of the control boards has made a great deal of progress with virus free plant material. It has been established that in other countries the existing production on the same land has been increased by 30% and more. That is the direction in which we should develop instead of placing larger areas under vines. We should first utilize the existing vines to the full, with the right root-stock and virus-free material. He also requested that wine should fall under the Department of Agriculture. I do not want to argue with him on that score, because I agree with him completely. My personal feeling is that it would be very sound if one could find a method of making light wines more easily available, and in that way probably reducing the consumption of spirits, particularly by our younger people. The time will probably come when we will be able to obtain a light wine in caf&#x00E9;s, instead of drinking brandy and whisky, which is imported, in the bar.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria District discussed the matter of withholding import permits for machinery when spares are not kept. We shall bring this matter to the attention of the Department of Economic Affairs, which issues the permits. But the exploitation of the public through prices is something which is very important. Several hon. members on both sides referred to this. It is so important that I am grateful that there are various newspapers which publish prices from time to time, particularly of canned products and foodstuffs which are on the shelves. This helps a great deal, for the housewife can see what the price is, and what she should pay for foodstuffs. In addition a request was made to the public to bring such exploitation to the attention of the department so that steps could be taken.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria District emphasized the important role of co-operatives. It is accepted on both sides of <span class="col_7703-7704" refersTo="page_0919"/>the House that the co-operative system is one of the cornerstones of agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal requested a system of long-term credit in agriculture. Various hon. members opposite also asked for this. One of the hon. members opposite referred in passing to the fact that half the farmers could not be assisted. The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure was established in 1966, when the old Department of Lands and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board were incorporated into it. Since 1966 R20,8 million has been lent to 47 000 farmers in the form of stock fodder loans. An amount of R10,l million was lent to 6 800 farmers for crop production aids. For land purchases an amount of R58,26 million was lent to 2 339 farmers. The total amount which the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure made available to farmers, amounted to R145 million for 67 000 farmers. However, there were also applicants whose applications were refused. One of the hon. members correctly pointed out that it was not possible to help all of them. One of the reasons why it was not possible to help some people was for example that the applicant was not up to it. Hon. members know how the system works. There are local committees which go into the applicant&#x2019;s application in detail. We allow ourselves to be guided by practical farmers in the vicinity, with the magistrate as the chairman of the local committee. Such a committee then makes a recommendation to the Agricultural Credit Board. It is simply impossible to help all the applicants with loans. In addition we also have to consider the assistance the Land Bank has already made available to an applicant when it comes to long-term financing. At the moment the Land Bank already has a total amount of R289 million outstanding among farmers in the form of long-term mortgage loans, hypothec lands and short-term cash credit loans. These are forms of credit which are covered by means of an insurance scheme.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer requested that the Land Bank should review its scheme of hypothec lands for the purchase of weaning calves. The Land Bank notified me that they have already made a great deal of progress with an investigation in that direction. It is a new production field in agriculture to feed weaning calves. The idea is that hypothec loans should not be granted only for the purchase of stud cows. I am pleased to be able to say that attention is very rapidly being given to this field.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal also requested that we should hold an agricultural year. [Interjections.] We had a year in which we celebrated the festival of the soil. When the festival was over, all thought of the soil was also over, and we had nothing further to do with it. After that, things went on merrily as before. Festivals of this kind cost between R100 000 and R200 000 per annum. We should rather inculcate in our farmers that every year should be an agricultural year. I do not know whether we should spend the department&#x2019;s money on such a propaganda campaign What the farmers want from our country is not something like that. The farmers want a decent price for their produce from our country.</p>

<p>It seems to me hon. members opposite have undergone a change of heart. I shall come in a moment to how they wanted to do me in because we granted an increase in meat prices.</p>

<p>Such a lot is being said about soil conservation and the protection of the soil. My standpoint is that our tax system is such that if the farmer makes a profit he may make his contours, fence his land and construct his conservation works first, before he has to pay tax. This enables the farmer to make a decent subsistence, and then he can do all this work out of his profits. It is of no avail preaching to a person from morning until night about how he should conserve the soil if he is like a bear with a sore head in any case when he sits down to make a few calculations and finds that there is nothing left. He must make a profit to be able to apply these practices. I hope the hon. member for Aliwal is satisfied with this explanation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Piketberg discussed bread prices and the wage levels of the Bantu. I was very pleased about his approach. One of the hon. members on this side&#x2014;I think it was the hon. member for Heilbron&#x2014;said that the price increase in mealiemeal cost the Bantu six cents per month. If one takes into consideration that the price of bread was increased by two cents, it means that if a family buys one loaf per day, it amounts to an additional expenditure of 60 cents per month. The hon. member also referred to the salary <span class="col_7705-7706" refersTo="page_0920"/>adjustments which completely justify such an additional expenditure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem spoke like a farmer who has both feet planted firmly on the ground. He put forward quite a number of practical suggestions, but when he advocated an increased wheat price, the hon. member for East London City cried out: &#x201C;Disgraceful.&#x201D; There is nothing wrong with that. If the production costs of the farmer rise as a result of the rising prices of implements, fuel and spare parts, it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the price of the product is adjusted accordingly. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town stated repeatedly that the Government had reduced the price received by the farmer for a bag of wheat by 20 cents. In reality the price was reduced by 30 cents per bag. In the determination of the price we consider the total crop. This was a situation where we were saddled with a tremendous surplus of wheat.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We adjust the price from year to year. There is one thing the hon. member can forget about, however, and that is production costs plus an entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage. That is what the hon. member for Benoni referred to. It varies from one farm to another, from one district to another and for many of these commodities one cannot have a differentiated price. One will have to have one price, but it is adjusted according to circumstances. I would far rather receive R5 for a bag of wheat when I am harvesting 40 bags per morgen than R7 per bag when I am harvesting five per morgen. After all, I am not stupid. That is the method whereby we determine our prices. That is the reason why there was a downward adjustment last year of 30 cents per bag. I could just inform the hon. member that the storage of that wheat does not cost the farmer or the consumer a cent, for it is borne entirely by the Minister of Finance. The State pays for the storage, the handling &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>From the same source as that from which you want to pay the extra subsidy on foodstuffs. That is where he gets his money from. The hon. member referred to lower extractions, and the wrapping of bread, as well as to cut bread. Since we have now heard all these complaints about the increased subsidies, I could just inform the hon. members that the time may even arrive this year when we will afford the consumer the opportunity of purchasing a cut loaf which has been wrapped and which has a lower extraction without any control being exercised over the price. We now have the position that the smaller, specially baked loaf which falls under the classification of &#x201C;cake&#x201D; is sold at 16 cents, and is selling like hot cakes. The people have money. In regard to the man who wants to pay that price for a loaf of bread, if he wants to eat cake three times a day, let him eat it! However, this is the direction in which we are thinking when we think in terms of reducing the subsidy. I shall tell the hon. members what will happen. It will in fact be the less well-to-do person who is going to eat this kind of cake.</p>

<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister on the fine contribution which he made in his fine speech on the 25 years the National Party has been in power. We do not play politics here &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; but I do want to say that this is also an opportune moment to congratulate the Opposition. It is truly an achievement to have been in opposition for 25 years. I think that this is the only opposition party which has specialized, and whose members are today experts in the field of being an opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rustenburg referred to the M.T.G.A. as an example of what a co-operative should be. I should like to add to this that the hon. member for Brits and the hon. member for Rustenburg make representations from time to time on behalf of the tobacco farmers in the country. Their contributions as chairman and secretary of the tobacco group, together with those of the tobacco farmers, make it very difficult for a Minister to say &#x201C;No&#x201D;. The adjustment of the price, an adjustment of 25% was in my opinion quite justified, and I think that the tobacco farmers were quite entitled to that contribution of R1,4 million for an emergency situation, for they had never before received State assistance and they have always been great contributors to the State coffers through indirect taxation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wakkerstroom discussed the economy which is so important. <span class="col_7707-7708" refersTo="page_0921"/>We do not differ from one another at all. The most important section of the syllabus today should be agricultural economy. You can approach a person who has the most beautiful cows and has won all the prizes on the shows. When you ask him what it costs to fatten up the cow to that condition, he will tell you: &#x201C;I do not know.&#x201D; When you ask him what his milk production is, he will tell you that it is an average of four gallons per cow for his entire herd. Then you can work out for him that it costs him more than 30 cents per gallon for the force feed he has to provide. He has a wonderful herd of cows, and he wins all the prizes on the shows, in contrast to another fellow who has a herd of tattered old cows, but he is showing a profit. It is the economy of the matter which is so important. One finds farmers in our country today who can tell you precisely what their pick-up trucks cost them per mile. They can tell you: &#x201C;This is my cost on every item; I cannot buy a new pick-up truck, for it is not justified.&#x201D; The hon. member for Vryburg discussed the future meat supply.</p>

<p>What about the other plea of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The question of the Royal Agricultural Show&#x003F; It does not fall under my control. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Vryburg discussed the increase of the floor price, and in that respect the hon. member was entirely happy. Let me state now what the problem in regard to meat production was. We can say to a farmer now: &#x201C;Here is your floor price; it is guaranteed. We have increased it from 44 cents for grade IAX to 60 cents. We shall ensure that in due course you have enough slaughtering facilities in the country.&#x201D;&#x2014;These are all things to which the hon. member for Vryburg referred&#x2014;. &#x201C;Now you make your contribution. Put a stop to this 50% calf percentage, put a stop to the trampling of grazing land. We give you the extension services, now take the trouble to look at the tests. We, the Government, are doing our best and in addition have also introduced a support price for you in terms of which the price does not drop by more than 2 cents per day or 4 cents per week.&#x201D; We are doing all these things to encourage the farmer, and a greater injection than this I cannot imagine for assisting the farmer. The hon. member for Prieska discussed the co-operative marketing of meat and what the situation had previously been. I know the hon. member is a great believer in co-operatives, and I am becoming more and more convinced that the person who injures the co-operative idea in this country in any way, will have the farmers to reckon with. I say thank the hon. member very much for his contribution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Harrismith discussed the exorbitant prices in the meat retail trade. At present it is true that there are many retail butchers who find themselves in difficulties as a result of the high salaries of blockmen, the hygienic standards of municipalities and also perhaps as a result of over-trading in certain areas. In addition there is the competition from supermarkets. Housewives have changed. Nowadays they want to stop once and make all their purchases under one roof. While she has parking she wants to purchase anything from shoelaces to a head of cabbage, a pumpkin and meat, under one roof. In many cases this hurts the retail butcher. However, we are keeping an eye on this situation.</p>

<p>I want to inform the hon. member that as far as home industries are concerned, we sent out a letter in which we convinced the Wheat Board that the amount of wheat which is being baked by home industries is minimal. There are many housewives in the rural areas who instead of going out to work can bake koeksusters and milk tart in their kitchens, sell them and in this way earn an extra income. I cannot see how there can be any argument in regard to hygiene in this connection. Everyone of us sitting here grew up in the kitchen, and not one of us died. I cannot therefore imagine that there need be any concern from a hygienic point of view. This matter has been settled as far as the Wheat Board is concerned, and will be dealt with in this way.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Albany. He said there were not enough stock inspectors. He also had a new idea in regard to veterinarians and this is quite in order. I replied to the hon. member on that score. It is the hon. member for Newton Park I have to deal with. The hon. member discussed the allocation of land in regard to the Orange River project. He said we should announce it at this early stage. The final announcement will be made soon; there are still certain surveys which still have to dispose of, and certain <span class="col_7709-7710" refersTo="page_0922"/>talks we still have to have, specifically with the Department of Water Affairs in regard to the cost of water. If the water is too expensive, the unit has to be larger in order to achieve a balance. The hon. member also said that the farmers of Wolmaransstad were coming to the Government, hat in hand, to beg for assistance. Nothing of the kind. I told the hon. member earlier that the farmers simply came together to meet their Members of Parliament &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>It was your <i>Rapport</i> which said that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct. However, I was there in person, and the farmers did not come to beg. There are no farmers in our country who beg. They simply told me: &#x201C;Come and see what you think of the situation,&#x201D; and invited the Members of Parliament to come and see the disaster that had struck them. However, they did not come to beg, definitely not. I think it was wrong of the hon. member to refer to those farmers and say that they had come to beg. Now the hon. member is alleging that we gave them a deferred payment of 50 cents on last year&#x2019;s crop. That was because we understood the situation. We guaranteed the co-operatives at least R25 million in order to give them loans for their means of production. Now the hon. member is claiming that we do not have any long-term planning and that this is the reason why the farmers came to us hat in hand. A person can have the best long-term planning and the best planning board, one can say that one wants 15 million bags of grain and announce the price at this early stage, but then it does not rain; and in that case it is by no means impossible that we will have only nine million bags of wheat. Hon. members must realize that we do not know, when the farmers sow their seed, how much wheat we are going to harvest. On the other hand, it may happen, if we have announced the price, that we find that the crop is one of 20 million bags, and that we have to export at a loss of R3 per bag, as was the case four months ago. Where must the money come from&#x003F; On the other hand, the hon. members are fit to be tied when we increase taxation; and then on the other hand they advocate that we should subsidize each of these foodstuffs, although a subsidy of almost R100 million is already being allotted for foodstuffs.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town requested that we should standardize tractors. We have discussed this matter on many previous occasions. It is very easy for the hon. member to say that we should standardize our tractors, but he must tell me what tractors we must standardize. Is he prepared to tell the farmers of King William&#x2019;s Town that they may no longer buy a Fordson or a Massey-Ferguson, because the Government has decided that only three or four specific models may be purchased&#x003F; In addition, there are already other makes of tractor in the country. There are trade agreements with other countries&#x2014;you cannot tell a country like Italy that you do not want to allow a single Fiat tractor to be sold in this country. It is not such an easy thing to do.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town made a terrible fuss about the wheat price. He said that we heaped scorn on the suggestions made by the United Party. This puts me in mind of the piccanin who came running up&#x2014;the waggon had passed over Jonah&#x2019;s head, and Jonah was dead&#x2014; and said to his master: &#x201C;Master, the waggon went over Jonah&#x2019;s head.&#x201D; The farmer said: &#x201C;But that is terrible; I am sorry to hear that. And apart from that&#x003F;&#x201D;, for the farmer wanted more details. The piccanin then told him: &#x201C;No, apart from that old Jonah is all right.&#x201D; It is of no use first arguing and subsequently admitting that we are nevertheless all right. After all, we are still all right if one considers the whole situation. As far as price determinations are concerned, he asked why we waited so long before increasing the floor price. Surely the hon. member is aware of what the circumstances were. Of what use is it increasing the floor price if one does not have slaughtering facilities, if 400 sheep are dying on the Johannesburg market every day because we do not have slaughtering facilities&#x003F; Of what use is it giving the farmers an increased floor price if, at that stage, there is a surplus of meat&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany discussed the determination of production, and this links up with what was said by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom. We have an Agricultural Production Economy Division with farm record systems in which 1 400 farmers are participating. We are attempting to expand the system and to get more farmers to participate and send in their statistics, which we could then feed into a computer so that we can advise them as to how they should set to work. Many <span class="col_7711-7712" refersTo="page_0923"/>of the farmers changed over from a loss position to a profit position as a result of this. If only we had more staff we would be able to give far more attention to this division. It is very essential.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City said that all aspects of agricultural financing should be dealt with by one organization. The hon. member then went on to say that the person who had paid too much for his land should not qualify; he is not a client of this umbrella organization in which Agricultural Credit and the Land Bank are thrown together. To say to a person today that he paid too much for his land is perhaps incorrect. Land prices are a relative thing. The prices are going to increase even further now; I regret having to say this, but can you tell me what the real agricultural value of land is in every district&#x003F; If we had to give a person a loan according to the agricultural value of his land we may as well forget about ever giving such a loan; we have to allow the land value to incline a little to the speculative side as well. There are farmers who are today paying R60 per morgen for cattle land. He has to have five morgen for a head of cattle, it amounts to R300 per head. At agricultural credit interest of 5%&#x2014;but he has to redeem it within 25 years; so it is an effective 8&#x00BE;%&#x2014;it already costs him R24 per head. If one then adds the animal as well at R100, and the interest on that, he has to pay R30 per head. Then he can do what he likes but at today&#x2019;s meat prices with a 50% calf percentage he simply cannot do it. If one wants to apply it in this way, one cannot give anyone a loan for the purchase of land. All these matters have to be approached in a practical way, each on its own merit and in addition to that we are looking after these youngsters. If they are already too old, or are no longer a practical proposition, then we say &#x201C;No&#x201D;. It is difficult to lay down a uniform rule.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the farmers&#x2019; investment in the Land Bank should be tax free. This is a commendable idea, but whether we shall ever succeed in doing so, I do not know. However, we could go into it. The hon. member also made certain practical suggestions to which we shall have to give attention. I do not pour scorn on the things which you have suggested because you are a member of the United Party, Uncle John. Because you are a practical farmer I believe that you give us practical suggestions to which we can give attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point then raised another matter. I cannot but agree with the hon. member.</p>

<p>The expenditure on fertilizer last year was R114 million. This is one of the highest cost items in agriculture. At present there are for all practical purposes only two fertilizer companies. I shall talk to the Minister of Economic Affairs about this matter. We are giving a subsidy of R15 million in regard to fertilizer which is divided up <i>pro rata,</i> depending on the requirements. If an injection has to be made in respect of nitrogen, potash or super phosphates, the subsidy is adjusted accordingly. However, there is only R15 million available. This is the farmers&#x2019; major expense, and when he experiences a drought it is lost. The hon. member discussed the matter of a more intensive application of fertilizer. If we know what our rainfall is going to be we would be able to achieve optimum crops by means of the right fertilization. We have only scratched the surface of fertilization in this country. We shall have to look into this matter. The hon. member also referred to the compensation on investment of 13% by the fertilizer companies, which then announced a dividend of 20%. We shall have to look into that as well. The people say that they cannot make a living. It is perhaps incorrect to continue in that way.</p>

<p>What about Coloured housing&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We have now appointed a committee in regard to Coloured housing. A farmer may today obtain a loan of only R600 from the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, at 5% interest. With that one can build almost nothing. In this way an amount of R480 000 has been made available. The industrialist draws his employees from the Bantu locations which have been established by the municipalities. However, the farmer has to build his own location. We must see whether we cannot get an interest-free loan for this purpose. We must devise a method. Those buildings become the property of the farmer. We must in some way or another provide the necessary encouragement, for it is definitely true that the Bantu <span class="col_7713-7714" refersTo="page_0924"/>housing on our farms leaves much to be desired. We shall have to think in this direction.</p>

<p>That is something to consider. The hon. member must bear in mind that I do not carry the keys to the safe around with me. I have to go and ask Dr. Diederichs for the money. We are working in this direction. We shall have to give attention to this matter very soon.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni said that demands are being made on the farmers to produce more cheaply. I should like to ask the hon. member whether he will ask the consumers in Benoni whether they are satisfied with the meat and milk prices. The hon. member created the impression that we are squeezing the farmer dry, and that we are giving him almost nothing for his produce. Is that the right approach while our criticism is in fact that the consumer today is having to pay too much for certain kinds of food. I think it was an unfair statement. On the other hand I want to advocate that we should never cause the feeling to arise that when we discuss agricultural matters in this debate we do not take the consumer into consideration as well. The two so hand in hand. My feeling in respect of maize, groundnuts, sunflowers, meat and tobacco, yes, the whole lot, was that we should give agriculture an injection. Let us, with a view to the cost increases with which the farmer has to cope, give him a price so that he can get his sums to work out. We can then review the position from year to year. If there are further cost increases, we shall have to make adjustments. If our economy justifies it, we can subsidize certain foodstuffs to an even greater extent, if we have the funds. However, we must look at these things in a practical way.</p>

<p>The hon. member also discussed the stock withdrawal scheme. The hon. member asked whether farmers would now be allowed to withdraw from the scheme. Now I want to inform the member that this is in fact the case. If a farmer states that his veld has recovered and that he wishes to leave the scheme, he may do so. I am pleased the hon. member asked that question. It affords me an opportunity of replying to it. It is not compulsory for the farmer to participate in the scheme for five years. A great deal of the veld has recovered in a wonderful way. Of course the position differs from one district to another.</p>

<p>The hon. member then paid me a tremendous compliment, for which I want to thank him. He asked me whether I would reintroduce the scheme again in five years&#x2019; time. I do not think so, because I think the veld would have recovered fully. It will then not be necessary to reintroduce a scheme. It costs too much money. But I want to thank him for the confidence which he displayed in me, namely that I will still be here in five years&#x2019; time to consider such a scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has been given so much praise today that I suspect he is already completely embarrassed as a result. Today we have actually had an experience here, because he was praised, <i>inter alia,</i> by the hon. the Deputy Minister. We also had an experience in that the hon. member for Brits, uncle Pottie, stood up here and instead of speaking politics, as we are accustomed to hear from him, he spoke about agriculture. After that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture jumped up. After his appointment and in his first debate about agriculture, we expected him to make a contribution in connection with agriculture. But instead of that he spoke politics.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to certain remarks which the hon. the Minister made. In the first place I want to tell him that although there may be many people who can afford to eat cake three times a day, old Jonas is not that well off. There are a few points we shall still be raising in this connection. When I spoke of applicants for agricultural credit, I was not trying to express criticism in connection with the funds which the Department of Agricultural Credit has, or in connection with the assistance they are giving. We are aware of the position as far as that is concerned. What I said was that the percentage of the farmers going bankrupt in this country is greater than in other countries, as a result of the fact that so many of the applicants who approach the Department of Agricultural Credit cannot be assisted. They cannot be assisted; That is all. That is why I used it as a counterargument to what was said about the prosperity of the farmers.</p>

<p>In addition, I have repeatedly heard the <span class="col_7715-7716" refersTo="page_0925"/>hon. the Minister tell of the miracles brought about by the co-operative movement in South Africa. I had also hoped to hear him say, as I have so frequently said before the South African Agricultural Union, and for which I am sometimes blamed, that the farmers must not think that the co-operative societies exist solely for the sake of marketing and distribution. They also have another duty, i.e. to handle production co-operatively. That is their own function. Sir, you must now tell me where production is handled co-operatively like this country. Every farmer in South Africa is such an individualist that he does not want to look at his neighbour&#x2019;s house. On the other hand, co-operative production is promoted in many other countries. I am thinking for example of Israel, France, Germany, England, Spain, Portugal, the United States and others, where co-operative production takes place on a large scale. Groups of farmers work together and sometimes they live together. In spots where the agricultural land is valuable they live together because they do not want the whole area cluttered up with houses. There they use the same machinery and the same labourers, if they are able to do so. In this way they succeed in bringing about a saving. This co-operative production is done to keep the production costs as such as low as possible. That is one of the prime functions which agricultural co-operatives ought to fulfil, but it is something they do not want to face up to; they speak only of marketing and distribution, and there they are co-operative. Sir, I do not want to criticize this. What I am criticizing is the unwillingness of the farmers in South Africa to produce co-operatively.</p>

<p>They could, for example, use the same set of machinery, the same workers. Sir, Jonas is not &#x201C;all right&#x201D;, and I expect the Minister also to issue that warning to the farmers of South Africa. He must tell them that if we want to produce on a basis that would enable us to compete with the rest of the world as far as international prices are concerned, it would be necessary to produce co-operatively. How many of our products&#x2019; prices are not already far above the international standard prices&#x003F; But the Minister continues to justify his standpoint. He also referred to the hon. member for Bethlehem&#x2019;s plea for an increased wheat price. Sir, if we were to double the wheat price, every farmer in the Free State would soon begin to sow wheat. We would have so much wheat that we would not know what to do with it. There must be a proper relationship between those things; that is very important. The hon. the Minister also said that the price of land is relative. Sir, before the Land Bank grants a loan it first valuates the land and the same applies to Agricultural Credit. They have a committee which valuates the land and they give a loan of 60% of the valuation placed on the land by that committee, and the hon. the Minister knows this as well as I do. Why can we not then, in future, under a central financing corporation, or whatever we want to call it, make use of the same kind of method&#x003F; I was not speaking of people who had paid too high a price for their land and who are now applying to the Land Bank for assistance. The water has already flowed under the bridge. I spoke of a measure of control which could be exercized in future. Sir, the hon. the Minister is surely a practical man; he knows that one cannot simply continue to increase the price of products as the price of land increases; there must be a proper ratio between the price of land and the price which the farmer obtains for his product.</p>

<p>Sir, in the few opportunities I may still have to speak, I shall also deal with other aspects of agriculture. At this stage I want to come back to the plea that was lodged here in connection with the livestock withdrawal scheme. Sir, it was a wonderful scheme. In fact, it was proposed by this side.</p>

<p>As far back as four years ago there was talk of the withdrawal of the whole Karoo, and I want to come back to the Karoo and tell the hon. the Minister that as good as that withdrawal scheme has been, and as well as it is still functioning today, it has not yet meant the reclamation of the Karoo: it has not yet meant the rehabilitation of the veld. We shall have to design a scheme to decrease the Karoo&#x2019;s load until such time as it has been rehabilitated to such an extent that it again draws back its boundaries instead of extending them. Sir, there is so little grazing for cattle and sheep in the Karoo that they constantly have to be looking for a little food; they cannot lie down and sleep; that is the problem we have in <span class="col_7717-7718" refersTo="page_0926"/>connection with our veld. Sir, 80% of the high rainfall area is in the Bantu areas; we have only 20% of the high rainfall area, and there are limits to what that land can produce, even with the use of the most scientific methods. I cannot see how, over the next decade or two, the production capability of the Bantu will increase to such an extent that they will also be able to make their proper contribution to the increased production which we will need in order to feed 50 million people; it will again be the White man who will have to do so, and the Whites have very little high rainfall land at their disposal. If we consider these things, we realize how necessary it is to try to rehabilitate the grazing lands of South Africa, particularly in the large sheep areas. Sir, may I quote to you what has been said in that connection by an expert&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Photographs of other parts of South Africa taken from space have dramatically emphasized the encroachment of the Karoo. Scientists in Pretoria who have been evaluating the Earth Resources Technology Satellite&#x2019;s imagery say the space pictures show that in certain areas the boundary of the Karoo has advanced nearly 70 kilometres into former grassland during the past 20 years and that Karoo boundaries will now have to be re-defined on plant ecology maps.</block>

<p>Seventy kilometres over a period of 20 years&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Grassland now covers merely 26% of South Africa, whereas savannas and semi-desert dwarf shrub Karoo covers between 31% and 35% of the surface. Pasture research in the future, say the scientists, will have to be directed towards maintaining and providing for an adequate grass component in either a Karoid dwarf shrub steppe or a savanna type ecosystem.</block>

<block name="quote">The area of South Africa in which many farmers live is particularly affected by the march of the Karoo. A line roughly between Aliwal North and Wepener is the new mark.</block>

<p>I cannot tell the Minister what can be done about that. I can only say that even the load, regarded by his department as a reasonable load for the Karoo, must be reduced. There is no other method of doing this. It will cost money. Do not think that the withdrawal scheme as such was so remunerative to the farmer that he obtained nearly as much as he could have on the free market for his livestock which were there and which he then had to reduce in numbers. But we acknowledge that it does bring about a measure of rehabilitation and that the lands have been reclaimed to a certain extent. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow up on what the previous sneaker has said. In the few minutes at my disposal I want to come back to a matter which is of great importance within our agricultural sector, and that is the making available of state-owned land to farmers. The allocation of state-owned land in South Africa has a long history. It gained momentum particularly after the First World War when the well-known &#x201C;Kompanjesgronde&#x201D; and other state-owned land were allocated by the then Government of Gen. Smuts to soldiers who had returned. In the Marico district it was the Lewis and Marks lands, in particular, which were allocated by the Land Board on a large scale at the time to the then supporters of the Smuts Government and soldiers who had returned. The prices were at times as low as 10 shillings per morgen, and I want to venture to say that many farms were made available at no more than R6 per morgen. These farms are today worth R100 and more per morgen. This process also took place after the Second World War with the resettlement of soldiers who returned. Irrigation holdings were allocated everywhere to our impoverished farmers, particularly during and after the depression of 1933, and many of those schemes were actually emergency schemes. We still remember the church scheme at Kakamas with its small units of 3 to 6 morgen, and the schemes at Groblersdal and other places, where land was allocated on the basis of small uneconomic units at extremely uneconomic and even sub-economic prices. The loan periods varied, but they even extended to 65 years, with interest rates that were sometimes as low as 1% and 2%. The National Party elaborated on this policy, also by making available the well-known Black snots where Bantu were resettled and where that land then became available for Whites. For efficient administration there was a changeover to the present system whereby all land transactions, like valuations and allocations, are done by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. The only real difference is that this department no <span class="col_7719-7720" refersTo="page_0927"/>longer allocates uneconomic units, and also that the loan period has been reduced to 35 years and less. The interest rate is still a reasonable one, i.e. 4% to 6%, in a few cases perhaps a little higher. But the point I want to make is that by the implementation of this policy by the State throughout these years, the land-hungry farmer in South Africa has been rendered a service that cannot be measured or described in words. There are thousands of people who are grateful for that, not only those who received the allocations at the time, but also those who thus found their feet again and could also help their children to take courses of study. This has furnished people who are today occupying dignified positions in our national economy. Literally thousands of farmers were established and rehabilitated. Thousands of young farmers who had their roots in the soil were given the opportunity to begin farming on an economic basis. There are some of these farmers whom we could today easily place in the category of the best and most prosperous of South African farmers, people who have furnished wonderful contributions to agriculture in our country. Today there is a strong trend towards state-owned land also having to be made available at economic prices, at the prevailing commercial prices or at the highest offer and for the money thereby collected to be employed more usefully by the State in other sectors. I want to state that this could be a disaster for agriculture in South Africa. It would be disaster for the land-hungry farmers in South Africa. It would only suit the purposes of the land barons and financially strong farmers to also try to obtain those state-owned lands. It would be a deviation in principle and policy which the hon. the Minister would have to give very good consideration to when representations are made to him along those lines. If he were to consider such representations favourably, this would be a serious deviation from the policy which has been adopted throughout the years to such good advantage for our land-hungry farmers on the platteland. Today there are still numerous extremely promising and capable share croppers, tenant farmers, young farmers and farm foremen who are hankering for land, people who would never be in a position to obtain a farm or economic units at the present commercial land prices. State allocation at low economic prices is the only way&#x2014;I repeat the only way&#x2014;in which this category of farmers can get hold of land in order to make a start.</p>

<p>Making land available at a low price is indeed a service being rendered by the State to the agricultural sector and our farming population, a service which cannot be described in words, as I said a moment ago. This has kept hundreds of people, if not thousands of people, on the platteland.</p>

<p>However, I want to proceed by expressing a few ideas about another aspect of allocation. I am referring to the subdivision of existing state-owned lands. The position has always been, as far as subdivisions are concerned, that land can be added to applicants&#x2019; farms which are situated adjacent or near to such state land. In so doing, uneconomic farms are transformed into economic units. What I cannot understand is how the State can initially divide up units which come into its possession, into economic units only to cut them up again later in order to add smaller portions to the land of people living nearby so that their land can be converted into economic units. This procedure will never work in practice, as I see it, because there may be farmers in that area who do not need a whole unit&#x2014;they may, however, need only 100 or 200 hectares to consolidate with their units of 200 or 300 hectares. If state-owned land, situated near the properties of such farmers, has already been subdivided into units of 500 or 600 hectares, how could it again be divided up in order to be consolidated with the surrounding economic units&#x003F;</p>

<p>The last aspect I want to refer to in this connection, is the order of preference according to which land is made available. It is sometimes said that only local applicants should be given preference. I adhere to the opinion that applications should also be allowed from other provinces and that every application should be dealt with on merit, but if all things are equal, and in addition there is a possibility of consolidation, the local applicant must be given preference. It is also asked at times what the role of M.P.s must be in connection with recommendations for applicants. I want to say that an M.P. should give every applicant a merit testimonial, but should also be allowed, in exceptional cases, which are really deserving, to mention at the bottom of his letter that the relevant person&#x2019;s case is an exceptionally deserving one.

<p>The hon. member has just come in and sat here cackling although he knows nothing of what is going on here. I do not know whether he wants to lay an egg but he may speak about chickens and eggs if he wants to cackle. It is striking&#x2014;and everyone has observed this&#x2014;that there is no enthusiasm in the United Party. We have an idea why there is no enthusiasm, because we would probably not have been very enthusiastic either if we had had to sit in the Opposition for 25 years and if, after 25 years, there was as much mutual discord as the United Party is experiencing in their ranks. In the hours devoted to this agricultural debate, we have listened in vain to get something positive from the United Party. I want to say in all reasonableness that I think that the hon. member for Newton Park made one positive suggestion, but one which is nevertheless very impractical. The hon. the Minister has replied to it. This suggestion was that prices should be determined in advance for the farmers&#x2019; agricultural products. I want to invite the hon. member to come and have a look at what is taking place at Wolmaransstad. Fifteen per cent of the surface area of Wolmaransstad&#x2019;s magisterial district is under maize this year. In other words, 85% of the surface area is not under maize. What price must we pay to people, not because they did not want to plant, but because they could not plant&#x003F; Conditions were such that they could not plant. For that reason I am saying that the hon. member for Newton Park was totally impractical in respect of the one suggestion he contributed to this debate. I have previously had the opportunity, on 3rd April, to lodge a plea with the hon. the Minister for a better dispensation for the farmers of South Africa. Today I have the opportunity of saying thank you very much to the hon. the Minister for the announcement and concession which he made. In saying thank you to the hon. the Minister, I am not only speaking on behalf of the constituency which I have the privilege to represent, but I am speaking on behalf of the maize farmers of South Africa. And it makes no difference whether they are members of organized agriculture, or whether they are members of S.A.M.P.I. I can tell the hon. the Minister with great confidence that I have made the necessary inquiries far beyond the boundaries of my constituency and that I can speak on behalf of the maize farmers, with great appreciation, of what the hon. the Minister has done for the maize farmers this year, a year in which this was vital.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, agricultural land in White South Africa is becoming less and not more, although there is a great demand. [Interjections.] Yes, thanks to the National Government. I want to tell the hon. member that the land which is, in fact, available is only that belonging to the Whites. As a result of the policy of the consolidation of the homelands, agricultural land will be withdrawn from White South Africa. For that reason it is necessary for us to utilize, to its best possible potential, the land that is left and which is at our disposal, agricultural land with a limited agricultural potential. There is a strong urge, particularly on the part of the Afrikaans-speaking boy, to be absorbed into the agricultural industry. We understand, however, that everyone who would like to live on a farm cannot be a landowner. There cannot be a further subdivision of our agricultural land, particularly not to such an extent that uneconomically small units develop. However, this evening I want to make a very urgent appeal to parents, teachers and pupils to give serious thought to qualifying themselves, if they have the aptitude, and to offer themselves for employment in our agricultural departments, and to render a service to the South African soil, the father-land and the people of South Africa in that way. If, from the agricultural land at our disposal, land with a limited potential, we want to continue to feed a growing people, it will be necessary for us to use that land with greater circumspection, knowledge and judgment. That knowledge about how we must utilize this land is knowledge we must obtain from research. That research must be done by our own boys. I want to appeal to them to come forward and present themselves so that the land can be utilized to the best advantage. We shall have to get the best possible production from every hectare of land and from every animal we have. Another aspect that we shall have to take a very serious look at is the labour on our farms. That labour must be trained. We must do research for the very good employment of that labour. My time is very limited. It is difficult to say in a few minutes what one would like to say on this occasion. I want to tell our young boys that there are fine careers for them in agriculture, i.e. in serving the Department of Agriculture and thereby being of some use. In that connection I want to recommend this brochure. I am aware of what the Public Service Commission is doing, of the bursaries that are being offered, of all the opportunities there are and of the progress that can be made in the agricultural departments, but I fear that not everyone is aware of the possibilities there are for them. Here I now have this fine brochure, &#x201C;Careers in Agriculture&#x201D;. I want to suggest that we send a few copies of this to all schools in the Republic of South Africa&#x2014; if this is not already being done&#x2014;and that we ask the principals of those schools to bring these careers to the attention of our pupils. We could render no greater service to South Africa than judiciously to conserve its soil and to cultivate it so as to be able to feed a growing people from that soil for all time.</p>

<p>&#x2026; and how platteland voters had written off the United <span class="col_7725-7726" refersTo="page_0930"/>Party. Very recently we had a by-election in a largely agricultural area. Is the hon. member&#x2019;s memory so short that he has forgotten what the result was&#x003F; Does he not know that the majority of the Nationalist Party was substantially reduced&#x003F; Does he not know that, whereas predictions were being made by senior people on his side of the House that there would be a majority of 2 000 in this agricultural area, the majority was something very much less than that&#x003F; I think his memory goes back a little further than that, but he has forgotten what he wants to forget.</p>

<p>I want to turn to the hon. the Deputy Minister for a moment. He made a speech that was not, I suggest, very much of an agricultural speech but more the sort of speech one would expect to hear on a &#x201C;stryddag&#x201D;.</p>

I want to come to this achievement in talking about the question of marketing. What he left out, was that one of the achievements of the Nationalist Government was to ensure the establishment and the consolidation of an ever-growing Black urban community in our country, and a permanent community at that.</p>

<p>I am coming agriculture. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that here, in these Black urban communities, we have, in the light of the evidence furnished by his latest departmental report, a vast potential that has not been exploited by this Government. I can understand that the hon. the Minister might be in some dilemma. If he wants to be a politician and pretend that these urban Black people do not belong there, he must say to himself that these people do not constitute a potential agricultural market. But if he wants to consult his alter ego and wants to be the man who is trying to do something for agriculture in this country, he must forget the politics of the matter. He must forget such things as 1978. As an agricultural marketing man, he must recognize that here we have our biggest potential and permanent market in the country.</p>

<p>I want to test the realism of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department in one field alone, namely the field of citrus marketing. We know that the citrus industry has been looking for a long time for new markets. I do not want to canvass the problems we have overseas in promoting our sales in some countries, but I want to say that the citrus industry&#x2014;the citrus exchange, for example&#x2014;have been looking very seriously at the question of increasing our sales within the Republic. One of the places they looked at, naturally, was the area inhabited by the urban Black people of the Republic. If one looks at the latest annual report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, one notes some very interesting facts. He makes the point that, while there has been a slight increase in the total sales of oranges in 1971 under the special so-called &#x201C;Bantu scheme&#x201D;, despite a slight average price increase from 43c in 1970 to 45c in 1971, there are some matters which cause grave concern. Sales increased among Bantu, from 1 480 000 pockets in 1970 to 1 511790 pockets in 1971. But if one looks at this report, one sees that things are far from what they should be. Let me read. I quote on page 34 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With better distribution of the product &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is citrus, but here the report deals mainly with oranges&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; from the producer to the outlet and from the outlet to the Bantu consumer, sales could be increased still further.</block>

<p>I believe that this is an understatement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is very difficult to find hardworking and financially stable Bantu distributors.</block>

<p>This, of course, might well be true. Let us accept that for a moment. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Soweto in particular there are problems because the facilities are too limited for the quantity of fruit handled, which dropped from 420 000 pockets in 1970 to 412 000 in 1971.</block>

<p>I want us to pause there for a moment and to consider that, on the strength of either <span class="col_7727-7728" refersTo="page_0931"/>of these two figures, the higher or the lower, it means that on average the Black people of Soweto consume something less than half a pocket of oranges each per year. This I think is an appalling figure, when one bears in mind two things. The first is that there is a demand for citrus in places such as Soweto, and the second is that the citrus industry wants to sell. Bearing in mind these two elements, what is going wrong&#x003F; Here we have a food which is highly nutritious, good to eat and full of vitamin C. We have an industry that wants to sell it, and something goes wrong; every person in Soweto, on average, eats something less than half a pocket of oranges a year. This, I may tell you, Sir, is less than the average overall consumption of oranges in this country, if one takes the total domestic sales in relation to the total population. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, from Friday on we have had an extraordinary debate. On Friday we had only three or four &#x201C;Sap&#x201D; men here in the House. They had to speak three times in succession in order to use up their time; each of them had to make three speeches. It was a real agricultural drought on the &#x201C;Sap&#x201D; side. I cannot even talk of the United Party side any more, because I find it terribly annoying if they talk about a &#x201C;United Party&#x201D;; for surely they are no longer united. And now, Sir, we have to hear from the hon. member for Kensington, of all people; they are now bringing him into this agriculture debate. [Interjections.] Worst of all is that that hon. member has now accused the hon. member for Wolmaransstad of making rambling speeches on agriculture. Sir, before that hon. member knew anything about politics, the hon. member for Wolmaransstad was up to his knees in politics and in agriculture. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument on the whole question of citrus in Soweto is a very clear proof of his not having the slightest idea of what it is about. The worst of all, Sir, is that the hon. member then suggested that they did very well in Aliwal and that that was a platteland constituency. He even suggested that the United Party had gained ground. Let us just have a look, agriculturally, at this ground they have now gained. He said they had gained ground. What is the ground on which they tread&#x2014;to keep this matter within the idiom of the agriculture debate&#x003F; The only ground they had to stand on, was the speech the hon. member for Simonstown made on the platteland that they, after all, were co-operating as far as state security and the Schlebusch Commission were concerned. I think this was worth a thousand votes to them, because the platteland &#x201C;Sap&#x201D; is not like these hon. members. In any case, they do not think as Harry Schwarz does. But, Sir, I think it is a waste of time to refer to a member such as the hon. member for Kensington when he spoke on agriculture. I have much more important matters to mention tonight than to refer to the hon. member for Kensington.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park says: &#x201C;Let us hear.&#x201D; He will hear in a moment, Sir. [Interjections.] Sir, I want to challenge that hon. member to come and make a speech in a platteland constituency. Let him come and make a speech in the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;, as the hon. member for Durban Point called it. Let him come to the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D; of Christiana. That is a pleasant little place to come and make a speech at. The hon. member is very welcome. It is a purely platteland constituency, a purely agricultural constituency. The hon. member is, after all, now shadow Minister of Agriculture. I must say that in this debate he was more shadow than minister, because the hon. member for Walmer had to do the work. The hon. member for Newton Park could not do it.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to say a few words in connection with Bantu labour in agriculture. South Africa is, as was also said by other hon. members, a country where we have to deal with varying conditions of climate. We are not really an agricultural country in the sense that we continually have good agricultural years. But notwithstanding all of this the tractor sales in South Africa constitute, for example, 65% of the total tractor sales on the continent of Africa. In this stage the official estimate is that we have 200 000 tractor units functioning in our agricultural fields. I immediately want to add in brackets that I accept these to be licensed tractor units. Sir, 30 years ago we had one tractor per 1 000 ha arable agricultural land. In this stage we have one tractor per 130 ha arable agricultural land. But, Sir, this alone does not mean that we are really so mechanized that the Bantu labour we are using on our farms could be eliminated or decreased. If we look at the labour force on our White farms, we see that in 1946 we had one <span class="col_7729-7730" refersTo="page_0932"/>White person for every 8,21 non-Whites, and, to save time, Sir, I refer you to the figure for 1967, when we had one White person for every 15,70 Bantu on our farms.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that hon. member knows nothing about farming. Sir, it is an established fact that we have really become mechanized in agriculture, but we still have the position that we are using Bantu labour. The investment made in farming machinery such as tractors and other agricultural implements is estimated at R700 million, and notwithstanding the fact that we have made such good progress&#x2014;and this is a lesson to the voters of hon. members on the opposite side&#x2014; 70% of all agricultural implements in South Africa are locally manufactured implements. This figure is higher than in any other sector of industry in South Africa. The local content of the product of the agricultural engineering industry and the agricultural implements manufacturing industry is higher than the local content of the products of any other industry in South Africa.</p>

<p>This all looks very good on paper, Sir, but the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has established that 95% of the Bantu farm labourers we are using are unable or not trained to use and to handle this machinery we use on our farms. I would just in passing like to point out that the machinery we use on our farms is continually becoming bigger and heavier. The industrial laws in regard to safety, etc., which are applied to the industries are not applied to the same extent to our farms. If we look at the number of accidents in which only tractors were involved, we find that the figure is disconcerting. In 1958 we had 301 accidents in which tractors were involved, and in 1966 we had 968, in other words, an increase of 221%. The total increase in the number of tractors for the same period was from 100 000 to 157 000, that is to say, an increase of 57%. But the number of fatal accidents increased from 59 in 1958 to 131 in 1964, an increase of 122% in six years. Sir, I must hurry, because my time has nearly expired. My whole plea amounts to this, that in these circumstances we will have to see to it that our Bantu, our Coloured and our Indian farm labour will be treated in the same way as our White labour in the sense that these people should be properly trained to be able to use and to handle this machinery. We will then probably find that the high repair costs which the agriculturalist has to pay will drastically be decreased.</p>

<p>Sir, if the hon. the Minister will allow me, I want to tell him that I myself, in my own simple farming system, have seen to it that these people who are using the farm machinery and implements are trained, and I may tell you tonight, Sir, that my own repair costs on my farm have decreased by 200% in two years&#x2019; time, after we had trained these people. [Interjections.] I may tell the United Party that I got rid of half my Bantu labourers on my farm and that I paid the other half three times as much in wages as I paid them originally, but I had these people trained. Let other members on the opposite side now tell their United Party supporters in the Christiana district that they should do the same. Sir, it is a challenge to any farmer in South Africa. But it costs the individual farmer a tremendous lot of money if he has to do it on his own. I think it is necessary, where we are giving many short courses for farmers to teach them how to plant carrots, onions, etc., that short courses should be arranged in order to train our Bantu labourers to be able to understand how a tractor works and how it should be handled.

<p>Sir, this reminds me of what the hon. member for Durban Point said quite recently at Kalkrand when he was addressing a meeting there. He claimed that since 1948 the National Government had made no contribution to agriculture and then said that he wanted to make one exception. He wanted to give the National Government credit for&#x2014;to use his own words&#x2014;artificial insemination. Sir, if there is one thing the United Party is in dire need of at this stage, it is artificial insemination. The hon. member for Durban Point is not here now. I do hope that he will not find himself in one of these small cages with the blinding light to which the hon. the Minister referred.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to tell <span class="col_7731-7732" refersTo="page_0933"/>you that things are going well with the farmers in South-West Africa, in spite of a less favourable rainfall season this year; but 1972 was a record year. There are 5118 farmers in South-West Africa and they can boast of an average income of R19 750 or a total gross income of more than R100 million. Sir, I want to tell you that the farmers of South-West Africa know that they have a Government who is looking after their interests. I want to give you the assurance that South Africa has never before, in its history, had a Government who has looked after the interests of the farmers better than this very Government. It is therefore a privilege for me, not only on behalf of the farmers of my constituency, but also on behalf of the farmers of the whole of South Africa and South-West Africa, to say thank you to this Government. We have a great deal to be grateful for. Sir, as an example I want to mention to you that only last year our position in South-West Africa was such that on 31st January there were applications for export permits for no fewer than 607 000 head of cattle. In the first six months there were applications for 331 000, and permits could only be granted for 152 000. But thanks to the intervention and the zeal and hard work of this hon. Minister and his predecessor, ex-Minister Uys, we are today in the favourable position in South Africa that we can market at will. The three slaughtering institutions are functioning excellently. Prices are good and there are really no complaints. I think the hon. member for Durban Point must take note of this, because I want to tell him that even those United Party farmers at Kalkrand agree that things are going well for the farmers in South-West Africa. They laugh up their sleeves at him when he makes such statements.</p>

<speech by="#botma">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. BOTMA</person>:</from>

<p>Although prices are high, it is my humble opinion that our hon. Minister with his competent department could perhaps take a quick look at certain bottlenecks that still exist. I do not actually want to call them bottlenecks, but because things are going so well and because the prices are high I think it is the right time now to give attention to certain points, specifically as far as the production of red meat is concerned. I should now like to mention four points to you. The very first is a realistic floor price; secondly a method for selecting and rounding off cattle which are not ready for the market, thirdly the revision of our grading system and, fourthly, a valuation of these mushroom feeding stations or contract feeding stations, whatever one wants to call them.</p>

<p>As far as the first point is concerned, I immediately want to tell you that here I need only say thank you very much. The floor prices have already been increased and they are realistic, and this could only serve as an incentive to the farmers to increase their production of red meat. The second point is illustrated by just taking a look at page eight of the report of the Meat Board. There we see that only 19% of the slaughtering in the Republic and South-West Africa was super and prime grade while only 28% of all slaughtering was first grade and higher. By first rounding off the balance of 53% we could increase the mass of our total meat production tremendously. But then it is necessary that we should also have on-the-hoof auctioning, that there can be a choice and that the farmer does not necessarily have to load up these unmarketable cattle and slaughter them; that there be a choice so that these people who have fodder banks can buy this cattle and then round them off and market them in this way. I want to mention that during 1972 no fewer than 172 000 calves were slaughtered and only 47% of these calves were first grade and higher. I think that there is a tremendous potential here that is being lost, particularly when one thinks of the fact, as has already been mentioned in this debate, that there is a predicted shortage of 1 million tons of red meat for the year 1980. By giving attention to this we could possibly help to fill this tremendous gap. I seriously want to advocate a revision of this existing system. Thirdly there is our grading system, a system which is already very old and which chiefly still focusses on the quantity of fat on carcasses, the appearance of meat, etc. To have carcasses covered by a layer of fat as required by the present regulations is a very costly process. Particularly in respect of young cattle that are still growing it is virtually impossible to get this fat on the carcass easily. But it is also a fact that the housewife of today and also commerce have no interest at all in the fat on the carcass. It is also a fact that the export market&#x2014;and that is the market of the future, a rosy market&#x2014;has no interest in fat at all. For that reason the question <span class="col_7733-7734" refersTo="page_0934"/>arises: Must we continue to produce meat at great cost which both the consumer and commerce regard as undesirable; must we continue to produce fat at great cost just to have it cut off later; should we not place the emphasis on the matter of producing meat, the commodity which commerce and the consumer want&#x003F; South-West Africa has already taken the lead here. I should like to mention to you that in South-West Africa only six grades exist. Fixed prices that are paid by these three slaughtering institutions there are as follows: Super at 73c, prime A at 71c, prime B, grade 1A, B and C are grouped together at 70c, grade two 68c, grade three 64c and grade four 58c. Finally I should like to request the Minister&#x2019;s attention in respect of these mushroom feeding stations that exist, and I specifically want to refer to these feeding stations that take on cattle on behalf of the farmer, feed them for him and then market them on their own account. These people, in contrast to our representatives, do not have to give any guarantees. There is no guarantee that they have to pay the money within three days and I think that this exposes farmers to a very great extent to any form of exploitation or the possibility of bankruptcy or whatever the case may be. I do not think our farmers are aware of this problem and I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious attention to this, before it boomerangs on our farmers at some stage or other. I want to finish that by just saying to the hon. the Minister: Go ahead; you have the support of the farmers of South Africa and we owe you a very great deal of thanks.</p>

<p>I have a great deal of sympathy for the point of view expressed by the hon. member for Omaruru in his desire to make more readily available more and better red meat to the consumers of this country, not only because I represent an area which to a large extent produces red meat from ranching cattle but also because I have interests in that aspect myself. I will say that in contrast with the area which he represents, where the emphasis seems to be on the provision of artificial fodder banks to meet drought situations, and where that sort of land is not threatened by Government policy in other respects, like the consolidations, I come from an area where it is almost unknown to have to feed in times of drought or indeed in winter; there is no artificial feeding at all, but it is an area where a great deal of this type of country which I am sure will appeal to the hon. member, is to be taken out of production for reasons of the Government&#x2019;s racial policy. [Interjections.] However, I do not wish to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. I want to deal with the speech made by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom earlier today, a young man who is young in years, young in politics and young in this House, but a young man nevertheless whose manner and bearing and whose presentation of his case up to now I have always admired. He is reported as having said earlier&#x2014;</p>

<p>You know, Sir, that if one considers the millions which are involved in financing in particular the agriculture of South Africa, it seems to me regrettable, to say the least of it, that for a trifling R2 600 one should utter sentiments which might bedevil the very foundations upon which our society exists. Not only is the Royal Agricultural Society of Natal one of the oldest of its kind in this country; not only is it one with a tradition as honourable as anyone can find; not only is it a Society which distinguished people from all walks of life and from all political persuasions have had the honour of opening &#x2014;from the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition, from foreign Prime Ministers to Prime Ministers of South Africa, and Nationalist Cabinet Ministers one after the other, Administrators of Natal, also from the ranks of the Nationalist Party, they have all been honoured to be invited to open the Royal Show, as it is known in Natal, a show whose standards of excellence, when it comes to the display of agricultural produce, is second to none in South Africa. Apart from this magnificent tradition, the speech by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom is shortsighted in so far as the historical background of South Africa is concerned and more particularly if you consider that Natal has a monarchical tradition of more than 100 years and a republican <span class="col_7735-7736" refersTo="page_0935"/>tradition of less than ten years. The Cape has a monarchial tradition going back hundreds of years, if you consider both the Dutch and the British monarchies which constituted the constitutional heads of state of this province. On the other hand we had in the two republics of the north, the Free State and the Transvaal, a republican tradition in every way equally as honourable and extending back to the early times of the Voortrekkers. Surely in the days of 1973, surely from one of the younger and one would have thought one of the more verligte members of this House &#x2026;</p>

<p>My friend there says that we should talk a little about agriculture. I am very happy to do so. I represent an area which is in the Lowveld. The only agricultural research station which deals with Lowveld matters is in the Eastern Transvaal and it serves a valuable purpose. However, you have in the Lowveld areas of Natal, both the subtropical fruits in respect of which there is a research station near Nelspruit and animal husbandry on an extensive scale under Lowveld conditions, far more wet, very different from those that one gets in the Lowveld of the Transvaal. There has been between myself and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor extensive correspondence with a view to establishing either an agricultural college or a research station or both to cater for the Lowveld conditions in the high-rainfall areas of Natal. This is something which is of considerable importance. One tends to think of the wetter areas of Natal as being an area confined purely to the sugar industry. I may say at once that there is no agricultural research station which caters for that section of agriculture. It is done entirely by the industry for itself. There is no agricultural college where young men who propose to engage in sugar farming are trained. That, too, is undertaken by the large sugar companies in the industry. There is, in my view, an urgent need for Government money to be spent on the establishment of an agricultural college combined with a research station to deal with the wet lowveld conditions of Natal, not only in the field of crops that are grown, which will include sugar, but in the field of animal husbandry as well. I know that there is not enough money for the employment of extension officers, of manpower to man those offices, but I want to tell the hon. the Minister what he probably already knows, and that is that from Durban to the Portuguese border, there are only two extension officers within the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. The one is based at Eshowe and the other one is based at Pongola or Nongoma, an area <span class="col_7737-7738" refersTo="page_0936"/>some 400 to 500 miles. If regard is had to the fact that there is no research station and no type of agricultural college for this area, the hon. the Minister will understand the pleas that I make, not only for additional personnel to serve that area, but also for advanced establishments of the kind that I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House must really join the hon. member for Christiana in saying that we have had a very strange debate on agriculture. I just want to repeat what the hon. member said, by indicating there were no speakers on that side of the House on Friday afternoon. Tonight, however, the hon. member for Kensington came forward to speak on agricultural matters! Furthermore, we had the position that the hon. member for Wakkerstroom made one single remark about the Royal Agricultural Show to which the hon. the Minister replied by saying that it had nothing to do with him. That was the end of the matter, but in spite of that the hon. the leader of the United Party in Natal devoted more than half of his speech to the Royal Agricultural Show of Natal [Interjections.]</p>

<p>These things amaze us.

To my mind the hon. the leader of the United Party in Natal should actually have reprimanded the hon. member for Port Natal a little for certain small things he did. The other evening the hon. member for Port Natal spoke in Afrikaans, whereupon the hon. member for Randburg started laughing. The hon. member for Florida then came along and said the hon. member for Randburg had laughed at the hon. member for Port Natal since he had spoken in Afrikaans.</p>

We cannot wait for him any longer, but it is clear to us that the hon. member is going to deal with agriculture when we shall no longer have an opportunity to rebuke him. However, the hon. the Minister is still there and he shall deal with him. However, we cannot allow ourselves to be side-tracked.</p>

<p>In the times in which we are living we are constantly experiencing increases in the prices of virtually everything. This is how it was put in a paragraph in yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This showed that consumer prices for all items have increased by 10,2% over the same period last year, while the food prices have increased by 17,2%.</block>

<p>This is true. Food prices have increased tremendously in recent times. But now hon. members on the other side, as well as people outside, want to connect this tremendous increase in food prices to the &#x201C;tremendous&#x201D; benefits which the farmer in South Africa is supposedly deriving from it. In the short time at my disposal, I should like to say something in this regard and make a correction.</p>

<p><span class="col_7739-7740" refersTo="page_0937"/>The farmer in South Africa&#x2014;and now I am speaking only of the dairy farmer in particular&#x2014;produces a quality product. It is immaterial whether this product is fresh milk, butter or cheese, or even industrial milk, the consumer in South Africa knows he is getting a quality product. He is getting a quality product in comparison to other beverages and he gets it as cheaply as he could wish. The consumer must not forget that to produce this product, this farmer must make a colossal investment. He must render dedicated service. The undertaking of the individual dairy farmer forms part of one of the few remaining industries in which one has a person working seven days a week, and working very hard, something he has to do in spite of the rising labour costs. In fairness towards these people, we want to say that since 1971 to date, the production of cattle mash has increased by 20%. The production of high-protein food concentrates has increased by no less than 65%. The production of fish-meal has increased by 52%. These figures are only for the period from 1971 to date. I can quote the figures for Cape Town, Pretoria and all the other places, but the tendency is approximately the same everywhere. I can only mention that on the Witwatersrand, which constitutes the largest market, the price of milk increased from 7,655 cents per litre to 9,815 cents per litre as from 1965 on, an increase of only 20% over a period of five years. This happened despite the fact that these people&#x2019;s expenditure on fodder increased by as much as 65% over this period. This calls for appreciation on our part for this section of our farming community who produces this quality product at this price. I do not have a great deal of time at my disposal, but to my mind I shall be neglecting my duty if I do not say&#x2014;and I think someone should underline this later&#x2014;that we should get away from the idea that dairy products, especially butter, are not beneficial to one&#x2019;s heart. I do not want to say a great deal in this regard, but I should like to mention&#x2014;and I hope hon. members take this to heart&#x2014; that the lowest <i>per capita</i> consumption of butter is in the United States, a country which has the highest number of deaths owing to heart disease. The highest <i>per capita</i> consumption of butter is in New Zealand, the country which happens to have the lowest number of deaths owing to heart diseases.</p>

<p>Now I want to express appreciation to our dairy co-operative societies, which, during the difficult days of this industry, have made it possible for this industry to become established, to grow strong and to expand in South Africa. [Interjections.] I have just been interrupted by a reference to a &#x201C;botterbul&#x201D;, but I do not know what they are talking about. I just want to say that our agricultural co-operative societies did a great deal for us during these years, and over a long period of time. Today a great deal is being said against the co-operative societies; I just want to tell you, Sir, that we can never over-emphasize the importance of a co-operative society. We admit that private companies do render tremendous services. We have taken cognizance of one company which made a tremendous profit, a profit which was so big that it paid the State R3 million, in round figures, and its shareholders only R2 million. This is true: it is a fine service which is rendered by the private company, but we want to put the following question to those people who want to harm the co-operative societies and always want to compare them with private undertakings: What would the position of the dairy industry have been today if the co-operative societies had not existed to keep matters in order for the dairy farmers&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think this hon. member owes the Minister and the South African Agricultural Union an apology. I have here in my hand the statement by the president of the South African Agricultural Union, as well as that by the chairman of the liaison committee of the South African Agricultural Union, in which they thank the Minister for the fact that he first consulted the Agricultural Union on the matter before importing the mutton. But that is the United Party for you! When the hon. member was speaking on a farm in the Jansen ville district, he condemned the importation of mutton. Now. Sir, I can name you many of the M.P.s who are sitting over there and who worked against Dawie de Villiers in Johannesburg West, who said that the Government refused to import mutton because it feared the farmers of the country. There is one of them, sitting over there and looking straight at me. But in the rural areas the hon. member for Albany went along and said that to him the whole matter seemed to be an election trick to help Dawie de Villiers in Johannesburg West if the housewives could be promised a decrease in the price of mutton. I want that hon. member to have the courage to rise in this House and to apologize to the South African Agricultural Union and to the hon. the Minister. To my mind he owes them an apology.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words about the wool industry. The first year of the new scheme will be drawing to a close next week. I am glad to be able to say that the wool industry has had a very successful season. There were price fluctuations. I want to analyse five of the most common types of wool. On the basis of clean wool, the price varied from 204 cents to 560 cents. In spite of this, I think we can say that we have had an exceptionally good season, actually the best season for the past ten years, and a considerable deferred payment&#x2014;I should say something in the region of between 50% and 60% of the advance payment, is awaiting our wool farmers. But now it is also true that this wool scheme has been criticized very severely. It is very gladdening to have the support of the Opposition in particular for this scheme. In recent times there has been much criticism from Natal especially, but I think that these people are unfortunately judging this scheme on a short-term basis. It is true that the people who sold at the highest level and who now have to make a contribution to people who sold on a low market, do perhaps have reason to be dissatisfied. But when we have regard to the long-term advantages of this scheme, they completely eliminate the short-term disadvantages. I want to elaborate on a few of these advantages. In earlier times, especially with a market such as we had this year, a tremendously speculative spirit used to prevail on our wool market. There were 30 000 wool farmers who had to decide when and how their wool was to be marketed. There were six or eight brokers who decided whether they were going to keep their wool or market it. In fact, chaos prevailed in the wool industry. Especially with a market such as we had this year, it could have happened that many farmers would have withdrawn their wool in the hope that the price would rise. But this year we had the position that there was only one authority in terms of this new scheme, one authority that decided how and when the wool was to be marketed. To my mind the greatest advantage of this, is that the price of the product is no longer linked to the time when the farmer shears or markets his wool. To my mind this is an exceptionally great advantage. In the past, as soon as there was any rise on the market, we all rushed to finish shearing, with the result that the market was flooded. Now the farmer has the satisfaction that it does not matter when he shears. For him there is a great deal of stability <span class="col_7743-7744" refersTo="page_0939"/>on the market. As a result of this tremendous rise on the market, the tremendous demand which was experienced, we could as yet not implement even one-tenth of the scheme. For instance, we want to process certain types of wool a little further. For instance, we want to have the locks washed. We are even thinking of processing wool to the top stage. But we were quite unable to do it during the past season, since there was a tremendous demand and we had to market the wool as soon as it had been delivered. We recall, for example, the tremendous success we had with lot building, where we sold 100 bales of wool or more as a unit, the contents of the bales being guaranteed and consequently achieving tremendous success. These are all possibilities which we want to carry into effect under this scheme, but have been unable to do up to this stage. I agree that we should effect an even greater degree of stability in prices. But this is not such an easy matter, because wool is an international product which has to compete on the international market. It is not such an easy matter to effect stability, particularly not on an open market such as ours. But I am convinced that we shall have the co-operation of Australia and New Zealand in the near future so as to effect stability, also with regard to international marketing. I have wondered whether the time has not arrived for us, especially this year, with our satisfactory market and with a future which does not look unpromising to increase the floor price of our wool drastically.</p>

<p>Then there is one other point which I should like to raise with regard to this scheme. Our greatest problem in implementing this scheme arose from the fact that the wool retained its identity throughout until the auction was over. In my humble opinion the wool should, after it had been valued, lose its identity altogether. Only then shall we be able to make a success of this scheme.</p>

<p>Then I should like to say a few words with regard to our wool ports. A great deal has been said about whether or not our wool ports should be closed. I should like us to consider two points in this regard. These are that we have selling ports as well as export ports. I agree that the time has arrived for an urgent investigation into this matter, in the interests of the wool industry, for I firmly believe that we can no longer afford to have four export ports. Because of the increase in freight charges and the high costs involved in loading goods at the ports, I am convinced that the Minister should take the bull by the horns and should order an investigation from high circles to help us to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Sir, if I still have time at my disposal, I should like to pay tribute to the co-operative societies which have been handling the marketing of wool over the years. I want to pay tribute to them for the fact that they initially instituted orderly marketing in this country. There are three co-operative societies in the country now which handle virtually 90% of the wool clip of our country. There is only one private broker, who is of necessity still rendering good service, but I want to pay tribute to these co-operative societies. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet, I must admit, ended his speech on a better note than the one on which he started. I can agree with much of what he said when he spoke about the wool industry, about which I think he must know something. But, Sir, when he spoke about my hon. friend from Albany and referred to the import of mutton, he aired his ignorance. He challenged my friend, who had made a statement that the price of mutton would remain the same to the housewife, and I want to ask him now whether it did not remain the same to the housewife. He need only answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;. [Interjections.] Sir, let him shake his head; let him wave that newspaper report around; let him do what he wishes; the fact remains that the price to the housewife did remain the same. I want to ask the Minister now what happened to the profit on the import of mutton. That is the question. That hon. member took my friend from Albany to task for making such a terrible statement. Now I ask the hon. the Minister: What happened to the profit&#x003F; Who got the profit&#x003F; That Government got the profit, Sir, just as they got the profit on the import of butter.

<p>Sir I want to come back to my friend from Wakkerstroom, before I deal with the hon. member for Smithfield. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom made certain allegations here this afternoon, which I want to ask him now to substantiate. He made the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7745-7746" refersTo="page_0940"/>Ek wil dit aan die agb.

<p>Mr. Chairman, these are the depths they sink to when they are really in trouble. This, I think, is some measure of the embarrassment they are suffering on that side of the House. Let me join with the hon. member for Smithfield in his plea to the Minister to do something for this ailing industry. It is an industry which is ailing, and an industry whose members, unfortunately, have been made political footballs by this Government. This is the case particularly with the dairy industry. The Government seems to have an idea that they can gain votes by keeping the prices of foodstuffs down at the expense of the farmer and particularly at the expense of the dairy farmer. Sir, I am glad to see that the hon. member for Newcastle is sulking and leaving the Chamber. Sir, this has happened particularly in Natal where, as I am sure the hon. the Minister is aware, in the last five years we have lost 121 out of a total of 603 registered fresh milk producers. Mr. Chairman, that is a terribly high figure for Natal alone, and one would think that this might be the tendency only in our province, but I find in the report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing that the same tendency is to be found in the rest of the Republic.</p>

He will find there, if he can do a little bit of arithmetic, that in the 1970-&#x2019;71 dairy year there was a total of 2 091 producers in the six controlled areas of the Republic. As you know, Sir, Natal is not a controlled area, and that is why I quoted Natal&#x2019;s figures separately. According to this report&#x2014;if what I say is a lie, then it is this report which is lying, not I&#x2014;there was a total of only 2 032 fresh milk producers in those six areas in 1971-&#x2019;72.

<p>Sir, I will not react to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. I just want to say that I think that it is past the time that we should try in this life to convince hon. members on the opposite side; we had better leave them on the other side of the grave so that they can try and fend for themselves.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to discuss the poultry industry and problems in my constituency and also in the rest of the country. In this debate it is necessary to look at the state of the poultry industry. It is an industry which experiences a variety of great problems these days. Sir, when legislation was passed last year to limit the number of laying-hens per unit to 10 000, it was just in time. I want to thank the hon. the Minister most heartily for that legislation. This has given our small poultry farmer an opportunity to come into the industry again. For this we thank the hon. the Minister very much.</p>

<p>Sir, these small poultry farmers also have to deal with the problem of increasing feed <span class="col_7749-7750" refersTo="page_0942"/>costs, of which we have heard a great deal here tonight, especially the increase in the cost of fish meal. Here we had an increase of more than 40%. This increase in the price of fish meal has dramatically changed and affected the production costs of table chickens&#x2014;and that is why chickens taste so much of fish meal. Sir, the fish meal producers boast about their bumper year the high prices they are getting abroad. They have now increased the price of fish meal for the local fodder industry from R116 to R150 per metric ton. Sir, I ask the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to have this situation watched. Price increases here influence the poultry industry detrimentally and in the end, as we know, the consumer must pay for these increasing costs. We ask that the Minister of Agriculture be given strong powers to combat and investigate cost increases&#x2014;please note, cost increases&#x2014;in the poultry industry as well.</p>

<p>Sir, the second matter is the problem experienced by the <i>bona fide</i> poultry farmer as a result of the smuggling into the country of breeding material from abroad. This causes Newcastle disease and other diseases to be brought into the country, and the <i>bona fide</i> poultry farmer must suffer. Our poultry producers are also asking the Minister&#x2019;s protection here by still stricter action against these smugglers. But furthermore we also ask that the department should let good breeding material in, that it should be kept in quarantine for a certain period and that a percentage of that breeding material should be made available to the average poultry farmer as well as to the farmers&#x2019; wives. In this way we will be encouraging a healthy development in the poultry industry instead of the monopolistic tendencies that are at present developing to the disadvantage of the farmer and the consumer. We want to thank the Minister very much. In the little time I have to my disposal I just want to repeat my appeal to the Minister to have a look at the poultry farmer so that we can again raise interest in this industry among our housewives who have a great need for and interest in poultry.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I have only five minutes to my disposal and, Sir, you will therefore understand that I cannot pause at the previous Opposition speakers, but should like to go on. I should like to exchange a few ideas on two groups of people who have meant, who still mean and who will in future mean more and more to agriculture and to South Africa. I refer to the White farmer and the Bantu labourer on his farm. It is a fact that a happy man is a good man, and therefore a happy labourer is also a good labourer. It is also true that we can say with conviction that the great majority of our Bantu labourers on the farms are happy and contented people. That is because the Bantu are a tradition-bound people and still have an opportunity of fully or nearly fully observing these traditions. Time does not allow me to elaborate on that.</p>

<p>Sir, we are now living in a time where we hear every day about demands for higher Bantu wages. Demands for higher Bantu wages are heard every day and unavoidably the echo of these demands will also be heard on our faraway farms. Now the position is, and I think it is necessary that this be brought to the people&#x2019;s attention, that our farmers, apart from the cash wages they are paying their labourers, are also paying the Bantu wages in kind. So we find, for example, that the farmer who gives his Bantu labourers three pints of milk per day, plus one slaughter-sheep every two months and one bag of meal per month, free housing, fuel and water, puts the cash value of those products at R32 per month. If he, as some farmers do, gives one slaughter-sheep per month, the cash value of that is R42, to which his cash wages should be added. I want to say with great conviction tonight that our farmers must realize that in this they have a means of competing with the employer in the cities and towns. They should concentrate on studying in detail this means they have of competing and on developing it further. Where they have an opportunity on their farms of giving their Bantu labourers free housing and better provisions, they should concentrate on making it more attractive for the Bantu labourers to come and work on the farms. It is not only cash that counts, and it is not only I who savs so. I quote an authoritative Bantu leader, who said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Chief Minister of KwaZulu, Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, is concerned about the increase of drunkenness among the Zulus. He said here in a Legislative Assembly yesterday that after the recent slight wage increases to Zulu workers, drunkenness had increased. He knew of a bottlestore in the Bantu township Clermont</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7751-7752" refersTo="page_0943"/>where after the wage increases sales to Bantu doubled.</block>

<p>In other words, the farmer finds himself in a position to remunerate his Bantu workers in cash and in kind and in a way which is constructive for the Bantu and which also suits the farmer. I think our farmers must take note of this, and develop it further.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to ask whether the White taxpayer in South Africa realizes&#x2014; and I want us to take note of this&#x2014;that the White farmer saves the State millions upon millions of rands annually by making housing available to their Bantu workers. There are 90 000 farmers in South Africa today, and if everyone of these farmers had only 11 Bantu labourers it would mean that collectively they have one million heads of families in their service and that they are making one million houses available to those Bantu. Can one imagine what this means by way of capital investment, however simple that housing might be&#x003F; Where local authorities and the State are making Bantu housing available in cities and towns which is to a large extent financed out of the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket, the farmer is making this tremendous contribution to South Africa. I think it is time for us to take note of this and to appreciate this.</p>

<p>We must also realize that the White farmer on his farm and the Bantu labourer have worked together in the course of many years, have come to know, respect and understand each other. In this way they have built up a sound White/Bantu relationship which is a blessing to the whole Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, once again I can agree with an hon. member on that side. The hon. member for Heidelberg spoke about farm labourers and I must say that I agree wholeheartedly with what he said. I do believe that there is a large proportion of our farming community which does treat their labourers in the way which the hon. member has described.</p>

<p>I am very glad to follow on the speech made by the hon. member for Stilfontein who spoke about the quarantine station and what this hon. Minister and his Government are now doing or are attempting to do for the poultry industry in this country. I want at the outset to pay tribute to the poultry industry in this country, because, particularly in this time of a shortage of red meat, of the scarcity of mutton, and when the price of beef has gone so high that it is beyond the reach of the pocket of the man in the street, we have this one industry which stands out like a shining light in this country and which is today producing a protein food which is cheaper than it was 20 years ago.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to hear the hon. member for Stilfontein say that is why he supports it, because then I can support him in the sentiments which he has expressed along those lines. This is an industry in which I took a part 20 years ago. This is why I say today, without fear of contradiction, that the housewife today is paying less for poultry than she paid 20 years ago. For that reason we must pay tribute to the broiler industry in this country. The same can be said for eggs, incidentally, because the price of eggs today is no higher than it was 15 years ago&#x2014;I am not prepared to say 20 years ago. From that point on, I am afraid I must separate from the hon. member for Stilfontein, because I cannot agree with him on what he has said about the quarantine station, the fact that chickens are now being imported legally and so on.</p>

<p>I want to speak to the hon. the Minister about the quarantine station that has been established at Kempton Park. I must start by quoting to him what was written to me by a veterinary surgeon in the Transvaal who visited the station&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is a disgrace to the veterinary profession in South Africa and something should be done about it.</block>

<p>It is not only from this one veterinary surgeon that I obtained the information which I have, but I believe that conditions at this station are just too shocking for words.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Are you referring to the station at Irene&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, to the one at Kempton Park. I believe that anybody who imports birds through that station is lucky if he gets 10% of what he brings in. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will not deny the fact that he recently had a major outbreak of Newcastle disease at that <span class="col_7753-7754" refersTo="page_0944"/>station. That is to be expected when you bring in birds under quarantine, but what shakes me is that I am given to understand that importers at the end of a 30-day quarantine period are allowed to collect their birds and to take them out even if they are still ill. This is a serious allegation that I am making but I believe that this is the position. I am afraid that I cannot comment on the new station at Irene because I have not been able to get information on it.</p>

<p>I would like to discuss with the Minister at some time the possibility of having a look at both of these stations. I believe that he is thinking of establishing a third station. I sincerely hope that he will, because as long as we are going to have a concentration of all birds imported to this country at one point&#x2014;now possibly two&#x2014;we are not going to overcome the problem of the diseases that we are experiencing. I believe that there are only two diseases which they are interested in at this station, the one being psittacosis and the other one being Newcastle disease. What about all the other diseases which are being brought in by these birds&#x003F; I believe that the control at that station is terrible. I want to say here and now that the complaints I have received have not been against the staff. I believe that the staff are doing as good a job as they are capable of doing. This is the case especially when one considers the fact that the trained staff which is there comprises only one veterinarian and two assistants. I do not know how they can be expected to do the work which is now to be done at this particular station. If that is the only staff there is&#x2014;and that is what I am led to believe&#x2014;I do not know how this can be done. If the lack of control exists which I am led to believe does exist and if staff and importers are allowed free access in and out of the various cages, I would say that control is sadly lacking. I must quote again what someone wrote to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The whole procedure is an absolute farce and a waste of the country&#x2019;s money.</block>

<p>It is put to me that, bearing in mind the way in which the place is run and the way in which the whole question of the importation and quarantine of all birds is conducted&#x2014;and I am not only referring to birds but to poultry as well&#x2014;unless a legitimate quarantine station is established and legitimate quarantine measures are applied, we can forget about allowing the importation of birds.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Quite right; there is no poultry, but I am now dealing with the broader spectrum and not only with the birds at Kempton Park. It is put to me that in practice what is happening is that a smuggler is importing a small quantity legally with a permit obtained from the hon. the Minister and his department, and that this is being used to cover up vast quantities which are being smuggled in, and that at the same time that we have this smuggling racket of bringing in the birds, there is also another smuggling racket of exporting South African birds, which must pay for the birds which are smuggled in. I believe that the hon. the Minister is aware of quite a lot of what I have said although I do not believe he is aware of everything I have said. I have a report here which I shall place before him at the first opportunity. I sincerely hope that in the interests of the poultry industry as a whole in South Africa and the wild bird industry in particular, he will investigate these matters in the same way as he is now investigating the illegal importation of poultry. I must thank him at this opportunity, which is the first I have for doing so, for the appointment of this commission for which I have pleaded. I sincerely hope that the work of that commission will only be to the benefit of the poultry industry in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the minute or two left to me, I want to come back to the dairy industry. I am sorry that the hon. member for Smithfield has left the Chamber because, as hon. members will know, in this case we have two hearts beating as one when it comes to the dairy industry. However, I have a problem which I must put to the hon. the Minister. He can perhaps give us the answer to that problem. This is a question which was raised from our side of the House. In the report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, page 48, under the heading &#x201C;Consumer Prices&#x201D; I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since the 13th January, 1964, when control of the retail prices for milk in the controlled area was lifted by the Price Controller, prices have been negotiated by the Board and distributors&#x2019; associations.</block>

<p><span class="col_7755-7756" refersTo="page_0945"/>In other words, there is no price control on the retail price of milk. But on the 24th April, in reply to a question put by the hon. member for South Coast, the hon. the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

But we have another conflict here, because on the 1st May, 1973, also in reply to a question put by my friend, the hon. member for South Coast, the hon. the Minister replied that the producer&#x2019;s and reseller&#x2019;s prices for fresh milk sold in the Witwatersrand, Pretoria, Western Transvaal, Cape Peninsula and Bloemfontein are fixed by the Milk Board with the approval of the Minister of Agriculture. He went further and said that the maximum consumer&#x2019;s prices of fresh milk sold in Port Elizabeth &#x201C;are fixed by the Price Controller in consultation with the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing&#x201D;.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, permit me first of all to convey my hearty congratulations to our new Minister of Agriculture. We know that he is a man of exceptional competence and abilities, and it is our wish and prayer that he will be of service to the agricultural industry for many years to come. We may say that all our expectations, all our hopes, are centred in him. In the same breath I want to say here that when we think of the 25 years of National Party r&#x00E9;gime, one can but say that 25 years ago the South African farmer had one of the greatest strokes of good luck, experienced one of the greatest blessings, which could possibly have come his way, namely when the National Party took over the reins of government from the United Party. Mention was made here of the previous leader of the Opposition, Koos Strauss, and all the things he had done for the agricultural industry. Mention was also made of the positive legislation on agriculture that had been piloted through under a United Party Government. However, I find this strange when I think of what happened to that Minister of Agriculture. He became their leader and subsequently the same thing happened to him as did recently to the hon. member for Yeoville. I should like to put a question to the hon. member for Newton Park here tonight. The hon. member for Newton Park said he wanted to have a blueprint in respect of the Government&#x2019;s agricultural policy, and that his party had a blueprint. Now, if one looks at this goat-fodder pamphlet which they paraded so in 1970, we see that the United Party said there that it would guarantee the farmer a price for his produce, after provision had been made for a reasonable profit over and above production costs. The hon. member went on to say that his party, when they should come into power, would announce, in advance, a price for the various agricultural products. Now I want to put this question to the hon. member for Newton Park, and he is a responsible shadow Minister&#x2014;although he is not much of a shadow and I would rather describe him as a &#x201C;spectre&#x201D;&#x2014;will most certainly be able to furnish me with a good reply. If they should announce the maize price and we should reap 100 million or 120 million bags in that particular year, who would pay for the losses on exports&#x003F;</p>

<p>In other words, I may not assume that the hon. member does not agree with the hon. member for Parktown. The hon. member for Parktown says taxes are too high, whereas the hon. member for Newton Park concedes that they would announce the prices of farmers&#x2019; products beforehand and would guarantee these prices by using money from the Revenue Account.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to another matter. In this election manifesto the United Party also said in respect of other agricultural products that they would guarantee the producer a price in respect of production costs plus a reasonable profit. Now I should like to ask the hon. member for Newton Park, <span class="col_7757-7758" refersTo="page_0946"/>because I take a great interest in that solution and because we do have that problem, what he would do, for instance, in respect of perishable agricultural products. I am thinking of a product such as tomatoes.</p>

I should like to know from the hon. member for Newton Park how they are going to get past this election promise of theirs. They have no option but to accept that they stand for this. What is he going to do in regard to the tomato farmer&#x2014;I have many tomato farmers in my constituency&#x003F; How are you going to guarantee him a profit&#x003F; And then, believe it or not, you say that you are going to announce it beforehand!

<p>Well, tell me then how you are going to do it; I should like to know that. I also want to know where he is going to get the funds for doing so.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to a third point. When I started, I said that the greatest stroke of luck which the farmer could possibly have had here was that the National Party came into power. When we were discussing the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote and there was uncertainty about the maize price, when everybody was speculating about the maize price, the hon. member for Newton Park, too, spoke here about agriculture and agricultural prices while the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote was under discussion.</p>

<p>I was not even present here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, let us make it another Vote then. But you did make a speech and it stands recorded in Hansard that I asked you five times what you suggested should be a maize price and when you were going to plead for it. The shadow Minister did not say a word about the maize price. He did not put forward any plea whatever for the farmers as far as the maize price was concerned, because they are afraid. They are afraid that when they ask for a better price for the farmers, this may boomerang on them when a by-election is in progress.</p>

<p>Tonight I want to concentrate briefly on the question of producers&#x2019; prices. When a producer&#x2019;s price is increased, one often hears the criticism that the consumer has to pay for it, and then the impression is often created that sometimes this increase in producers&#x2019; prices is unnecessary and that the consumer unnecessarily has to pay for it. In such cases these critics assume that there will always be sufficient food available in South Africa, irrespective of the price obtained by the farmer. We are making a big mistake if we reason or argue in this manner. In surveying the agricultural industry as a whole, we can only say that we in South Africa are in a very fortunate position because we are one of the few countries in Africa which has surplus food. This surplus food which we have is a very great asset to the farmer and to the country as a whole. It places us in a position where we do not have to import food. If we think of a country such as the United Kingdom or Japan, which has to import most of its food and has to use scarce foreign exchange for that purpose, one realizes that the agriculturist, the farmer, is rendering a major service to South Africa in that he is producing sufficient food for the country and so makes it unnecessary for South <span class="col_7759-7760" refersTo="page_0947"/>Africa to have to import food. What is more, the agricultural industry is a net earner of foreign exchange for South Africa. In reviewing the figures for 1971, which are the latest official figures I could obtain, one sees that in that year imports of agricultural products amounted to R48 million and exports to R453 million, which leaves a surplus of R405 million in foreign exchange, earned by the agricultural industry for South Africa. But this happy situation, the fact that we do not really have to import food and the fact that the agricultural industry is an earner of foreign exchange, cannot continue indefinitely if we do not adjust prices. Unfortunately, we are also faced with considerable increases in production costs in the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>We see that over the ten year period from 1960-&#x2019;61 to 1971-&#x2019;72 the combined index for all farming requirements rose by 35%. This is, therefore, the increase in interest, wages, and so forth. That is why it is necessary for us to adjust producers&#x2019; prices from time to time. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am in complete agreement with the hon. member for Lydenburg that when the hon. member for Newton Park talks about his policy, he says monstrous things. I, too, have a small question I should like to ask him. But before I come to that, I first want to give him a little information. He and his cohorts on the opposite side have said a great deal about rising food prices. That is true; the food prices have risen, but we should compare these with the increase in food prices in other countries of the world so as to be able to view the position in South Africa in its true perspective. Now I have here the Bulletin of Labour Statistics of the International Labour Office. In this, consumer price increases in food in all countries of the world are indicated on an index basis. They took 1963 as the base year, in which the prices were equated to 100. Then the bulletin gives the index figure for all the countries of the world in September, 1972. If we take 1963 as the base year, the price of food in South Africa rose to 148,5 in September, 1972. In Nigeria food prices rose to 187,2; In Za&#x00EF;re to 507,8; in the Argentine to 910,9; in Hong Kong to 169; in India to 223; in Israel to 156; in Japan to 169; in Denmark to 182; in France to 148,6; in the United Kingdom to 164 and in New Zealand to 156. In other words, the increase which has taken place in South Africa is less than in any of the countries I have mentioned, which are spread across the whole world.</p>

<p>Then there is another very important figure I want to mention, namely the increase in producer prices, wholesale prices and consumer prices in South Africa. In the Short Survey of Agricultural Statistics the period from 1958-&#x2019;59 to 1960-&#x2019;61 is taken as the base and the average prices in those years are equated to 100. On that basis, the producer prices rose to 131,5 up to 1971-&#x2019;72. The wholesale prices rose to 135,2 and the consumer prices to 142. In other words, in comparison with other countries the rise in food prices which occured in South Africa, was not exorbitant. In fact it compares favourably with the increases in other countries, and what is more, of all the sectors that have to do with food, the farmer has been the least responsible for the increase in the prices of food.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Newton Park told us about his policy and said that consumer prices must be stabilized, in other words consumer prices in South Africa may never rise again in the future. Is that correct&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member says that prices must be stabilized and that he is opposed to the latest increase in the price of bread. Sir, in South Africa the price of bread has increased six times since 1953, and each time the U.P. has been opposed to that increase in the price of bread. Is that true or is not true&#x003F; I ask the hon. member for Newton Park to give me one example where he and his party have said that they agree with the increase in the price of bread. [Interjection.] Let us leave all the other matters, then, and talk only about bread. Do hon. members on that side want an increase in the price of bread in future, or not&#x003F; They must tell me today when they want the price of bread to increase.

<p>Of course.

In other words, the consumer no longer decides how much bread he should buy and what he should pay; he should merely decide how much bread he wants to eat. Sir, what the hon. member wants is that the Government should take back the earnings of the consumer in the form of taxation; the farmer must be paid by the Government; the farmer, the trader and the consumer must all work for the Government.

We are in favour of the consumer also making his contribution, just as the producer has to <span class="col_7763-7764" refersTo="page_0949"/>make his contribution, because what we are not in favour of is that we the producers, and the consumers and the workers and the traders should all be sold out to the Government so that we should become a socialist state and that is what the party on that side is seeking to achieve.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply first to some of the statements made by Government members. The hon. member for Marico spoke about the allocation of State-owned land. I should like to give the hon. member some information. In his constituency &#x201C;Bantu land&#x201D; will be made available to Whites. The intention is to allocate that land in different ways, after we have allowed it to rest and it has recovered. The most important aspect in this regard is that we do not want to offer it for sale by auction so that a wealthy person may be enabled to acquire the land. Suppose that an economic unit in that area consists of 1 000 hectares and we have a farm consisting of 10 000 hectares. We would then divide those 10 000 hectares into 10 economic units. Then we would advertise those units, and this does not mean that only people from the constituency of Marico would be taken into consideration in this regard, for there are many constituencies in which State-owned land will never become available.</p>

<p>We would of course, as is our wont, determine first whether it would be possible for us to add parts of that land to the land of farmers in that district who do not have economic units at the moment. The screening would take place after we have advertised the farm at its agricultural value. If we were to advertise the land at its present market value, it would mean that the person who acquires such a farm would be handicapped by a heavy burden of debt right from the beginning.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wolmaransstad spoke about encouraging farmers to enter into the service of the Department of Agriculture. I want to thank the hon. member for the thoughts he expressed in that regard. It is not possible for everybody to be settled in the agricultural industry, but there are great opportunities in the department, and in this regard I am thinking of some of the projects which we are developing specifically as a result of the meat shortage. We have at the moment a beef cattle performance and progeny testing scheme, for which 800 herds have been entered. Furthermore we have a milk recording scheme, for which 893 herds have been entered and 33 900 cows are being tested every month. We need people to do the work for us which is involved in these projects. We have a mutton-sheep performance and progeny testing scheme, in which several farmers are taking part. We have a performance testing of woolled sheep, under which 12 000 wool samples are being analysed at present. We have a boar performance testing scheme with facilities at Elsenburg, Irene and Cedara. At the moment 280 farmers have been entered and we envisage that this scheme will yet be <span class="col_7767-7768" refersTo="page_0951"/>extended a great deal. We also have a pig recording and health progeny testing scheme. Then we also have an egg-laying and broiler test scheme, in which 800 farmers are taking part already. This kind of development is essential for the provision of sufficient food, and for that reason I am pleased that the hon. member for Wolmaransstad mentioned this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana made very interesting figures available to us. He referred to the training of non-Whites as tractor-drivers, for they are the persons who are handling many of our expensive agricultural implements. Attention is already being given to this matter by these bodies which have so pointedly been placed in the limelight today, namely the co-operatives. A co-operative such as VETSAK has a training scheme for Bantu tractor drivers, whereas some of the co-operatives are availing themselves of the facilities created by the Total Oil company. The hon. member is quite correct in saying that the Bantu must be trained to drain a tractor&#x2019;s oil, to clean its air filter and to service it. It is important that they receive this kind of basic instruction. Once I visited a farm during the planting season. It was raining and the farmer had to start planting that morning. However, he did not have enough tractor drivers. But then he saw a Bantu standing there and he asked him, &#x201C;Can you drive a tractor&#x003F;&#x201D; The Bantu&#x2019;s reply was, &#x201C;No, master.&#x201D; Then he said to the Bantu, &#x201C;Get on, let go of the clutch and drive! &#x201D; That type of farmer allows his own machinery and implements to be ruined. That is not the way to work with an expensive implement. For that reason we must give more attention to this matter, and this is in fact being done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru said that things were going well for the farmers of South-West Africa. I do not begrudge those farmers the favourable circumstances they are enjoying at the moment, because for several years they experienced very hard times. The hon. member also referred to the system of auction on the hoof, which could provide the feeders with an opportunity to hold back certain animals in order to improve their condition. As it is, the present system of selling at auctions lends itself to that, and the meat farmers do not want to do away with the system of auction on the hook as implemented by the Meat Board at the moment. The hon. member referred to the revision of the grading system, and he specifically referred to unnecessary fat on the carcasses. In laying down the present floor price, we specifically took the age into account in determining super and prime grades. Grade X and grade Y carcasses are determined on the basis of age, whereas we have raised the minimum weight from 160 kg to 180 kg. Of course, this depends on whether it is a two-tooth animal, whether it is a full-mouthed animal, and so forth. The aim is to get cattle ready for the market as soon as possible within that period so that more meat may be produced. However, we may from time to time look at the grading regulations again.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield referred to the contribution made by the dairy farmers, and I admit that this is definitely a trying undertaking, for the dairy farmer works seven days a week. The hon. member referred to the cost increase in concentrates. He mentioned that there had been a 60% increase in the cost of fish-meal and that there had been a cost increase of 30% in the case of oil-cake. Seen as a whole, these two kinds represent but a small percentage of the concentrate. For the most part concentrate still consists of maize and milled lucerne. There is a R9,2 million subsidy on the price of maize, apart from the R23 million being paid in respect of handling and storage compensation. By these means the Government has tried to give the producer a 22% increase, whereas the consumer is only paying 11,5% more for white maize and 15% more for yellow maize. It was therefore an entirely wrong statement that was made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, or was it the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town&#x003F;, namely that the price of concentrates had risen such a great deal. That is not the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet set out the wool scheme. I should like to tell the wool farmers that they should not be unpleasant about the wool scheme. They should give it a chance for a year. In fact, so many of our deciduous fruit varieties, our citrus products, our apples, our peaches and our pears lose their identity to such an extent when they are pooled that one no longer knows whether it is one&#x2019;s own specific carton which is being sold. This is the case because these cartons go into the pool, but unfortunately this scheme is such that the wool farmer is still aware that it is his own wool which is being sold in that specific period. Once the scheme has had a chance to catch on, I think farmers will <span class="col_7769-7770" refersTo="page_0952"/>understand this scheme much better and accept it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stilfontein took up the cudgels for the poultry farmer. He, too, referred to the increase in the costs of concentrates, and so forth. What I said a moment ago also holds good for the subsidies on maize in the case of concentrates for poultry. As far as the smugglers are concerned, I may tell the hon. member that good breeding material may in fact be brought in by certain private importers. Because there have been specific developments in America, especially as far as the breeding of broilers is concerned, we gave permission, after consultation with the Poultry Association, for a quarantine station to be built at Irene. It is now possible for a person to import breeding material without having to smuggle it in. At the moment there are financially strong consortiums which have permission to import, but our condition is that 15% of that material, after it has been tested and it has been determined that it does not carry any diseases, must be made available to the smaller farmer, especially those in the Stilfontein and Potchefstroom vicinity, so that with these new mother lines they may also have the opportunity to compete with the other producers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heidelberg spoke about the fringe benefits received by the non-White worker, and pointed out that in some cases these were worth up to R40 per month. I am glad that he mentioned this and also referred to the relationship which existed between the Bantu worker on the farm and the owner of the farm, their attitude towards each other. The hon. member forgot to mention a few things. Virtually any farmers will, when a Bantu worker comes to him at 10 o&#x2019;clock or 12 o&#x2019;clock in the night in order to tell him that a member of his family is sick, take that person to the doctor. Services of this nature are being rendered all the time, and one cannot calculate them in terms of money. Many of these Bantu do not refer to the master&#x2019;s farm but to &#x201C;our&#x201D; farm. This is the relationship which we should like to see between employees and employers on our farms.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lydenburg wanted to know how one cold guarantee a person a price, and I simply cannot understand that the hon. member for Newton Park fails to see the point here. Let us take, for example, the case of potatoes. There was a time when the market was overstocked with potatoes and one did not know where to market this product. Countries abroad did not want any potatoes, and we had a surplus on the Johannesburg market of 23 000 pockets on one day. One cannot give a farmer a guaranteed price and tell him that he may go ahead and produce and that we shall guarantee his price. There are some products in respect of which this simply cannot be done. It seems to me as though the U.P. members do not know how the &#x201C;mechanics&#x201D; of this whole matter works. The hon. member for Lydenburg quite rightly pointed out to him the problems which are involved when one talks about a stable price and about a subsidy. Surely one may not cause the consumer to labour under the delusion that the price of bread will never be increased, even if the subsidy were to amount to R150 million. There are people who treat bread with contempt because it is so cheap. Salary adjustments are taking place, and the consumer must therefore be prepared to pay a little extra, otherwise this would simply lead to extra taxes, and we do not want to increase taxes.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the speeches made by Opposition members. The hon. member for East London City spoke about co-operative production amongst farmers. This is a voluntary matter. The hon. member for South Coast approached me in regard to a loan for the Umzumbe Sugar Planters Co-op., where bulldozers had been bought jointly by 24 farmers. They obtained a loan of R60 000 from the Land Bank. It is quite a voluntary matter when farmers want to co-operate in regard to purchasing of farm implements, and so forth. This is quite in order; we encourage it, but we cannot make it compulsory.</p>

I want to explain to him that the decrease is because of the better export prices and a better crop, because we export only the top quality products. The inferior quality is sold locally. Over a period of 10 years the sale of South African citrus products in England increased by seven million pockets. Another thing the hon. member must remember is that more and more citrus fruit is being sent to juice manufacturing companies also to be marketed overseas.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F; Are you satisfied with the system of marketing in the Bantu areas, because the Citrus Exchange is highly dissatisfied, as you probably know&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not satisfied. I am also not satisfied in regard to the distribution of milk. We have made arrangements with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration to have these products freely distributed. I think that in future, with the techniques and methods the Citrus Board is working on, we will approach the Minister of Bantu Administration again to institute a better distribution of fruit in the Bantu areas, [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I have not got much time left and I still have to reply to several other hon. members. The hon. member for Zululand asked for a research station in his constituency. We have a research station on the Makatini Flats. Perhaps the hon. member has been to the research station we have there. That research station is now going to KwaZulu. We will investigate this matter. At the moment we have extension officers in Vryheid, Dundee, Eshowe, and Pongola. In Pongola research work is being done in connection with sugar. However, as the hon. member specifically mentioned, the lowveld area under various conditions are not the same as those at Cedara, and we will pay attention to this. I will reply to the hon. member later as to whether we can shift the research station from the Makatini Flats to another place in his constituency. He will understand, of course, that we cannot place one at Nongoma, Hlabisa or Umfolozi; that would be impossible, but we will look into this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District asked who received the profit on the import of mutton. It is a very small profit, but in the Budget we made provision for the losses which might occur. The Government was prepared to bear the losses, but the farmers of South Africa receive the small profit that is made. It is not the Government&#x2019;s money.</p>

<p>Yes, like with butter. They are paying the losses there. I will give the hon. member the figures later. The hon. member said we are keeping the prices of foodstuffs down at the cost of the farmers. That is what he said.</p>

<p>He must remember to tell this to the people in the cities. Tell them that we are keeping the prices of the foodstuffs down to penalize the farmers. Is that what you said&#x003F; He said we lost 121 dairy farmers in Natal. It is not only the problem of profits but also the availability of Native labour that have to be taken into account. The dairy farmer must work seven days a week. With the high prices of beef, those farmers switched over. I may add that we have a surplus in all those areas. In Natal we have surpluses of milk at the moment. We increased the price by only 18%, whereas we increased the floor <span class="col_7773-7774" refersTo="page_0954"/>price of beef by 36%. They felt it is more profitable to switch over to beef production. Is there anything wrong with that&#x003F; Yet we still have surpluses of milk!</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to quarantine facilities. We spent R1 million on quarantine facilities at Kempton Park to which I paid a visit in November. I make bold to say that the facilities there are the most modern in the world. Overseas visitors have said they are proud to see what we are doing at Kempton Park. We are arranging a visit for the farmer groups on both sides of the House and I think the hon. member will be ashamed of his words that what is happening at the quarantine station at Kempton Park is a &#x201C;disgrace&#x201D;. The only animals we keep in quarantine there are parrots and other pets, such as dogs, etc. R1 million was spent on this station.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, let me rather get at the hon. member in my Afrikaans. If the hon. member would take a look at the quarantine facilities that have been created at Irene, where only poultry comes in under quarantine, he would see why these are facilities of which we are proud. Now the hon. member comes along and says that this is the breeding place of Newcastle disease. There was an outbreak of Newcastle disease at Kempton Park as a very result of testings for Newcastle disease, and all diseases are tested at this institute.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to price control. The milk price is being controlled, he said, by the Department of Commerce and Industry, but in the Witwatersrand areas, Pretoria, Klerksdorp, Krugersdorp and other West Transvaal areas as well as the Cape Peninsula, the Milk Board operates on a basis of full control. However, in Pietermaritzburg, Durban and Port Elizabeth the Milk Board does not operate in a similar manner. There the Minister of Economic Affairs exercises the control. However, my Department is keeping itself informed on the price of milk. Since the last announcement of the new price, we have made it known in the Press and told the distributor to display the price on his till. Hon. members have seen this in the caf&#x00E9;s. From time to time we announce the maximum price of milk, but there has been some exploitation; however, at the moment everybody is satisfied with the method by which we are controlling the price of milk.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. Let me just tell the hon. member that between June and October, 1972, the Government made a contribution on a 50-50 basis in respect of the butter export losses&#x2014;an estimated amount of R400 000. The Dairy Board also contributes R400 000. The subsidy to the consumer of butter in respect of this year, up to the end of September, comes to an amount of R10,9 million. This is what the Government contributes in order to subsidize the price of butter. The price of butter has dropped from 54c per 500 grammes, with the special system of promotion we had at the end of November, to 44c per 500 grammes. This represents an additional contribution which was made by the Government and the dairy farmers from their funds because the sale of butter had dropped by 40% after the arrival of yellow margarine. It seems as though it must be accepted by us as a permanent situation that butter will have to give up 40% of its market to margarine. The price adjustments made this year were deliberately aimed, because we have a shortage of powdered milk and cheese, at widening the gap by increasing considerably the price of industrial milk but raising the price of butter only by 6c per 100 kg of butter-fat. This was done for the specific purpose of providing an incentive for the production of industrial milk.</p>

<p>Sir, it seems to me that I am not going to finish. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s <span class="col_7775-7776" refersTo="page_0955"/>Town said that the price of cattle mash had risen by 60%. That is nonsense; that is utter nonsense.</p>

<p>The hon. member talks so freely about the burden of debt of the farmers. He said the farmers had no debt in 1948. That is simply not true. I think the hon. member for Christiana said we had 200 000 tractors in the country. Last year alone we imported tractors to the value of R25 million. We bought agricultural implements to the value R23 million. All of these are assets that were acquired in one year&#x2019;s time. I am not even talking about the sprinkler apparatus and other installations acquired by the farmers. The assets of the farmers are increasing far more rapidly than is their total burden of debt. A great deal of the debt incurred by the farmers has been in connection with land, which is still appreciating. As a result of our agricultural policy and price adjustments this year the position is unfortunately that land prices are going to rise. It is a pity that this is the case. I am not saying that all is well with the farmers of our country&#x2014;one cannot expect to remedy everything in next to no time &#x2014;but I do say that the Government is trying to lend a sympathetic ear to the problems of the farmers and to see to the bottlenecks which are developing along the way. We are not stagnant; we shall always be faced with problems and try to solve them. We are not going to lie down.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister whether he is going to do anything about the biggest bottleneck, the railway rates&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the determination of the price of agricultural products this year, which was adjusted generally after the increase in railway rates, we took into consideration every time the higher costs of the farmer to be able to transport his product. This is being incorporated in the determination of the price. In any upward adjustment on the road ahead, it will be the duty of the Ministry of Agriculture to take this factor into account in the determination of the farmer&#x2019;s price. If they have that assurance, I know that the farmers are happy, but this is not the case when one gives them those goat-fodder pamphlet assurances and guarantees them all sorts of things. These are things which one only delivers oneself of when one is sitting in the Opposition. But if one is in the &#x201C;game&#x201D; and one has to implement a policy, one exercises caution, and then one knows that from time to time one &#x2026;</p>
