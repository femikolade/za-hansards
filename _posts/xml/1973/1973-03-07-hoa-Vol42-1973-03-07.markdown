<heading>REVIEW OF FINANCIAL YEAR 1972-&#x2019;73</heading>

<p>Whilst it was in the interests of the country that excessive demand arising from consumption expenditure should be curbed, the cooling-off phase in the South African economy has been more drastic and protracted than could be expected, and for the second year in succession the overall economic growth rate has fallen short of the target set by the Economic Development Programme.</p>

<p>The improvement in the national economy during 1972 was largely confined to the financial markets and the primary sectors, whilst in the secondary sector business conditions remained slack, despite the reduction of official interest rates, the abolition of the ceilings on bank credit, the relaxation of hire-purchase credit restrictions and the reduction of sales duties on certain goods.</p>

<p>The sluggish state of the economy generally was reflected in the results of working of the Railways throughout the year, and by the end of December total revenues from all services showed an increase of less than R21 million on the corresponding period of the previous financial year, in comparison with a very restrained increase of R48 million in expenditure. With reserves depleted by the deficits of the past two and the current financial years, and faced with an arbitration award entailing a considerable increase in the wage bill, the Railways could no longer afford to carry the burden of uneconomic rates and fares, and tariffs were increased with effect from 1st January, 1973.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#prospects_for_1973-&#x2019;74">

<heading>PROSPECTS FOR 1973-&#x2019;74</heading>

<p>The Reserve Bank reported recently that a number of expansionary factors which could assist in reviving the general economy during 1973 were already at work. These included higher export earnings, easier conditions in the capital and money markets, the stimulation of domestic demand through capital outlays by the public and mining sectors and through salary and wage increases in the public sector, and the expansionary fiscal and monetary concessions designed to encourage economic growth without aggravating inflation.</p>

<p>A time-lag between the initiation of these measures and an actual upturn in production and consumer spending is inevitable, but there have since been setbacks which must affect the growth rate of the economy, the most important being the devastating drought.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that the volume of agricultural production will fall by as much as 10% during 1973, and apart from the detrimental effects on the national economy as a whole, which will in time permeate to the Railways, the Administration will suffer a direct loss of railage on export maize which is estimated to yield R11 million less revenue than in 1972-&#x2019;73. In addition, harbour revenue, grain elevator earnings and railage on fertilizers, fuel oil and other farming requisites will be adversely affected.</p>

<p>A further possibility in 1973 is that recent political events in Southern Africa may influence the volume of exports.</p>

<p>The Administration&#x2019;s revenues as at present constituted do little more than cover expenditure, and it is not expected that they will show a marked improvement before the economic upswing is more evident, probably later in the year.</p>

<debateSection name="#current_year&#x2019;s_performance_in_retrospect">

<heading>CURRENT YEAR&#x2019;S PERFORMANCE IN RETROSPECT</heading>

<p><i>Passenger Services:</i></p>

<p>The upward trend in the total number of passenger journeys featured in previous years was again evident in the year under review, and during the period April to December. 1972, an increase of more than 5,6 million was recorded as compared with <span class="col_2095-2096" refersTo="page_1061"/>the same period of the previous year. Suburban journeys increased by 1,2% in the first class and by 1,3% in the third class. Third-class main-line journeys showed an increase of 4,8%, whilst first and second-class journeys declined by 13,3 and 14,6%, respectively.</p>

<p>Since early 1972 various aspects of all passenger train services, including the curtailment or withdrawal of uneconomic services, are being critically examined. Certain trains have already been withdrawn and more are likely to be withdrawn during the year.</p>

<p>Revenue for the year is expected to total R 105,8 million, i.e. an increase of only 5,5% over the figure for 1971 -&#x2019;72, despite the higher passenger fares in operation since the beginning of January, 1973.</p>

<p><i>Goods Services:</i></p>

<p>Although the volume of high-rated traffic decreased by 2,7% from 13,7 million tons to 13,3 million tons during the period April to December, 1973, as compared with the corresponding period during the previous year, the overall tonnage of revenue-earning traffic conveyed increased by 4,7% from 78,8 million to 82,5 million.</p>

<p>The number of head of large livestock conveyed increased from 1,8 million to 2 million, but small animals declined from 7 million to 5 million.</p>

<p>The volume of coal and coke conveyed advanced slightly to 17,8 million tons in 1972. As a result of timeous steps taken, no inland coal shortages were experienced during the past winter season.</p>

<p>Although adequate truckage was made available throughout the year, conditions in the ore export market were such that full use was not made of the capacity provided and the tonnages of manganese, chrome, iron and magnetite ores conveyed for export declined by 0,8, 14,8, 17,2 and 23,2%, respectively. Export asbestos traffic, however, increased to 268 000 tons in 1972.</p>

<p>Cement traffic showed a satisfactory increase of 13,8% during the first nine months of this financial year over that for the corresponding period of the previous year.</p>

<p>Maize conveyed for local consumption decreased slightly by approximately 25 000 tons in 1972, but export maize advanced by 96,2% to almost 2,6 million tons.</p>

<p>Due to the higher tariffs, goods revenue is now estimated at R541,l million, or R21,8 million more than the budgeted figure, and coal earnings at R61,8 million&#x2014;an increase of R2,3 million on the original estimate.</p>

<p><i>Road Transport:</i></p>

<p>During the period April to December, 1972, there was a decline of 21,1% in the number of first-class passengers patronizing the Department&#x2019;s Road Transport Services, whilst third-class passengers increased from 9,1 million to nearly 9,8 million, or by 8,2% during the same period. The total number of passengers carried advanced to 10,6 million.</p>

<p>Goods traffic advanced by 9,5%, from 2,5 million tons to 2,7 million tons whilst the number of livestock carried declined by nearly 106 000. Cream traffic declined from 5,3 million to 5 million litres.</p>

<p>As a result of the tariff increases, the loss on the Road Transport Services is estimated at less than half a million Rand, compared with R1,3 million in 1971-&#x2019;72.</p>

<p><i>Harbours:</i></p>

<p>The considerable increases in the tonnages of cargo handled during the previous two financial years were not maintained during the first nine months of 1972-&#x2019;73. During the period April to December, 1972, 38.4 million tons of cargo were landed and shipped, reflecting a decrease of 1%. Cargo shipped reflected a satisfactory increase of 11,8%, but the tonnage landed declined by 10.2%.</p>

<p>Despite higher prices of imports as a result of devaluation, the value of imports during the period April to December, 1972, amounting to R2 120.4 million, was R26,8 million less than that of the corresponding period of the previous year, whilst the value of exports increased by 28,8% to R1 574 million.</p>

<p>Tariff adjustments were also effected in respect of the various harbour services and harbour revenue for the year 1972-&#x2019;73 is now estimated at just short of R62 million, an improvement of R2 million on the figure for 1971-&#x2019;72.</p>

<p><i>Airways:</i></p>

<p>With the delivery of the last of the five Boeing 747 aircraft order by South African Airways, the introduction of a revised pattern of services on the route to the United <span class="col_2097-2098" refersTo="page_1062"/>Kingdom and Europe constituted the highlight for the airline during the year under review. These aircraft have proved particularly successful from a traffic point of view and passenger carryings between the Republic and the United Kingdom and Germany increased markedly compared with the previous year, despite direct competition with other Boeing 747 operators in a depressed market. Furthermore, the cargo-carrying capacity of the 747, which, on account of import control, could not be fully exploited up till now, should provide good potential for revenue growth in the future.</p>

<p>Although revenue growth was not up to expectations during the first five months of the current financial year, there has been a noticeable improvement since September, 1972. Cargo carryings, which were adversely affected by the relative decrease, mainly as a result of import restrictions, have improved since October, 1972, and now reflect a higher growth rate for the first nine months of the financial year as compared with the same period the previous year.</p>

<p>In view of South African Airways&#x2019; world-wide operations the devaluation of the Rand caused a sharp rise in the airline&#x2019;s costs, already aggravated by increased charges for airport and en route facilities, fuel and passenger meals, etc.</p>

<p>On the Springbok services passenger journeys increased by 26,2% and cargo ton-kilometres by 33,5%. These encouraging results, which are far above the overall market growth rate, are due to the operation of Boeing 747 aircraft.</p>

<p>The favourable growth rate on the Wallaby route was maintained and passenger traffic increased by 25,1%, whilst cargo ton-kilometres rose by 24,5%.</p>

<p>A second weekly frequency introduced between Johannesburg and Rio de Janeiro from 1st April, 1972, resulted in passenger traffic on this route increasing by 35.3%.</p>

<p>On all overseas routes passengers carried increased by almost 62 000, or 26.3%. Freight tons increased by 44%.</p>

<p>BOAC introduced a weekly service between Johannesburg and Hong Kong on a &#x201C;Joint Venture&#x201D; basis with SAA on 6th January, 1973. The present frequency is operated by BOAC aircraft, but SAa will also introduce a weekly Boeing 707 frequency as soon as certain formalities have been concluded.</p>

<p>A service between Cape Town and Buenos Aires is expected to be introduced on 2nd April this year.</p>

<p>On the domestic services passenger traffic increased by 11,4% to 1,1 million journeys and cargo ton-kilometres by 17,5% to 12,5 million.</p>

<p>Passenger traffic on the regional services showed an increase of 25,8% whilst freight ton-kilometres advanced by 37,9%.</p>

<p>From December, 1972, special night flights were introduced on a trial basis between Johannesburg and Cape Town. The extension of such facilities to other routes to ease the pressure on long-distance rail services during peak periods will be considered.</p>

<p>The revised estimate of Airways revenue, viz. R137.2 million, falls short of the budgeted figure by a quarter of a million Rand.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines:</i></p>

<p>The quantity of products conveyed through the pipelines decreased by 9,2%, from 5,8 million to 5,3 million tons during the first nine months of the current financial year, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year.</p>

<p>Despite the application of higher tariffs during the last three months of the year, pipeline revenue, at R55,1 million, is only R1,4 million higher than the original estimate, due principally to a shortfall in traffic through the crude-petroleum pipeline.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#results_of_working_for_1972-&#x2019;73">

<heading>RESULTS OF WORKING FOR 1972-&#x2019;73</heading>

<p>In total, revenue from all services is estimated at R1 141 947 000.</p>

<p>As the revised Estimates of Expenditure approved by Parliament total R1 187 044 000, the year is expected to close with a deficit of R45 097 000, which it is the intention to defray, <i>in to,</i> from the Rates Equalization Fund and the Reserve Account of the Sinking Fund.</p>

<p><i>Productivity and Efficiency Measures:</i></p>

<p>In view of the deterioration in the Department&#x2019;s financial position, the depletion of reserves, diminishing profitable traffic and excessively rising costs of labour, equipment, material and services&#x2014;over many of which, such as electricity, coal and fuel the Department has no control&#x2014;special steps had to be taken to reduce expenditure wherever possible. The sustained <span class="col_2099-2100" refersTo="page_1063"/>efforts over the past years to increase productivity were, therefore, intensified and a campaign was launched early last year to increase economy, productivity and efficiency in all fields of activity. An in-depth examination was consequently made of working methods and the level of productivity critically analysed.</p>

<p>The Department has, during recent years, been intensifying its efforts to increase productivity through the application of modern technological developments. Mechanisation of working methods, such as the use of equipment for track laying and maintenance, and improved communications, to mention but two examples, are plying an increasingly important part. Not only does it serve to alleviate the manpower shortage, but by eliminating outmoded, time-consuming manual methods, workloads are eased, productive time is increased and greater economies are effected. It will be of interest to note that despite a decrease of 2% in the number of staff in the Railway branch of the Service since March, 1972, the overall tonnage of revenue-earning goods traffic conveyed by rail has advanced by 4,7%&#x2014;in respect of low-rated traffic the increase amounted to 8,3%.</p>

<p>The manifold uses of the computer are also now being applied on an extensive scale and, apart from its primary function, the computer is proving an invaluable tool in the hands of Management both for control purposes and as an aid to quick and efficient decision-making.</p>

<p>In the campaign I have referred to, which had as a more immediate aim the bridging of the current gap between revenue and expenditure, Management took the initiative by establishing Committees for Higher Productivity and Efficiency. These committees now function on all the nine systems of the railway network and in most departments. The staff were given the opportunity to participate fully and their Staff Associations were invited to be represented on the committees.</p>

<p>The committees meet monthly, when working results are closely scrutinized in order to establish what economies can be effected. All suggestions from the staff with a view to increasing productivity and promoting efficiency, are thoroughly investigated and, if found practicable, put into effect immediately.</p>

<p>By introducing improved methods and procedures and by a greater measure of rationalization of workloads and working methods, a saving of almost R19 million has been effected since the launching of the campaign last year to the end of December, 1972.</p>

<p><i>Staff Emoluments:</i></p>

<p>Although the staff had manifested admirable restraint in their representations for increased remuneration based on the rise of cost of living since the last general increase in salaries and wages in June, 1970, a dispute was declared by one of the Staff Associations, and the Judicial Commission appointed by the State President to investigate the matter unanimously recommended a wage increase of 15%. The Administration was legally bound to implement the finding of the Commission but, by virtue of the fact that all groups of the staff were affected, the increase could not be restricted to one group only and I decided to adjust all salaries and wages of Whites as well as non-Whites, with effect from the January, 1973, paymonth. The additional expenditure arising from the increase will be of the order of R100 million per year.</p>

<p><i>Rates Review:</i></p>

<p>It had been clear from the outset that expenditure of this magnitude could be met only by a general tariff increase and to correct the imbalance between revenue and expenditure, all goods and pipeline rates, harbour charges, parcels charges, certain passenger fares and related miscellaneous charges were enhanced with effect from 1st January, 1973.</p>

<p>Because of its historic system of charging, the Railways had hitherto to contend with an inordinately large and disproportionate gap between its highest and lowest rates. This gave rise to a situation where, since the bulk of traffic conveyed by rail was charged at rates approximating, and in many cases below, the cost of conveyance, the Administration was to a major extent dependent upon a relatively small proportion of its more remunerative traffic, whether transported by rail or by pipeline, to maintain its viability.</p>

<p>The Railways&#x2019; high-rated traffic has always been peculiarly sensitive to, and usually affected by, changes in the economic climate of the country. This was underscored by the disproportionately large decrease in the revenue derived from that traffic (4,5%) as against a relatively small <span class="col_2101-2102" refersTo="page_1064"/>decrease (approximately 2,7%) in the volumes conveyed during the period ended 31st December, 1972, as compared with the previous year&#x2014;a situation aggravated by the drop in net earnings occasioned by an increase in the volume of uneconomic traffic conveyed.</p>

<p>To remedy the position and yet retain as much of its traditional high-rated goods traffic as was possible in an environment of steadily mounting costs, it was essential that the rail tariff increases, which had become inevitable, be implemented on a selective basis rather than by way of a flat horizontally-imposed surcharge. It was also necessary, unless the more elastic high-rated rail traffic was to be burdened with an inequitable share of the increased charge, that steps be taken either to eliminate or materially to modify the incidence of traffic conveyed at uneconomic rates.</p>

<debateSection name="#new_works_programme_and_capital_expansion">

<heading>NEW WORKS PROGRAMME AND CAPITAL EXPANSION</heading>

<p>The construction of new railway lines is progressing satisfactorily. The line from Vryheid to Empangeni is 66 per cent and that from Broodsnyersplaas to Ermelo 11 % complete. The commissioning date for the latter line is set for April, 1976, to fit in with the target date set for the completion of the rebuilding of the existing line between Ermelo and Vryheid. The line from Grov&#x00E9;put to Vogelstruisbult, on which 16% of the work has been done, is expected to be opened for traffic in August, 1974. Preliminary planning is in hand for the construction of the double line from Kensington to Bellville, the new line to serve the Table Bay Harbour extensions, and the line from Arnot Power Station to Wonderfontein.</p>

<p>Of the other new projects mentioned in last year&#x2019;s budget speech, the installation of centralized traffic control on the Wellington&#x2014;Touws River section is expected to be completed in December, 1975, whilst the first stage of the doubling of the Vooruitsig&#x2014;Newcastle and electrification of the Kroonstad&#x2014;Hamilton and Whites&#x2014;Welkom lines are expected to be completed by March, 1976. A contract has since been awarded for an aerial survey in connection with the proposed central mechanized marshalling yard for the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>Only 6% of the work on the installation of centralized traffic control and associated improvements on the Klerksdorp&#x2014;Fourteen Streams section remains to be done, whilst similar improvements on the Queenstown&#x2014;Burgersdorp section are expected to be placed in service in December this year; steady progress is being made on the Potchefstroom&#x2014;Klerksdorp section. The electrified section Hercules&#x2014;De Wildt has been opened for traffic, that between Booth and Reunion is already partly in use and the improvements between Noupoort and Springfontein were completed in August, 1972. Other improvement projects completed during the current financial year, or which are expected to be finalized by the end of 1973, include the installation of centralized traffic control on the Union&#x2014;Volksrust, Acornhoek&#x2014;Hoedspruit, and Metsi&#x2014;Acornhoek sections, remodelling of the yards at Swartkops, Donnybrook, Wolseley, De Aar and Cradock, stage 2 of the new goods layout at East London, track improvement between Pietermaritzburg and Kranskop and electrification between Duff&#x2019;s Road and Mandini.</p>

<p>In consequence of the progressive elimination of steam traction, diesel depots are currently being erected or extended at Coligny, Humewood Road, Noupoort, Swartkops, Cambridge, Bloemfontein, Franklin, Greytown, Mason&#x2019;s Mill, Wentworth, Germiston, Krugersdorp, Capital Park, Koedoespoort, Lydenburg and Nelspruit, whilst the Estimates for 1973/74 provide for diesel depots to be erected at Richards Bay and Amabele.</p>

<p>The extensions of the white-products pipeline from Alrode to serve Isando, Benoni, Pretoria West and Waltloo were completed in August, and the line from Sasolburg to Klerksdorp in December, 1972. The new 15 cm pipeline for the conveyance of aviation fuel from Sasolburg to Jan Smuts Airport was completed in January, 1973. The pipeline network now covers 1 783 route kilometres.</p>

<p>Restoration work on the eastern mole in Table Bay Harbour was completed in August, last year, and stage 1 of the harbour extensions will be completed during this month. Steady progress is being made with stage 2 which is expected to be completed in June, 1975. The facilities for the fishing industry at Mossel Bay harbour will be ready this month. In Durban harbour three new cargo sheds at Point were taken into use in September, 1972, and the new Pier No. 1 and remodelled yard at Cato Creek will become operational during <span class="col_2103-2104" refersTo="page_1065"/>this month. Stage 2 of the construction of Pier No. 2 is expected to be completed in October, 1974, and the ore stacking and loading plant at Port Elizabeth harbour in June this year.</p>

<p>At Richards Bay dredging is proceeding to schedule. Work on the construction of quay walls is due to commence towards the and of May of this year, and the first berth to be constructed are those intended for the handling of export coal. The new port will be brought into service by April, 1976, by which time three berths will be available. A fourth berth is to be commissioned by April, 1977, completing the initial stage of harbour development.</p>

<p>The freight depot at Jan Smuts Airport will be taken into use in stage from April, 1973, whilst the building for cabin services and the flight kitchen will be completed in June, 1974.</p>

<p>A development of particular significance was the completion during the past year of the Administration&#x2019;s new data-processing centre in Johannesburg, for housing, <i>inter alia,</i> three modern computers as well as an integrated data-switching system, costing about R1, 1 million and which is at present being installed. This will form the centre of a sophisticated data-telecommunications network. One of the computers will be used for the next phase of the computerized truck-control system whereunder data concerning truck and locomotive movements will be entered directly into the centrally situated computer from marhsalling yards, operating offices and locomotive depots. This will ensure country-wide, up-to-the-minute information on rolling-stock movements and thus more efficient decision-making in regard to traffic flow and control. The other two computers are being used for the other numerous computerized activities of the Administration.</p>

<p>Further applications of computers envisaged for the years ahead include an integrated stores inventory control and accounting system for both the Railways and Airways, and a system for the capture of full consignment-note data by means of the computer and the forwarding of consignment particulars by telecommunication line to destination stations. This latter system, of which the first phase is expected to be in operation by September this year, will be extended gradually during the coming five years and will bring about improved goods control, reduce the incidence of unentered traffic, and assist towards rendering a more efficient service to the public.</p>

<p>Having regard to the heavy capital programme already provided for in previous Estimates, which will take some time to complete, as well as the availability of physical resources, provision is made for a minimum of new proposals in the Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74. Those that are included, however, are considered essential for certain of the Administration&#x2019;s basic functions and relate to the provision of housing for staff, new machinery for workshops, mechanized equipment for the permanent way, cartage and road transport service equipment, and the extension of schemes already provided for in previous Estimates. The Department is also obliged to meet its commitments to ensure sustained progress of projects associated with the coal-export scheme, and to augment its motive power and rolling-stock establishment and to provide facilities for the conveyance of non-White commuters in the Pretoria complex.</p>

<p>To cater for the conveyance of the large number of non-Whites being settled in the Tswana Homeland to the north of Pretoria, the Railways and Harbours Board will shortly investigate and report with a view to constructing an electrified double line, 20 km in length, between Winternest and Mabopane at a cost of nearly R20 million. In addition to certain facilities which require to be provided between Winternest and Pretoria to allow for the large number of additional trains to be schedule, a new passenger station has to be built at Belle Ombr&#x00E9; which, together with its connecting lines taking off near Hercules, will cost about R15 million. The cost of the whole project, including coaching stock for the conveyance of passengers to and from the Mabopane area, will be of the order of R70 million. A Construction Bill will be submitted to Parliament later in the session for approval of the construction of the new line from Winternest to Mabopane and for the link line to Belle Ombr&#x00E9;.</p>

<p>I would like to inform the House that I am in full agreement with the decision to go ahead with the Sishen-Saldanha project. If Iscor&#x2019;s expectations materialize, namely to carry upwards of 15 million tons of export iron ore and a large quantity of semi-processed products over this line, it will become a most valuable asset to South Africa.</p>

<p>I had good reasons for concurring in the decision that the railway line and ore quay should be operated by Iscor. In the first place, it will be a single-purpose line carrying only Iscor&#x2019;s products and materials. If <span class="col_2105-2106" refersTo="page_1066"/>the S.A. Railways were to have been responsible for operating it, it would have had to be a public line available to all making use of it and the condition was that after redemption of the capital costs, it would have had to be handed over to the S.A. Railways without compensation, as is the case with all guaranteed lines. Iscor objected to this. Secondly, the S.A. Railways is experiencing a serious manpower shortage, particularly in the bread and butter grades, which will make it extremely difficult to man the project. Thirdly, as the S.A. Railways would have been required to operate the line at cost for at least 20 years, the Department would not derive any financial benefit from it during that period.</p>

<p>I have, however, set two conditions: Firstly, there will be no connection with any S.A.R. line, and secondly, no S.A.R. personnel may be recruited by Iscor unless they had left the service of the S.A.R. at least six months previously.</p>

<p>Should the Government of the day in the years ahead consider that it would be in the country&#x2019;s interest to effect a linking-up with S.A.R. lines in order to enable other bodies to make use of this line, or that railway lines to link up with this line would have to be constructed in order to provide in the needs of others, the operation and ownership thereof would have to be transferred to the South African Railways because the existence of two competitive railway systems, one privately owned and the other a government undertaking, could never be allowed in South Africa. I should also like to add that a privately owned single-purpose railway line and harbour are not unique. As a matter of fact, this is found in several countries where state-owned railways also exist.</p>

<p>The St. Croix scheme should not be seen as an alternative but rather as complementary to the Sishen-Saldanha project. When Port Elizabeth harbour reaches its maximum capacity, attention will have to be given to St. Croix. It is self-evident that where other exporters will not be able to utilize the Sishen-Saldanha line but have obtained oversea markets for ores in quantities that Port Elizabeth cannot handle, and also wish to use larger ships, the St. Croix or, for that matter, any other scheme, will receive the necessary consideration. Up to the present, however, the full capacity of the rail facilities to Port Elizabeth and the ore stacking and loading plant have not been utilized.</p>

<p>Having dealt with the Sishen-Saldanha and St. Croix projects, I would like to say a few words about Richards Bay, which has many advantages over Durban Bay. It is protected, has considerable room for expansion and development and can be deepened to handle vessels of up to 250 000 tons, which it would never be possible to do at Durban harbour or, for that matter, at any other existing South African port.</p>

<p>Labour requirements should present no problem as Richards Bay is situated close to a Bantu homeland. Apart from an aluminium smelter and associated industries that have already been established, two oil companies are planning to erect refineries there, which are expected to be followed up by a full range of petro-chemical industries. In addition, various other industrial concerns are seriously considering establishing themselves at Richards Bay. The framework plan for the industrial area has been finalized and the basic water supply, electricity, sewerage and road systems are in the course of completion.</p>

<p>The construction of the railway line is proceeding according to programme and will be completed simultaneously with the two berths which are to be used for coal exports from 1st April, 1976. A third berth, which is to be used partly for imports of alumina and partly for general cargo, will also be available at that date, whilst a fourth berth, intended for bulk and general cargo, is to be commissioned by April, 1977.</p>

<p>As the oil pipe-line passes relatively close to Richards Bay, a junction could be provided to make the new port a great oil discharge point.</p>

<p>The rail access now being provided passes from the Transvaal coal producing areas through the Natal coal fields and as hon. members probably know, the Transvaal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association has been given authority by the Government to export approximately 109 million tons of Transvaal coal at a rate of not more than 9 million tons a year. The Association has already signed a contract for the export to Japan through Richards Bay of 2,7 million tons of coal a year over a period of ten years as from 1st April, 1976. This line might also facilitate the export of maize. As Richards Bay will be the natural export harbour for a large portion of our maize-producing area, a grain elevator will in due course be constructed there as and when additional capacity becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The railway line and the harbour will also <span class="col_2107-2108" refersTo="page_1067"/>provide an alternative route for products to and from the Witwatersrand industrial and commercial complex.</p>

<p>Richards Bay is the greatest project embarked upon during the past 60 years and I foresee that it will, in the years to come, become a second Durban harbour. In this connection I might perhaps allay fears that the new port will be allowed to develop substantially at the expense of Durban harbour.</p>

<p>It must, however, be borne in mind that Durban harbour does not offer much more room for substantial expansion and that Richards Bay will, as a result of the considerable economic development that South Africa can expect in the future, develop into a commercial harbour of format.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the current financial year the locomotive establishment consisted of 2 296 steam, 1 290 electric and 455 diesel locomotives. Since then 63 electric and 124 diesel locomotives have been placed in service, whilst 97 steam, 9 electric and 3 diesel locomotives have been withdrawn. The present combined tractive force of locomotives in service is 3,5 per cent more than that at the end of March, 1972.</p>

<p>Of the 350 electric locomotives ordered, 95 were received up to the end of December, 1972&#x2014;delivery of the balance is expected to be completed by June, 1976&#x2014;and of the 295 diesel locomotives ordered, 156 were received up to the end of October, 1972; delivery of the balance is expected to be completed by August, 1974. In addition, there are 20 narrow-gauge diesel locomotives on order which are expected to be placed in service during the period July&#x2014;December, 1973.</p>

<p>The Estimates for 1972/73 provide for the acquisition of 100 electric locomotives in respect of the specifications are being prepared. In addition, specifications are being prepared for 100 diesel shunting locomotives while tenders have been issued for 100 main-line and 100 branch-line diesel locomotives. A further 50 class 34 diesel locomotives are included in the Estimates for 1973/74.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1972/73 financial year, there were 4 330 main-line saloons, 820 steam suburban and 3 186 electric suburban coaches in service. After the placing in service of 281 main-line and 75 electric suburban coaches and the scrapping of certain main-line and suburban stock, the establishment at the end of December, 1972, comprised 4 479 mainline, 794 steam suburban and 3 235 electric suburban coaches.</p>

<p>Of the 500 main-line and 545 electric suburban coaches on order, 84 main-line and 75 suburban coaches have already been delivered. Tenders for the supply of 125 first-class and 250 second-class main-line saloons, 120 third-class main-line saloon bodies with bunks, and 165 second-class reserved main-line saloons, were issued during September, 1972. Specifications are being prepared in respect of 125 first and second-class composite main-line saloons, 50 first and second-class reserved main-line saloons, an ultrasonic rail test car, as well as a number of guards&#x2019; and parcel vans. Further specifications engaging attention include 982 suburban coaches. The Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 provide for the acquisition of 150 third-class main-line saloon bodies with sleeping accommodation.</p>

<p>During the period April to December, 1972, the total merchandise-carrying capacity of goods wagons increased by 3,6% to 4,7 million tons. During the same period orders were placed for a further 2 700 wagons of various types, including 52 double-decker motorcar wagons. An additional 5 271 bogie wagons are provided for in the estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74.</p>

<p>The highlights of the year in so far as the provision of new rolling-stock is concerned were the introduction, towards the end of last year, of the new luxury Blue Train sets between Pretoria and Cape Town, and a double-deck train for the conveyance of motor cars between Port Elizabeth and the Reef. The enhanced international renown that the new Blue Train has already brought to the South African Railways and the country in general is undisputed proof of the success of the purpose for which this new concept in luxury rail travel was devised, whilst the efficiency of the motor-car train is ample evidence of the adaptability and viability of rail transport. It is the intention to expand this service and introduce a service between Kaalfontein and Isipingo when the motor-car trucks now on order are placed in service in 1974. The old Blue Train, repainted green and gold, and renamed &#x201C;Drakensberg&#x201D;, is now doing duty between Johannesburg and Durban.</p>

<p>In order to improve payload capacity, special combinations of road transport vehicles, consisting of a semi-trailer and a <span class="col_2109-2110" refersTo="page_1068"/>trailer, were recently placed in service for goods traffic. To match the increased carrying capacity, high-powered vehicles were also acquired for the hauling of payloads of 26 500 kg, as against the previous maximum payload of 18 000 kg. Fifty of the special combination sets have been placed in service on selected routes. A new type of vehicle combination for the transport of livestock has also been placed in service. It has a carrying capacity of from 24 to 30 large and from 130 to 150 small animals.</p>

<p>Vehicles placed in service during the current financial year include 152 passenger vehicles, two dual-purpose vehicles, 159 haulers, 101 semi-trailers and 68 trailers. The Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 provide for the acquisition of 229 vehicles of various types at a cost of R4,5 million, and a further 733 vehicles at a cost of R2 million earmarked for the cartage services.</p>

<p>Harbour equipment placed in service during the current financial year includes, <i>inter alia,</i> a new tug at Durban, two pilot boats at Durban and one each at Table Bay Harbour and the harbours at Port Elizabeth and Walvis Bay. In addition, a new dredger was provided at East London, and a barge with dredging and anchorlift apparatus and hopper at Walvis Bay. Wharf cranes placed in service include eleven 4-ton cranes at Table Bay, and four at Walvis Bay, whilst 75 fork-lift trucks and 14 other mechanical handling appliances were provided at the harbours. Equipment on order or to be ordered includes 48 wharf cranes, six tugs, two floating cranes, two dredgers, two pilot boats, 20 fork-lift trucks and two mobile cranes. Additional equipment provided for in the Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 includes one first-class oceangoing tug for Richards Bay, 44 Fork-lift trucks and four platform tractors.</p>

<heading>ACCIDENTS AND ACCIDENT PREVENTION</heading>

<p>In the operation of transportation services, the safe conveyance of passengers and freight, is of primary importance and the spate of serious train accidents during last year was, therefore, viewed with grave concern. I am pleased to say that there was a decrease in the number of accidents during the first ten months of the current financial year, but the situation is, nevertheless, being carefully watched.</p>

<p>An analysis of accidents reveals that in nearly all collisions between trains and in approximately 25 % of derailments, the human element was at fault. The departmental investigations which are conducted into accidents, without delay, have a twofold purpose, viz. to establish the cause thereof and to recommend precautionary measures. In the technical field improved equipment is continually being designed for the control of train movements. Recently, for instance, a vigilance control device has been introduced and is being installed progressively in electric and diesel locomotives. This device will cause a train to stop automatically should a driver become incapacitated or inattentive to the performance of certain essential routine actions whilst driving a locomotive. Reliable equipment and the maintenance of permanent way, rolling stock, etc., are, of course, also of cardinal importance, and research is continually undertaken in this regard.</p>

<p>By far the greatest scope for improvement, however, lies with the human element. Management has recently intensified the application of all safety measures in this direction and by means of instruction, propaganda, inspection and discipline is motivating all ranks of the staff, especially those concerned with the movement of trains, towards a still greater measure of safety-consciousness and sense of responsibility. I am glad to report that certain positive steps taken before the recent Christmas and New Year holidays, when heavy passenger traffic in particular reached peak proportions, were effective to the extent that during the ensuing month a decline in the number of accidents of no less than 26% was recorded.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#staff">

<heading>STAFF</heading>

<p>Owing to the country-wide shortage of manpower, due to the sustained state of full employment, difficulty is still being experienced in filling vacancies in certain grades. In August, 1972, there were less than 2 400 registered unemployed White males in the Republic, whilst on October, 16, 1972, the Railways had a total of nearly 11 500 vacancies mainly in certain key grades, in which vacancies by mid-December, 1972, amounted to 20%.</p>

<p>To alleviate the position in the bread and butter grades, staff in other spheres have, where possible, been trained for duty in those grades in which serious shortages are experienced and nearly 500 servants are at present rendering such auxiliary service.</p>

<p><span class="col_2111-2112" refersTo="page_1069"/>The practice of employing female staff in certain occupations traditionally filled by men is also being extended. The number of females employed in such positions increased steadily and now totals about 500. The first group of female police constables are at present undergoing training at the Railway College.</p>

<p>Where justified, the placing of non-Whites in graded positions in consultation with the Staff Associations is being continued.</p>

<p>During the year the Department continued in its efforts to improve working conditions in general and particular attention was paid to amenities such as ablution, heating, ventilation and lighting, as well as lighter and more comfortable clothing.</p>

<p>Whereas in the past the value of leave payable to a servant&#x2019;s widow on his demise was limited to a maximum period of six months, approval has been given of the payment to his dependants, or to his estate in the absence of any dependants, of the value of all leave standing to a deceased servant&#x2019;s credit.</p>

<p>The Administration, on the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Pension Matters, has approved of a scheme, which took effect from 1st October, 1972, whereby every member of the New Superannuation Fund who joined or joins the Service at an age higher than 18 years may exercise the option of antedating his pensionable service to the first day of the month following his 18th birthday. The antedating is, however, limited to a period of not more than five years and the servant is responsible for the total amount of his own contributions and the contributions that are normally paid by the Administration, together with interest.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will be glad to learn that Railway pension beneficiaries have not been forgotten. It has been decided to raise, with effect from 1st April, 1973, the minimum income level of R118 applicable to married&#x2014;single persons with dependants included&#x2014;and R59 applicable to unmarried pensioners, to R130 and R65 per month, respectively.</p>

<p>In so far as Civil pensioners are concerned, my colleague, the Minister of Finance, will deal with this matter in his Budget speech.</p>

<p>In view of the recent salary and wage increases granted to Railway staff, consideration was also given to improve the basic pensions of Railway pensioners, in order to also compensate those persons whose pension exceeds the minimum income level, for the rise in the cost of living.</p>

<p>I have consequently accepted the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Committee on Pension Matters that the annuities of all Railway pensioners be increased by 10% with effect from 1st April, 1973. Hon. Members will, no doubt, bear in mind the concession made a few years ago whereby the net annuities paid to all Railway pensioners are enhanced by 2%&#x2014;compounded annually&#x2014;for each completed year that they are on pension.</p>

<p>As far as non-Whites are concerned, the temporary allowance is being increased as follows with effect from 1st April, 1973.</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Married&#x2014;inclusive of single persons with dependants: from R20 to R22-50 per month for Coloureds and in respect of other non-Whites from R17-50 to R20 per month.</li>

<li>(b) Single, widow or widower: from R11 to R13 per month for Coloureds as well as other non-Whites.</li>

</ol>

<p>In regard to housing, new ground is being broken by the introduction, with effect from 1st April this year, of a House Ownership Scheme for Coloured staff on lines similar to the scheme in operation for White staff. Provision is accordingly being made in the Estimates for 1973-&#x2019;74 for an initial amount of R300 000 for this purpose.</p>

<p>At present almost 70% of the White married staff in permanent and temporary employment are enjoying assistance in respect of housing either in the form of a house purchased under the House Ownership Scheme, a property acquired under the Assisted 10% Ownership Housing Scheme or a departmental house.</p>

<p>At present 13 000 servants are participating in the House Ownership Scheme, whilst some 7 500 servants have been assisted in purchasing a house under the Assisted 10% Ownership Housing Scheme.</p>

<p>Departmental houses available to White married staff number 23 700 and the 1973-&#x2019;74 Estimates provide for a further 370 to be erected. If regard is had to the fact that accommodation for more than 4 800 unmarried White staff is available in Railway Hostels and that some 42 000 non-Whites are accommodated in compounds, line camps and other departmental dwellings, hon. members will agree that the <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1070"/>Railways has made equitable provision in respect of housing.</p>

<p>The rental for departmental houses averages R17-50 per month. The last rental adjustment was effected in October, 1953, nearly 20 years ago, and during these years salaries and wages have more than doubled. Since then maintenance expenditure, assessment rates, etc., in respect of departmental quarters amounted to more than R14 million.</p>

<p>Although an increase of 75% in rental would appear to be justified, I have decided to raise the rental for departmental housing with effect from 1st March, 1973, by only 40%; I consider this to be fair and it means that the average rental of R17-50 per month will be increased by R7. The increase is expected to yield additional revenue of almost R2 million.</p>

<debateSection name="#estimates_for_1973-&#x2019;74">

<heading>ESTIMATES FOR 1973-&#x2019;74</heading>

<p><i>Passengers:</i></p>

<p>Passenger revenue in the coming year is estimated at R116,4 million, or R10,5 million more than during the current year.</p>

<p><i>Goods:</i></p>

<p>It is estimated that goods traffic will yield approximately R652,9 million in the coming year, the improvement of R111,8 million on the current year&#x2019;s figure being due in great measure to the tariff increases.</p>

<p>Iron and manganese ore traffic, both local and for export, is expected to increase during the year, and also imports of capital goods such as machinery.</p>

<p><i>Coal</i> earnings are estimated at R72,5 million, the improvement of R10,7 million being due to increased exports and the effects of the higher tariffs.</p>

<p>The increase in <i>road transport</i> revenue (viz. R2&#x00BC; million) is also due largely to the higher tariffs.</p>

<p><i>Harbours:</i></p>

<p>It is forecast that the volume of imports will again rise in 1973, and the Bureau for Economic Research of Stellenbosch University estimates an increase of 12,5% in value. Taking into account the higher tariffs now applicable, harbour earnings are expected to rise by R11,5 million to R73,5 million.</p>

<p><i>Airways:</i></p>

<p>There has recently been an improvement in air traffic, and in addition to the revenue from the new services to the Far East and Argentine, increased earnings are expected from air freight.</p>

<p>Airways revenue for 1973-&#x2019;74 is estimated at just over R158 million, i.e. R21 million more than in 1972-&#x2019;73.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines:</i></p>

<p>The crude oil pipeline is scheduled to convey 1,2 million tons more traffic than in the current year and an increase is also expected in the case of White products as a result of the expansion of the network to include Pretoria and Klerksdorp. It is forecast that pipeline revenue for 1973-&#x2019;74 will yield R81,4 million, or R26,3 million more than the current year&#x2019;s figure.</p>

<p><i>All Services:</i></p>

<p>Total revenue from all services is, therefore, estimated at R1 311 674 000 and expenditure at R1 303 874 000, so that the year 1973-&#x2019;74 is expected to show a surplus of R7,8 million.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was pleasant to see today that the hon. the Minister still realizes that there is a Parliament in South Africa to which the Railways are to a certain degree accountable, because the way matters have developed recently, most things in the sphere of the financial administration of the Railways are taking place outside Parliament. We find that increases in salaries and rates are announced and then Parliament is expected to approve them <i>ex post facto.</i> The hon. the Minister does of course have my sympathy, for I cannot see what else he can do since he has to run the Railways and determine the financial policy of the Railways as a member of a Cabinet and within the framework of a policy responsible for the financial misgovernment of South Africa. With this stop-go, stop-start economic policy which is so characteristic of this Government, it is almost impossible for most of the businessmen in South Africa to determine their policy and to plan their business projects properly. A few years ago the hon. the Minister said he appreciated that changes in the salary structure and the rates of the Railways would have to be brought about every four years. I do not know whether he still remembers that. I fear that as a result of this Government&#x2019;s policy, that period is becoming shorter and shorter, and year after year it is in fact becoming more and more difficult to plan the Railway&#x2019;s financial administration in advance. I want to express the hope that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s expectations for the new financial year will be realized. At the same time I want to express the conviction that in two years&#x2019; time he will again experience problems owing to inflation and lack of control over the value of our money. It is matters of this kind which we want to discuss and for which the Minister will have to account.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that what we welcome in the proposals of the hon. the Minister, is the relief which is envisaged for the pensioners. We on this side of the House would like to express our appreciation and support for anything done to ease the lot of these people. I think the hon. the Minister deserves appreciation for the generous provision which he made for improving their lot. I always find it pleasant to be able to say something good about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget. I listened carefully and did manage to find something good, but I am afraid that there are also other matters which we want to discuss with him and which cannot be discussed in the same friendly atmosphere. To allow him some rest before having to hear these things, I move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find something very strange in the hon. member for Durban Point. Reference has already made to it in this debate. He has the ability to whip up emotions about every possible matter in this House. When this debate was adjourned, the hon. member for Durban Point had just taken part. Hon. members may now listen to the kind of statement he made. He spoke of &#x201C;Iron curtain methods&#x201D; and of &#x201C;Iron curtain&#x201D;. The concept of an iron curtain is a very unpleasant one in terms of the meaning the world assigns to it today. To go and label a measure, the objects of which I clearly explained in this House, as an &#x201C;iron curtain&#x201D; type of measure, is in my opinion very irresponsible. I think it is very unreasonable, as far as the country at large is concerned, to give that kind of label to this measure, which is a protective measure for them. The hon. member spoke of &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;. Surely there is no mention whatsoever of censorship in this legislation. It is surely very unreasonable and very irresponsible to label this measure a form of censorship. I again just want to reiterate what I said to the hon. House on a previous occasion. The procedure up to now has been to advertise, and then the National Transport Commission is applied to for a licence to introduce certain services. All they are now doing is to ensure that those who advertise in the newspapers first obtain the necessary licence authority from the National transport Commission. That is all we are doing. I simply cannot accept the fact that it is labelled an &#x201C;iron curtain&#x201D; measure <span class="col_2117-2118" refersTo="page_1072"/>and &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;. I give him credit for more responsibility than such a statement is worthy of. He speaks here of the &#x201C;banning of information&#x201D;. Can hon. members grasp what &#x201C;banning of information&#x201D; means? What is the hon. member trying to achieve with that? What is he trying to do? What is his purpose? What is his intention as far as that is concerned? I have stated very clearly that we are dealing here with the measure for the protection of the air travellin public of South Africa. We are dealing with the measure that must protect people against unscrupulous exploiters. When we do this, the hon. member says we are engaged in the &#x201C;banning of information&#x201D;. The hon. member moved amendments, and on a previous occasion I very clearly gave my reasons why those amendments are not acceptable. Either they are already contained in the Act or they contain a principle which I cannot accept. Up to now the position in this country has been that the National Transport Commission is autonomous. We do not, by means of this legislation, now want to restrict that autonomy.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I want to refer to, although it is not directly concerned with this measure before the House. Because of what was said in the House I must, however, make a correction. Hon. members on the other side included charter flights in the discussion, which is completely unfair. A great issue was made of the fact that charter flights would supposedly be so much cheaper now than scheduled services. A great fuss was made about that. I must point out to the House and to the travelling public that there is also something called group rates as far as the South African Airways is concerned. The group services of the South African Airways are cheaper than the majority of charter flights. Because what else is a charter flight? It involves a group travelling as a group and therefore subject, as such, to cheaper, group rates. But exactly the same privileges are available at the South African Airways, and since the debate has developed along those lines, I find it essential to point out that injustice, because those privileges also exist.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question? I put something to him yesterday afternoon in the debate.

Would he please answer that now?</p>

<p>No, I have not read the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard; I remember distinctly what he said. He asked whether it was an offence for <i>The Cape Times</i> to publish an advertisement for any airline, possibly the example he quoted now. Obviously it is not an offence for a newspaper to do that. We place no onus whatsoever on a newspaper. But on the other hand it would of course require the permission of the National Transport Commission to publish any advertisement for a flight which is meant to draw South African passengers. If it originates or terminates outside the borders of South Africa, we do not of course have any jurisdiction over that whatsoever. But if it does terminate within the borders of this country, or leaves from any place from within the Republic, they will obviously have to have the permission of the National Transport Commission.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It means nothing more than what I have said. It means that, if any airline flies a connection from anywhere in South Africa to any other place, whether the flight is chartered, scheduled or whatever, I accept that it is carrying passengers from South Africa. Perhaps I did not use the correct term by calling them South African passengers. I really meant passengers from South Africa. If any airline, whether it flies a chartered, a scheduled or any other service, flies passengers from inside South Africa to anywhere else, it comes under this Bill as it is now phrased. First of all, the original Act <span class="col_2119-2120" refersTo="page_1073"/>already provided for certain classes of airlines. This is merely extended by the proposed new section 2A as far as the advertisements are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister did not reply to the query which I put to him about the interpretation of the English term &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D; and the Afrikaans term &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;. Perhaps he will deal with that later. I wish to come back to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply. He has said that the objectives of this Bill have been clearly explained by himself. Yet when we accept the hon. the Deputy Minister at his word and we say that, if those are his objectives, let us limit this Bill to what he says are the objectives, he rejects the amendment we move. Therefore I must say that by his own refusal to accept the amendment, by his own rejection of that amendment, the hon. the Deputy Minister makes us reject the reasons which he gives for wanting this legislation. If this legislation is required, as he says, only to protect travellers against unscrupulous agents, our amendment makes that possible. If the hon. the Deputy Minister wants more powers, to do things other than those which he claims he wants to do and pretends he want to do&#x2014;as we must assume from his rejection of the amendment&#x2014;then we must assume that the reasons given do not cover the motive. My amendment covers every single object which the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to achieve through this measure.</p>

Let him give us one reason why the acceptance of any of these limitations on the commission would prevent the achievement of the objectives at which he is aiming. Then we can talk about it. We cannot debate intelligently when there is no intelligent argument put forward from the side of the hon. the Deputy Minister. It is typical of the attitude of the Government that, when they come to the House with a measure, they say: This is what we are going to do and we are not interested in reason, logic or anything else&#x2014;&#x201C;ons is die groot baas en ons gaan dit deurforseer; ons het die stemme; ons het die mag&#x201D;.</p>

<p>*What we have here once more is one of those cases where we try to debate in a reasonable manner the merits of a case but the Minister is not prepared to debate it. He simply says: &#x201C;It is not necessary and I do not accept it.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He has not yet furnished a reason why the acceptance of this amendment is going to thwart his aims.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now let me come to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply to the hon. member for Kensington. He has not, in fact, replied to him at all. Does he not understand the question put to him? In terms of the proposed provision, would it be illegal for somebody to advertise in <i>The Cape Times</i> a flight from Swaziland to, say, Luxemburg? He says that it will not be illegal for the newspaper, that we cannot control flights outside South Africa and that only if they leave from within South Africa will they fall under the provisions of this clause. It is not so. I have here with me <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> dated 4th March in which an article appears. I say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that when this Bill is passed an offence would have been committed in terms of this article. An offence would have been committed because in terms of the provisions of the Bill it would have promoted the sale of seating accommodation. It would have encouraged people to look for the Luxavia opportunity to fly to London via Luxemburg at R395 instead of R529. It would therefore have contravened the law by promoting and drawing to the attention of the people the opportunity to fly cheaper than they can under normal fares charged by the South African Airways. By referring to London-New York and London-Venice flights it <span class="col_2121-2122" refersTo="page_1074"/>would be tantamount to promoting flights. Therefore, whether or not that flight originates in South Africa this would create an offence for any journalist, newspaper, any travel magazine or anyone other than a registered airline who put out any advertising material at all, even the advertising of an internal flight in America, an internal flight in Europe or a flight from London to the North Pole. This would be promoting flights without the permission of the commission. I do not know how to get it through to the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is not practical to limit writings in magazines, publications, leaflets and trade adverts in the way in which this seeks to do it. It is not practical and it is not realistic. He is aiming here at one group of people, namely pseudo travel agents in South Africa. In aiming at them he shoots with a scatter-gun at any sort of information coming into South Africa. Then he takes exception when I talk of the Iron Curtain and censorship. It is not what the hon. the Deputy Minister intends, but it is what he is achieving. He must not come and squeal to me when I talk of censorship or the Iron Curtain when it is his Bill which is creating that situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows or should know that this measure will in fact prevent South Africans from receiving information on the sort of flights which are available to them overseas.</p>

<p>Unless the hon. the Deputy Minister can indicate to us some reason other than that the Big Broeder wants this power and is not prepared to bend one inch on it, we cannot accept that the reasons he has given for this measure are the real reasons for which he wants it. It goes far beyond that and our amendment gives in fact the powers that he is asking for.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to the question put to me on a previous occasion by the hon. member, relating to the English translation of the word &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;, namely &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D;. It is merely a matter of phraseology, Sir. There is no single English word for &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;, to the best of my knowledge. &#x201C;Authorized representative&#x201D;, &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D;, or whatever the case may be, would be the translation of &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D;. I am not a linguist, and that is the information that was made available to me. Perhaps the hon. member knows better; I do not, unfortunately, or at least, the sources available to me do not. &#x201C;Gevolmagtigde&#x201D; in Afrikaans includes an agent as well, so therefore &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D; is the exact interpretation of the term &#x201C;gevolmagtigde&#x201D; in Afrikaans. As I have said, this word in Afrikaans includes an agent, and &#x201C;gevolmagtigde agent&#x201D; would then have a double meaning; it would be repeating what was already said. &#x201C;Gevolmagtigde&#x201D; can be interpreted as &#x201C;gevolmagtigde agent&#x201D; or &#x201C;authorized agent&#x201D;. It means exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to the hon. member&#x2019;s next point. The hon. member for Durban Point blames me for a lack of intelligence, but I am trying also to bridge the intelligence gap on his side. I have explained in the clearest possible terms exactly what this clause means. I did so during the Second Reading and I did so again in this Committee. I have stated the reason why the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is not acceptable to me. Let me go into this once again. The hon. member, in his amendment, states that &#x201C;such authority shall be granted &#x2026;&#x201D;. He binds the National Transport Commission. I have already explained the accepted principle and I am not prepared, by means of this legislation, to change that principle. The accepted principle is that of autonomy for the National Transport Commission. I cannot possibly use this legislation before the House at the moment to change that principle. I do not intend changing the principle because I want the National Transport Commission to judge whatever application comes before it, and to judge it purely on merit. I am not prepared to accept the amendment because it does limit the judgment of the National Transport Commission. It forces, it orders the NTC to do certain things and it takes away its discretion in that regard. I cannot accept that principle. I am trying to explain this to the hon. member. Secondly, I pointed out that what he intends in the second part of his amendment, namely his proposed subsection (2)(b), to follow subsection (1) of the proposed new section 2A, has already been incorporated in this clause itself. Thirdly&#x2014;and this also answers the hon. member for Kensington&#x2014;part three of his amendment deals with journeys originating and terminating outside the borders of the Republic, and limits the provisions of the proposed new section to the Republic of South Africa. Here he refers to publications, etc., referring to such journeys. But, Sir, that is self-evident.</p>

<p>I will come back to that. Sir, let us go back to the clause. I have tried very hard to explain it. This clause, with due respect, should be read in its entirety. It is not subdivided into separate subclauses. One should therefore read the clause as a whole&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall without the written authority of the Commission, which may be granted subject to such conditions as the Commission may deem fit&#x2014;</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I cannot see the hon. member&#x2019;s argument; that is the problem. This relates only to a single fact which I wish to state most emphatically once more. The position up to now was that anybody could publicize or advertise a flight; anybody could collect deposits from people, or even the full price of the ticket, before applying for a licence or before getting any authority whatsoever for such a flight. We are merely changing the sequence of the procedure now. Before a person is allowed to advertise or to sell tickets to the public or to collect deposits from members of the public, he has to have the authority of the NTC. After he gets their authority, he is free to advertise to the public any form of cheap air travel, provided &#x2026;</p>

He is free to do so provided he has the necessary authority, and provided again that it is a flight which terminates or originates within the borders of the country. This is merely changing the sequence. He has to go through all the procedures first. We are merely changing the sequence in this respect that he now has to have the authority of the NTC before he advertises the flight to the public. In my reply to the Second Reading debate I very clearly pointed out to the House the sort of problem that we are faced with, the sort of experiences we had in the past, and I want to emphasize again that I have a responsibility to the public of South Africa to protect them against this sort of thing; it has got to be done, and we are doing it by means of this Bill, and nothing more can or should be read into the Bill than merely this.</p>

I would be glad, Sir, if he would just look at 2A(1); he will agree with me then that my paraphrasing is fair: &#x201C;Within South Africa&#x201D;, I suggest we say, &#x201C;no person shall without the authority of the National Transport Commission make known by any means that any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service&#x201D;.

<p>I am looking for a specific application. This is what I am arguing. Now, if this is correct, and he cannot argue that it is not correct, let us first remember that an &#x201C;air service&#x201D; in the Bill is not defined as an air service within South Africa or originating within South Africa or terminating in South Africa. In other words let us come back to the example I put to him earlier. If the operator of a non-scheduled airline or air service between Swaziland and Luxemburg, or Louren&#x00E7;o Marques and Luxemburg, wants to advertise such an air service in a South African newspaper, does this not fall within the ambit of what I have put to him, that within South Africa no person shall without authority make known by any means that any person is willing to undertake the conveyance of any person in the performance of an air service? Of course it means that. How can he say otherwise? That is precisely what this says.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister knows, as I have said, that the definition of an &#x201C;air service&#x201D; in the original Act does not confine itself to air services which originate or terminate here. Let me read it to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Air service&#x201D; means any service performed by means of an aircraft for reward and includes an air transport service.</block>

<p>Now, in the light of this, is this hon. Deputy Minister prepared to give this House the unqualified assurance that it will not be necessary for authority to be obtained from the National Transport Commission by publications which wish to advertise non-scheduled trips from outside our borders, perhaps just outside our borders, to anywhere else in the world?

If he says this is his intention, to allow this sort of advertising, that is certainly not what the Bill says but it is what the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Point proposes. Then, why is he not prepared to accept the amendment? You see, Sir, we seem to be pushing our heads up against a stone wall. He keeps on talking past our arguments. But even as I put this to him again, he does not seem to react. I am glad the hon. the Minister of Transport is here, because this is a serious matter. It affects newspapers and publications generally and they will want to know exactly where they stand. We must insist that this hon. Deputy Minister reply to us, or if he cannot answer adequately, the hon. the Minister should come into the debate and tell us exactly what this means.

<p>Of course the principle of this Bill has been accepted in the Second Reading, but in submitting our amendments to the hon. the Deputy Minister we were trying to put into practice what he had actually said. He has said here this afternoon that it does not concern air service outside this country. Of course he talks against his own arguments because one of his big worries is the air services that operate from Louren&#x00E7;o Marques to elsewhere. It is quite clear from the Bill that this in fact affects all services, and as the hon. member for Kensington says, most publications are going to be in a most difficult position on interpretation of this particular clause.</p>

<p>We have come forward to try to assist the Minister by moving our amendment. What he wants to do is to protect the legitimate user and the person that wants to go about it the correct way. We want him to do this to assist those legitimate organizations who in the past have gone the right way about it and have organized charter flights or group flights. He wants to protect the public as far as the fly-by-nights are concerned but he does not say so in the Bill. But in our particular paragraph (b) we give him that let-out by providing for a substantial deposit and that substantial guarantees be provided. That protects the man in the street against the fly-by-nights. All the way through we have tried to assist the hon. the Minister but he now puts a measure on the Statute Book which will not work out and which will embarrass most legitimate travel agencies who have international connections. They will be placed in a most difficult position. If we as the S.A. Airways advertise in New York or anywhere else&#x2014;forgetting about our scheduled flights&#x2014;if one of our pamphlets advertises a flight within the Republic which is a non-scheduled flight or a group flight, one may get away with it in New York, but what if they retaliate and say: &#x201C;You do not allow us to do this in South Africa, so we will not allow you to advertise in our country&#x201D;? That can happen. We have had retaliations before. As was said during the Second Reading by the hon. member for Durban Point, we have gone too far in this Bill. What the hon. the Minister wants to do we are trying to put right in this amendment. Unfortunately I do not know why he does not see the light and why he does not appreciate the fact that he is going too far in this measure. We do not want to make fools of ourselves. Do not let us put measures on the Statute Book that we cannot put into operation and dare not put into operation. It is no use putting a measure on the Statute Book and the Minister having to come here next year and tell us that there has been a test case and his legal advisers say the Act has to be amended. Surely, this is the time to examine the law properly, even if we delay <span class="col_2129-2130" refersTo="page_1078"/>it, or even if the Minister decides to withdraw it at this late stage for that purpose?</p>

The whole point which the hon. the Deputy Minister is trying to make seems to be based on the fact that jurisdiction applies to flights which take place to or from South Africa. But can he still not see that that is not the point of the argument? According to this amendment the National Transport Commission is given jurisdiction over publication within South Africa of details of flights anywhere. That is exactly what it says. Does he not see that? It does not appear as though he sees it. In that case we cannot argue any further.

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides that &#x201C;any person who fails to comply with an order or direction of the commission shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding R1 000.&#x201D; One of the most important elements of the law generally is that it should be certain. The public should know beforehand precisely what the legislator enjoins them to do or forbids them to do. The offence, especially if it is a criminal offence, should be clearly stated so that everybody knows what that offence is&#x2014;otherwise you either have anarchy or despotism. Here we have a condition that you commit a criminal offence in respect of which you may be fined R1 000 if you do not obey and comply with an order or direction of the commission. What sort of orders and directions does the commission in fact give? The commission gives a direction when it hears applications for licences or for the renewal, alteration or transferring of licences or the exemption from any of the provisions of this Act or conditions of the licence or on behalf of any interested person requesting the commission to make any order or give any direction. In other words, these directions that it might give in respect of licences, if these are not complied with constitute an offence. Let me put it another way. What this means is that we are not stating here that X, Y and Z are offences, or that a particular behaviour constitutes an offence, but we are saying that the commission may, in its discretion in all sorts of circumstances, decide from time to time what would be an offence in terms of the law. In other words, the National Transport Commission is here entitled, upon application for licences under the Act, to declare from time to time that something is a crime, or that something can become a crime, and a fine of R1 000 is imposed. This is not just a bad law; it is also an extremely bad principle. If you do not comply with the direction or order of the commission in respect of the granting or renewal of a licence, in respect of a condition of that licence or whatever, then the National Transport Commission has the power to withdraw or refuse the renewal of that licence; it has the power to do something about it. To make it a criminal offence is ludicrous and absolutely unacceptable. That the offence should be stated <span class="col_2133-2134" refersTo="page_1080"/>clearly in the law, that it should be known to all and should then be punishable by the courts is a principle which has been well known throughout the centuries. This is so fundamental that it does not need any elucidation. As this measure stands at the moment, it is objectionable, but there may be just some aspect of this which has escaped our notice and perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister can indicate to us that what I have said is not so, and if it is not so, why it is not so.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer the hon. member to section 3(l)(d) of the principal Act. For the sake of completeness I should just like to read it to the hon. member. It deals with the functions of the commission in relation to applications. Subsection (1) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be the function of the commission, subject to the provisions of this Act, and with due regard to the provisions of sections seven and nine of the Transport (Co-ordination) Act, 1948, to hear and determine any application&#x2014;</block>

<p>And now I shall read paragraph (d)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">by or on behalf of any interested party, requesting the commission to make any order or give any direction, consent or approval which it may lawfully make or give, or with respect to any matter which by this Act or any order or direction &#x2026;</block>

<p>Please note: &#x201C;any order or direction&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any order or direction of the commission is prohibited, sanctioned or required to be done.</block>

<p>The principle that the commission may give certain directions in terms of section 3(l)(d) has already been accepted, but it was an oversight in the Act that no penal provisions were included in this connection. All that is being done here is to attach, with reference to section 3(l)(d) of the principal Act, where in principle the commission already has powers of direction penal provisions to those powers of direction. The hon. member must of course remember that anything of this kind will in the nature of things come before a court and that the court has a discretion in the matter. It is not necessary for me to tell him that. This, therefore, only refers to section 3(1)(d) of the principal Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I accept that, obviously, this has to come before the court. That is not the question. The question is: What is the offence? We do not define here what the offence is. What this clause says, is that the commission can decide from time to time in its absolute discretion what are to be offences, by saying: This is to be a condition; this condition is to apply to the licence; this condition to the use of a service. It can make any direction it likes as to how the operator, who has the licence, is in fact to operate. If that condition is transgressed, an offence is committed. It is true that the offender has to go to court, but that is not the point. The offence is created by the commission.</p>

<p>I want to go a little further. The hon. the Deputy Minister has dealt with section 3 of the Act. But I would like to ask him to have a look at section 7 of the Act. Subsection (3) thereof provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the commission is of the opinion, having regard to the nature of an application or objection or the circumstances in which it is made, it has a <i>prima facie</i> little chance of success and that its making may cause needless expense to an objector or to the applicant, as the case may be, the commission may at any time during the proceedings after the lodging of an application or objection, order such applicant or objector to deposit with the commission a sum not exceeding one hundred pounds within a stated time, and in default of such deposit may refuse the application or disallow the objection.</block>

<p>If they ordered someone to pay R200 deposit, as is the normal practice, then in terms of the provisions of this clause it would lapse if they did not do so. But if that order is not complied with by the applicant, they would in fact commit an offence. The hon. the Deputy Minister cannot say that they will not be prosecuted, because they will in fact be committing an offence if this legislation is passed. It is not the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s department who will decide. Any member of the public, an objector, who is in competition, could then lay a complaint with the police that in fact he did not deposit the R200. He has therefore committed a <i>prima facie</i> offence and the police will then investigate <span class="col_2135-2136" refersTo="page_1081"/>the matter and a prosecution might take place. But most certainly it will take place in respect of the breach of a condition of a licence. Surely this is once again taking the matter much too far. Does the hon. the Deputy Minister propose that in respect of every licence that is granted, whenever the local transportation board imposes a condition in respect of that licence and that condition is broken or not complied with, does he in turn &#x2026;</p>

<p>I know that. I am talking about road motor transportation licences. The principle is exactly the same. Is it now proposed that the breach of the conditions of a licence for road motor transportation by a local transportation board is also going to constitute a criminal offence? Surely not. As matters stand at the moment, a breach of those conditions reported to the local board or the National Transport Commission will result in that licence being suspended, withdrawn or not renewed. There is action that can be taken irrespective of the licence. But this is not a matter where the public at large is being offended against. This is a matter where there is an application for a trade licence. That is all. The National Transport Commission in its discretion says that you can have that licence upon certain conditions. Now he breaches that. It is a matter relating to that licence. It is a commercial matter. He has the licence at the discretion of this board. Now it is to become a public criminal offence.</p>

<p>They are only far-fetched because this is a far-reaching clause. It says that the breach of a condition is a criminal offence. What is the criminal offence going to be? There is no one that can answer that. There is no one here that can say what sort of conditions are going to be imposed in every case. The National Transport Commission itself could not tell you. The chairman of that commission could not now pass a note to the hon. the Deputy Minister and tell him, what the position would be in respect or every one, because every application is considered on its merits. Both sides are heard, the objectors and the applicants. There are circumstances which arise in every case which are different. No one can tell you what the offence is going to be. But the principle is there. Does not the hon. the Minister appreciate that it is a bad principle? There is a remedy. Why is this necessary? Why can the National Transport Commission, as it stands now, not use its power, if there is a breach of a condition imposed by it, to either nullify the licence or suspend it, or deal with the operator in some other way?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>But surely. Sir, the sanction is that because you have breached the conditions of your licence, you are no longer able to operate on that licence? That is the way to deal with it, surely? As I understand it, they have that power, but if they do not have that power, then they must have it immediately. They must have the power then to suspend the operation on that licence, because a breach of the licence would have occurred. I would have thought that once such a condition were breached, the holder of the licence would no longer be entitled to operate. That is the way to deal with it and if they do not have that power, give them the power. Do not, however, let us give the National Transport Commission the power to create an offence carrying with it a fine of R1 000, because it imposes conditions according to its own whims, entirely in its own discretion. This situation is untenable at the moment. We have not had a satisfactory explanation from the hon. the Deputy Minister yet.

<p>I do not intend to debate the Motor Carrier Transport Act in any way. At the moment I have the Air Services Amendment Bill before me, and I am prepared to debate that principle. If the hon. member will look at section 17 of the principal Act, he will note that it deals fully with the whole question of the cancellation or suspension of licences. If he will page back to section 3(l)(d), he will have to agree with me immediately that there is no penal provision for any oversight committed in terms of that section. If, for example, one fails to act in terms of a direction given under section 3(l)(d), no penal provision is attached to such failure to act. The hon. member will readily grant me that. I shall mention to him two examples of what can happen. The commission may, for example, issue an instruction to someone to appear before them and that person may refuse to do so, in terms of this section. What remedy does the commission have? What penal measures can be applied? Nowhere is there a penal provision providing for such a case. Let us take another case. A licence may have to be returned to the commission within a certain period because it has been cancelled, and the holder of such a licence may refuse to do so. What power, in terms of section 3(1)(d), does the commission have at the moment to take action against him? What penal provision is there? The purpose of this is very clear. It is simply to attach a penal provision to a direction given by the commission with regard to section 3(1)(d). Once again not half of the spectres which have been seen by the hon. member, are present here; this is simply not the case. The intention behind this relates to section 3(l)(d) of the principal Act only.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, could the hon. the Deputy Minister explain to us again, in satisfactory terms, the reason for removing the right of an applicant to obtain a licence 12 months before the expiry of his existing licence? The only reason given in the Second Reading Debate was that this right was not used very much. But it does appear to be a privilege which people have at the moment and which cannot create insurmountable difficulties or problems for the department.

<p>*The reason is as follows. We have investigated all the possibilities which might occur when an officer is discharged from the Force on account of ill health. I just want to say for the record that the procedure which is followed in connection with medical unfitness, is the following: If the district surgeon or another doctor should express the opinion that the member of the Force is medically unfit for further service, he makes out a clinical report and supplies a prognosis which is submitted to the head office. A medical board is then convened to which two doctors are appointed. The minutes of the medical board are subsequently forwarded by the Commissioner of the South African Police to the Secretary for Health to inquire whether or not he agrees with the findings and recommendation of the board. The Secretary then submits the matter to the Minister. In the light of this very thorough procedure there is no possibility of some future illness being used for the purposes of a discharge. In these circumstances we shall accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

The possibility of lack of fitness during the period of his employment with a department of State is one which concerns every State employee. With the acceptance of this amendment, there need be no fear now of all the financial consequences of a premature retirement from the Force. That situation can only arise when in fact the man is found to be unfit; in other words, his services will be retained in the Force up to the very time that he is found to be unfit. I thank the Deputy Minister for accepting that amendment. It will reassure members of the Force.</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there is an interesting provision here in subparagraph (c) of the first paragraph of this clause. I refer to the provision for the storage of arms and ammunition by licensed dealers and registered gunsmiths. This raises the question which was raised when the Act was amended, when the first amnesty was granted, and that is whether or not it is not desirable for this provision to be extended not just so that licensed dealers and registered gunsmiths may in fact store arms and ammunition, but whether there should not be a repository provided by the State for arms to be stored. I want to say that the persons who are the most concerned, who are the first to be affected by the theft of fire-arms, are the police themselves. They are usually the people who are at the receiving end of the bullets that come out of those stolen weapons. It is not good enough that the Act, properly interpreted&#x2014;and the Commissioner of Police agrees with this&#x2014;does allow one to leave one&#x2019;s fire-arms with a friend for storage. Although he is in fact not the licensee, you may leave your fire-arms with him. But, Sir, that is not good enough. Your friend may leave and leave your fire-arm in his house and his house may be broken into. No doubt if you take your arm along to a gunsmith or a licensed dealer, he may agree or may not agree to keep it for you; he may or may not charge you a fee. But in our view the public should be entitled to have access to a repository provided by the State, Obviously, Sir, the police station is the proper place for it at the moment, but the police have difficulties as well in providing facilities for arms to be locked up in strong rooms; they would also have the difficulty of keeping a register of them, etc., and they have enough to do already without having to do this as well. On some occasions it depends entirely on the facilities which are available at any particular police station as to whether or not, when a man goes away on holiday, for example, he is able to leave his arms with the police for safekeeping until his return. That depends entirely on the facilities available at the police station. Sir, this is an important matter. The object of this Act <span class="col_2141-2142" refersTo="page_1084"/>is to control the licensing of arms and also to ensure that they do not get stolen or go astray. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give us some indication as to what sort of regulations he has in mind in respect of gunsmiths and whether he will give consideration to the whole question of the State providing for a repository for arms when people want to go away from home and want to leave their arms in safety.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately I do not think that the proposal by the hon. member for Durban North is completely practical. What happens at present, is that there is a proper repository at each police station for the arms of the Police, and the Police are prepared to keep the arms of individuals, of people who go on holiday, in that repository. But a general State repository would involve major expenditure and one would not know for certain how many rifles, revolvers, etc., one would have to provide for when establishing such a repository.</p>

<p>As far as this particular subsection is concerned, it is only concerned with the storage of weapons and ammunition by licensed dealers and registered gunsmiths. Previously it was not necessary to have a regulation in this regard. Under the original Act, before this amendment, the position was such that when a licence was issued, certain conditions were laid down for the storage of the fire-arm. Initially the legal draftsmen thought that it would be more practical, for the simple reason that each dealer had his own specific premises, with his own specific problems, and that it would then perhaps have been easier to attach the conditions to the licence. But after the Act had come into operation it was found that it was better to make provision for the general storage of fire-arms by way of regulation, so that one could have a general repository and could lay down conditions regarding storage. As regards the other aspect, gunsmiths, of course, have never before been subject to licensing at a fee, etc. That is now being introduced. A registration fee is now being required from gunsmiths as well. That may be found at the top of page 6 of the Bill, and consequently storage regulations are also being laid down for gunsmiths. I think the hon. member for Durban North raised an interesting point, but I do not think that it is a practicable one.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister for Transport yesterday said that we did not have to work hard in this House. He has forgotten what it is like to be in the Opposition!</p>

<p>Sir, when this debate was adjourned I had dealt with the question of our objection to this Bill based on the practicability or impracticability of clauses 2 and 5, apart from any other objections, and today I want to take that a little further. I want to look at the reality of what we are being asked to pass here today. We imposed in the original legislation&#x2014;the law as it stands today&#x2014;under section 10(1) an onus on any person who moved his residence, to notify the department of such change of address. We were agreed on that; there was no argument. We believe that when a person changes his address, there should be a legal obligation on him to notify his change of address. We were agreed on the principle that wherever it was possible to find other means of tracing changes of address they should be used. However, when the original Act was adopted we said that the onus it placed on a landlord was not realistic and not practicable. Therefore we opposed the provision. We said that landlords were being asked to do something which in practice would not work. We are now being asked to extend that. There was an option for the landlord. He could either notify or he could wait a period and verify whether notification had been given and then he had to act. A further option is now being added, the option that after 14 days he shall verify notification and within 28 days he shall notify. In other words, it is simply a change in the form of notification, which the hon. the Deputy Minister told us is based on representations made by the landlords, through their organization, and accepted by the Government. The existing system did not work&#x2014;the fact that it did not work is admitted by the Government by the suspension of this provision by the State President &#x2026;</p>

They are now coming along to say that they are not only going to reapply it, but they are going to make it even more difficult to apply by instead of 45 days, limiting it to 28 days. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question when he has finished educating the hon. member who incorrectly interjected. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister how many notifications the Department of the Interior received before the suspension of this provision. Did any landlord notify changes of address or, in fact, did they have no notification in terms of this provision? The hon. the Deputy Minister cannot tell me; he does not know, and I do not blame him. One cannot expect him to know everything. However, the fact is that landlords simply did not notify. What are they now being asked to notify? The amendment in lines 24 and 25, which we are now being asked to add, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and furnish in that notice the full name and identity number of such person.</block>

<p>Those are the two particulars, and the address would obviously be the third which the landlord will have to notify. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that is going to be easy. The landlords have agreed that they would simply send along lists of their tenants. Of course, that is not going to help the hon. the Deputy Minister at all. What is the practice? The practice throughout flats&#x2019; administration in South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p>Let me interrupt myself at this point and point out that a large percentage of South Africa&#x2019;s White population today live in flats. I have tried to establish the percentage, but it must be something like 30%, or more, of the White population. In my constituency it is 100%, but of the whole of South Africa&#x2019;s White population a large percentage live in blocks of flats. When a person rents a flat, the procedure is that he or she goes along to the agent, signs a lease, pays a deposit and is given a key to the flat. On that lease is the name of the tenant who signs the lease. In 99,9% of the cases there is only a limitation as to the number of people who may occupy that flat. With a house there is not even that limitation. But the agent does not know who lives in the flat with whom. It could be Mr. and Mrs. Jones. If hon. members on the Government side have never done so yet, they should try canvassing in flat-land some time. On the board they may find the names of &#x201C;Mr. and Mrs. Jones&#x201D;. But when they get inside they will find that it is Mr. Jones and Mrs. Smith who are living together and are known as Mr. and Mrs. Jones but because of what was then Government policy, they could not afford to get married because they would have lost their pensions. You might find a Mr. Kruger and Mrs. Ponsonby-Smythe living together under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Kruger. Hon. members realize that the landlord does not know this. He signs the lease with the tenant but now he is being asked to examine the identity documents, the book of life, of the tenant and anyone else who lives in that building in order to enable him to fulfil the provision which we are being asked to add, and to furnish in that notice the full name and identity number of such persons. In the first place he is going to find some objection from some of the female tenants, because his Government has now made it so that the identity number immediately discloses the age of the tenant to start with. So every caretaker and every agent is going to be able to establish not only the marital relationship of his tenants, but their ages too. If this is not an intrusion into the privacy of South Africans, I would like to know what is. Not an official for the purposes of official duty, but a landlord, or a letting agent or a caretaker of a flat or a supervisor, will be entitled to pry into the marital status of all his tenants and to establish all their ages. I have even found that in filling in voters registration cards people are not prepared to leave their <span class="col_2145-2146" refersTo="page_1086"/>cards with the caretaker to be collected because they do not want the caretaker of their block to know these personal details where they may not in fact be married or where they do not want to let them know their ages or their personal history. That happens quite often.</p>

They are therefore administered not by an owner, not by a company which is a body of people, but by an office in town to which they pay their rent and from which they obtain their lease in the first place. There is no personal supervision. But now we are asked to make those agents or their caretakers responsible for establishing this information. Again, what happens in practice is that modern estate agents who handle letting, work on computers; they computerize the information and if you ask for a list of the tenants of a building they can get that out by pressing a button.

That list is quite useless in that form, because that list will not have identity numbers on it. It will only have the name of the person who signed the lease and his initials. I have worked on these lists and have tried to marry a list of tenants of a block of flats to a voters&#x2019; roll where there are only some 14 000 names to look at. You find in practice that it does not work, because you can have some four or five Mr. J. Smiths or four or five J. Bothas, or Krugers. In some constituencies &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; for instance, when you go down to the bottom end of mine you even find so many Daan van der Merwes but you have to go pretty far down Point Road to find them! These lists are not going to provide the information. What is more, in many modern blocks of flats which are not rent-controlled, the post-1966 flats, the turnover of people in those buildings can be anything up to 400% a year. Your total population can change four times per year in a block of flats. This will create a tremendous problem for the department, but it is also an impossible problem for landlords. If they are going to keep up with this continual change and are going to have to record all the tenants and notify the department thereof it may give some of the information but it will not work as envisaged. What we will then find is that the population register, like the voters&#x2019; roll, is going to become &#x201C;shambolic&#x201D;. We will find the same sort of thing as we now have on the voters&#x2019; roll, namely that four, five or six families are registered at the same address in the same flat with one bedroom. Agents and landlords are going to be notifying the moves inwards each time&#x2014;if they are doing their job. So they will notify that Mr. Jones moved in in January. At the end of February they will notify that Mr. Van der Merwe has moved in. At the end of March they will notify that Mr. Smith moved into the same flat. Now, within a year you can have four or five people that have been notified as being resident in that flat. However, unless they have been picked up elsewhere, they are still going to be registered there. So your population register becomes, like the voters&#x2019; roll, a mass <span class="col_2147-2148" refersTo="page_1087"/>of irrelevant and inaccurate information. Surely, what we are aiming at is an accurate population register one which will be effective. We are going to have to find some other way, other than this. It is so easy to pass a law&#x2014;we simply debate it; we all vote and it becomes law. We have masses of laws which do not work. I would rather see this House trying to find a method which is going to be effective, efficient and which will give correct information, instead of having something on paper which looks nice through passing a law knowing that it is not going to solve the problem.</p>

<p>I was coming to that. When we criticize, we usually make constructive suggestions. When the same problem was investigated by a select committee on the Electoral Act, we went into this very thoroughly. We found that there was one way in which you could rely on information, namely if you could get it from official and semi-official sources. Every person who moves into a block of flats, has to pay a deposit if he is charged directly for his electricity, or he has to pay a water deposit if each flat has its own water meter. It certainly applies to every house. If they have a telephone, they have to apply to the telephone department. So already you have three official sources which most tenants are obliged to notify when they move from point A to point B. These are official sources that must make out documents. If they make out a telephone receipt, it is easy for them to put in an extra piece of carbon to get an extra copy of that receipt which could then be sent to the department.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it might obviate certain hon. members of the Other Place getting accounts for R1 400 for briefly being absent from their flat. However, as I was saying, these are official documents which are made out. It would only mean that an extra copy would have to be made. As it is an official document, it will have on it the full address and the name. All that would have to be added, would be the identity number. You would then be able to get the information without having to disclose it to private people who have no right to that information. It would be disclosed to officials in municipal or State departments who, by the nature of their work, are used to dealing with confidential information. It would not hurt the tenants, if the person who filled in the application for a telephone happens to know that he was not married to his assumed wife. It would not harm him in his social life or in his local community. By placing the onus on people under whose control they must live month in and month out, you are interfering with their privacy in a way which can be harmful to them. Whether we like it or not, despite the laws we pass, if a caretaker of a block of flats does not like someone, he can get rid of him in one way or another and if he is shocked to find that Mr. Kruger and Mrs. Ponsonby-Smythe, who are living together as Mr. and Mrs. Kruger, are in fact not married, he could get rid of that person. Through official channels, through government sources, you could still get the same information. Therefore my suggestion is that we should rather seek the solution through all the official channels which today control every person&#x2019;s life. Radio licences, motor licences, all these things have to be renewed; they have to be recorded. These are all things which people require. One must have water and light. Many people must have a telephone. These are things they must have and therefore they must go to the specific source. That source can then supply the information easily; it is preferable to a business or private source with which the tenants are in almost daily contact. If this were done, not only could the population register be kept in some sort of order, but the voters&#x2019; roll as well. The original Act, <i>inter alia,</i> provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the person who consented to such residence shall &#x2026;</block>

<p>The proposed amendment to subsection (2) adds the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; within 14 days after the taking up of such residence, furnish the Secretary with the prescribed particulars &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now, in many cases that person who consented to such residence is not in a position to do so. It does not say &#x201C;or his agent&#x201D; or &#x201C;or her agent&#x201D;. It is the person who consented to such residence. If hon. members let their homes to come to Cape Town for <span class="col_2149-2150" refersTo="page_1088"/>the session, they have given their consent to the use of that house, but they do not handle it themselves. They are sitting here in Cape Town. It is handled by an estate agent. But we are placing the onus on the person who consented to such residence, which is in fact the owner, and not that person&#x2019;s representative. Who is the person who gives consent to somebody sentenced to imprisonment when such a person goes into prison? Is the officer commanding that prison the person who consented to his taking up residence in that prison? I give this as one of the many cases where there is not a person who consents. What about if one of these banned students moves from one house to another? If they move into a new house this cannot be notified because they cannot be quoted. Who is going to notify this? But let us take a more serious line. What about all your large institutions such as university residences, boarding schools and other large institutions? The same is going to apply there. I think we are chasing the wrong end of the stick in trying to solve the problem through this amendment. We cannot handle the existing documentation. We cannot handle the existing paper work in the department in respect of the register. And if we cannot handle what we have already, why now go and flood it with millions and millions more pieces of paper when those bits of paper are not going to give us the answer we are looking for? Until we have the population register working more or less smoothly and the basic record is there, let us not chase shares as to how we are going to alter things which are not yet there to be altered. I think we are being over-hasty and this clause should remain suspended as it is at the moment, until the department is in a position to receive this information. I suggest that we should then seek that information from official sources. We have other objections to the Bill, but I will leave that to my colleagues to deal with. I hope that perhaps I have given the hon. the Deputy Minister some food for thought in respect of this particular problem of notifying changes of address.</p>

<p>This afternoon the hon. member for Durban Point tried to put an alternative proposal to the House in connection with the notification that must take place, as he calls it, through official channels. If we turn our attention for just a moment to the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal, he himself will see how ridiculous it really is. The hon. member mentioned quite a few official channels, for example where a deposit must be paid for water and lights, telephones and so on, which means one would have to furnish the information at all these places. In other words, since according to the proposed amendment a person can be asked for his identity document by the home owner or his representative to determine whether he has given notice of his change of address, notice must now be given at three or four places. According to the hon. member&#x2019;s own argument &#x2026;</p>

For example, a man by the name of Raw is living with a Mrs. Kruger, and that type of thing. Now he must go and give this same explanation three times over. In other words, he has three times the embarrassment. There are many blocks of flats in South Africa, and I can tell the hon. member that I shall return to the United Party members in the Christiana constituency and I shall tell them the hon. member for Durban Point regards the Christiana constituency as the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;.

We still remember how those hon. members spoke about the &#x201C;deep platteland&#x201D; last year, and then denied this again at a later stage. Sir, despite the thousands of residents and blocks of flats he spoke of, this hon. member for Durban Point does not even know that today there are hundreds of flats where one no longer pays water and electricity and that this is included in one&#x2019;s rent. In other words, one does not have to go and apply for electricity or water to be connected. There are also hundreds and thousands of people living in blocks of flats today who do not have telephones.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter whether they can get them or not, but there are people who do not have telephones. And they are not in the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;; they are in flats. The proposal about using official channels to find a solution for this matter is a smokescreen the hon. member is using, because the hon. member himself knows it is not possible in practice. Sir, in more serious vein, as far as we are concerned this is a very serious matter. I think we are all agreed that we would very much like to see a successful method found for the notification of changes of address.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. member and I did not understand each other a moment ago, but if the hon. member was speaking of subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 that are not in operation yet or have been suspended by the State President, he is correct. But I was referring to subsection (1) of section 10. Section 10(1) is in operation.</p>

<p>Of course section 10(1) is relevant. Sir, how can hon. members now want to argue about subsections (2) and (3) without taking subsection (1) into consideration. Section 10(1) provides that a person must himself send his change of address to the department, of course. Now alternatives are being added in subsections (2) and (3).</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member may make his own speech. He does not need to glare at me like that. I say again: One cannot discuss subsections (2) and (3) in this proposed amendment without looking at subsection (1). Section 10(1) is the gist of the whole matter. The hon. member for Green Point stated this. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District must go and take a few hints from the hon. member for Green Point. Sir, perhaps Pietermaritzburg District is also in the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;; one never knows. Now the hon. member for Durban Point says we must not bring about changes to an Act that is not in operation yet. But the hon. member realizes that there are a quarter of a million Whites in South Africa who have already received their identity documents today. These provisions must come into operation some time or other. Those hon. members are always accusing us of being too late in the action we take. Now that we are too early, the hon. member is also annoyed.</p>

<p>But, Sir, let us look at the procedure we are proposing here. Throughout the world no better method can be found, for giving changes of address, than the method being proposed here. In other words, if the person himself does not report his change of address to the department, it is then the duty of the owner, whether of the house or the flat, or whatever the case may be. No better method can be found than that method of principle. Sir, there are practical problems one must take into consideration, and specifically for that reason these amendments are being proposed; that is why these alternatives are being offered to make it easier for the flat or home owner. The hon. member himself knows that the regulations prescribe what that owner must do. He must examine the person&#x2019;s identity document and satisfy himself that his change of address has been made known to the department. If that person has not informed the department of his change of address, the owner himself may do so, and after 14 days have elapsed he again gets an opportunity to do so. It is all being made as convenient as possible for the home owner. Sir, there is no other tried and tested method. Every country in the world that accepts this system of change of address, makes use of this method.</p>

</speech>

<p>Where?</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister will tell the hon. member exactly where it is done. The system is used, <i>inter alia,</i> in Switzerland; it is used in Holland and it is used in Belgium. The hon. member may go and ascertain this for himself. Sir, this is not a new principle we are now bringing before the House. We have various Acts, <i>inter alia,</i> the Hire Purchase Act, which also places such an obligation on the owner of a building. I cannot see why hon. members now actually have to bring up the whole principle of notification of change of address again when they should be speaking about the amendments that are being introduced here. Sir, I do not think it is necessary to go into the arguments of the <span class="col_2153-2154" refersTo="page_1090"/>hon. member for Durban Point any further, because the &#x201C;practical proposal&#x201D; he made is no practical proposal; it is a completely impractical and senseless proposal.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back for a moment to the hon. member for Green Point, who is now unfortunately absent. I take it he has a valid reason for not being here. I just want to refer briefly to the delegation problem, with respect to this Bill, to which the hon. member for Green Point referred. Sir, here it is a matter of the delegation of the powers which the Secretary for the Interior has. The hon. member for Green Point said scornfully that 20 years have passed and this matter has not been put right. The hon. member came and played politics here by saying that there are probably thousands of Bantu and other people who were unnecessarily prosecuted because of a document that is not even worth the paper it is written on. Sir, the basis of delegation exists in the existing Act; there is no question about that. The delegation, for which provision is made in the existing Act, is now merely being extended, in terms of this Bill, to the Director of the Bantu Reference Bureau. Let me explain the position to hon. members in these terms: The Secretary for the Interior could delegate his powers to the Director of the Bantu Reference Bureau, but in terms of this Act the Secretary had to name, individually, every person who works under the Director, and it is surely an impossible task for the Secretary for the Interior to know exactly what people there are, in the Department of Bantu Administration or under the Director, who are going to handle this matter. All that is now being done in this Bill is that it is specifically being determined that the Secretary&#x2019;s powers may also be delegated to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner, or whoever the official may be and that the latter himself, like the Secretary, has the power in his own department to delegate certain powers to certain officials.</p>

<p>Hon. members know that there are certain provisions according to which the Secretary for the Interior may delegate his powers. If a classification or a registration is made de novo, hon. members on that side know as well as I do what happens. The particulars are furnished by the person himself or by his father or mother. The hon. member for Green Point is now trying to play another political game by saying that a junior clerk can decide about the reclassification of a person. No, Sir, with all due respect that is not so. Reclassification can never be done by a junior clerk of a department. [Interjection.] The hon. member may go and read what the hon. member for Green Point said; he said it. Reclassification can only be done by the Secretary for the Interior, by the board or by the courts, and hon. members know it. Why is the hon. member for Green Point now making such a fuss about this matter? The hon. member is trying to make out here that the delegation of powers to the Director of the Bantu Reference Bureau and to officials in his department will give rise to dreadful anomalies, but what is the position? When a person comes to apply for reference documents, it is surely logical that he is applying of his own free will; he himself states that he is a Bantu and that he belongs to this or that ethnic group. What can go wrong there? If some or other irregularity takes place, it can be followed up. There is no problems in that connection. The same method is adopted in respect of the activities under the director as in the case of the activities under the Secretary for the Interior.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Green Point also tried to make out that we are being very unfair in clause 3, where we are dealing with the possession of two documents. Sir, when we read clause 3 we must also look at clause 1 and the definition of &#x201C;identity document&#x201D;, while in the past there was only a reference book in which the necessary identity information appeared, <span class="col_2155-2156" refersTo="page_1091"/>we have reached the stage where we must make an adjustment to the definition of &#x201C;identity document&#x201D; because these people are going to get citizenship certificates and because a citizenship certificate is not necessarily an identity document. That is the reason why we must now say that a reference book, and all the information contained in it, is also an identity document, which it has really been all along; its form is now merely changing slightly. I now come to clause 3. A person has an identity document that indicates that he is a Bantu or a member of a Bantu group; he obtains another identity document which he is not really entitled to. The problem of hon. members on that side is this: As the old section read, that person had to be in possession of both those documents to have committed an offence, but, Sir, that is a na&#x00EF;ve standpoint to adopt. If I want to get another identity document why would I keep the one I do not want? Surely I would desire to destroy that document: I would get rid of that document specifically because I want this other document, and that is our problem at this stage: People prefer a certain identity document and then they get rid of their real identity document; then recourse must be had to the register in order to determine what the position is. The Act provides that the person must be in possession of that document, and if he has got rid of it no action can be taken against him in terms of the old section. We shall now be able to check the particulars, and if we ascertain that certain particulars are correct and that the person is in possession of the document he was desirous of having, we can withdraw that document and issue him with another document so that he will not have two documents. The only question involved is whether he was in possession of that document or not. We should all like the person to possess only his correct identity document, but this we cannot bring about if the Act remains in its present form, and therefore it is essential for this amendment to be introduced.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>That is a very good question. Why does he want to? But that is irrelevant, Sir. The fact is that what is involved here is possession or something else. It is not a question of whether the person wants to or does not want to. That is not the question. The question of whether he wants to or not is decided when he applies for classification. There is a channel through which a person, if he has been classified and is dissatisfied with his classification, can apply for reclassification. Hon. members surely know this as well as I do. There is nothing strange or sinister in this connection. I cannot, under any circumstances, see the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2019;s proposal being acceptable to this side of the House in respect of this extremely important matter of the change of address, which has to do with our whole election system, our voters&#x2019; rolls and all related matters. In no way can we accept the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2019;s proposal in connection with official channels. I say it has no body, in contrast with the hon. member&#x2019;s anatomy. Secondly, as far as clause 3 is concerned, there is no reason why we should not also aim at the true object of the matter, i.e that a person should not have two identity documents but only one. Then there is no reason why we should run away and not also place an obligation on home owners and flat owners to bring that change of address to the attention of the department. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District will pro ably still be entering the debate this afternoon, and perhaps he can come to light with an alternative proposal that will be more acceptable than that of the hon. member for Durban Point. The hon. member for Green Point unfortunately made no proposals, but we are still waiting upon the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District. Perhaps he can tell us something.</p>

<p>To give effect to what we are asked to do here, one must realize what has happened and what could happen. There is the question of reclassification and the powers of the Secretary. The Secretary has extraordinary powers in terms of this Act. He has more powers than the Minister. If hon. members have the Act in front of them, they will see that in terms of section 5(4) the Secretary has powers of reclassification which he can use. I should like to say that the Secretary and his predecessor have been exercising these powers with discretion. We welcome it that they can do that in special cases. When I am talking about the Secretary, I want to refer to the reclassification of people who are members of divided families. One finds cases where half the members of a family are classified as White and the other members are classified as Coloureds. When these cases have to be considered by the Secretary, he must use these powers and he has the discretionary power to alter such classifications.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister does not understand what I am talking about. When one deals with this Bill, one must realize what really happens if this delegated power is granted to the Secretary. When application is made for reclassification, the Secretary has to consider such application. We should not forget that in these cases we are dealing with people who have grown up under the supposition that they are living within the White group and that they themselves are Whites. Later they discover that they are not classified as members of that group. A young girl may wish to get married and she applies for her documents in order to get married. When those documents arrive, she finds that she is not qualified to enter into such marriage. These cases are referred to the Secretary for the Interior or to the Minister for his investigation.

<p>I do not know whether they ever had something to do with classification; I do not even know whether they are classified themselves. The position is that the Secretary, as was said by the hon. member for Christiana, cannot see every person who applies for classification and he is forced to delegate his powers. It was said jokingly that he could even delegate his powers down to the tea-boy. That is a very great danger. When you are dealing with a reclassification which affects a person&#x2019;s life, a person who has probably been brought up in a particular group but who has been classified as belonging to another group, you are dealing with a very important matter. The Act is so restricted that it is only the Secretary who has the power to alter a classification. We have strong objection to the Secretary being allowed to delegate his powers down to people who are not qualified.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know why hon. members are so worried about this legislation. That is the point and that is what we object to. We know that the Secretary will probably be careful about it, but the power is there and he cannot classify everybody. The delegation may go to a person who is unqualified and this may affect the whole of the person&#x2019;s life, the whole of his life hereafter. Once a person has been classified it is difficult to be re-classified as a member of another colour group. That is the point to which I object in this particular Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my noisy friends on the other side fail to see the implications of the amendment which is contained in clause 1 of this Bill. We are now being asked two things. One is to empower the Secretary to delegate authority to somebody who may redelegate that authority to a third person, possibly even to a fourth, a fifth or a sixth person. That is what we are being asked for here this afternoon, and that is the point that has been made by my hon. friend from Salt River, but that the hon. members on the other side cannot see it. Why do we object to this? We do it because we believe that the authority should remain with the Secretary, that the control of that authority should remain with him, so that at least the Secretary will know to whom he has delegated the authority to carry out certain actions, because the responsibility remains with him. The responsibility does not pass on as this authority is delegated, redelegated and re-redelegated. It is, as has been pointed out by the hon. member for Salt River, a very, very great responsibility. The future of the lives of people is dependent on this, namely, whether they are classified as White or Coloured, or whatever it may be. That is our point of objection. This whole amendment <span class="col_2161-2162" refersTo="page_1094"/>is compounded by the provisions of clause 6 of this Bill. Clause 6 makes it retrospective to 1953, that is 20 years ago. We are being asked now to justify <i>ex post facto,</i> errors which have been committed by the Government over the last 20 years. I submit that the hon. the Deputy Minister, in his introduction of the Bill, did not answer this question; he did not motivate this and he did not tell us why he wanted this made of retrospective effect for 20 years. That is the whole point. We are being asked for a blank cheque. The hon. the Deputy Minister referred to the reference bureau for the issue of identity documents to Bantu. I accept all that, but this does not only refer to those classifications, but it refers to the whole Act. It refers to all the powers the secretary has in terms of legislation, under all the sections and in particular section 5. He can delegate to someone to redelegate and redelegate. Where is it going to end? This is the whole point. The responsibility remains with the Secretary, but he does not know where it has gone. He does not know who is carrying out these powers. That is why we oppose this legislation.</p>

<p>No, it is not a case of seeing &#x201C;spoke&#x201D; at all. It is a case of watching the interests of the people of South Africa. I want to say that I do not believe that this is fair on the Secretary, because he is going to have the responsibility. What did we find with the Agliotti affair? That this authority had been delegated and redelegated to the point where the Secretary, the person concerned, did not know who had the power and in fact did not know who had signed certain documents but yet he had to carry the responsibility. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he believes this is fair on his Secretary. Is it fair on the Secretary of the Interior that he should not know who is carrying out his authority?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana made a long song and dance about clause 3 and referred to what the hon. member for Green Point had said. I want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that clause 3 is the only clause of this whole Bill that we accept. The hon. member for Green Point made that quite clear. I therefore do not know what the hon. member for Christiana was getting all excited about.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana referred to section 10(1) of the Act. I want to say here and now that section 10(1) of the Act is the only section that was accepted by us. We believe that the onus should be on the individual to notify his change of address. In fact the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that there are forty laws, regulations, byelaws and other provisions in this country requiring an individual to notify his change of address. But they have all failed and that is why the hon. the Deputy Minister has now come with a second amendment in the space of three years to try to get people to notify their changes of address.</p>

<p>Hon. members ask what suggestion I can make. I am going to refer those hon. members to the department concerned, the Department of the Interior, particularly to those who are concerned with the Book of Life. I want to say that we in South Africa have already devised the best scheme to get people to notify their changes of address and I am sure the department will confirm it to members on that side as well. That is the card which is now embodied in the Book of Life. I am sure that the hon. the Deputy Minister will confirm that the response which has been received from holders of the Book of Life, those who have sent this pre-addressed change of address card back has been phenomenal. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that instead of wasting the time of this House coming with this sort of amendment when in fact we are amending a provision of an Act which has been suspended or which has never been promulgated and which does not apply, he should be getting on and be issuing the Book of Life, because once those are all issued then, if the indications to date are to be accepted, we are going to find our difficulties regarding notification of changes of address very much alleviated and we are going to find the situation very much better than it is today. What is the position. Nobody can even apply for a Book of Life today, because the department cannot carry out the work it has now. But here the Deputy Minister is coming with an amendment which is going to create even more work for them in that department.</p>

<p>I really wanted to speak to the hon. the Deputy Minister in connection with clause <span class="col_2163-2164" refersTo="page_1095"/>4 of this particular Bill. Clause 4 amends section 19 of the Act. Section 19 raises certain presumptions. Clause 4 introduces a new presumption, namely that if a reference book under the Bantu Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents Act has been issued to any person, such person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have been notified on the date on which such reference book was so issued to him that he has been classified as a member of the ethnic group indicated in such reference book. In other words, when that Bantu receives his reference book in response to his application, it will specify the ethnic group to which he belongs. The presumption is thereby raised that he is in fact a member of that particular ethnic group and it is up to him to prove that he is not. That is all very well, but how does the responsible authority arrive at a decision with regard to the ethnic group to which one belongs? I ask that question in all seriousness: How do they arrive at the decision &#x2026;</p>

<p>It must be. How can the hon. member say that it is not pertinent to this matter? Of course it is! We are being asked to write a presumption into the law which shall be raised in every case under this Act, the presumption that a person is in fact a member of a certain ethnic group. They cannot tell me how they decide to which ethnic group he belongs. Section 5(5) of the Population Registration Act states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the application of this section and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">(d) a person shall be classified as a Bantu if his natural parents have been classified as Bantu.</block>

<p>That is fine; so far so good. However, there is no reference whatsoever to the different ethnic groups which can by proclamation be proclaimed by the State President and which have, in fact, been so proclaimed. Reading subsection (5) further, one finds that there is another group which is subdivided into subgroups, namely the Coloured people. It is specifically laid down in subsection (5)(f)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person whose natural father has been classified as a member of any ethnic or other group into which Coloured persons may be classified, shall be classified as a member of the group of which his father has been so classified as a member.</block>

<p>There is no such provision for the Bantu. I want to know how they decide to which ethnic group the Bantu man belongs, because&#x2014;and this is becoming more and more important as Government policy is carried out in this country&#x2014;certainly a Xhosa, a citizen of the Transkei, has far greater benefits than the citizen of KwaZulu has today.

<p>I shall reply to the last question of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District first. He asked what the prescribed steps are which have to be taken. Those steps are determined by means of regulations. A person must ensure that his registered address is the correct one. Those are the steps which have to be taken. A person must see to it that the address on his identity document, which the hon. member called the book of life, is the correct one. That is the obligation which is being placed on a person, which is what the hon. member is looking for. Those are the prescribed particulars.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The prescribed particulars are his name and identity number. Is the hon. member satisfied? Then I want to deal with the presumption. The hon. member had a long argument on presumptions, and on how the ethnic groupings would be made. This is a matter which is not relevant to this Bill at all. Let us see what is in fact relevant. The envisaged amendment in clause 4 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If a reference book has under the Bantu (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act, 1952 (Act No. 67 of 1952), been issued to any person, such person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have been notified &#x2026; that he has been classified as a member of the ethnic group indicated in such reference book &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now the hon. member wants to know how the ethnic grouping will take place. That has nothing whatsoever to do with this Bill. The clause refers to what has already taken place and to the ethnic groups indicated in his reference book. The issue here <span class="col_2167-2168" refersTo="page_1097"/>is not how ethnic classification takes place. As I have said it is indicated in the book and the person is aware of it or ought to be aware of it because it is given to him at his request. The person himself came forward to state to which group he belongs, and this is indicated in the reference book. Now the clause indicates that such person shall be deemed to be aware of this. That is all. He cannot subsequently state that he falls under another ethnic group. If he received his reference book with his ethnic grouping, he was aware of that. That is not unjust. What is unfair about that?</p>

<p>I could not quite make out what the tenor of the argument of the hon. member for Salt River was. I did understand that it dealt with the matter of delegation. I think another hon. member also has problems in this regard, and consequently I shall deal with that portion of the Bill immediately. What has happened here is the following: The head of the Bantu Reference Bureau distributed reference books to people who applied for a reference book. The head of the Bantu Reference Bureau and his subordinates did this. As people reached the age of 16 years they came to ask for reference books, and the reference books were issued to them. That reference book is also a document which is being used for this Population Registration Act. The Secretary has had the right to delegate since 1950. But how was it stated in the Act? I refer to the existing definition of Secretary&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; means the Secretary for the Interior and includes any person employed by the State or the holder of a post in the public service acting under a delegation from or under the control or direction of the Secretary for the Interior.</block>

<p>It is a delegation. What happens here was that the law advisors said: &#x201C;This delegation of yours should be a personal delegation. It should be your personal delegation, and as far as we were able to establish your personal delegation was given solely to the head of the Bantu Reference Burea.&#x201D; In other words, his further delegations were not made, and for that reason this provision is now being amended. In future reference books will continue to be issued in this way. Consequently it is necessary for the delegations to be made correctly. For that reason one amendment, i.e. the substitution of the words &#x201C;kragtens delegasie deur&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;in opdrag&#x201D; is being effected to the Afrikaans version only and two others to both the English and Afrikaans versions. The fully amended definition now reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; means the Secretary for the Interior and includes any person employed by the State or the holder of a post in the Public Service acting under a delegation from or under the control or direction of (a) the Secretary for the Interior; or (b) any person acting under a delegation from or under the direction of the Secretary for the Interior.</block>

<p>In other words, he is now granting the right to delegate on his behalf to the head of the Bantu Reference Bureau as well.</p>

<p>I come now to the point raised by the hon. member for Green Point. He apologized for having to leave the Chamber. In his Second Reading speech he told us that he could understand that if an error had been made it had to be rectified, but he wanted to know why we did not simply legalize all the actions of the officials. His objection was not concerned with the matter of delegation. His objection was concerned with our manner of legalizing matters. He wanted us to say that everything which had been done previously, from 1952 onwards, was now legal. There is no difference whatsoever if we were to do this as the hon. member for Green Point suggested, or if we do it as is being proposed in the Bill. I maintain that this method of ours is a far easier method, for we have to remedy the matter of delegation in any case as far as the future is concerned. Since one now has to remedy it as far as the future is concerned, one may as well remedy it in retrospect as well, in respect of the 20 years which have elapsed. So, we have now remedied this matter of delegation. That is all that this provision comprises. It comprises nothing more. When the hon. member for Salt River becomes concerned here about section 5(4), etc., it has nothing to do with this. The situation is still that the Secretary simply takes action, or someone acts directly under his delegation.</p>

<p>He has always been able to do that. The hon. member is simply conjuring up spectres now, as one of the hon. members here said.</p>

<p>Sir, my time is running out; I should also like to reply to the hon. member for Durban Point. I appreciate the attempt by the hon. member to make a constructive contribution. He mentioned certain things here which in his opinion should be applied. Sir, I do not think it is practical and I am now going to tell the hon. member why. But before I do that I want to cross swords with him in regard to one point. The hon. member said that subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 of the principal Act were being replaced by new subsections because they did not work. The hon. member knows as well as I do that those two subsections were not in operation for a very good reason. I know that the hon. member is always only too eager to make a little political capital out of matters. It is no use putting subsections (2) and (3) of section 10 into operation now for the simple reason that the identity documents have not been completed yet.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is a big difference between what the hon. member said, namely that the section would not work, and the actual position, namely that the section was not put into operation because a preliminary step had to be taken first. The section will definitely work; we believe that it will work. I want to agree with the hon. member for Durban Point that this clause is one of the most important clauses in regard to this new attempt to include people&#x2019;s names on the register. It is extremely important that people should furnish their change of address. I told the hon. member at the outset that I would welcome practical suggestions, for I have no doubt whatsoever that the Department of the Interior will definitely consider any really good suggestion, precisely because this aspect of the Act is one of the most important aspects. If we fail in this connection, then the entire system of registration of identity documents fails. Sir, hon. members know that section 10(1) is in operation. Section 10(1) provides that the person should himself, within 14 days, notify the Department of the Interior of his change of address, but we are now going a step further. We have received representations from the estate agents, and I shall come in a moment to what the hon. member for Durban Point said in regard to blocks of flats. I want to tell him that I grew up in the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;, but that in my constituency there are just as many big blocks of flats as there are in his. The estate agents approached us themselves and said: &#x201C;please, allow us, as soon as a person moves into a block of flats, to obtain the necessary information immediately and furnish it to the Secretary&#x201D;. This amendment is therefore being effected at request. Sir, let us see how it works in practice. I do not know how many people who are not married and who go under one surname are living in the constituency of the hon. member for Durban Point, but I want to tell him that it is absolutely essential for the sound operation of this Act that one should constantly be able to keep track of the movements of a person, whether he is married or not; it is absolutely essential. What happens when a person moves into a block of flats? The hon. member said that the person who consents to that can only be the owner. Sir, surely that is far from being the truth. The owner gives his consent if the agent gives his consent. The hon. member knows just as well as I that companies who appoint agents to rent their properties have no idea whatsoever of who is living in those flats, for the agent gives consent.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If that is accepted, then we will have this position: As soon as a person moves into a block of flats the owner or agent will immediately inform him: &#x201C;Sir, I am under a legal obligation to ascertain what your name and your identity number is.&#x201D; That information is then furnished to him; he simply sends it on to the Department of the Interior and the necessary entry is made in the register. The document of the person concerned is amended and returned to him. What more can you expect?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This applies to all whose particulars which have to be included in the person&#x2019;s identity document.</p>

<p><span class="col_2171-2172" refersTo="page_1099"/>Sir, I listened attentively to the suggestion made by the hon. member in regard to water, telephones and lights&#x2014;because it sounded to me like a practical suggestion&#x2014;which was that we should rather obtain this information from the departments. He has mentioned telephones, water and lights. There are many thousands of telephones which are being operated under the name of a previous subscriber. It usually takes a person one to two months before he has his previous telephone subscription cancelled and is allocated another telephone. We simply cannot do this. I do not think it is practical. Take water and lights. There one has the same position. The people have moved out of the house long ago, and only then did they cut it off. Therefore there is no absolute control. The very best control remains the person who is moving who has to inform you. Take radio licences. One licence is issued to one member of the family, but five members have radios. Those licences mean nothing in this respect. Take the university residences. I think this proves our side of the matter, that this is a very practical method. The moment a student arrives the residence warden writes his name down and this goes to the Department of the Interior and it is rectified in the identity documents. I am not wedded to this clause as such. I do not want to inform this House that this is the only method on earth whereby we are able to exercise control. I want to reiterate that any time when hon. members, inside this House or outside, go to the Department of the Interior with a better suggestion, it will be considered, for herein lies the essence of the whole matter.</p>

<p>In his Second Reading speech the hon. member for Green Point made a few statements. He discussed the position of the document, in terms of clause 3. He said that he did not think we should amend this Act as we want to do. Previously the position was that if a person has an identity document&#x2014;the Act read that if he was in possession of an identity document and was also in possession of an identity document on which the race of another person was indicated as being Bantu or otherwise&#x2014;the one document was returned. The law advisors have informed us once again that in this case a person must be in possession of both these identity documents. Now I want to give the hon. members a very practical example. What happens here is that a person receives a Bantu reference book. He throws it away for he receives a lot of advice from all his friends. He obtained the Bantu reference book from the one department. He then comes to the Department of the Interior with a lot of other things, many of which are not valid, and receives a Coloured identity card. Now he has two documents, but he throws the reference book away. It was not possible to call in that Coloured identity card in terms of section 15, for the simple reason that the interpretation of the law was that he should have been in possession of both documents. Now we are simply amending it in such a way that if he has the two documents, whether he has them in his possession or not, if they have been issued to him&#x2014;these are the words which are now being used, if they have been issued to a person&#x2014;then that person has to return the one. Then it is the one on which he is not indicated as being a Bantu. In other words, the one on which he is indicated as being a Bantu must remain in his possession.</p>
