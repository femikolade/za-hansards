<p>Mr. Chairman, last night the hon. the Minister of Agriculture spoke at length on agriculture in South Africa. He told us, too, that the export of agricultural products was our best export for the creation of goodwill towards South Africa. I agree with him 100% as far as that is concerned. Last night we also learnt from the hon. the Minister, in the course of his reply to the speech by the hon. member for Newton Park, that an agricultural planning board was to be established in November of this year. This is something for which we have been pleading for many years. We appreciate it and we welcome it wholeheartedly. The hon. member for Newton Park will deal with it more fully a little later on.</p>

<p>We also want to associate ourselves with the words of the hon. the Minister concerning the retirement of Dr. Du Plessis next month. We appreciate the work done by him in the department. We fully associate ourselves with what the hon. the Minister said about him.</p>

<p>There is another matter of great importance to South Africa, one which intimately concerns my constituency. Although the agricultural faculties fall under the National Education Vote as do all the faculties of Rhodes University, I feel that the Minister of Agriculture should not forget these faculties, as they perform an excellent service for South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak particularly about the tick research institute at Rhodes University which is a research institute of international repute. At the moment, this institute receives assistance from the Mohair Board, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, from the Rhodes Foundation Trust and from the Livestock and Meat Industries Control Board. We are grateful for all the assistance that is given to this department. It is important that this department should be able to plan for the future. The reason why I am raising this matter is that a short while ago the Meat Board was prepared to make a grant to this university, covering a ten-year period. If my information is correct, I believe that this grant over a ten-year period would have amounted to approximately R250 000. The hon. the Minister was not very happy about this. I discussed the matter with him and he told me what his reasons were. He preferred the grant to be made on a year-by-year basis because it was felt that Rhodes University might be duplicating work being done at Onderstepoort. I may say that Onderstepoort is also doing a magnificent job of work in the field of tick research.</p>

<p>At the moment the basis of subsidization of Rhodes University by the Livestock and Meat Industries Control Board is in the vicinity of R5 000 per annum. When one has year-to-year subsidization of an institute such as this there is a great deal of difficulty in planning ahead. I am told by the university authorities that one must have the ability to plan at least three years ahead. This is particularly in regard to the post-graduate researchers and the fellowship scientists from overseas who come out to this country for one to three years at a time. I may mention that I have here the <i>Rhodes University Newsletter</i> of 1 February 1972 in order to illustrate my point. &#x201C;The first person from overseas to take advantage of the followship at Rhodes University for tick research was Prof. Don R. Arthur, Professor of Zoology at King&#x2019;s College University, London. Prof. Arthur has been given a year&#x2019;s leave from his university and has joined the tick research unit at Rhodes. He has published more than 70 scientific papers on tick research which range from the classification to the toxicology of ticks and to their physiology and behaviour and association with disease.&#x201D; There is a great deal said in this newsletter about Prof. Arthur who is a man of international repute. I say that if we wish to attract this type of person, we should be able to plan ahead financially. The universities need additional assistance.</p>

<p>In relation to the question of duplication, I want to say that at the time when Rhodes University applied for a long-term subsidy from the Meat Control Board, they drew up a memorandum setting out their programme for the future because it was necessary to do so. Actually, if one is applying for this sort of thing, one has to draw up a programme of work and indicate the direction in which one is working. This memorandum was available to all researchers and to all scientists not only in South Africa but throughout the world. It now appears to me, without deprecating Onderstepoort, that Onderstepoort itself is making good use of this setting out of a programme by Rhodes University. _ They are possibly to some extent also duplicating the work being done at Rhodes. I want to say that in the Eastern Cape the incidence <span class="col_5483-5484" refersTo="page_0432"/>of OP-resistant ticks is very high indeed. It is phenomenal how the resistance keeps on building up in these ticks. It is definitely on the increase in that area and Rhodes have realized this. They are now studying the whole ecology of the tick with a view to its partial biological control. I believe that it is important that we should have this aspect as I am told that it is impossible ever to eradicate it totally, but we can bring it under control by regular dipping and by the use of biological control by the study of the ecology of this animal. We must remember also, Sir, that the bont tick is found in the East Coast areas only; the bont tick is a virulent carrier of disease, and we should encourage further research into the ecology and the life cycle of this particular tick. We must also remember, Mr. Chairman, that in the East Cape we have 49 out of the 63 varieties of tick, including politics. Forty-nine out of the 63 varieties are to be found around Grahamstown, and this is a great advantage to a researcher in that area. We also find a high incidence of all tick-borne diseases, and that is why we have a diagnostic centre in Grahamstown, a new one which the hon. the Minister has helped us to get. We have it there because of the high incidence of tick-borne diseases, and the research done at Rhodes University can be co-ordinated with the work done at this diagnostic centre to perform a great service for South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to be in Grahamstown on the 22nd of this month to open a congress there, and I would like to issue an invitation to him on behalf of Dr. White-head, the head of the Tick Research Institute in Grahamstown, to come and visit the Tick Research Institute and to see the work that is being done there. I believe, Sir, that every possible encouragement should be given to this institute, and I appeal to the Minister to have a look at this thing again. If the Livestock and Meat Industry Control Board is still prepared to grant a subsidy to this institute over a long period, a period of 10 years as was proposed, I hope the hon. the Minister will reconsider this in the light of the wonderful work that is being done by Rhodes University. I believe it is essential. Sir, if that is not possible, then perhaps the Department of Agricultural Technical Services could give an assurance that steps will be taken to attract fellowship students and post-graduate researchers to the university under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture. Because I can tell you quite frankly, Mr. Chairman, that the contact between this institute and both the East Coast Agricultural Union of the Cape Province and the Eastern Agricultural Union of the Cape Province as well as between this institute and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is of an excellent nature.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, just before the adjournment of the debate yesterday, when the hon. the Minister was speaking, he used a sentence which made a deep impression on one and caused one to wonder what would happen if the cooperative movement in South Africa were to be removed from the community and if everything were to be left to private initiative.</p>

<p>Sir, before I proceed to deal with this subject in greater detail, I first want to say a few words about the co-operative movement, as it is now developing and as it has been developing in recent times, and I want to refer in particular to one specific aspect of this movement. Sir, I suppose that all of us in South Africa are concerned about the tremendously high food prices. If the producers themselves had been able to control those prices, it is likely that the prices of many of the commodities would not have been so high today. The housewives of South Africa have always been prepared to pull their weight. Our history offers abundant proof that women have always been the driving force, and instead of appealing to other bodies to do the work for them, they have recently established co-operative home industries. These co-operative home industries are chiefly in the hands of housewives who cannot afford to go out to work, but who can nevertheless undertake some baking and sewing at home and who can grow some surplus vegetables in the backyard or in their gardens. This applies to our bigger towns in the rural areas and particularly to the smaller ones. Sir, as a result of the disorderly marketing of fresh fruit and vegetables in the past, one municipal market after another admitted defeat and leased the markets to private initiative, and this resulted in chaos, so much so that the housewives stepped in themselves to establish these co-operative home industries. Sir, last year one of the control boards launched <span class="col_5485-5486" refersTo="page_0433"/>an attack on one of the sectors of the home industries undertaken by the housewives, namely baking. The hon. the Minister kindly intervened on our behalf. This matter has not quite been resolved yet, but the women of South Africa want to thank him for his action. Sir, more than 130 co-operative home industries have already been registered. They render a service; they supply the product of the housewife and of the smaller farmer to a central place, their co-operative and from there they distribute it. In this way the fruit or the article or the labour of the housewife is supplied to the consumer in a fresh condition and at a reasonable price. Sir, just as in the case of other co-operatives, their books are public documents; they are open to inspection for 14 days before every annual meeting and everyone is free to go and see what the profits of these co-operatives are. They do not make big profits, but they now find that they are continually being criticized, and we want to object to this and to ask the hon. the Minister to help us ensure that our housewives, who took the initiative in this matter and whose boards of directors consist mostly of women, are left alone to manage their own affairs. It has recently come to our notice that the control over the slaughtering of poultry has been tightened to such an extent that the ordinary housewives, who for years have been supplying four or five chickens a week from the farms to friends in town, are not allowed to do so any more. They are now allowed to do so only if they have an approved slaughtering place. We now find that there are stubborn people who arbitrarily disallow these slaughtering places. In addition, a registration fee of R5 has to be paid. Sir, we think this is most unreasonable. It may be reasonable for the commercial poultry farmer. The big poultry farmers apparently complained, and when this hygiene or health regulation began to be strictly enforced, we soon found that the ordinary free-range chicken are not appearing on the market any more, because the housewives did not want to break the law. The result was that the price of chickens fed on fishmeal simply went up, as we had indeed expected. Sir, our request is that these housewives should again be allowed, as in the past, to slaughter their own surplus free-range chickens. Sir, this free-range chicken story is a long one. These days one can no longer buy chicks in small numbers. The housewife cannot buy fewer than 25 at a time, and then she is saddled with a surplus she has to dispose of. For this she must pay R5 for a three-year registration fee, and then she is subject to the arbitrary actions of a health inspector who upsets and annoys her and makes her unhappy and dissatisfied. I think this is wrong and I think attention should be given to this matter, in order that these housewives may manage their own affairs. Sir, we have been eating these free-range chickens slaughtered by the housewives for years, and none of us has fallen ill from eating one of those chickens. The only bad chicken I have ever eaten came from a big factory. Sir, I mention this specifically, but I want to come back to organized commerce which is always trying to harm the co-operative movement in our country. Sir, I do not want to pick a quarrel with them; I just want to mention a few facts. In April, organized commerce made certain allegations in an article entitled &#x201C;Unco-ops&#x201D; which appeared in their official organ, Association of Chambers of Commerce. One of the allegations made in this article is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Alarming picture of emergence of an almost complete monopoly of the South African agricultural scene by the co-operatives through the various product control boards.</block>

<p>Then they come to the conclusion that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inflated food prices are the ransom South Africa must pay for a co-operative movement which seeks co-operation with but one link in the food chain.</block>

<p>Then they give a list of prices to substantiate their allegation that organized agriculture is responsible for the increased prices. I shall only give the price increases which occurred from 1950 to 1973. They are as follows, and I shall read them in the form in which they are given here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All consumer prices increased by 119%; all farming requisite prices, 107%; producer prices of field crops, summer crops and winter crops, 58%; producer prices of agricultural products, 71%; producer prices of vegetables, 67%; producer prices of fruit, 68 %; producer prices of slaughter animals, 367%; producer prices of dairy produce, 101%; producer prices of livestock, 142%. Combined producer prices for all the above products, 92%.</block>

<p><span class="col_5487-5488" refersTo="page_0434"/>&#x2020;That was the increase from 1950 to 1973. Then we have the increase in salaries from 1960 to 1973 which are the following: Mine-workers, 207%, factory workers, 237% and public servants, 258%.</p>

<p>*On analysing these figures, we come to the conclusion that the prices of the products handled by the co-operatives, and these are mainly the winter and the summer grain products, which are to a large extent in the hands of the co-operative movement, increased by only 73% in the case of summer crops and 58% in the case of winter crops.

<speech by="#van_der_spuy">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. H. VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, various references were made on both sides of the House yesterday to the fine qualities of red wine and of good mutton and to the excellence of tobacco for human consumption. Sir, I should like to state here that the more red wine one drinks, the worse is one&#x2019;s hangover, the more mutton one eats, the greater is the danger of a coronary, and the more tobacco one consumes, the greater is the danger of a lung complaint.</p>

<p>But I want to come to an industry which promotes fitness, namely the citrus industry. I want to recommend the consumption of citrus products to hon. members and to the general public as well, since we hear a great deal these days about the necessity for greater fitness among our people. In this regard we have the hon. the Minister and the department who are very sympathetically disposed towards this industry in the Republic. This is the industry which is characterized by a constantly increasing production, a production which in many countries and in other parts of the world is being hampered, not only in regard to the area of cultivation, but also in regard to climatic conditions. I may mention here that the main reason for this increase in production is the enthusiastic way in which the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has given its co-operation to the industry in regard to the development of new cultivars and new fertilization programmes, etc., things from which this industry derives positive benefits in many ways. Contrary to the climatic conditions in the United States and in the Mediterranean area, we have conditions enabling a continuous production throughout the Republic of South Africa, so much so that there is increasing production in the regions of the Northern and Eastern Transvaal, as well as in the coastal region of the Eastern Cape, and there was an increase of approximately four million units of 15 kg each over the period from 1970 to 1972.</p>

<p>In the past, the citrus industry had to rely almost exclusively on the export market. For various reasons, however, there has been no appreciable increase in the citrus exports over the past 12 years. On the contrary. Over the past 12 years there has actually been a decrease of 25% in the citrus products intended for the export market. There has been a sharp increase in production, an increase which is forcing the industry to pay greater attention to the domestic marketing of this product. In this regard I should like to mention the zeal with which the Citrus Board is tackling domestic marketing, particularly the efforts which are being made by the manager of the Citrus Board. The manager and his Board are engaged in an excellent and vigorous effort to develop the domestic market. We find the potential of the domestic market reflected in the final report of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture. According to this report, the per capita consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables among our population amounted to only 113 kg in 1969. In the United States, on the other hand, the per capita consumption was 250 kg. I suppose that this low consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables among our people is to be ascribed to an undeveloped taste as well as a low income level. The domestic sales during 1972 amounted to 19% of the total crop, while in 1971 had it accounted for 23% of the total crop. So the increase in the citrus production of the Republic is forcing us to take a fresh look at the domestic market in order to promote a healthy economic vitality in the citrus industry. We must constantly stimulate the domestic consumption. A significant factor in this regard is the growing income of our people in the Republic. We have to cultivate a new appreciation for citrus as a product. It should no longer be regarded as a luxury; it should also be regarded as a health-giving product. We have to give attention to the internal distribution points for this product. In this regard I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that there is a very great lack of distribution points for citrus fruit in the Bantu residential areas. The hon. the Minister, in co-operation with the Department of Bantu Administration, should please take a fresh look at the potential of this field, which holds great possibilities for us, particularly when regard is had to the <span class="col_5489-5490" refersTo="page_0435"/>fact that during 1972, the sale of citrus fruit in Bantu residential areas exceeded that of the previous year by one million pockets. I also want to draw attention to distribution through municipal markets. Certain markets in certain centres of the Republic&#x2014;this is really a provincial matter&#x2014;are supported by the Department of Agriculture. I should like to ask whether the department could not render assistance to markets in more centres in regard to the establishment of better facilities for the distribution of citrus products. The sympathetic approach of the hon. the Minister as well as of the department has been of great benefit to the distribution and marketing of citrus products. Here I am thinking of processing activities which have a great intake of citrus fruit at the moment. In 1972, 35% of the total crop was processed in this manner, while the figure for 1971 had been only 25%. This also applies to the fresh fruit which is supplied to juice factories. I may mention that the consumption of citrus juice in 1972 showed an increase of 53% over that of the previous year. I should like to convey the thanks of this industry to the hon. the Minister and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. We thank them for introducing a better classification of fruit juices. The State has provided, for example, that a drink advertised as a pure citrus drink must contain at least 90% pure citrus juice. We want to thank the hon. the Minister and his department in this regard. With sound guidance and sympathetic co-operation the industry has a great future.</p>

<p>I want to raise a final point. Should attention not be given to the high cost of packing citrus fruit? One grows concerned when one sees the litter and the pollution along our roads. If one goes into the matter, one finds that a lot of that litter consists of discarded packing material. In a report which appeared after a deputation of the Transvaal Agricultural Union had visited Israel, it was mentioned, <i>inter alia,</i> that used packing material was re-used for packing. So this material is used again. I feel that this is a field which should be explored by our people, i.e. the re-use of packing materials for, <i>inter alia,</i> the packing of citrus.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and for the mutton.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to what was said by the hon. member for Newton Park in the debate yesterday when he spoke of the various crises in the world which are posing a threat to us as well. He mentioned three different crises, the inflation crisis, the energy crisis and the food crisis. There is no doubt in my mind that the food crisis of the world is the most important. Accordingly, it is the task of the Department of Agriculture and of our farms in South Africa to resolve that crisis as efficiently as possible. The hon. member for Newton Park also pointed out that at one stage the world only had food supplies available for 27 days. This figure sounds appalling to me, and I think that in the light of this we should all realize the importance of the department and of the hon. the Minister. We know that there are many countries in the world, particularly in Africa, where thousands of people die every year as a result of malnutrition and famine. This forcibly directs our attention to the fact that this is not only a problem for the future, but also one which is of immediate importance. We realize what a magnificent task has been performed by the South African farmer as well, with the assistance of the officials of the Department of Agriculture. We really have to congratulate the farmers of South Africa on the fact that they have not only succeeded over the years in improving their efficiency in this country of ours, which is a difficult one from the agricultural point of view, but that they are still providing us with sufficient food. They have been able to do this, of course, with the assistance of those men in the department who are continually conducting research and disseminating information. The challenges to the department and to the farmer will increase in the years to come. In the light of the anticipated doubling in the population of South Africa over the next 25 years, we shall have to double our food production as well, and there is no hope of obtaining additional land. The hon. the Minister mentioned yesterday that we could expect even more land to be taken up by freeways&#x2014;I think he mentioned a figure of 30 000 ha&#x2014;and that more land would have <span class="col_5491-5492" refersTo="page_0436"/>to be made available for urbanization, towns and other purposes. In other words, we must expect that the area for agricultural purposes will become smaller. There is only one possibility for a slight expansion in the area of agricultural land, and that is the land which at the moment is still being controlled by the hon. the Minister, and specifically by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. That land may be leased to certain farmers to be utilized until it has been allocated for the purposes for which it is really intended.</p>

<p>It is absolutely essential for us to increase the efficiency of our research, of our extension services and of our production as well. We are attempting to do so at the moment, but it is clear that we shall have to redouble our efforts in order to obtain the maximum production from our available land without causing the land to deteriorate. This is very important, for we dare not exploit our natural resources in such a way as to turn them into dwindling assets. I am referring to our natural resources such as land, water and pasture. It is for that reason that I should like us to retain the stock reduction scheme. I think that the stock reduction scheme has served an excellent purpose and in my opinion there will still be a need for it in the future in order to enable pasture in certain parts of our country to recover. The hon. the Minister may not see his way clear to continuing with this scheme as it was applied in the past, but it may become necessary for the Minister, if he has to curtail this scheme, nevertheless to give effect to recommendations made by the soil conservation body for certain areas which have been badly damaged by overgrazing to be subjected to a scheme similar to the present stock reduction scheme. We are opposed to the total withdrawal of stock in all but exceptional circumstances, for there have been farmers in the past who took advantage of that fine concession. We see that there is already a great shortage of red meat in South Africa, and that even greater shortages are anticipated. There is room for improvement in regard to this potential in South Africa. Animals may be selected in order that we may have more rapid growth. This has been done with reasonable success in the past. We could have a higher lamb percentage. In the Northern Cape the generally accepted practice used to be one lamb from every sheep every year. At the moment most farmers expect 1&#x00BD; to 2 lambs a year. In other words, they have three lamb seasons every two years. Some even have four lamb seasons every two years. The calving percentages of cattle could be increased. At the moment only 45% to 50% of the breeding cows are calving, and there is no reason why there should not be an average of 80% for the country as a whole. The high mortality of lambs and calves could also be brought down considerably. In <i>Agricultural News</i> it is mentioned that in the Free State region, 23% of the lambs that are born die before they have been weaned. This means that one out of every five lambs die before they have been weaned. After they have been weaned, a further 3,7% die before they have reached the two-tooth stage. Only 62% of the lambs eventually reach the two-tooth stage. This is a tremendous waste, for approximately 1,8 million lambs die every year. This alarming figure represents approximately 5% of the total sheep population of South Africa. There are many problems in this regard. Farmers who would like to practise better farming methods on their farms, for example by enclosing more fields, are frustrated, in the first place, by short supplies, particularly of fencing material. Wire, particularly galvanized high-tension steel wire, is not available, while heavy cattle gates are nowhere to be obtained. I have inquired at many co-operatives, but these gates are simply not available. Stay-wire is likewise unobtainable. I realize that this is not the specific responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture, but I do want to draw his attention to these facts, to give him an indication of the problems which the farmers have to contend with today. No matter how much the farmer would like to plan his farm by enclosing fields and by practising better farming methods, in many cases and in most districts he cannot do so. Number 8 stay-wire is not available; it can only be obtained in exceptional cases. Likewise, there is a shortage of dicalcium phosphates in bone meal for feeding to animals in the form of licks.

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the hon. member for Benoni, for the first part of his speech fits in like an excellent entr&#x00E9;e with the speech I want to make.</p>

<p>The first duty of a farmer is to ensure a livelihood for himself and his family by means of his farming enterprise. In addition to that the farmer has another important task, i.e. to feed and clothe the people <span class="col_5493-5494" refersTo="page_0437"/>of his country. Next to that he has the important task of providing his country and his government with essential foreign exchange by means of the export of his product. The farmer of South Africa has to perform these tasks now and in the future on agricultural land which is unfortunately becoming less and less every year. It is a fact that the laying out of towns and the provision of roads and other essential services require farmers to give up vast tracks of good agricultural land. In addition to this, the world population is increasing at a breathtaking rate. The world population is growing at a rate of 80 million per year, or approximately 1&#x00BD; million per week. Authoritative sources have it that the number of people living on earth today is equal to a quarter of all the people who have ever lived since man came into being. Apart from the tremendous population growth in Africa, it is a fact that a large part of Africa is already facing famine. At present there are 20 million people in certain African territories who are being threatened by starvation.</p>

<p>South Africa has a population of 22 million at present, of whom 16 million are Blacks. By the year 2000 our total population will be 50 million, of whom 37 million will be Bantu. It is these 37 million Black people who cause me concern. That is why I want to make the statement today, without fear of contradiction, that in future the Bantu farmers in the homelands will to an increasing extent have to contribute their share to the production of essential foodstuffs and agricultural products for South Africa and other African countries. It is true that the Bantu homelands include good agricultural and stock-farming areas. Unfortunately it is also true&#x2014;and I say this without levelling any reproaches&#x2014;that these people are handicapped by certain backlogs, that they do not have the necessary know-how as regards agriculture and stock-farming. This is where the White South African farmer can once again extend, as the White man in South Africa has done so often recently and is still doing, a helping hand to his Black colleague in the Bantu homelands. It is impossible for the Bantu homelands to establish agricultural universities, colleges and schools at a fast rate so as to provide Black farmers with the necessary knowledge of agriculture. I want to suggest that the Department of Agriculture, in co-operation with organized agriculture in South Africa, should select a number, say 1 000&#x2014;it may be more or less&#x2014;of our good farmers all over the Republic of South Africa, and that the Governments of the Bantu homelands should on their part, select Bantu farmers whom they think could undergo agricultural training to good advantage and send them to these 1000 selected White farmers of South Africa to undergo their apprenticeship in the agricultural industry under the guidance of the White farmers. Basically the Bantu farmer of the homelands is an agriculturist and a stock-breeder. He was born and bred in that rural atmosphere. All he requires is that extra bit of knowledge and technique which the selected White farmer can offer him. This will bring along with it the advantage for the Bantu farmer, firstly, that he will acquire the knowledge which is essential for himself and his country; secondly, that he will not need to pay for that knowledge; and thirdly, that he, while gaining that knowledge, will be compensated by the White farmer, who will be prepared to provide him with that education for a consideration. After all, while this prospective Bantu agriculturist is undergoing his training, he will also be rendering service in the form of labour to the White farmer who is training him. Therefore, the White farmer will also profit by this arrangement. I had the privilege of looking at the farming enterprises of our hon. Minister of Agriculture. I want to say that the scope, precision and scientific character of the farming methods and techniques applied by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, will make it possible for 100 or 200 Bantu agriculturists to be trained there annually, people who would then be able to apply that knowledge in their own homelands. In doing so the White farmer would not only be contributing towards expanding the knowledge of his Black fellow-farmer in the homelands as far as agriculture and stock-farming are concerned, but would also be making a major contribution towards creating and promoting good relations between people, between White and non-White, between peoples, here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the first three months of this year 50 inches of rain fell at Kuruman. This means that within three months we had a rainfall equivalent to the amount which normally falls in three years, with the result that vast areas of the Northern Cape were flooded at that stage and are still flooded at present. <span class="col_5495-5496" refersTo="page_0438"/>We who live in the Northern Cape will never complain about having too much rain. We are grateful for the good rains that fell, for this greatly added to the subterranean water in our area. Fountains are running swiftly and water is gushing out of boreholes. We are grateful for this water. These goods rains have caused vast tracts of land to be under water. Up to 900 morgen of some farms were under water. In some cases two-thirds of peoples&#x2019; farms were under water. Pests and diseases also made their appearance in our part of the world. That is something we have not known before. In the first place, I want to extend my sincere thanks to the hon. the Minister, the hon. the Deputy Minister and Dr. Verbeek, the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services, for the fact that they rushed to our aid when our people had to cope with an emergency. I just want to mention that in the vicinity of Campbell more than 20 000 fully grown sheep and 6 000 lambs died because of these diseases during this period. When we approached our Ministers and the department for assistance, they immediately turned their attention to the matter. Drs. Pienaar and Slabbert, directors of the Free State region, immediately paid our area a visit to come and inspect the position. They also helped us a great deal. We want to express our sincere thanks to the hon. the Minister and his department for this assistance. The pests and diseases which broke out there were to a large extent carried by mosquitoes. Now that summer has arrived in that area, this plague holds great dangers for us. Through the mediation of Drs. Pienaar and Slabbert, Onderstepoort also conducted an investigation into this danger, and we are grateful that their research work, aimed at combating this plague effectively, is fairly far advanced already. We are very grateful for this effective and speedy help which the department offered the people in that area.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to touch upon, and that is the question of the existence of uneconomic agricultural units in our agricultural industry. In the Northern Cape, as a result of the uneconomic sub-division of agricultural land which took place over a number of generations, many uneconomic units were created. Although there are many complaints in this regard. I should like to express my thanks today to the Agricultural Credit Board, under the chairmanship of Mr. Jan Retief and Mr. Olivier, for the sympathetic way in which they enable people who own uneconomic units to acquire additional land. I want, to thank them for the way in which they have been treating these people and helping them to obtain economic units. However, it is not always possible to help all the farmers owning uneconomic units in this way. I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister for State-owned land to be used in future for placing uneconomic units on an economic footing. Not all districts in South Africa are as fortunate as we are in the Kuruman constituency, where vast tracts of State-owned land will be made available in the near future as a result of the removal of Black spots and the consolidation plans which will be implemented. I know it is the policy of the department to apply this land in some instances for the purpose of extending uneconomic units, but I want to ask the hon. the Minister to regard this as an absolute priority. I want to mention an example, i.e. the case of the farm Vlakfontein which consisted of approximately 5 000 morgen. This farm was surrounded by seven uneconomic units. The owners of these uneconomic units were young farmers who had been struggling on these uneconomic units for many years. Instead of dividing this farm of 5 000 morgen between two farmers new to this area and so leaving these seven farmers to struggle along on their uneconomic units, the department divided up that farm among five of those struggling farmers. Today all these farmers are happy and making a prosperous living on economic units in that area. However, at Groenwater and Skeifontein the department apparently did not apply this principle. I want to ask the Minister that when the Gathlose-Maremane Reserve is placed at the disposal of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and consideration is given to making it available to the farmers&#x2014;i.e. the land which is placed at the department&#x2019;s disposal as a result of consolidation, and will possibly be allocated to farmers&#x2014;he will consider using this land exclusively for the purpose of placing uneconomic units on an economic footing. He may do this by allowing adjoining units or units situated close to one another to extend their areas. In a case where another uneconomic unit is perhaps situated 100 miles from that place and where the neighbour also has an uneconomic unit, the one farmer could sell his unit to the other and in doing so create an economic unit. Sir, <span class="col_5497-5498" refersTo="page_0439"/>if the State-owned land which is going to become available in the Northern Cape could be applied in this way by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, I believe it will be possible for us to succeed in eliminating the vast majority of uneconomic units in the Northern Cape and then to settle farmers there who will be able to make a happy and prosperous living on a unit which is large enough.</p>

Sir, we spend a good deal of time in this House talking about Africans in the homelands, as the hon. member for Meyerton did this afternoon, and we spend a good deal of our time in this House talking about Africans in urban areas, but hardly a word is ever said about the 3 million Black people who are living and working on the White farms of South Africa.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge there has not been an in-depth inquiry into the conditions of farm labour in South Africa since 1939, and that was when the Native Farm Labour Commission, the so called Herbst Commission, reported. Sir, since then, in the ensuing 35 years, vast changes have taken place in the countryside. Apart from changes in farming techniques with mechanization, we have had an enormous emigration of Whites off the land. Today something like 85% of the White population of South Africa is in the urban areas. I must say, Sir, that I, like the hon. member for Rondebosch, am not reduced to floods of tears at the thought of this depopulation of the platteland. I think it has been to the great economic good of South Africa. Indeed the Du Plessis Commission recommends that assistance be given to enable more uneconomic farmers to leave the land than have already done so. Sir, what is in fact the position of Black labour on the farms today? I maintain that we badly need a new inquiry. As far as can be ascertained from the agricultural censuses and from the report of the Du Plessis Commission&#x2014;the latest figures that they use are the 1968-&#x2019;69 figures&#x2014;it is true that wages have risen since 1960; it is also true that there have been improvements in the conditions on the farms, for instance as far as the provision of education is concerned. There has been a big improvement there. Many farmers are providing farm schools and something like 0,3 million Black children are today in these farms schools. I also say at once that many farmers pay good wages, but for various reasons wages on the average remain low throughout South Africa, and the reasons are as follows: First of all, there are still too many marginal farmers on the land and wages naturally come down to the level they can afford. Secondly, agricultural labour is excluded from the operation of the Wage Act and the Industrial Conciliation Act and, of course, there are all the restrictions on mobility, and these factors all tend to depress wages. Then, Sir, there is the attitude of &#x201C;once a farm labourer always a farm labourer&#x201D;, which was expressed by a former Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. Sir, these words were said by the hon. Deputy Minister Koornhof when he was Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. Even more recently, the Regional Director of the Cape Midlands Bantu Administration Board said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the law stands, a Black person born in a rural community remains classified as a farm labourer for the rest of his days, regardless of whether he has matric or even a higher educational qualification.</block>

<p>Sir. I am quoting the Head of a Bantu Administration Board. Now, as the result of all these factors, together with another factor which is I am glad to say declining, namely the use of cheap convict labour, there is no doubt that the average wage levels throughout South Africa on the farms are very low indeed, and the hon. the Minister has admitted it. I might say <span class="col_5499-5500" refersTo="page_0440"/>that agricultural congresses throughout the country have been attempting to persuade farmers to increase wages. The national average wage for the regular worker works out, according to the agricultural census&#x2014;and those, as I say, are old figures but it is not my fault that there are not any more recent figures&#x2014;to R135 per annum in cash and kind, and of that 30% must be reckoned as wages in kind. It works out roughly at a cash wage of R7-50 a month.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have no time. [Interjections.] Now, reports in newspapers reveal a depressing state of affairs on farms throughout South Africa. What interests me is the attitude of the hon. the Minister. I believe he is taking a very <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude, judging by a statement he made in an interview in Natal when he arrived for the Agricultural Union Congress in October last year. He said that the Government had no intention at this stage of instigating a nation-wide investigation into farm labourers&#x2019; work and wage conditions or of taking steps to force up wages. He said he wanted to see what the farmers&#x2019; congresses feel about this position, and then he said that there was no country in the world where a Government laid down what farmers had to pay unskilled labourers. Well, I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that farmers&#x2019; congresses have made their feelings heard. The Natal Agricultural Union has already proposed dramatic increases of up to 25% in wages in Natal, together with other improvements in regard to housing, leave pay, increased rations, etc. The Stellenbosch Farmers&#x2019; Association called for workers to be paid R3 a day in cash and kind. The Boland farmers have called for higher wages, and the S.A. Agricultural Union recently stated that its policy was for farmers to employ a hard core of well-paid, well-fed and well-housed workers who live on the farms with their families, such a hard core of workers to be supplemented by organized teams of seasonal workers. Why does not the hon. the Minister help the agricultural unions to implement these desirable aims? The unions themselves have no way of enforcing them. He is incorrect in saying that no country in the world has a Government which forces farmers to pay unskilled labourers a minimum wage. He is quite wrong. Canada has a minimum wage laid down which is applicable to farmers, and so indeed has Australia, and I am pretty sure also the U.K. and the United States of America.</p>

<p>Of course it is compulsory. It is a national minimum wage. But in any case in our country there are restrictions on the mobility of farm labour which do not apply to these other countries, and therefore the ordinary law of supply and demand operates in the other countries. In other countries there are opportunities for farm workers to get together and form unions. I say that the Minister is abdicating his responsibilities in this regard. I believe that he should abandon his <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude and show a little &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D; in this regard. Sir, the lives of over 3 million Black people and of many hundreds of thousands of Coloured agricultural labourers depend on him. If he could do something to improve the conditions of Black workers working on the White farms, and of Coloured labourers on the White farms, he would be helping not only these people, but he would be assisting the problem in the urban areas, because by improving conditions in the rural areas he will be doing something to stem the migration of these people into the urban areas, which is one of the main causes, as far as Coloured workers are concerned, of the chaotic housing conditions which have arisen in the Western Cape. The hon. the Minister must do something, I maintain, to implement the proposals that have been made by the agricultural unions, proposals which, with all the goodwill in the world, they are unable to insist that the farmers carry out. I think we desperately need a new in-depth inquiry into the conditions of farm workers in South Africa, because as I have said, it is something like 35 years since we have had such an inquiry.

<p>His hon. party is now trying to make a contribution. I should very much like to tell the hon. member for Houghton that I can reproach her with certain things. For example, she must stop talking about the salaries of the Bantu workers on South African farms. She should rather go to the Union Hotel and have a look at the wages of the Bantu who work for her there. So we can sling back at her all the reproaches she levelled here today. Surely it is not true that we as agriculturists do not pay any attention to the position of our Bantu workers. At this very moment the South African Agricultural Union is conducting a study, and this study does not simply cover salary adjustments. The hon. member referred to the Du Plessis Commission. Has the hon. member ever taken the trouble to consult what a lady called Merle Lipton&#x2014;I do not know whether she is Mrs. or Miss&#x2014;had to say? She is associated with the Royal Institute of International Affairs and has just concluded an investigation in South Africa. This lady said &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know that little book just as well as the hon. member does. This lady said that the position of the farm-workers in South Africa had undergone a radical change since 1961. In fact, from 1961 to 1968-&#x2019;69 their wages showed a real growth rate of 24 per cent. This hon. member should also remember that when we speak about the salaries of Bantu workers on farms we should be very careful. We should take cognizance of the fact that the Du Plessis Commission and the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture found that 40 per cent of the farmers in South Africa produced only 3&#x00BD; per cent of the total agricultural production. We should also bear in mind, when we speak about the salaries of Bantu on farms, that over the years the agricultural industry has become the school for training Bantu workers who eventually go to the factories and the cities. I am speaking as a person who is a farmer himself and I invite the hon. member to come and have a look at what is being done for the Bantu workers in the Western Transvaal. The farmer probably does more than any employer in South Africa as far as in-service training is concerned. I know of no other sector in the country&#x2019;s economy which has an in-service training programme to which that of the farmer of South Africa has to take a back seat. Eighty thousand farmers in South Africa employ 1 million Bantu workers which make them the people who train these 1 million Bantu workers.</p>

<p>I am pleased the hon. member at least had one good word for the farmers. She referred to the educational facilities provided by the farmers on our farms. What is the position at present? The hon. member stopped short at 1968. From 1968 up to the present time that party has been sleeping soundly as far as the Bantu on the farms are concerned. Now all at once they are opening their eyes to have a look at the situation. The hon. member must tell us today whether she is prepared to act tactlessly and unscientifically, as did the people who had the programme &#x201C;Monitor&#x201D; over the radio. She must tell us, if she wants us to make salary adjustments in respect of our Bantu workers on our farms, what the effect will be on the production costs of food for the people of this country. In the past year we had the position that on an investment of R10 million 80 000 farmers had a net income of R800 million, of which R250 million constituted labour costs. Does the hon. member want us to double the labour costs? For the information of the hon. member I want to mention the salary position of our Bantu labourers on our farms in South Africa. My figures will not be the 1968 figures, but the figures as they were at the beginning of the year. I want to speak about my own part of the world, i.e. the Western Transvaal. The position there is that the cash salary of the Bantu labourer is R32 per month on the average. One should also have regard to the housing which is provided as well as the medical services the farmer provides for his Bantu workers. We should also take into consideration that they receive firewood, in addition to other facilities which are made available to them. If one takes this salary plus the other privileges which are provided in kind, we find that the Bantu on our farms is compensated for his services to a far better extent than any Bantu who lives in Soweto or in any of the urban areas. That is a fact. The hon. member herself can go and inquire from the Bantu in that area and that is what she will find. If the hon. member had made a <span class="col_5503-5504" refersTo="page_0442"/>contribution such as the hon. member for Newton Park made yesterday in connection with housing for the Bantu on our farms, for example, I would have agreed with her. I do not want to repeat what the hon. member for Newton Park said, but I should like to say that the agriculturist in South Africa has carried the burden on his own for long enough, the burden of providing basic commodities to almost half of the Bantu population living in White South Africa. It is time the Treasury or the general taxpayer helped us in respect of housing for Bantu on farms. We cannot evade the problem any longer. It is not for 80 000 White farmers in the country to find a solution to this problem on their own. Just as the farmer who pays taxes had to help establish housing schemes in the urban areas, so too the general taxpayer must help the farmer provide proper housing on the farm. The White farmers are doing a great deal today to rectify the matter, but the need is tremendous. The hon. member&#x2019;s figure of 1 million economically active Bantu on the farms is correct. The survey we made at the beginning of the year indicates that we need at least half a million dwelling units on our farms. I should like to associate myself with what the hon. member for Newton Park said; in fact I want to go further by saying that the incentive measures needed to make the housing available, should go a step further in terms of the National Party&#x2019;s policy. There are thousands of farmers who farm in areas situated between 15 and 20 miles away from Bantu homelands. There should be a special measure which will serve as an incentive to those farmers to provide housing for their Bantu within the homelands. I am not talking at random; I am giving hard facts and I can furnish hon. members with concrete examples. If I may be quite so vain, I want to say that I am one of the farmers who implement the policy of erecting houses for my Bantu workers within the homelands. I transport them on a daily or weekly basis from the homelands to their places of employment. I centive measures of this kind should be taken for our White farmers, for we have the situation that we should encourage the White farmer to invest in housing for his labourers in the homelands just as our businessmen are being encouraged to invest in some industry in the homelands. For that purpose, however, there should be some incentive measure or some guarantee so that he may have security for any investment he makes in the Bantu homeland. The farmer of South Africa has always done his fair share as far as his Bantu are concerned. Let us now speak plainly and in the terms of the farming community; when I as a farmer am working with a non-White youth (&#x201C;klong&#x201D;) a non-White farm-hand (&#x201C;jong&#x201D;), not a single discriminatory connotation attaches to any word we may address each other. In that situation we address each other in 6a specific relationship, in an extremely close relationship, for we are sharing in the weal and woe of the farm. Things could be as I myself have experienced them this year. When I concluded my contract of service and entered into a new contract of service and thanked my farmhands for the work they had done, one of them stood up and said, &#x201C;Hendrik&#x201D;, for he has never in his life called me master (&#x201C;baas&#x201D;) as he has known me since childhood, &#x201C;you have thanked us now, but your are wrong; you should first have thanked the mudimo for the rain he gave.&#x201D; That sort of relation which is cultivated on our farms between farmers and Black workers, is one of the most praiseworthy there could be in human relations in South Africa. Far be it from us to act in the way the hon. member did in connection with the relation on the farm between the Bantu employees and the employers. She came along today and gave us the type of information she did without her having any knowledge of the true situation. [Time expired.]</p>

We are keen to see the gap between White and Black wages narrowed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton, however, has an absolute phobia about agricultural wages. She likes to appear as the champion of the Black agricultural worker. I should like to say to her that as recently as last year the agricultural economics department of Rhodes University, which is by no means a conservative university, produced a survey <span class="col_5505-5506" refersTo="page_0443"/>on working conditions for African workers on farms. The overall result of that survey was that their working conditions, when all the fringe benefits such as housing, rations, etc. are taken into account, do not compare unfavourably with those of urban workers. I do not believe that a minimum wage is the answer. If a minimum wage is raised, whether in agriculture or industry, it is invariably accompanied by unemployment.</p>

<p>In the short time available to me I want to raise two matters which fall under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. The first is the Groot Constantia Wine Farm. I would like to say that this operation, which falls within the boundaries of my constituency, is one that does great credit to the department. Not only are the products produced by this farm of very high quality and in great demand, but the farm itself is a showpiece for visitors. I think it has all the appearances of being a model operation. However, I raise the question of Groot Constantia Farm in a different context. The hon. the Minister may be aware that there was recently a court case in regard to sub-division of a property adjoining the Groot Constantia Farm. This sub-division had been granted by the Divisional Council and approved by the Provincial Council with the idea of allowing the development of cluster housing on this adjacent land. The court stopped that development and I believe it is a very good thing that it was stopped. Had that development been proceeded with, it would have opened the way for high-density housing schemes in an area of Constantia which, bordering on the Groot Constantia Farm, has traditionally been a farming area. It is a beautiful rural area which I believe should be kept that way. More particularly, had this development gone ahead, it could well have adversely affected the environments of at least five historical Cape homesteads. I refer to Groot Constantia, Hope of Constantia, Nova Constantia, Klein Constantia and Buitenverwachting. Why I raise the matter under this Vote is because I believe that the Department of Agriculture, as well as producing good wine on the Groot Constantia Farm, has a part to play through that farm in preserving the traditional farming nature of the historical triangle which contains these five Old Cape Homesteads, of which Groot Constantia is the focal point. I am not to any extent a believer in the extension of State activity, far from it, but I do believe in the preservation of historical beauty and culture and, particularly, of tradition. I believe that there are occasions when non-economic considerations must override economic considerations in the public interest. Left as it is at present the historical triangle of Constantia will inevitably become developed away from a farming and rural character towards residential and urban complexes. I would like the hon. the Minister to give very careful consideration to the possibility of the Groot Constantia Wine Farm being expanded in area to take in some of the neighbouring farming lands, particularly those that were affected by this proposed cluster development on Hope of Constantia; if he were to do that I think he would be fulfilling two objectives. Firstly, he would be expanding a very worth-while farming project, viz. the Groot Constantia Wine Farm which produces an excellent product which is in high demand. Secondly, he would be protecting the environment of the historical triangle in Constantia.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to raise relates to the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. Along with thousands of citizens of the Cape Peninsula and thousands of citizens of South Africa from other parts of the country as well as, I believe, thousands of people from outside the country, I am deeply concerned at the potential damage which could be done to Kirstenbosch if the six-lane freeway, which the Municipality of Cape Town has agreed to construct, goes ahead. I believe that the hon. the Minister must be concerned about this himself, because a large part of the funds for the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens comes under his Vote. The lion&#x2019;s share of what is included in his Vote under &#x201C;Botanical Gardens&#x201D; goes to Kirstenbosch. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, when I raised this question two and a half years ago, did give me an undertaking that he would watch the position and that he would use his influence to see that damage to Kirstenbosch was not done, but I believe that as at present designed this road which has been designed by engineers and not by botanists, will do damage to Kirstenbosch. It will constitute a noise hazard because the topography of the ground is such that it is a natural megaphone and will amplify noise. The director of Kirstenbosch tells me that there will be a fume hazard to the plants. The way this highway is designed <span class="col_5507-5508" refersTo="page_0444"/>to run along the perimeter of Kirstenbosch, it will undoubtedly spoil some of the best ground on the property for nursery purposes. It is north-facing ground that will be spoilt and it is north-facing ground that is needed for this purpose. Kirstenbosch is one of the great national botanical gardens of the world, and it is regarded as such throughout the world, it is not only one of the greatest, but it is also one of the most beautiful. It is the fount of much of the flora of South Africa; it is an absolutely irreplaceable heritage of our country, and I do appeal to the hon. the Minister under no circumstances to allow it to be damaged by road construction. There are other ways in which that road can be built. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I beg the pardon of the hon. member for Constantia for not following him in his arguments. On the face of it the hon. member raised a matter which is of importance to his constituency, and I am sure the hon. the Minister will deal with it.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to say a few words about what is probably one of the most sensitive industries in the South African agricultural structure, i.e. the wheat industry. I say it is one of the most sensitive industries because when one looks at the price of wheat on the world markets over the past season, one finds that the price fluctuated between R44 and approximately R200 per metric ton. Moreover this industry is influenced by the fact that crop failures in South Africa are frequently accompanied by wheat shortages throughout the world, which can then have the effect that in lean times South Africa will have to purchase wheat at prices which can rise up to R200 per metric ton. On the other hand, it has also often happened in the past that when we in South Africa have had record wheat harvests, a large harvest is also reaped throughout the world and we then not only struggle to sell our wheat, but are also compelled to sell at prices which are as low as R44 per metric ton&#x2014;exactly half of what is paid today.</p>

<p>In his speech yesterday the hon. member for Newton Park referred to a statement the Minister made at the congress of the S.A. Agricultural Union in Bloemfontein, in which he told the farmers that he could not give the assurance that it would always be possible to produce wheat and maize on a profitable basis. In his speech the hon. member for Newton Park intimated that he suspected that the Minister had made that statement on the grounds of rapidly rising production costs. Rising production costs are a problem for us in this industry too. I think the reason why the hon. Minister cannot give a guarantee in respect of the profitable marketing of wheat and maize, is the fluctuation of prices on the world market from R44&#x2014;half of what we obtain in South Africa&#x2014;to R200 per metric ton&#x2014;more than double the price paid in South Africa today.</p>

<p>A second aspect which complicates this industry, is the different regions which have entered the wheat industry, i.e. the traditional winter rainfall region as well as regions in the summer rainfall area, regions therefore with vastly different production costs and risk factors. A third factor which complicates this industry, is the rise in production costs over the past few years as a result of the tremendous increase in the cost of machinery. Now, this is one of the industries which cannot do without mechanical equipment. Another factor which complicates this industry, is the fact that, in determining the price of wheat, we cannot lose sight of the fact that South Africa makes cheap bread available to the population. I shall come back to this aspect later on.</p>

<p>When one regards these factors against the background of the tremendous problems one has to cope with, such as droughts, hail, late cold spells and frost&#x2014;one comes to the conclusion that the decision the hon. the Minister made in respect of determining the price of wheat for this season, is the most correct and effective decision. For that reason we want to say thank you to the Minister for the insight he displayed in this regard. It is a fact that, if a wrong decision should be taken at this stage, it could mean that the planting of wheat in certain parts could increase at the expense of other products, such as maize or meat. A wrong decision could, however, result in farmers withdrawing from the cultivation of wheat in various regions. Because the Minister has noticed this balance, we want to thank him for the price we are going to obtain for our products this year. For many years the wheat industry developed at a slow rate. Only at the end of the &#x2019;fifties did the department undertake extensive tests for the cultivation of better cultivars and varieties. We also want to extend our special thanks to the department <span class="col_5509-5510" refersTo="page_0445"/>for the varieties which have already come into being and, along with that, ask that no costs, no time and no labour should be spared to make the cultivars available in the future which will further decrease the risk factor involved in this industry. Once we have taken note of the restricting factors in this industry, we notice that there are various ways in which the problems of this industry can be solved. A change over from wheat to other products or commodities may take place in any of the regions if the price is not correctly adjusted. We must, however, sound a note of warning and ask people to guard against a spirit which has increasingly reared its head recently, i.e. a spirit of antagonism between the producers of wheat in the winter rainfall region and the producers of the same product in the summer rainfall region. We who live in the summer rainfall region will immediately concede that as far as the quality of wheat is concerned, we cannot compete with the Boland since they harvest their wheat under optimal conditions during the dry summer months. For the sake of the wheat farmers of the Boland, we want to ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to widening the gap between the price of the super-grade and grade 1, and that we should regard the winter rainfall region as the producer of the super grade wheat. On the other hand, we are also requesting that in considering the other grades, especially grades 1 and 2, attention will be paid to the risk the farmer in the summer rainfall region experiences at harvest time. This short period we have in which to harvest, and that in a rainfall season, results in the situation that one shower of rain can cause the quality of one&#x2019;s grain to drop by two grades. This also brings about that every farmer in the interior today is virtually compelled to erect his own drying installation on his farm. We hope that in the future the hon. the Minister will bear these factors in mind when it comes to price determination.</p>

<p>If the greater productivity we are aiming at in this industry is not applied in a balanced way, it can result in our experiencing a greater problem in the future in connection with soil-borne and fungal diseases. We also want to ask the department to determine whether a suitable crop may not, in the summer rainfall region, be integrated productively and economically into our wheat industry on a basis of crop rotation.</p>

<p>One of the most important restricting factors on which I just want to dwell briefly, is the question of the price of bread. This means that when fixing the price of wheat, one&#x2019;s thoughts cannot be detached from bread. Yesterday reference was made to subsidies for the consumer or the producer, or general subsidies. The hon. the Minister also referred to an amount of approximately R86 million which will be employed this year to ensure that the price of bread remains at the same level, in spite of the higher wheat price for the producer. When one makes a few calculations, one finds that the subsidy on bread amounts to approximately R&#x00BC; million per day. One wonders if this measure of subsidization in respect of bread has not resulted in this very important foodstuff in South Africa being treated with disdain and even wasted. The social division of a university in the Eastern Cape&#x2014;I am not sure whether it is the University of Port Elizabeth or Rhodes University&#x2014;instituted an investigation and found that in respect of our Whites, 14% of each loaf of bread is lost or wasted and, in respect of our Bantu&#x2014;this is extremely high&#x2014;approximately 11% of each loaf of bread is lost or wasted. When we consider these figures, I think one can say it is not only a disgrace, but also a sin that we treat this product in this way. Sir, I now want to quote a few figures to you to indicate the we in South Africa not only produce a cheap foodstuff&#x2014;it is the farmer&#x2019;s privilege to make this bread available to the consumer public&#x2014;but that there are also other products which may serve the same purpose. Sir, let us consider a product which is more or less the same as wheat, i.e. rice, and analyse its calorie value. The new term for this is &#x201C;kilojoles&#x201D;; I think this is the first time the word is being used in this House. If we make a comparison between the calorie value of rice, white bread and whole-wheat bread, we find that in order to obtain the same number of calories or carbohydrates from rice as may be obtained from one loaf of bread, one would have to buy rice at a cost of R1-21. On the other hand, the same quantity of carbohydrates or calories may be obtained from maize or potatoes at a price of 7 cents and 5 cents, respectively. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, no one will quarrel with the hon. member for Bethlehem in the case that he has made out for the wheat farmer <span class="col_5511-5512" refersTo="page_0446"/>zation of bread. Sir, to me it is a great privilege today to take part in this debate when we have a Minister of Agriculture who is in truth a farmer&#x2019;s farmer. In the same way as the previous Minister of Railways was a railwayman, so our present Minister of Agriculture is a round peg in a round hole. He has a deep grasp of every subject which has to do with agriculture and of the various agricultural sciences in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to pass from the topic of com and bread to a related subject very close to the heart of man, namely wine, and I return to the subject of Groot Constantia as a wine farm. A previous speaker, the hon. member for Constantia indicated that he would like to see this wine farm restored possibly to the 900-morgen size that it was originally in the early days when Simon van der Stel was Governor of the Cape and when this farm came into his hands. Sir, provision is made in this Vote that we are dealing with for R46 000 for the maintenance and support of Groot Constantia as a show farm, not necessarily a technical wine farm. It falls under ture and the Research Institute. In 1972 the sales of wine at this wonderful exhibition wine farm realized R64 923; the stock of wine on hand then was 3 014 hectolitres, and the profit made was R31 431, with an accumulated profit then of R104 988. Sir, wine, as long as there has been a Cape, has always been part of the living pattern of the Cape, and it was a fortunate day when Jan van Riebeeck, the first founder of the Dutch settlement at the Cape, could record in his diary on 2 February 1659&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today, praised be the Lord, wine was made for the first time from Cape grapes.</block>

<p>Sir, Jan van Riebeeck was in good company, because the writer of the book of <i>Ecclesiastes</i> enjoined&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eat bread with joy, and drink wine with a merry heart.</block>

<p>In fact, Sir, the natural joy of natural wine has been part of Man&#x2019;s normal experience from times beyond human memory. Sir, Groot Constantia, which is perhaps the most gracious home that we have in the Cape, is a home of which we can be truly proud. It was written by Barrie Biermann of Groot Constantia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Groot Constantia troon oor die Constantia-vallei. Sy wingerde en lanings betrek die onmeetlike ruimte in die berekende vakke wat sy wit ringmure omlyn. Die helling van sy ho&#x00EB; swart dak herroep die helling van Constantia-berg en sy gekalkte gewels verkondig die trotse boodskap aan Afrika dat: &#x2019;n Magtige skoonheid kom oor jou soos die ha&#x00EB;lwit somerwolk wat uitbloei oor jou donker berge.</block>

<p>This indicates the intimacy and the spirit which pervades Groot Constantia as a monument and as a wine farm. In Simon van der Stel, its first owner, in 1692, who created this farm, we again have a monument. The spirit of Simon van der Stel pervades every corner of the building and of the land, but it was not in fact Simon van der Stel who gave greatness as a wine farm to Groot Constantia. It was in fact Hendrik Cloete, who in 1778 became the owner, and in 1791 re-built the farm, which was then crumbling, as a building. He used the expertise and the inspiration of Anton Anreith for the restoration of the pediment and of course of Thibault, who was the designer of the over-all complex. It was Hendrik Cloete who could write about his wines as follows: &#x201C;My plante is die konings van Pruise, die tsaars van Rusland&#x201D;. And of Napoleon, when he was exiled at St. Helena, it was said that he consoled himself with a glass of sweet Constantia wine. Today this wine farm, under the control of the department, has become a show farm, and it no longer produces sweet wines. It does in fact produce wine which should be known to hon. members of this House and to the South African public. More specifically, the following varieties of wines are sold on the estate, namely Pinotage, a ruby-coloured red wine, Shiraz, a very lively, fruity, well-coloured red wine with a typically schiraz character, Cabernet, a deeply red-coloured exceptionally fruity and well-balanced medium-bodied varietal wine, and of course the white wine Steen, a light-bodied, well-balanced, very fruity and slightly semi-sweet white wine.</p>

<p>Now, having whetted the appetites of those present, I come to the substance of my comments today, namely a constructive criticism of the way in which these wines are distributed. It is one of the few instances where the Government is in direct competition with private enterprise. I have no complaints on this occasion, but over <span class="col_5513-5514" refersTo="page_0447"/>the years it has become customary for these wines to be made available to members of the public in case lots on Wednesdays, the sale commencing at 10.30 a.m. and going on to 12.45 p.m., re-starting at 2 p.m. and closing at 3.30 p.m. Now, because of the fact that these wines have acquired international reputation and because of the tourists who visit Groot Constantia, they are known throughout the world, and because, too, of the fact that we are all experiencing a tragic scarcity of the noble red wines at the moment throughout the Western Cape and throughout the South African market, there has been such a clamour for the products of Groot Constantia that unfortunately confusion has set in in the minds of those people who endeavour to purchase these wines. It would appear from public comment that today you can go to Groot Constantia at 7 a.m. on a Wednesday morning and you will be joined by the locals and by people from as far as Paarl and Stellenbosch and all over the Western Province, and by their gardeners, and there is one colossal queue which stretches for several hundred yards, and from 7 a.m. you will stand in the summer sun in the boiling heat until your turn at last comes and you have the privilege of buying one case of white wine and two cases of red wine. Only 100 cases are sold of each variety each day. The procedure in selling is archaic and outmoded. A very worthy gentleman writes three or four copies of invoices in longhand, and you are held up in the queue unnecessarily. I make the submission as a constructive one that it is invaluable that these wines should be sold as products of the Cape and of Groot Constantia, but if we are to make the most of our public relations, they could well be sold throughout every day of the week during the early part of summer when we have our high Cape season and when the Cape is at its tourist best and the biggest number of tourists visit the farm. I submit also that not only should this be done, but that these wines should not be sold in case lots. People should be allowed to buy bottle lots, and we should introduce half bottles, so that people coming off airplanes or going off on ships could buy half a bottle of each variety. Further, we should encourage what they have in Basle and other parts of Europe where they have the wine festivals, and tourists on the spot should be allowed to indulge in winetasting at a small fee of 25 cents or 40 cents, which could possibly go to charity. If they have cheese and wine on the spot they could enjoy the flavour of the wine and go away as addicts to South African wines.</p>

<p>My final complaint is that between last year and this year, notwithstanding the profit which this farm has made, the prices of our lovely Constantia wines have been doubled, a 100% contribution to the increase in the cost of living and inflation. This should, surely, be a case for the Price Controller. I can see no other recourse. I would appeal to the hon. the Minister, whom I know is a wine lover himself, to have mercy on those people in the Cape who cannot get all the wines they want. He ought to consider whether this price is indeed a fair one. For the rest I should like to compliment those people who run the institution and those who work there. Groot Constantia can well be said to be the pride of South Africa and pride of the valley of the vines.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens must pardon me if I do not react to what he said. Unfortunately I do not know a great deal about wine. All I know is that it tastes good. I assume the hon. the Minister will deal with his particular problems later on.</p>

<p>I attach great value to the matters the hon. member for Bethlehem raised here. I should also like to raise a few points in connection with the production of wheat. In spite of the great heights which agriculture in South Africa has achieved so many times over, this is not an industry which can rest on its laurels. We should realize that the demands that are going to be made on agriculture in the years ahead will become increasingly severe for obvious reasons, such as the increase in population and the buying power of this very large population which is increasing so rapidly. These feats were achieved in spite of the fact that in 1936, 176 000 farmers were actively engaged in farming as against only 80 000 according to the latest figures of today. The dramatic change which has taken place in the United States of America over the past years in respect of its agricultural situation, should serve as a serious warning to us. For a number of decades this rich agricultural country has had to contend with problems of tremendous surpluses, surpluses which have now disappeared within the short space of a few years. What can happen in the U.S.A., with its vast agricultural <span class="col_5515-5516" refersTo="page_0448"/>resources, can surely happen just as easily in any other country, especially where the natural conditions do not favour agricultural production. I believe that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is fully aware of the tremendous task resting on the shoulders of the South African farmer in respect of the production of food and essential raw materials. All the research and extension measures of the department are geared to assisting the farmer in the particularly unenviable task he often has to perform in difficult circumstances. I personally am very grateful for that. I also want to express my sincere thanks to the Minister for the increase in the price of wheat. In my opinion it was really necessary. I also want to express my sincere thanks for the way in which his department conducts research and provides extension services in connection with wheat-growing in South Africa. That is why it has not been necessary in the past seven years to import wheat, and it has even been possible for South Africa to export wheat. For the first time in history wheat was exported on a fairly large scale during the 1972-73 season. The quantity of wheat available for export during the 1973-&#x2019;74 season, after provision had been made for domestic consumption as well as a transfer equal to the milling needs for four months, amounted to 506 000 tons. Of this amount 426 000 tons have been exported up to the present. During the past 12 months production costs have risen tremendously. This justifies the increase in the price of wheat. I should like to mention a few examples for the period between September 1973 and September 1974. The price of diesel rose by 67,23%, power paraffin by 66,9% ordinary petrol by 42,8 %, tractors by 18,7% to 26,8%, combines by 21,2%, implements by 25,2%, bulk trailers by 26,6%, weed killers by 80%, fertilizer by 8,5%, Bantu wages by 20% to 25%, not to mention the rise in the costs of spare parts and repairs. I think these figures suffice to prove that the price of wheat had to be raised.</p>

<p>I also want to bring another matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister, which is that a great need exists for more funds for the purpose of erecting grain silos. I have great appreciation for what has already been done in this sphere in the past few years, but this cannot be regarded as being sufficient.</p>

<p>In the first place, most of the grain silos are full as a result of the large maize harvest. Problems are expected as far as a good wheat harvest is concerned. Hon. members know that nowadays the farmers are geared to the bulk handling of grain. When our grain silos are full, the farmers have to change back to handling it in bags, which presents many problems and involves tremendous costs and demands extra labour.</p>

<p>Secondly, we are storing too small a supply of wheat in South Africa. The climate in our country fluctuates considerably, and it very easily happens that a surplus in one year is followed by a crop failure the following year. At present the Orange Free State is producing 51% of South Africa&#x2019;s wheat and it is precisely the Free State which has to contend with the worst fluctuations in climate.</p>

<p>In the third and last and, as far as I am concerned, the most important instance, South Africa is in a very favourable position to provide the whole of Africa with food, as a result of its production powers and its strategic situation. As I see matters, it may shortly be necessary to provide food for the whole of South Africa. Food could become a mighty weapon. Yesterday, the hon. the Minister used the expression, &#x201C;food for peace and friendship&#x201D;. I fully agree with him and that is why I think it would be a very wise step to store sufficient supplies of grain in the years ahead.</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, is that the wheat cultivar &#x201C;scheepers&#x201D; will be graded as a C class wheat as from the 1974-&#x2019;75 wheat season. In spite of extensive research, &#x201C;scheepers&#x201D; remains the cultivar which, taken over a number of years, delivers the best average yield in the Free State region, because it is best able to adapt to the climatic conditions in that area. That is why approximately 80% of the wheat harvest in the Free State consists of the &#x201C;scheepers&#x201D; cultivar. It would appear as if climatic conditions play a major role in determining the quality of wheat. In other words, in a year when climatic conditions are favourable, the quality is higher whilst during a bad year the quality is poorer. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister not to treat lightly the decision of grading &#x201C;scheepers&#x201D; as a C class wheat, since there is a fairly big difference between the price of Class B and Class C wheat. This could have a detrimental effect on the farmers in that area.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the debate is proceeding so <span class="col_5517-5518" refersTo="page_0449"/>peacefully that one really feels tempted to put the cat among the pigeons. However, I would rather not do it.</p>

<p>I want to convey my sincere thanks as well as the thanks of my constituency to the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs for the assistance we received at the time of the recent floods in that area. It is difficult to explain to people the extent of the disaster that occurred. It was my doubtful privilege to accompany the Ministers from Bloemfontein on a flight along the course of the Riet River as far as the Orange River, and along the reaches of the Orange River to the Aughrabies Falls. The latter was the only attractive sight I saw in the whole of that flood area. From there we flew along the Fish River Valley to Port Elizabeth. Tremendous damage was caused, but the aid and assistance that were given were rendered in such an energetic way that the suffering was greatly alleviated. Assistance is still being rendered in my constituency, particularly in the Riet River area, with the drainage of premises and the determination of the water table to ascertain in which way those premises can be drained further. Even now streams are still to be seen; the rivers are still running. The large Kalkfontein Dam has been overflowing fairly strongly for almost the past seven months in spite of the fact that irrigation from the dam takes place regularly. Large marshes are to be seen everywhere, which brought a tremendous plague of mosquitoes and gnats, just as in Kuruman, which the hon. member for Kuruman spoke about. There are still large areas which can be regarded as swamps. As a matter of fact, we fear the summer rains that are due. In spite of what we and all the scientists expected would happen, this mosquito plague was not stamped out during the winter. When the cicadas are added to this during summer, it will create many problems. I have often said that we do not kill mosquitoes in that area by swotting them, but that we crush them, otherwise one does not get rid of them all.</p>

<p>It is a fact that veterinary surgeons confirmed that lambs suffering from no disease at all were killed by mosquitoes. In addition, it was found that sheep died in large numbers on account of various diseases such as blue tongue, on account of the gnat plague, Rift Valley fever, Wesselsbron disease and other diseases. Unfortunately a shortage of vaccine, as produced by Onder-stepoort, was experienced at one stage. The farmers then decided to dip the sheep every week in order to keep this blood-sucking insects away from the bodies of the sheep. In addition, this caused lumpy wool, foot-rot, bacterial infection, and so on. During this whole episode, thousands of sheep died. I have here a survey conducted by the farmers&#x2019; association in Boshoff. On 38 farms no fewer than 25 837 sheep died. At the current prices this means a loss of R750 000. This does not take into account at all the fact that there were no lambs this season. I am not saying this for the information of the hon. the Minister, but for the information of the Secretary of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. He should show some mercy with regard to claims against these farmers who have suffered so much damage in the meantime.</p>

<p>We are grateful for everything that has been done, but there was one salient shortcoming, i.e. the shortage of veterinary surgeons in the employ of the State. The few veterinary surgeons we had and who were quite willing to assist, were inundated with requests to render services. However, they were unable to render such services. As a matter of fact, it is heartbreaking to think that so many of our veterinary surgeons settle in the cities and become doctors to cats and dogs immediately after they have completed their studies instead of rendering the services which are so absolutely essential if we were to provide this nation as well as the rest of South Africa with an income and food in future. I want to add that I do not blame the veterinary surgeons, because what matters to them is rands and cents and a particular standard of living. In the first place, I therefore want to request that we, through the Public Service Commission, regard this group of professional people, i.e. the veterinary surgeons, in a special light and make it possible and attractive for these people to remain in the Public Service. In the second place, I know that extensions are being undertaken at Onderstepoort, and that others are being planned. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what progress has been made in this direction.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, there is one further point I wish to raise. These blood-sucking gnats are becoming a plague in large parts of the country. The same can be said of the mosquitoes. People have even rumoured that an outbreak of malaria could occur, but at no stage was there any danger of this happening, because the mosquitoes were <span class="col_5519-5520" refersTo="page_0450"/>by no means of the anopheles type, which is the malaria carrier. They were of the culex type. These gnats are a terrible plague along the streams, as well as in the vicinity of the Vaal River&#x2014;I may be asked what I have got to do with the Vaal River, but a portion of my constituency adjoins the Vaal River. During 1966-&#x2019;67 a similar outbreak of gnats occurred. At that time they were sprayed with DDT from aeroplanes, but on account of steps taken by the health authorities DDT is no longer available on the market. A gnat plague is also developing higher up along the river, particularly in view of the construction of dams taking place at present. The reason for this is probably the zoo plankton which grows in the dams and provides food for the gnats. They are not destroyed by running water. Previously it was found that these gnats are destroyed and prevented from becoming a plague by algae growing below the dams. This year, however, with the enormous floods this algae was virtually washed away and on account of this it was made possible for these gnats to flourish. We appreciate that Onderstepoort does not have a hydro-biological research centre. On the other hand, the Department of Water Affairs does not undertake research on these arthropods either, because it is not their task to control these gnats. In view of the increasing number of dams we are going to build, these are plagues which may create problems for us in future, particularly for those living in the vicinity of rivers. What I want to ask, therefore, is for the Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the Department of Water Affairs, to establish a unit to undertake research in connection with the hydrological control of these gnats, the simuliidae.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, outlined the difficulties he was experiencing with mosquitoes in his area.

<p>I said mosquitoes, not gnats, although I would include them also.</p>

<p>The Natal Agricultural Union in its magazine produced for the congress reported on a study that was made in America a study of the attitude between farmers and urban dwellers. It is reported as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">In a study made in the United States of what farmers and urbanites think of each other, the conclusion emerged that both groups still see the farmer in the typical agrarian image, perhaps not as a yokel with straw in his hair, but as the urbanites observed: hardworking, religious, co-operative, practical, prosperous, independent, friendly and honest in business relationships.</block>

<p>That is how the &#x201C;dorpsbewoners&#x201D; see us farmers. The farmers, however, taking a good look at themselves, added the following: self-reliance, independence, self-restraint, persistence, courage and thrift. If you take all those qualities together you will agree, Sir, that the farming community consists of people who are able to look after themselves and who are people with a conscience. I feel that I am entitled to say that I resent very bitterly the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Houghton here this afternoon where she made a blatant attack on the farming community regarding the wage issue, something on which I do not consider her to be an authority of any fashion whatsoever. I believe that the farming community is well able to take care of the agricultural labour situation on their farms. I believe that they have carried their fair share in maintaining the Black population in this country on farms by providing employment, and schooling to an increasing extent for them. It is significant that the Natal Agricultural Union, without any prodding of any kind from any political party, has been moving in a direction which even the hon. member for Houghton had to admit is the right direction, in providing pension schemes and all kinds of other advantages and incentives to the farming community. I reject that accusation by the hon. member completely. I do not think it is justified at all; I do not think she has the facts at her disposal to make such an accusation.</p>

<p>I wish to speak to the hon. the Minister this afternoon on a matter which concerns my constituency, namely the agricultural college at Cedara. May I say that, if ever there was something which was a tribute to <span class="col_5521-5522" refersTo="page_0451"/>the Department of Agriculture, it is the Cedara College. I think this is one of the outstanding institutions of this country. I am very pleased that in my constituency I maintain a dose relationship with the members of the staff, and also many of the students when it is election time, because most of them, of course, vote for my party. I want to deal with the relationship between the members of the staff and the students. One of the greatest attractions for the staff at the Cedara College is that many of them are engaged in research.</p>

<p>I want to say that this is project-related research dealing with the practical problems of the farming community in the Natal Midlands. It is outstanding work. I want to say that that college has created nothing less than a revolution in farming on our area by means of the outstanding fertilization procedures and research in connection with pastures, irrigation and the aspects I mentioned yesterday. There has come about a complete change in methods of production in the Natal Midlands. It is being spearheaded, perhaps not exclusively, but to a great extent, by the members of the college. They have spearheaded the change in agricultural techniques that have taken place. This has brought about a great measure of trust and almost of affection between the members of the staff and the farming community. I have had the privilege to go to farmers&#x2019; days three or four times recently, and I want to say that there is the best possible relationship between Cedara as an institution and the farming community. However one of the problems is that the college does not only provide research, but also undertakes the training of students. One can quite understand the fact that a person who is engaged in research work may regard giving up his time for the training of students almost as a side-show of the important work on which he is engaged. I wonder whether it is not possible that there could be some kind of incentive.</p>

<p>I am sure that when Cedara staff members were lecturing at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, a bonus was paid to them. I understand that the same thing is happening at Onderstepoort, namely that a bonus is paid to people from the research staff who have to lecture the students. This does not happen at Cedara. My information is that there is, perhaps not a conflict, but a measure of strain developing among the members of the staff between their obligations to train students and their own inclinations which are towards the research work they are doing. It is vitally important that you should get the best people on the staff to train the students. In the case of a department of three, four or five members, the chap who is not so intimately connected with research is being loaded with the training work. This is a matter where we are dealing with the minds of future farmers and I want to say that it is of the utmost importance that we should pay attention to the minds of future farmers. We should challenge them with the best possible brains that the agricultural industry can provide to stimulate their interest. We must grip those young minds and prepare them to accept the challenge that the future is going to set them.</p>

<p>One of the problems is I think the amount of time that is allocated in respect of these projects. These project estimates do not include the time for training. This is as I understand it. My information may be incorrect but I think that all projects are estimated on the basis that a person&#x2019;s time is allocated. It would be an incentive if somewhere on the budget of that college an additional allowance could be made available in respect of incentive payments to staff members who have to undertake the work of training students. I think that there is a real problem in this regard and I can understand it. I do not at all wish to run down anybody for wishing to concentrate on what is his basic and primary function there, viz. the research which has contributed so largely to the furtherance of the prosperity of the agricultural community in that area of Natal.</p>

<p>I want to say this is a problem which is also carried over into the universities. There is a growing concern in the university faculties that any possible cuts that may be forthcoming in the allocations to universities, may well be forthcoming in the agricultural faculties. This seems to be a prevalent concern. This may result in a serious hampering of the recruitment of staff for those agricultural faculties if people have any fears in relation to the department of the university to which they attach themselves. I think that the hon. the Minister will avoid a great deal of trouble if he is able to state here today that he will ensure that agricultural faculties will be maintained at full strength and will receive an adequate allocation of funds <span class="col_5523-5524" refersTo="page_0452"/>from the central Government because of the imperative need to maintain progress in the agricultural sphere in relation to the extension of agricultural research, information, etc.</p>

<p>There is also the problem in relation to research expenditure. The department seconds people to the staffs of universities to undertake research over certain periods. If this secondment and these grants are not continued, university faculties tend to feel that they will lose status and that they will not be able to obtain the best brains that they need&#x2014;that they will not be able to attract people into the service of the universities. Let us take this matter one step further and go back to Cedara. One of the activities at Cedara is an extension activity, viz., to go out to the farming community in order to make sure that the knowledge gained by research at Cedara is conveyed to and practised by the farming community.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. BOTMA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Mooi River will pardon me if I do not follow up on his arguments. However, I want to associate myself with the remarks he made in respect of what was said here by the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>I should like to request your attention for a brief review of the red meat industry. Prices were particularly favourable during the past year and, in fact, showed an increase of 36% compared with those of the previous year. On the other hand, slaughtering showed a drop of 14%, and one of the major reasons for the drop in demand has been the reduced supply from adjoining areas. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the red meat consumed in the Republic comes from adjoining areas, including South-West Africa. It is interesting to note that the cattle herd in the Republic of South Africa dropped by approximately 600 000 during the past 15 years. As against that, our population has increased tremendously, the purchasing power of the Whites and the non-Whites has increased and if we consider this state of affairs, we come to the conclusion that there is a bright future for the red meat industry. This presents a great challenge to the producer because, as it is, there is a considerable backlog he has to make up. However, it is a fact, Sir, that only since 1972 did it become possible for the farmer in South-West Africa to share in the favourable prices his counter-part in the Republic received thanks to the assistance and aid the hon. the Minister of Agriculture rendered the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to say thank you once more for this helping hand on behalf of all and every farmer in South-West Africa. Things are going particularly well for the farmers in South-West Africa, and I want to appeal to our farmers to utilize these favourable prices to redeem their loans or at least reduce them drastically. Money is becoming more expensive and more scarce all the time, and it is in their own interests to pay attention to this matter. Sir, there are a few factors which may have a detrimental effect on this very favourable state of affairs, factors which may discourage producers particularly in the remote areas from producing meat, and in this regard I should like to mention a few points.</p>

<p>In the first place, the increased railway tariffs; in the second place, increased imports from overseas; in the third place, too low floor prices; in the fourth place, a slackening in the present feeding tendencies on account of more expensive maize and increased railway tariffs; in the fifth place, buyer resistance on account of too high prices and, in the sixth place, large-scale game farming. Sir, it is a fact that the drastic increase of 60% in respect of the conveyance of livestock could wipe out these benefits. This affected farmers in the Vryburg/Northern Transvaal&#x2014;South-West Africa areas in particular. According to figures furnished by the Railways itself, this means an increase in the railage of R7-03 per head of stock transported from Grootfontein in South-West Africa to Cape Town. The additional motor transportation costs amount to approximately R1 per head of stock. In addition the 12&#x00BD;% increase in railage on all commodities will amount to approximately R1 per head of stock per year, or R3 per head of stock before one is able to market it after three years.</p>

<p>This means that the farmer of South-West Africa has to pay an additional R11 per head of stock to be able to market it in Cape Town; this is simply deducted from the price he receives after his stock has been slaughtered. I therefore want to make an urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister to discuss this whole matter with the hon. the Ministers of Transport, Finance and Economic Affairs. Sir, I want to submit to you in all amity a few possibilities for your <span class="col_5525-5526" refersTo="page_0453"/>consideration: In the first place, some or other form of subsidy, such as that applying to the transportation of Bantu, or in certain industrial areas in which the Railways is compensated by the Department of Commerce for services rendered. I know the hon. the Minister is not in favour of subsidies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>But he is in favour of subsidies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botma">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. BOTMA</person>:</from>

<p>Another possibility is the establishment of shorter routes. The long distances do not only result in higher railage cost, but also cause considerable loss in weight and loss on account of bruises sustained underway. The loss of weight is estimated to be 7 kg per 200 kg from Southwest Africa to Cape Town, and to this is added the loss of weight on account of bruises sustained underway, which vary from one case to another. If a shorter route via the Sishen/Saldanha railway line could be used, it would be possible to transport the cattle from South-West Africa and the Northern Cape via Pudimoe to Johannesburg; but a shorter route still would, of course, be the railway line for which the hon. member for Kuruman has been asking for many years. If that railway line were to be built and cattle could be transported over that route, it would shorten the duration of the journey by up to three days, which would be more economical and which would eliminate to a large extent, or at least a greater percentage of the loss in weight and the loss on account of bruises. A third possibility is the arrangement according to which, if not the whole of this increase, at least a portion of it could be passed on to the consumer or trader in one way or other. As far as the import of beef is concerned, particularly from overseas countries, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that one of the major reasons for the shortages we are at present experiencing locally, is the fact that our farmers throughout the country are building up their herds. If imports were to become a factor, which it is not at all at the moment thanks to the competent way in which the hon. the Minister handles this import situation, we would have the position again where breeding stock are slaughtered, which would cause the number of our herds to be reduced even further. It is a fact that the industry is moving through a phase of shortages at the moment, which will revert to normal as soon as the building up of herds has been phased out and our farmers succeed in pushing up the calf percentage. The present calf percentage of 50% is quite inadequate and it can and should be increased to 80%. But when considering the position abroad, we find that Rhodesia and even Russia are experiencing shortages. Even America is experiencing a mild shortage, while Australia has handsome stocks. However, the largest surplus is in the EEC countries. However, the world is inclined to stare itself blind at the approximately 230 000 tons of meat that accumulated in the EEC countries. This may be regarded as an artificial surplus on account of the high consumer prices prevailing there, but the question is often asked outside why we do not import more meat. However, the hon. the Minister has already given consent for the importation of test consignments, but on analysis the position is not quite as bright as it appears at first sight. The meat coming from Australia is a frozen boned product which can only be used by meat processors. As against this, the meat from the EEC countries consists of frozen carcasses from which the bones have not been removed, in which the ordinary consumer is not interested at all. The only major consumer is the mining industry which has large compound facilities, but even this is a very limited market. In addition, the carcasses cannot be obtained at give-away prices.</p>

<p>Another point I want to raise is floor prices. If we consider that the auction price in 1972 was 48 cents per kg for grade I meat, while the floor price was 44 cents per kg, i.e. a difference of only four cents, and if we consider that the auction price in 1973 was 65 cents while the floor price was 60 cents, and that in 1974 the auction price was 100,8 cents and the floor price only 71 cents, there is a difference of only 30 cents. This low floor price is no guarantee for the producer, and I want to ask that the floor price be increased to at least 90 cents to provide the producer with some kind of guarantee.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have gained the impression once more that agriculture is subject to major fluctuations. I experienced this again last year. In the first place, I want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for what he has done. As I said the other day during the debate on Water Affairs, 880 km irrigation land along the rivers in my area were affected <span class="col_5527-5528" refersTo="page_0454"/>by the flood this year. In this regard the hon. the Minister assisted our people and he did not only help with the reclamation of land, but he also assured our farmers of a new future. He supported our people through a time of great distress and gave us new hope. The hon. the Minister treated these people sympathetically and came to their assistance with the good intention of rehabilitating them so that they can carve out a new future for themselves in agriculture. For that reason R10 million was made available for loans and R6 million for subsidies in these areas. I am very grateful to the Minister and the Government for what they have done for these people in my constituency, and the people throughout our country. I am grateful for and pleased to see the remarkable change of heart which has taken place in the ranks of the United Party. Two years ago the attitude of these people was quite different. At that time they did not really advocate the withdrawal scheme. Yesterday I heard something entirely new in this House. From 1967 to 1972 agriculture experienced difficult times: it was a period of drought setbacks, floods and water shortages. During those five years every disaster that could possibly befall the industry, was experienced in agriculture. The United Party did its very best to exploit for political purposes these circumstances, over which we had no control. During these five years the Government came along and pumped R385 million into agriculture in order to keep agriculture sound so that we can provide food for the people of this country. Never before has any government considered it necessary to do this and neither do I hope that any Government will have to do this in future. This year the United Party has remained quiet on that aspect. They have no appreciation for what the Government has done in recent times to put our agriculture on a sound footing. Where were the hon. members of the United Party when the withdrawal scheme was introduced? We found them in Brakpan two years ago. At that time they were doing their best to create discord between the producer and the consumer. They did their best to whip up the feelings of the people against the farmer and the producer. They told the people that the meat shortage in the country was due to steps taken by the Government. They said it was a crime that was being committed against the consumer, because the Government was paying R3 for a sheep the farmer did not possess. The people strongly resented the action taken by the Government in this regard. The consumer protested against this, but after the election in Brakpan, they accuse the Government of only paying R3 to the farmers. They objected to it and said it was unfair of the Government not to pay the farmers R6. It is no use acting in this way.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Is that the kind of speech you are making?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The United Party is no longer speaking in that vein. We have appreciation for what has been done. During the last years of the regime of the United Party things were just as bad for the farmer. That was due to the prices of our products. During the last years of the regime of the United Party, in 1947-&#x2019;48, 600 farmers in the six districts of the North-West left the rural areas on account of the low prices they had been receiving for their products. At that time the price for super beef was 16,1 cents per kg; today it is 84.5 cents. The price of prima beef was 14.1 cents; today it is 97,5 cents. I continue in this vein. The price of grade II mutton was 9,9 cents; today it is 64,5 cents. In January the average market price was 85.2 cents. I can continue in this vein and also refer to the prices of sheep and goats, which were so low in those years that it was impossible for farmers to make a living. It is no small wonder that 600 farmers had to sacrifice their farms during the last two years of United Party government. I want to tell the consumer quite frankly that if the farmer is unable to produce his meat profitably, there is going to be further meat shortages and consequently he will have to pay more for it. For that reason I want to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the hon. member sitting in front of me here as far as his request is concerned that consideration should be given to the floor prices so that our meat producers would be assured of profitable prices. There are many reasons for that. We know that the price of land has increased tremendously, that there was a sharp increase in interest rates, that labour is expensive, that it is impossible for us to buy any fodder because prices are exorbitant, that licks are very expensive and that transport costs of livestock are extremely high. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to take these factors into consideration when floor prices are fixed because in this way it will be <span class="col_5529-5530" refersTo="page_0455"/>possible to increase the basic floor price in order to make it profitable for us to produce meat.</p>

<p>At the same time I want to make an appeal to out farmers. Because we are aware of the fact that every year is not a good year, and because we know that, during some years in the future, farming will be less profitable than it had been the year before, I want to appeal to farmers who have liabilities to do their best to reduce those liabilities or eliminate them altogether. Our calculations should not be based on wishful thinking, because that is going to cause our downfall in any case. The production of red meat in our country has to be increased tremendously, and I want to ask that we should help these people to increase their production. There are certain factors we have to take into consideration, and I want to mention these factors. The agricultural industry is subject to fluctuations and because we are aware of this, we should not budget as if every year is going to be a year of prosperity. We should rather work out our budget for those years when we suffer set-backs.</p>

<p>I want to make a request to the hon. the Minister. This concerns the applications in terms of the Land Tenure Act, which are being submitted every day to the Agricultural Credit Board but which are rejected. These people submit their applications for the very reason to be able to obtain an economic unit. Experience in the past has taught us that it is far better for the farmer to become rich through farming than through buying. The applications of many of our farmers who have 1 000 or 2 000 morgen today and want to buy another thousand morgen are rejected because they do not have an economic unit yet. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, unfortunately the political matters which the hon. member for Prieska discussed happened before my time, before my birth, so there is no point in my referring to them.</p>

<p>If I may, I want to tell my own little story. I want to support what the hon. member for Vryheid said today about the slaughtering of chickens and about the problems of those chicken farmers&#x2019; wives who have been slaughtering in the past for the local market. He spoke a lot of sense, but he stated one fact which I do not know whether it is correct. He said that the farmer&#x2019;s wife was allowed to slaughter four or five chickens a week. I do not know where the hon. member gets this figure. It is no use for him to shake his head because here I have the report of his speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that they were being limited but that it was the number they normally slaughtered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>In any case, I heard that the figure was ten. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether there is indeed a limiting number because this is creating a problem. I agree with everything the hon. member for Vryheid said and I particularly agreed with him when he said that the farmer&#x2019;s wife is at the mercy of the inspector who is applying the Act. That is very true and it should not be so. Apart from that, what I should like to know is whether the slaughtering of farm chickens is actually a danger to public health. Has anybody in the past been influenced by it, except the cock of course? I cannot imagine anybody else suffering.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>You mean the rooster.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I beg your parden, the rooster. I was wondering whether the hon. the Minister can give some consideration to relaxing the requirements of the Animal Slaughter, Meat and Animal Products Hygiene Act as far as the slaughter of farm chickens is concerned. In the country towns particularly this is establishing another monopoly for the broiler industry. If no fowls are being sold locally, the fowls must be obtained from those in the broiler industry who are charging as much as they like for their chickens.</p>

<p>That brings me to another problem experienced particularly in the country areas. I refer to the scarcity of red meat. In the country we have the small butcher who is accustomed to slaughtering cattle for his own shop. He is now precluded from doing this. I have been given a figure in this connection but I do not know whether the figure is correct. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether it is true that they are allowed to slaughter four or five head of cattle per week and that, if they require more meat, they must obtain it from the abattoirs. These small butchers do not have the money and they are not prepared to extend their premises to conform <span class="col_5531-5532" refersTo="page_0456"/>to the requirements of the Hygiene Act. The result is that they must not only fetch the meat from the nearest abattoir but they must also deliver it there. This is causing a great deal of extra expense. The stock has to be taken to the abattoir, slaughtered and brought back. In many cases it has to be brought back in refrigerated trucks conforming to health requirements. This naturally costs the earth. All these extra expenses get passed on to the local consumer and this is putting red meat completely beyond the pocket of the African as well as lower income groups in the small towns. This is not achieving what it was supposed to achieve at all. Apart from that, it is forcing people into the dangerous habit of foregoing red meat. They are now beginning to eat substitutes from which to obtain the necessary proteins. This eventually becomes a habit and I doubt if they will ever go back to eating meat again. They now eat eggs, soya products and tinned foods which they feel they can still purchase. I know that in my own area, the South Coast, people limit themselves to one egg on alternate days and that is the total amount of protein they are getting. This is not good, even from the point of view of public health alone. The small butcher is of course also no longer a bidder at the stock sales because he is not interested. The result is that we are simply creating another monopoly for the big slaughterer of meat. The farmer is also losing thereby because he is not getting the best price for his meat.</p>

<p>It is no good merely complaining about these matters, but the question of abattoirs has been dragging on for many months. In the <i>Agricultural News</i> of 11 April this year mention is made of the fact that the supplying of abattoirs in controlled areas is going very well. However, one also reads there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The abattoir position in the uncontrolled areas is very unsatisfactory.</block>

<p>According to this publication it appears that if there is any joy to be had in this connection, the local authorities whose areas of jurisdiction will be served by an abattoir, should consider the establishment of regional abattoirs. The commission is now investigating this possibility by making an economic survey in the various areas. The article says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The planning and the design of the abattoirs should be conducted in consultation with the Commission to ensure that the abattoirs will be erected as economically as possible with due regard to the slaughtering facilities and hygiene requirements.</block>

<p>I have another cutting here which refers to the problem experienced in the area of Ladysmith which is now suffering a great deal of hardship because of this abattoir requirement. Mr. Volker is quoted in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 4 May as saying that the standards required are up to export standards and that he does not think it necessary for meat in that area to conform to export standards. It appears that butchers in that area are not prepared to spend money on the abattoirs. The local authorities themselves do not wish to spend the money. Although they have agreed that this project should be tackled on a regional basis, nobody seems to be prepared to provide the money to build a regional abattoir. The sums of money required are too large. For example, if Ladysmith were to provide such an abattoir the alterations would cost between R500 000 and R1 million. In any case, it would be for a quantity of meat five times as much as they require. Mr. Volker, the hon. member for Klip River, was interviewed by the butchers, the Abattoir Commission and the farmers and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The apparent solution lies either in the availability of loan money at a very cheap interest rate or, alternatively, in adapting the size and the standards of the abattoir to be more in compliance with the present needs.</block>

<p>This is exactly what the commission&#x2019;s findings are and I would like to know from the hon. the Minister if he is giving consideration to assisting with the implementation of regional abattoirs and if the Abbattoir Commission is prepared to undertake the building of abattoirs in uncontrolled areas. I think this is the only way in which this matter can be tackled because the money required is just beyond the scope of small local authorities. Ladysmith is by no means a small local authority. There are many smaller local authorities which just cannot afford this sort of money. When I think of the South Coast, this will probably devolve on the Port <span class="col_5533-5534" refersTo="page_0457"/>Shepstone area, and they can just not find this sort of money to extend their abattoir.</p>

<p>The other point I should like to touch on in the minute or two at my disposal is that the hon. the Minister said yesterday&#x2014;and I could not agree with him more&#x2014;in reply to an hon. member that a lot of our arable land was being lost to freeways. This is something with which I agree wholeheartedly. I will not speak about the political significance of that remark, because I think a lot of our arable land is being given away for ideological purposes as well. In respect of freeways, however, I agree with the hon. the Minister and I would like to have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s support in this regard. In any particular area an excellent piece of farming land is to be cut up by a freeway which is considered quite unnecessary by road engineers, by the farmers and by the roadusers involved. Yet the National Road Transportation Board is adamant in going ahead with cutting this freeway through this wonderful piece of land. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the peaceful atmosphere which has prevailed in this debate up to now, it is rather difficult for someone who prefers a more lively atmosphere to make a speech. Nevertheless, the hon. member who has just spoken made a request to the hon. the Minister which, to my mind, should be replied to by the hon. the Minister himself, and for that reason I shall not follow up on what he said. The hon. member will pardon me for that reason only.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central, who is unfortunately not here at the moment, yesterday afternoon very briefly expressed his gratitude and appreciation to the Wool Board and leaders of the South African wool industry for the services they have rendered in recent times. Now, it is a fact that the wool industry in South Africa has experienced a period of considerable prosperity during the past two years. However, it is also a fact that the wool farmer of South Africa who is solely dependent on a market overseas for his product, is unable to come along to this House to argue whether the subsidy he receives favours the consumer or the producer. The wool farmer of South Africa has become accustomed to accepting the price overseas countries are prepared to pay for his product. During years past, the wool farmer has become accustomed, as far as the price he receives is concerned, to being kicked around like a flabby football. In times of crisis, as in recent times, the wool farmer and particularly the leaders of the wool industry decided that he could no longer tolerate the situation where he is compelled simply to accept the price which prevails at a certain stage, whether the price is good or poor. After long and sober consideration the leaders of the wool industry and the wool farmer of South Africa decided on a new marketing scheme. That scheme was not decided upon for reasons of crisis, but after long and sober consideration it was decided what the wool farmer should do in order to bring about stability&#x2014;not only for him, but also for the consumer of his product. The new South African wool scheme was born on account of those ideas and considerations on the part of the wool farmer. Unfortunately it is a fact that the year in which the wool scheme was put into operation was the year in which wool prices increased considerably. Many of our farmers at once forgot the immediate past and sharp criticism was levelled. Unfortunately it is a fact that some of our people forget very quickly, but fortunately it is also a fact that the majority of our people learn from the lessons of the past. We are grateful that the majority of the wool farmers in South Africa gave the new scheme their wholehearted co-operation. How fortunate were we that this was indeed the case! After a period of merely two years, however, a new crisis threatened the wool industry at the beginning of the present season. You know, Sir, this is how things go with the wool price: If Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s horse runs second in the Grand National, the wool price drops by 5%. In the beginning of August the wool industry was being threatened by a new crisis when it seemed to us as if the wool market would collapse as a result of international financial problems. Fortunately the South African Wool Board was prepared for a possible crisis. What I should like to record here is that the status of the leaders of the South African wool industry was such that when we had to liaise with our partners in Australia in an attempt to cope with the new crisis, there was no need for the wool industry in South Africa to meet around a conference table and to enter into a formal contract with Australia concerning the steps to be taken during the coming season. The status of the leaders of our wool industry was such that a telephone conversation with the leaders of the industry <span class="col_5535-5536" refersTo="page_0458"/>in Australia was sufficient for an agreement to be entered into between South Africa and Australia. The leaders of the wool industry of South Africa were able to do this because we know that we can trust and rely upon our friends in Australia. We, in turn, were able to do this because we know that our friends in Australia are reliable and because we know who and what they are. As a result of the steps they have taken the leaders of the wool industry not only made friends for themselves overseas, but also friends for our country as a whole. How happy we are to know that, since we are experiencing a crisis year in the wool industry, we in South Africa not only enjoy the support of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, but also of the entire Cabinet. Although the wool farmer in South Africa has no written agreement to the effect that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture will support us in a time of crisis, we know that we can automatically rely on his support and that of the Government. We are fortunate in that we have recently learned on the part of Australia&#x2014;we never said so, but we did have our doubts as to whether the Australians would receive financial support to enable them to boost the market during the present season&#x2014;that also their Government would accept legislation immediately for the present season to make available to their wool cooperative an amount of 50 million Australian dollars to support the market for the current season. For that reason we are able to tell the wool farmer of South Africa that there is no need for him to have any fear; that we, together with Australia, will see to it that, for the current season, the price of wool will not drop below its present level. We are able to say this to the farmers because we know that our Australian partners enjoy the support of their government and because we know that we enjoy the support of our hon. Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<p>As far as the new wool scheme is concerned, there were many reservations on the part of many of our people. I just want to tell those people who have had any reservations that with this new scheme a new pattern was introduced as far as wool marketing is concerned. We shall never again operate on the old pattern we knew for so many years. New ideas which fit in with the times in which we are living, new ideas of modern marketing, will prevail, also as far as the wool industry of South Africa is concerned. Since we are in the fortunate position in South Africa in that we were able to prepare ourselves for a crisis, it is unfortunately a fact that our partners overseas were caught unawares and that they really had to take emergency measures. As far as the new future is concerned, we have such great confidence in our industry and in the importance of our industry, that we are fully convinced that this industry will only go from strength to strength. As far as marketing is concerned and if there are any wool farmers who still have reservations, I just want to quote an extract from the <i>Primary Industry Newsletter</i> of Australia of last month. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite the acceptance by the International Wool Textile Organization of the need for price stability and the major contribution of a floor price towards such stability, despite all these factors, people are still running around criticizing, condemning, ridiculing and rebelling against the changes which have been made to their sacred system. The facts are simple. The system of wool marketing in Australia has been changed. It will never be the same again, and this is only the start. Now that the marketing wagon is on the move, it will gather momentum with surprising speed and those still retaining their fixed attitude and emotionally orientated &#x201C;firm principles&#x201D; will either be swept aside or bowled over in its wake.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it must be a very pleasant thing for every representative this year to be able to get up in the Agricultural debate and to say that this year is a particularly good year; this is also the case in South-West Africa. Since we are accustomed to the fact that it is only the northern regions which are blessed we in the south were particularly blessed this year as well. Of course, this also causes some problems, and I share the concern of the hon. member for Fauresmith about the explosion of insects as a result of the rains we have had this year. Sir, we have probably experienced the greatest outbreak of locusts South Africa has ever known. As was said by the hon. member, we also suffered plagues of gnats, insects and diseases we have never known to exist among our stock in the past.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, all the plagues of Egypt. Sir, since I want to dwell for a moment on the locust plague, I am grateful to be able to say that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has, with a small labour force, rendered a service to us in this connection for which we are very grateful. It was such an enormous plague and the scope thereof so extensive that it could easily get out of hand; nevertheless, they succeeded in combating the plague and to re-organize the combating thereof so that we can regard the following outbreak with far more confidence. We want to thank those officials who wore themselves out night and day in order to cope with this plague. But at this stage we are particularly concerned about the gnat plague and the diseases which accompany it. Sir, it may not sound so serious to the uninformed, but one appreciates the extent of this plague only when one visits these farms and notices the condition of the sheep deteriorating in spite of the bountiful grazing. I believe that the department will, in time, give its serious attention to this matter in order to assist our farmers.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to discuss an industry about which very little has probably been said in this House, an industry carried on in the southern areas of South-West and in the northern areas of the Cape Province, i.e. the karakul industry. We are privileged in this respect that few other countries are able to do what we are doing and join in a discussion with us when we talk about the karakul industry; as a matter of fact, there are only two countries, i.e. Afghanistan and Russia. We are privileged, because it is not possible for this industry to be carried on just anywhere. As a matter of fact, it is pre-eminently suitable for those areas with a low rainfall, but I do not want to go into this aspect any further. Sir, over the past few decades we in South-West Africa and in the Northern Cape have developed a splendid industry&#x2014;the karakul industry or the karakul pelt industry. A few years ago a Karakul Board was established, which concerned itself with advertising and the marketing of karakul pelts in particular. As you are aware, Sir, we are dependent upon foreign countries for a market for these pelts. To our regret there is not yet a significant market for karakul pelts in South Africa. What this Board should do, therefore, is to exert itself to expand the existing markets in those countries buying these pelts and also to try and find new markets in other countries. These pelts are for the most part being marketed under the trade name of &#x201C;Swakara&#x201D;. The auctions are held in London, where two auction houses take care of the auctions, i.e. the Hudson Bay Company and Annings. Our major buyers are West European countries, such as Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom, as well as quite a number of smaller countries in Western Europe. Because this article is not a food commodity, it is a product which is not easily marketable and price fluctuations can occur quite easily. The Board is now endeavouring to expand to the east, and Japan entered the market recently and we are looking forward with interest to the progress that will be made there. The trade in karakul pelts in the U.S.A. remains disappointing. One does not know why, but we have hardly made any progress in that country. As I have said, we are entirely dependent upon the overseas market, and for that reason we are, of course, subject to the fluctuations and problems, of the international monetary system, as well as everything that accompanies it. In this way, for example, the increased oil prices recently caused confusion in the monetary system to become even worse. Rates of inflation in all Western countries have increased tremendously with the result that trade balances, which were quite favourable until recently, are now showing considerable deficits. Consequently one has to appreciate that the karakul pelt trade is quite sensitive when these fluctuations occur, but in spite of all this Swakara has performed very well up to now and the market has been quite stable. To illustrate this, I just want to quote a few figures of the last few years. I start at 1960 in order to show you, Sir, what the value of this trade is to South Africa. I quote the number of pelts and I also quote the monetary value thereof. In 1960, 2,7 million pelts were marketed and the monetary value was R12 million. In 1962 the number of pelts increased to over 3 million and the monetary value increased to R17,5 million. In 1964 the number of pelts increased to 4 million and the value thereof increased to R20,9 million. In 1966 the number of pelts increased to 4,3 million and the value increased to R27 million. In 1970 the number of pelts increased to over 5 million and <span class="col_5539-5540" refersTo="page_0460"/>the value thereof to more than R29 million. In 1972 there were 5,5 million pelts and the value was more than R54 million, almost R55 million. Over these 12 years the value therefore increased from R12 million to R54 million. Therefore this is an industry that has to be reckoned with. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with great interest to the hon. member for Karas as he described the growth of the karakul industry, which is now such a valuable asset to South Africa in terms of foreign exchange. R55 million is no mean asset and I would like to join him in congratulating those who have built up the industry in a very fine way. During the two days of this debate, the hon. the Minister, the Deputy Minister and many other hon. members have been telling us, in spite of mosquitoes, midges, locusts and many other plagues, what a good year this has been for agriculture. The hon. the Deputy Minister said it had been the best year ever for agriculture. This may well be the case. However, I would like to say that it has not been a good year for the housewife.</p>

<p>Food prices have rocketed to the extent that most families in South Africa are not eating as well as they used to. The family has had to lower its standards. In the case of many of the poorer sections of the community, rising food prices have become a crushing burden. In many cases families which were already hardly able to feed themselves properly, can no longer do so. It has become a hand to mouth existence, except that there is very much less in the hand when it goes to that mouth. There is no doubt at all that food bills are rising at a frightening rate. However, I want to make it clear at the outset that I do not believe that the farmer is getting a square deal either. For a long time farmers have not been getting a fair price for their produce. I am also fully aware of the fact that food prices in this country are low in comparison with prices in many other countries right around the world. Perhaps we have just been lucky. I certainly believe that it is true to say that the farmer&#x2019;s share of the final price to the consumer has been scandalously low. What particularly concerns me is the enormous difference between what the farmer gets for his produce and the final price to the consumer. I believe that prices at the moment are unfair to the farmer and also unfair to the consumer. This comes down to marketing. I know that the hon. the Minister has already pointed out that a Select Committee on the marketing of agricultural produce has been appointed because of the considerable criticism of South Africa&#x2019;s current marketing set-up with its proliferation of control boards. This committee was set up in April of last year. Since that time food prices have gone wild. I do not know how much longer this committee is going to take over its deliberations, but I do know that the situation in regard to food prices has reached crisis proportions. The hon. the Minister has said that he would prefer not to see it as a crisis. He would prefer to see it as challenge. I think, with respect, that we are facing a crisis and must see it as such. We must also see it as the challenge. I am afraid that the average housewife is finding it very difficult, though, to regard the situation only as challenging.</p>

<p>She is getting pretty desperate about it. The average housewife is desperate because it becomes more and more difficult to balance her budget. I realize that to take action before the report of this Select Committee is before us is a very difficult thing to do, but I believe that something must be done now by the hon. the Minister. In his introduction to the Marketing Amendment Bill earlier this session, the hon. the Minister himself said that an Act which is the subject of an inquiry of this nature, ought not to be amended in principle before the inquiry had been completed. He said, however, that this was just not possible in the case of the Marketing Act. He added that it was not considered desirable to hold over proposed amendments of an urgent nature until after completion of the inquiry. With this I must entirely agree. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that having <span class="col_5541-5542" refersTo="page_0461"/>waited 18 months, the situation has now deteriorated to the stage where it is desirable to take action now on the question of agricultural marketing. It is my contention that the comment earlier this year by Assocom and the Grain Trade Association to the effect that agricultural marketing boards, as presently constituted, are totally unsatisfactory, is a correct comment. Monopolistic trading conditions are created which are unfair to the consumer. I believe that there is good reason for the hon. the Minister to act on this right away. The man in the street looks at the total agricultural scene&#x2014;he perhaps does not know much about it&#x2014;and he sees dozens of agricultural advisory committees, agricultural credit committees, commissions like the Abattoir Commission, control boards ranging from the Oilseeds Control Board to the Rooibos Tea Control Board. There are boards such as the Government Brandy Board and the Artificial Insemination Board. There are subcommittees such as the Apricot Price Committee of the Canning-Fruit Board. There are agricultural credit committees all over the place. I feel that the man in the street looks at this busy lot of people, most of whom are probably doing jobs that are vitally necessary, and wonders who is paying for all this. I think that the farmer also looks at all these people and wonders whether he is paying for it. For example, one can understand the dairy farmer who is paid roughly 12 cents per litre for his milk, being a little cynical when he sees the milk being sold in a plastic bottle over the counter for 25 cents per litre. The public, both farmer and consumer, are not at all satisfied with the marketing situation. In view of the extreme urgency of the situation, I should like the hon. he Minister to tell us whether or not it might be advisable for the Committee on Marketing to submit an interim report so that emergency action can be taken. We cannot wait much longer. Something has to be done and it has to be done urgently.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is striking that almost 50% of the members of the Progressive Party have already taken part in the agricultural debate, although they did not have one candidate in an agricultural constituency in the recent election. When the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, stood up to speak, I almost thought that he was going to talk about oranges or orange farming because the name of his constituency is Orange Grove. Actually, the hon. member told the House nothing new. We all know that prices have risen but we wonder why the hon. member did not also mention the fact that bread, for example, is subsidized to such an extent that today, comparable bread in any country overseas is 100% more expensive than our bread. He can mention any country, and he will find that our bread is cheaper by half than in any country overseas. We subsidize our agricultural products in many other spheres as well. It is owing to these boards which the hon. member criticized that the hon. member is today still able to enjoy the cheapest food in the world. He should be very grateful for the boards&#x2019; existence.</p>

<p>I should like to discuss another matter, and that is the technical training of our young boys in the agricultural industry. I do not want to discuss university training, except to say that we are very grateful for the 823 undergraduate students and the 358 graduate students who studied last year at our four universities with agricultural faculties. Taking into account the scientific and technical progress that has been achieved in the world and in this country, particularly in the sphere of our agricultural industry, I believe that there is a need for our agriculturists, too, to stay up to date and to keep themselves informed as far as is practically possible concerning what is going on in the scientific and technical fields. Formal training at the agricultural college level does in fact meet a pressing need in this field. I am pleased that the hon. member for Mooi River was so full of praise for Cedara Agricultural College today. However, I think the same applies to the other five agricultural colleges in the Republic, too. These colleges really do a wonderful job. I note that during the 1972-73 financial year, 464 students studied at the agricultural colleges. In my opinion this is still not enough. I think that there is still a void which has to be filled. If we look at the kind of students that are allowed to enter the colleges, we find that there is very strict selection. The selection is of such a nature that matriculation with a minimum pass mark of 50% is required before a student is allowed to enter such a college. Apart from that, I believe that the students must have a minimum pass mark of 60% in mathematics. The colleges can only accommodate a limited number of students and many students who apply <span class="col_5543-5544" refersTo="page_0462"/>to the colleges annually, are turned away because they simply cannot be accommodated. What is more, if a student fails his first year, he may not return for a second year and take his first-year course over again. For that reason I think that a gap has developed between our university students, the agricultural college students and those young boys who would like to undergo training but who are unable to. What is more, these young boys are often among our finest farmers. It is these boys who, perhaps, are best at reading the weather or who possibly have a better understanding of animals. They, too, would like to have some kind of training. I want to ask, therefore, whether a start could not be made on the training of young boys of this type. I should like to suggest that a kind of technical training lasting, say, six months, be provided for these young boys at our agricultural colleges or perhaps at our experimental farms. The training I wish to advocate is a practical training in which, for example, they could learn to work with a welding machine, in which they could gain practical experience of livestock diseases, and how to handle an injection needle, whether livestock are to be injected under the skin or in a vein. Practical training of this kind could perhaps include elementary bricklaying or building. I have in mind, too, the planning of a bookkeeping system, something that is essential for any farmer. They should be able to undergo this kind of training. I could mention many kinds of training which they could undergo. I have in mind, for example, various plagues and pests they could perhaps study, as well as the servicing of tractors and elementary repairing of parts so that these boys would not need to go to the city or to a mechanic for every little thing, nor would they even need to call a mechanic to help them on the farm. It would have to be a practical course. I know that specialist courses which may be attended by farmers to enable them to be informed about the latest developments, are arranged at these agricultural colleges from time to time. However, I am making a plea specially for the young boys who are unable to attend a university or college or who did not possess the necessary matriculation exemption or other qualification to attend university or college. Such a course could perhaps be held for a period of six months. I believe that if these young boys were to take a course of this kind and if they could perhaps be given a diploma, they would have an achievement to be proud of. This would enable these young boys to plan more effectively when they entered the farming industry, and that is something of great importance in any economic sphere. They would also be better able to organize, give orders and see that those orders were carried out properly and that there was co-ordination in their farming. Then, too, they would perhaps be able to exercise better control over their farming. I therefore want to ask that the hon. the Minister should perhaps consider offering these young men who have not had the opportunity to undergo training, the opportunity to undergo this practical, useful training at one of our colleges or perhaps training at one of our experimental farms.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with pleasure to the fine plea for the training of those boys made by the hon. member for Potgietersrus. There is no doubt that owing to the enormous population growth a wonderful challenge awaits our farming community, that of providing the population with food. In order to be able to accept this challenge. I believe that the most effective farming methods will have to be employed. Among other things, these effective farming methods undoubtedly demand judicious mechanization and an effective labour force. When I refer to an effective labour force, what I really mean is a trained labour force. Since I am talking about mechanization and a trained labour force. I should like to mention a few figures. In the year 1972, 17 006 tractors were purchased. One supposes that not all went to the farming industry. In 1971, farming equipment and implements to the value of R18 million were purchased. When one considers that during those two years alone, an enormous capital amount was invested by farmers for the production of food for your table and mine, one must bear in mind that the labour force that had to man those tractors and implements, the people who had to work with that capital investment, had to be trained by the farmer himself. That is a tremendous achievement that certainly deserves the thanks of all of us. Those trained Bantu and Coloured farm labourers who worked with that capital investment undoubtedly also deserve our thanks. However, the question occurs to me whether it is fair, in view of the enormous capital investment made by the farmer, that <span class="col_5545-5546" refersTo="page_0463"/>he alone should be held responsible for the training of the people who have to work with that machinery. I am grateful to be able to say that through the mediation of the Department of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs, such a training centre for Coloured farm labourers was established here in the Western Province as far back as 1964. People who have been trained there&#x2014;so say the farmers who make use of their services&#x2014;are extremely valuable workers. Someone said it was an experience to see the enthusiasm and the new outlook on life evinced by these people on the farm. Now we are very grateful also to be able to announce that the Department of Bantu Education is prepared to grant support to the establishment of decentralized training centres where these farm labourers can be trained. We hope and trust that farming communities will make very thorough use of this opportunity. We are very grateful to the Department of Bantu Education in this regard. While we are grateful for the training opportunities created for people to be able to work with these large capital investments, it is probably also necessary to appeal here to farmers to support those schemes. This, to me, is very important. If various Government departments support these training centres and if support for these training centres is forthcoming from the farmer himself, then I think it is also necessary to appeal to the big firms responsible for the marketing of farming implements and tractors, and to tell them that the time has now come for them to make part of their profits available for the training of our farm labourers.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Kimberley North mentioned certain efforts which have been made by the Government, more specifically by the Departments of Bantu Administration and Development and of Agriculture to train a non-White labour force for the farmers in this country. He made the point that up to now it has been the farmers who have had to do all this training. I see the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development is congratulating the hon. member on his speech. I want to ask that hon. Deputy Minister: Is he satisfied that he is doing enough in this sphere? I do not believe that he is. [Interjections.] He knows and other members who are making a noise at the moment know that for years and years we on this side of the House have pleaded for exactly the things about which the member has now been talking. For how many years did the previous hon. member for South Coast, Mr. Douglas Mitchell, not plead for this? As long as he was in this House, he pleaded fox it. At last we are getting a little bit of daylight, and for that we are grateful. We are thankful for small mercies.</p>

<p>I want to say too that I can agree with the hon. member for Potgietersrus in his representations to the Government for the training of our own people. I briefly want to refer to the hon. member for Parktown too, and say that I am very glad to have support from him and from his party for the pleas which we have made repeatedly in this House, particularly during this session. The hon. the Minister will recollect the <i>contretemps</i> we had here during the Budget debate over this very subject of high prices of agricultural products, particularly the gap between the producer price and the consumer price.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the point I had reached yesterday in drawing the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the situation in the dairy industry today. I had just come to the stage where I said that he should not view the position with any equanimity at all. The situation is serious because the number of dairy herds continues to fall too rapidly. It remains to be seen whether the recent increases which he has allowed will put a stop to this. I know that he has increased the price by 46% in the last two years, and by 36%, I think, in the last 10 or 12 months; I am not certain exactly how much. However, the violent inflationary spiral in the last 18 months has placed the dairy industry in a complex situation. The policy in the past has been to review the prices approximately every two years. It is true that we have had three increases in the past two years, but I believe that a review of milk producer prices every two years will not do. The hon. the Minister has to accept as policy that he will review the consumer prices, with which I am dealing now, at shorter intervals until such time as the pressure is taken off the farming sector. It is no good thinking that he can wait two years, until there is an outcry from the farmers or until there is a shortage of milk before he reviews the price. I believe that he has to adopt a policy of a regular review of the producer price of milk and other dairy products. But what is the effect on the consumer? Yesterday I mentioned <span class="col_5547-5548" refersTo="page_0464"/>the increase in the consumption of milk in the Durban area alone. It is estimated that the housewives of Durban this year will pay an extra R3 million for the milk they consume. They will pay R3 million more than last year. I do not believe that the housewives can afford it. As I have said, it is iniquitous to expect that in this country of ours with its luscious veld, we have to pay more for milk than we pay for Coke. I believe that it is the duty of this hon. Minister to subsidize the consumption of milk; because the alternative is going to be that our people, particularly those of the lower income group, are going to revert to buying Coke and other mineral waters instead of buying the milk that they should have. I believe that milk must be subsidized as a basic foodstuff supplying the highest quality protein available. Serious consideration must be given to a consumer subsidy on milk. It could prove to be sound national economics from a health point of view, when you think of deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkor and tuberculosis and the amounts which are spent on them. My medical friends tell me that it costs 40 times more to cure a child from a deficiency disease than to prevent that disease. I believe that this subsidy would be an investment in the national interest. It is absolutely essential that we have basic foods available to our less-privileged people at the lowest possible price.</p>

<p>I know the hon. the Minister has practical problems in this regard. First of all, he will ask how and at which point the subsidy should be applied. I want to say to him that he can pay that subsidy at exactly the same point as he pays the subsidy on cream, viz. at the creamery or the dairy which is the distribution centre for the milk in the controlled areas, and in Natal, at the co-operative societies, who undertake most of the distribution of milk in Natal. I do not believe that there is any practical or physical problem in relation to a subsidy on milk. In a statement which the hon. the Minister issued I think a little earlier this year&#x2014;unfortunately it has no date on it&#x2014;he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because increases in the cost of living cause concern and it is its policy to limit such increases as far as possible, the Government has very seriously considered subsidizing the consumer price of fresh milk. All fresh milk is, however, not produced and marketed in controlled areas and accordingly the institution of such a subsidy had been found impracticable.</block>

<p>On the impracticability aspect of this matter, I think I have told him that as far as the controlled areas are concerned&#x2014;and he will agree with me&#x2014;and in those areas of Natal and the Eastern Cape which are controlled by co-operatives, there are no practical difficulties. The only problem which remains is in relation to the uncontrolled areas. However, I do not believe that any problem exists in the uncontrolled areas. Milk in the uncontrolled areas is not being sold at 25 cents a litre. It is being sold at way below 20 cents a litre. Therefore, I do not believe that this need impede the hon. the Minister in providing a subsidy for these people. According to the figures of the hon. the Minister himself, R10 million per annum would reduce the price of milk in the controlled areas by one cent per litre. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether R30 million is too high a price to pay for the future health of our young people. It is the young people particularly who are going to suffer because of the higher price of milk. Families will not have the money to buy the milk for their children. I also believe that the hon. the Minister must consider reintroducing the milk-feeding scheme for schoolchildren of all races. This is a scheme which was suspended some years ago. The scheme was subsidized by his department and I believe he should consider its reintroduction because our young people in this country need this health-giving food. I am afraid that the hon. the Minister cannot ignore the nourishing qualities of milk and must consider any investment by way of subsidy as an essential investment in preventive medicine in relation to the health of our country.</p>

<p>A little earlier in the debate, the hon. member for Omaruru dealt with the question of red meat. He pointed out that 13% of the red meat consumed in South Africa today comes from South-West Africa and other neighbouring territories. He also pointed out that the cattle population had dropped by something in excess of 600 000 head. He then made a plea to the hon. the Minister which I can support. However, I want to ask the hon. member why I did not get his support when we were discussing the Railway Budget. When we were discussing the Railway Budget, I pointed out <span class="col_5549-5550" refersTo="page_0465"/>that the 60% increase in the tariff for the conveyance of livestock was going to amount to between R8 and R9 per head of stock. I was slightly out in my estimate because the hon. member says that it is between R7 and R8 per head from South-West Africa. I was howled down by those hon. members opposite. I got no support from them at all.</p>

<p>I am very glad that at last the penny has dropped and that hon. members opposite are at last beginning to realize what these tariff increases mean. In replying to a question the other day, the hon. the Minister said that the Livestock and Meat Industries Control Board had agreed to the importation of 300 tons of beef from Europe. According to the figures which the hon. the Minister gave us, this is coming through at a very, very competitive price. I do not want to urge the hon. the Minister to import meat with the purpose of reducing the domestic price in South Africa at all. I believe that a policy of importation in order to depress prices in this country would be a wrong one because we have to have a stimulus for the producer to produce. It is no good the consumer complaining about prices if the producer is not going to produce.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister has done the right thing in allowing the importation of this meat. Why, however, have only 300 tons been imported? How far is that going to go towards alleviating the shortage? As far as I am concerned, he is importing for the purpose of meeting the demand which exists today and in this respect I must say to him, well done! However, why limit it to only 300 tons? Is it his intention to import more? Similarly, we are faced with the position at the moment where the supply of mutton is also not meeting the demand. This is one of the reasons why the price is so high. Let us stabilize the price with importation, importation, as I say, not to reduce the price but simply to meet the demand. I want to issue a warning, too, to the Livestock and Meat Industry Control Board through the hon. the Minister. A few years ago we had the situation where mutton was imported from New Zealand but a year after it was imported we still had it in our cold rooms. It had not been sold. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Interesting things happen in this House every day. Just fancy, Sir, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South accusing other members here this afternoon of &#x201C;making a noise&#x201D;. I really think the hon. member will pardon me for being unable to give him any reply to a noise, because that is something I really have not yet learnt to do. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, time and again in the course of this debate I have heard that there are critical food shortages in the world and that we in the Republic of South Africa cannot escape this food shortage; I certainly agree wholeheartedly with this. This food shortage is the more serious if we consider that we are also experiencing a population explosion. It is therefore very logical that we may not waste food and that we should also do everything in our power to consume food judiciously. Bearing this in mind, I should like to draw attention, tonight, to a similar population explosion that is taking place among dogs. I want to maintain that the large number of dogs we have in the Republic of South Africa also creates a problem in regard to this very same question of the food produced here, and, in fact, in any other country, particularly if one bears in mind that these dogs, and the stray dogs in particular, can also cause great damage by attacking the farmers&#x2019; sheep. I believe that this is a nation-wide problem and it is for that reason that I raise it in this House this evening.</p>

<p>I discovered the following shocking figures relating to the breeding of dogs, in a survey made by the Animal Anti-cruelty League, beginning with one bitch. We find that such a bitch can bring into the world in one year a litter of four puppies, of which, say, two are bitches. When we come to the second year, we find that these first and second generation bitches can bring an average of 12 puppies into the world of which, say, six are bitches. If we go on to the third year, we find that these three generations of bitches can give birth to approximately 36 puppies, of which, say, 18 are bitches. If we go on to the fourth year, we find that these fourth generation bitches can bring 108 puppies into the world, of which, say, 54 are bitches. [Interjections.] If we take into account the fact that in four years&#x2019; time we therefore have a breeding figure of 108 from one original bitch, you will agree with me that we have a major problem on our hands in this regard. I have made it my business to find out about the number of dogs here in Cape <span class="col_5551-5552" refersTo="page_0466"/>Town and its vicinity. In Cape Town itself, 70 758 dogs were licensed last year.</p>

<speech by="#clase">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will not understand, after all. Apart from those 70 758 dogs that are licensed, there were 5 200 unlicensed dogs in 1973 that were taken away from their owners, 4 500 of which were gassed. But I also contacted a few of the municipal authorities in the immediate vicinity of Cape Town, closest to Cape Town, and after contacting the sixth municipality I arrived at a figure of over 90 000 licensed dogs and over 10 000 unlicensed dogs. This means, therefore, that here in Cape Town and in six other local managements there are more than 100 000 dogs. Now will you agree with me, Sir, that this enormous dog population must create serious problems, three of which I just want to mention briefly.</p>

<p>In the first place they eat an enormous amount. In the light of what the hon. member said yesterday, viz. that in America we find that 25% of the tinned fish is eaten by cats, you will realize that we have a serious problem on our hands. In contrast we have a country like China where, I am told, they are saddled with a serious food shortage and a large population, but there are virtually no dogs or cats. In the second place we also find that these stray dogs create a major problem because they are starved, and in order to satisfy their hunger they cause damage, particularly in the country areas, where they visit farmers&#x2019; kraals and sometimes cause a great deal of damage by attacking the sheep. There is a third aspect, too, arising out of this, namely that this enormous number of dogs must necessarily be exposed to ill-treatment, too, owing to the fact that many uncared-for dogs do in fact lead a dog&#x2019;s life. They are starved, and injured and have to bear cold and heat. Sometimes they are killed in a cruel way be poisoning or shooting. I believe that this situation is due to irresponsible owners who do not ensure that numbers are limited, and to inadequate control and supervision being exercised over the breeding of dogs, in particular, by the responsible bodies. It is in the non-White areas in particular that ill-treatment of animals occurs most often and that is where the &#x201C;sheep catchers&#x201D; usually come from. I am not reproaching the animal lover. In fact, to me there is nothing finer than a close friendship between the owner and his dog. But that is not where the problem lies. The problem lies with the irresponsible owner who has neither a true love of dogs nor the financial means to care for his dogs properly. I believe that this major problem is steadily gathering momentum and a solution for it must be found. In all humility I want to mention a few possible examples.</p>

<p>I believe that breeding must be controlled, even though this should mean that there would have to be compulsory sterilization and even though the State would have to subsidize that sterilization. [Interjections.] Steps should also be taken in regard to the number of dogs an owner may possess. I believe that the number should also be limited to prevent an owner from simply keeping as many dogs as he likes. Local regulations must also be applied more strictly.</p>

<p>But there are a few other bodies, too, which I want to mention. The Animal Protection Societies are very often blamed for the situation. This, I think, is unfair because the task of the Animal Protection Societies is not to control the number of dogs, but only to ensure that the dogs are not ill-treated. I have praise for the work these people do, because it is done on a voluntary basis. It is for that very reason that it sometimes occurs that the work cannot be done well because, if a person who has taken a real interest in this, leaves, we find that the work once again suffers in consequence and that many problems are experienced. They are also dependent on donations for the work they perform. I think the time is ripe for us to help these people, for example by increasing the subsidy paid to them. But I also want to maintain that the owners of the dogs must themselves be trained to take good care of their dogs. The local managements must accept responsibility, because it is the local management that receives the licence fees. In my opinion it is for them to accept responsibility and control breeding. The newly established Bantu Administration Boards can make a major contribution on the farms, and this applies to the farmers&#x2019; associations too. Mr. Chairman. I want to conclude by telling you that this problem is a wide-ranging one, and that is why I make the plea today that a vigorous investigation <span class="col_5553-5554" refersTo="page_0467"/>into this problem and, its solution be undertaken.

<p>Sir, we have the greatest appreciation for the sober approach of the hon. member for Virginia. I just want to give him the assurance that I am pleased that my children&#x2019;s pets are not in the Free State.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when, with exceptional altruism, I address a few words to my immediate predecessor this evening, hon. members should not take it amiss of me. My immediate predecessor in my constituency is the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, who is here in our midst this evening. Sir, history has taught us that our predecessors in the constituency of Standerton have played an exceptional role in this House. Outstanding tributes have been paid to these predecessors of ours. On a site very close to this building stands an equestrian statue of General Botha, and a little higher up in the Gardens there is a statue of General Smuts. I just want to say in passing, that if the United Party supporters are going to erect a statue like that for our Minister, he will certainly withdraw all existing subsidies. We want to convey our sincere appreciation to our Minister, his Deputy and the department&#x2019;s officials for the prestige they have built into our agricultural industry. I think we can say tonight, very proudly and without any fear of contradiction&#x2014;and I am convinced that the Opposition parties will agree because they have certainly never ever had a Minister like the one sitting here in our midst this evening&#x2014;that those people have endowed our agriculture with such prestige that the word &#x201C;farmer&#x201D; arouses real pride in everyone today. If a man tells you &#x201C;I am a farmer&#x201D;, one immediately envies him. But Sir, this has not always been the case with our farmers in our country, and we want to thank the officials for their contribution in this regard. What we have had from them, has not just been empty lip-service. The various departments have proved this through research and the results they achieve. As far as research is concerned, we can but mention the concept of Onderstepoort. Onderstepoort is so world-famous that Americans know where Onderstepoort is, while they think of Pretoria as a little place near Onderstepoort. Sir, we have in mind, too, research at Mara where the strains of herds of cattle are improved. The Bonsmara is world-renowned; people from Rhodesia pay very large sums of money for cattle of this breed. We also have in mind the wool research at Grahamstown; the research work at Nelspruit, where the combating of greening in citrus is a world break-through. We have in mind the wheat cultivars that have been improved at an experimental site near Groblersdal; freshwater fish research in South Africa, with a view to establishing freshwater fish farming in the interior in South Africa, where carp of an improved strain are made available to farmers to supply their dams. Sir, I could mention an experiment in the colder region of the Eastern Transvaal, where the Winkelhaak Mines pump their surplus water into Leeupan and where the carp of an improved strain are fed into Leeupan. Waste food from the mine compounds is fed into the dam as feed for the fish, and every two weeks the mine management nets between one and two tons of fish&#x2014;fresh, good food for their compounds&#x2014;from that water. This is a resource that is standing on the threshold of exploitation and development in this country, and it is a particularly profitable source, as one finds when one reads the lectures and the research documents in that regard. Sir, I want to refer briefly to the concept very often mentioned in this House, namely that we are heading for a shortage of food for the people. When they talk about the feeding of a people, we should draw a delicate distinction between the feeding of a people and the fattening of the people. I do not believe that it has ever been the task and the purpose of our agriculture and our farmers to make a people fat, because if one makes it fat, one makes it unhealthy. There is imbalance as far as expenditure on food is concerned. Most of our people do not realize that every body has a characteristic rhythm for food consumption, and a food metabolism. In other words, what the body can us as energy and as food for cell growth it uses, but the rest it stores somewhere. Usually it stores either in front or behind. This is a delicate matter; it causes us great problems. In the end a person with incorrect eating habits turns to doctors and psychiatrists, and they do not tell him that he is fat: they tell him &#x201C;You are a little overweight&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that we should ask for publicity for good eating habits; I think that we should ask that information be distributed to our people to enable them to know how to spend so that they can feed their families correctly and give them the maximum energy so that they can be healthy in order to work. Sir, this also brings us closer to the ideal of our Department of Sport and Recreation. The more people who eat more healthily, the less they need worry about special exercise; this gives us a balance in our whole structure. We want to ask that our dietetic services receive more attention. Here I have in mind the particularly good service provided recently to hotels, hostels etc. by dieticians from our Dried Bean Control Board, with the aim of giving our people useful hints.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with interest to the short speech made by the hon. member for Houghton this afternoon. I regret that the hon. member is not in her seat. I found her speech not only interesting but rather depressing. In fact, her performance this afternoon in relation to agriculture was, I believe, tragic. I do not know whom the hon. member was trying to impress in this House, but she certainly did not impress anybody who has had anything to do with agriculture in South Africa. She dealt with the wages paid to farm labourers. Mr. Chairman, it is quite obvious that the hon. member does not understand the formula used by farmers and how they go about deciding what wages to pay their labourers. I know of only one other speech she has ever made in this House on agriculture since I have been here. Today&#x2019;s speech was the second. As I have said, her performance was tragic. The farmers usually work on the advice and the guidance of the Farmers&#x2019; Associations and on the advice of their particular local labour bureaux. If the farmer is paying wages below the average, he very soon finds himself without any labourers at all. I wonder whether the hon. member for Houghton knows what farmers are paying shearers today to shear their sheep. I wonder whether she knows how much they are being paid and how they are being fed. I wonder whether she knows that they get one slaughter sheep out of every thousand as well. I do not think the hon. member has the foggiest idea of what is going on in agriculture today. I want to mention, as an agriculturist myself, that upon numerous occasions, when I have wanted to dismiss labourers, they have refused to go. I wonder whether the hon. member for Houghton has ever dismissed a garden boy or a domestic servant only to find that the servants have refused to go. We on the farms find this happening. Often, when we dismiss labourers for various reasons, they simply say: &#x201C;Baas, jy kan maar nou s&#x00EA; wat jy wil en jy kan doen wat jy wil, maar ek gaan nie weg nie. Ek bly hierso.&#x201D; In fact, one labourer said: &#x201C;Baas, jy kan my liewer doodskiet, maar weg gaan ek nie.&#x201D; It surprises me that the hon. member for Houghton should stand up here today and accuse agriculturists not of ill-treating, but of underpaying their farm labourers. She went on to say, and I quote from her Hansard:</p>

<block name="quote">We have had an enormous Emigration of Whites off the land. Today something like 85% of the White population of South Africa is in the urban areas.</block>

<p>I agree with that statement. On the other hand, however, the Black people in the rural areas have been on the increase. To my knowledge&#x2014;and I attend many Farmers&#x2019; Association meetings,&#x2014;and I have even attended farmers&#x2019; congresses&#x2014;our Black people on the platteland are a very happy people, very happy indeed. As I have said, just try and chase them off a farm for any reason and see if they will go. There are also many fringe benefits which they receive.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I have no more time for quotations, but I have here my own labour pay sheet. When one sees what they receive in fringe benefits, one realizes that they are well paid. In fact, I am not ashamed to show these figures to anybody in South Africa, and that goes for the hon. member for Houghton as well. She evidently came along here today to discuss <span class="col_5557-5558" refersTo="page_0469"/>something which she does not understand. I agree with her; it is correct that recently the local labour bureau has enforced the registration of all farm labourers. Here I have a copy which I received. I received a copy for each farm labourer. Today a farm labourer who is registered as an agricultural labourer must remain in agriculture, but I have not heard any of those labourers complain about it. In fact, before this regulation was enforced, I found that some of the Black people from the villages moved back to the farms because they believe that they are well treated on the farms. Then one must consider the fringe benefits, such as fresh meat, which they receive regularly, fresh milk and vegetables, etc. If they want to plough their own little pieces of land, who but the farmer supplies the machinery and the fuel to do that? The farmer is only too pleased to do it. All this is done in the farmer&#x2019;s time and not on Sundays or Saturdays when they have the day off. I believe that the hon. member for Houghton should acquaint herself better as to the conditions on South African farms before she comes and shoots her neck off in this hon. House. I do not know whom she was trying to impress; I really do not know, but she is not going to impress the farm labourer at all.</p>

<p>I want to go on to another matter which I believe warrants discussion in this House. I should like the hon. the Minister to listen to this. Two years ago the Government imported mutton and unfortunately we had to keep it in deep-freeze for some 12 months. This mutton was marketed for only 10 cents less than fresh mutton was marketed for in this country. The problem was that the consumer of mutton did not want to buy this frozen mutton for only 10 cents less than what they could pay for fresh mutton. The difference was too small. We shall be importing beef very soon, but before doing so we shall have to see to it&#x2014;and I appeal to the hon. the Minister to bear this in mind&#x2014;that the difference in price between the frozen beef and fresh beef will have to be greater, otherwise we shall not be able to sell it. In the end we shall find ourselves saddled, as was the case with the mutton, with so much beef that we shall have to give it away or sell it at a loss in order to dispose of it.</p>

<p>I want to come to another item which I mentioned yesterday but which I could not elaborate on because my time expired. I refer to loans from the Land Bank. As hon. members know, at present most applications are granted by the Land Bank for loans which are payable over a period of 20 years or less. I think that the Land Bank must reconsider this. In the past the farmers received bonds for up to 30 and 35 years. Now these loans are being cut down and in almost every instance the loans are being cut down to a maximum redemption period of 20 years. We find that the redemption payments, together with the interest, and the insurance, are very high. The farmers, particularly the young farmers, find it almost impossible to pay off their bonds within 20 years. This is not only applicable to the established farmers, but is is also applicable to young farmers who are starting in agriculture today. They can only get a bond with a redemption period of 20 years, if they are lucky, because sometimes the period is even shorter. We appreciate that the Land Bank is doing a tremendous amount to encourage our young men to remain on the farms. We also appreciate what the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure are doing with their short-term loans of 5%, but I should like the hon. the Minister and the department to bear in mind the possibility of increasing the period for the redemption of the loan to more than 20 years, as is the case generally today.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member must excuse me if I do not follow the thread of his argument in the limited time at my disposal. I should like to refer to unimproved State properties in municipal areas. It is generally known that the State&#x2014;and when I say that I include the provincial administrations&#x2014;possess a great many properties in the country&#x2019;s municipal areas. I think the problem I want to raise affects virtually every city council or municipal area in the country. These properties belonging to the State are for the most part acquired by way of donation where new residential areas are established. In some cases the properties were probably bought by the State. It happens, too that some of that State-owned land sometimes lies vacant for years before being used for some purpose by the State. For the purpose of my argument, I should like to use Boksburg as an example. At the moment, 75 pieces of unimproved State land fall within the municipal boundaries of Boksburg. Of those 75 pieces of land, there are 22 that have been vacant for 85 years. I can also mention that nine of them have been vacant for 60 years and another <span class="col_5559-5560" refersTo="page_0470"/>nine for 51 years. It is also of interest to know that of these 75 pieces of land in Boksburg, 13 of them comprise only 2 500 square feet and 11 of them, 5 000 square feet. They are therefore very small pieces of land which could really serve no useful purpose to the State, whatever use it might have in mind for them. The total valuation of that land, according to the latest valuation, amounts to R191 000, involving a loss in rates for the City Council of Boksburg amounting to R9 500 per annum.</p>

<p>I know that it is the procedure that when a local authority requires that State-owned land, the land in question is first offered to each Government department and to the provincial administration. If not one of them requires it, it is offered to the local authority, expropriated at market value and then they may use it for the purpose for which they require it. I want to say at once that I am not in favour of the State disposing of all the land it possesses, for at one time or another it may require it again. In the light of what I have already said, namely that there is land that has been lying unused for more than 80 years and is so small in extent that it will never be required by the State or by the local authority, I want to ask whether a survey of unimproved State properties in municipal areas could not possibly be made at some time or another. Where it is found that the land in question is not required by Government departments or local authorities, I should like to suggest that that land be made available to the public, either by public auction or by way of tender. I ask this because it is only with difficulty that these pieces of land in the towns are kept free of the weeds that grow there. In many cases those pieces of land serve as nothing but dumping grounds for rubbish. This spoils residential areas. What is more, that land can also serve as a source of income for our city councils. [Interjection.] As the hon. member said, those pieces of land usually serve as the hiding and sleeping places of loafers.</p>

<p>Then I should like to touch on another minor subject. It is in regard to meat. A great deal has been said here about the consumption and marketing of red meat. I can give you the assurance, Sir, that I am probably one of the biggest consumers of red meat in this House. I should therefore like to bring a certain matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister in this regard. Let me say at the outset that I think that we should accept that the price of meat will never again be what it was in the past. I think we should accept that the era of cheap meat is gone forever. I want to say at once that I am in favour of the producer getting a paying price for his product. It is right that this should be so. I think that most consumers also accept that the producer should command a reasonable price and that the prices should not go back to what they were before.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before we adjourned for dinner, I said that we should accept that meat prices will not go back to what they were. I think the consumer has accepted this too. But now I want to add that in view of prevailing prices, if one buys meat or goes to eat somewhere one certainly expects value for one&#x2019;s money. It is in this very sphere that the most flagrant exploitation of the public is taking place. I want to give you a few examples. Hon. members have probably all had a similar experience. One goes to a restaurant or to some eating place and orders rump steak, but I wonder how many people really get rump steak. Sometimes it seems to me as if they have simply cut the meat off the shin. As long as there is no bone with the meat, it is put before you as rump-steak, and one just has to be satisfied with it. After all, these days it has become the fashion for the chain stores to sell meat as well. It is there that the greatest amount of swindling takes place with this so-called &#x201C;packing&#x201D; of theirs. Packets of meat lie ready to be selected by the housewife. I have seen this happen innumerable times. The contents of certain packets is slated to be loin chops. The top few pieces really look as if they are, too; but just scratch around at the bottom of that pack and see what you find there. It will be anything but loin chops. I want to give an example. The week before last, my wife was at one of these small chain stores. The packet was labelled &#x201C;Leg of pork&#x201D;. It was very neatly packed. It looked wonderful, too. When she got home, however, she found a piece of chop attached to the leg of pork. Where that pig was bred, I really don&#x2019;t know.</p>

<p>One of our Afrikaans newspapers made a random test of sausage. After all, it has become the fashion these days for every <span class="col_5561-5562" refersTo="page_0471"/>thing to be boerewors. The contents of those concoctions was then ascertained. I do not want to bore you with them. I shall just mention the best example to you. Say for example that we were to make sausage out of this Opposition. Imagine, Mr. Chairman, that the Old Guard would be used for the meat. It would be rather poor quality, of course. The Young Turks would be added as fat, for the rancidity.</p>

There ought to be a degree of control at the restaurants or at other eating places where one can order meat. I would not say that a check should be made everywhere, but I do think that by making random tests here and there, the public could perhaps get better value for their money. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand that when Daniel was helped out of the lion&#x2019;s den, they asked him what he had done to prevent the lions from devouring him, to which he replied, &#x201C;I told them they could have me, but that when they had finished eating, they would have to make a speech.&#x201D; I now find myself in the same invidious position, namely that I have just finished eating and now have to make a speech.</p>

<p>After we have had difficulty in chewing the sausage made for us by the hon. member for Boksburg, I should now like to proceed to refer briefly in this debate on agriculture, which really seems to be more of an agricultural congress, to a few things hon. members have already delivered themselves of here. I do not want to refer to a member of the Opposition, but it really grieves me that I have to refer to one of the hon. members on this side of the House. However, I cannot allow this to pass, because I am afraid the hon. the Minister himself will not refer to it. I want to refer to the hon. member for Somerset East who has now linked red wine with hangovers. These two things do not belong together at ail. For the sake of the record I just want to set this matter straight. The hon. member for Orange Grove said that housewives did not have a good year last years. However, the farmers really are not to blame for this. Nor do I think the Department of Agriculture or the hon. the Minister is to blame for it. When one talks about agriculture, one talks about the most important industry there is. Should one have listened to the speeches made here today and yesterday, one could most definitely have gained the impression that we were dealing here with an industry which is absolutely of the greatest importance because it produces what is of primary importance to man&#x2019;s continued existence, namely food. We are dealing with an industry with a special character and with special problems. I know of no country in the world&#x2014;if there is one I should be pleased if someone would correct me&#x2014;where the agricultural industry stands on its own legs, independent of the state. But I am also unaware of any country in the world where the agricultural industry has been fully nationalized successfully. I believe that we in this country, under National Party regime, under the regime of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, have succeeded in laying down a policy which is an excellent compromise between free competition and freedom in practising this industry on the one hand and state interference in the industry on the other hand. It is good that this is so, because this industry is important for the continued existence of our people and our country. It is an industry which is practised by people who do it out of love for the industry and by people who place a very high premium on the way of life of the farmer. They are people who are prepared to forfeit income for the sake of the population of the country. It is an industry which has dose ties with nature and which is dependent on circumstances in nature. The result is that we have to deal with the surpluses and shortages in this industry. As a matter of faco, Joseph had them back in the time of Pharaoh. I just do not know who built the silos at the time. The person who does not want to face these fluctuations in the industry, should not be in the industry, because it is primary to this industry that we sometimes have to cope with surpluses and sometimes with short-ages. <span class="col_5563-5564" refersTo="page_0472"/>We have to deal with perishable produce which is difficult to store, as well as with demand and supply, which is a difficult matter to regulate. It is an extremely difficult matter to regulate the demand and supply in this industry to the satisfaction of everybody. For many years already an ideal solution to the problems of the agricultural industry, and more specifically to the marketing and financing problems of this industry, is being sought in many countries of the world. All over the world the agricultural industry has from the earliest times been exploited by profit-seeking capitalistic undertakings because of its weak bargaining position. As a reaction against this exploitation, the co-operative movement came into being. In my view the co-operative movement has made a greater contribution to the upliftment of the farming community than has anything else. Every farmer sitting here can take stock of his own position and see how important his local co-operative is in his area. As a result of this individual farmers were capable of better farming methods, greater productivity and a better distribution of available food supplies throughout the world. Especially in the present juncture this distribution of food supplies is of cardinal importance to us. The potential of this form of enterprise was appreciated by the state, and in all Western countries in which a free capitalistic system obtains co-operatives are accepted also protected by the State. They are accepted by the state because a responsible government proceeds on the view, firstly, that a strong component of one&#x2019;s population must remain in the rural areas and, secondly, that this component in the rural areas is also entitled to make a living income from their industry. The co-operative is that one body which assists in making this possible. Because co-operatives are part of the agricultural industry, they are entitled to the protection of the Government. The problems of the farmer are the problems of the co-operative, because, as I am saying, it is an extension of the industry. If an agricultural co-operative negotiates a loan to supply its members with working capital, and the crop fails&#x2014;and sometimes it does fail; it failed back in the time of Joseph&#x2014;what happens then? Then, in the first place, the co-operative is responsible for the burden it incurred for the sake of its members. It is responsible for the repayment of the borrowed money. I believe that the value of a co-operative society can no longer be called into question. Its value has been proved over and over again, locally and also abroad. We are aware that complaints are often heard about the place taken by the agricultural co-operatives in our national economy. The argument is advanced that through the establishment of boards of control in terms of the Marketing Act, the co-operative has now lost its marketing function to a large extent, that it has disappeared because it has lost its function of price determination in many cases, I want to make it very clear that apart from the marketing aspect, there are still numerous functions that are being fulfilled by the co-operatives. It acts as the agent of the board of control; it has to provide for the storage and handling of one&#x2019;s products. It has numerous other important functions, <i>inter alia,</i> the provision of requirements for the industry at reasonable prices in order that the industry may produce at reasonable prices. There are extension services that are being provided and, what is also very important, there are short term financing services that are being provided. This can only happen if there is no overlapping of co-operative services. We want to ask the hon. the Minister very courteously to see to it that there is no overlapping of co-operatives as this only pushes up costs. But, in the second place, Sir, if the co-operative cannot obtain inexpensive funds, it cannot cope with this short-term financing; then it cannot finance its members. Sir, the co-operative has to do this over a very wide field. If we should withdraw our assistance to co-operatives today, I believe that many of our farmers would be in trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Malmesbury, who has just resumed his seat, complained at the start of his speech that he had just eaten and had to make a speech so soon after his dinner. I want to tell him that he made a very fine after-dinner speech, and he actually did so without burring. This is something exceptional coming from the Malmesbury district. Sir, just as the hon. member for Malmesbury did, I also want to enlarge a little on what was said here by previous speakers, before I come to the crux of the matter. The first member I want to refer to is the hon. member for Fauresmith; I am glad that he is here. He made a wonderful plea here in respect of the extermination of gnats (<i>muggies</i>) in his constituency. I am only sorry that he did <span class="col_5565-5566" refersTo="page_0473"/>not make that speech in English, for a &#x201C;muggie&#x201D; is a &#x201C;gnat&#x201D; in English, and it would most decidedly have affected his majority in his constituency if he had spoken about exterminating the &#x201C;Nats&#x201D; in his constituency.</p>

<p>Next I come to the hon. member for Standerton, who said that the people should get used to eating less; that our goal is to feed the people, not to fatten them. I liked his story about the one-ton truck which had to carry a seven-ton load. We on this side of the House are in complete agreement with him, for the South African is inclined to over-eat and our restaurants are inclined to provide too much food at too high a price. This evening I want to appeal to restaurants to provide a little less food at a slightly lower price so that these things may be distributed more evenly among the people of South Africa. The days of the doggy-bag are over; we have to feed our people; we should not order an enormous steak, only eat a quarter of it and then ask for a doggy-bag so as to take the rest home for the dog; those days are over, and I am in full agreement with the hon. member for Standerton.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, arising out of what I said here earlier today, I want to ask the Minister very courteously to convey this story to his colleague the hon. the Minister of National Education, for the point at issue here is university training at Rhodes University. Sir, in my maiden speech in this House I pleaded for a second faculty of veterinary science in the Eastern Province. I do not want to repeat that speech here tonight; it was a very fine speech, and I am sure there are many hon. members on that side of the House who agree with me in this regard. The present shortage of veterinary surgeons in South Africa makes it imperative that we open a second faculty, and I am asking the hon. the Minister very courteously to convey this request to his colleague and to give it his full support. Sir, then there is another matter in respect of which I think we require the support of Agriculture at Rhodes University. In this regard I should just like to quote from the newsletter of the <i>Rhodes Development Programme</i> of 1 May 1974&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A new major course in agricultural economics has been introduced at Rhodes University and already 19 students are reading for the first course which is offered in the second academic year of study.</block>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, this is a course in agricultural economics, and in charge of that course is a gentleman who was trained by the Department of Agricultural Economics, Mr. Geoffrey Antrobus, a young man, a Young Turk, in agriculture who is now an academic. He has developed this course and I think it is something that needs watching and that we should develop much further. In the first year the course includes sections on agricultural production economics, farm business management and the marketing of agricultural products. In the second year the course is divided into three papers embracing the economics of agricultural production and resource use, agricultural price analysis and problems in agricultural development.</p>

<p>*Now, Sir, I believe that all of these are important matters in the development of agriculture in South Africa. On a previous occasion I said in this House that a man could receive technical training in the sphere of agriculture. If he does not have business acumen and if he does not have the ability to manage his business affairs, he could be trained technically right up to doctorate level and still be an uneconomic unit on the best farm in South Africa. I ask the hon. the Minister tonight to convey to his colleague the Minister of Education the message in connection with this new development at that university, and to tell him to support this thing for he has the full support of the agriculturists. This type of training is very necessary not only among the members of our farming community, but also among those who advise or those who have dealings with our farming community. An acquaintance with the farming community is very necessary in South Africa. We had proof of this here this afternoon when the hon. member for Houghton made such a fine speech about something she knew very little about. Had she perhaps completed a course of this nature, the hon. member might have known far more about it. I am asking the hon. the Minister to give his full support to this development at the university. In the few minutes I have left, I want to raise something which I believe is of great importance to farming in South Africa, i.e. the fact that the stud-breeder in South Africa is not compelled today to <span class="col_5567-5568" refersTo="page_0474"/>have his herd tested for tuberculosis. I think this is something which should receive the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, for we who are dairy farmers on the commercial side of the agricultural industry are in many cases compelled to have our herds tested. We are not permitted to bring untested animals to our farms. This causes major problems for the farmer who wants to diversify, who wants to go in for red meat or sheep-breeding on a smallish scale. This means quarantine camps, and it also means that those cattle or sheep have to be tested before they can be brought to the farm, for tuberculosis is a terrible thing which could infect human beings too. It is interesting to note that, whereas testing is for the most part carried out on the herds of dairy farmers, it is not done to the same extent on animals bred for meat purposes. I am pleased to see that the hon. the Minister of Health is here too. He, too, could give this some consideration. This is the position. I had a case in my constituency where a dairy farmer wanted to buy a beef bull and in fact did so. I do not want to mention names here, even though I am speaking under privilege, for I do not want to prejudice the interests of any fellow-farmer. He bought it from a well-known stud-breeder, and because his herds had been tested, he also had that bull tested. The bull was found to have tuberculosis, and when he went back to the breeder &#x2026;</p>

I think it is high time this was taken up by the department and something was done either by regulation, co-operation or legislation so that the breeders of stud-bulls will be compelled to test their herds for tuberculosis. Sir, I see my time has almost expired, and I know the Minister wants to reply. Thank you very much.</p>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should also like to talk about meat production and livestock, but before I come to that there are two matters I just want to mention briefly because I think they are important to the farming industry in South Africa. All of us are aware of the oppressive shortage of fertilizer, and I should like to make a request to the hon. the Minister to actively promote the petrochemical industry of which nitrogen is one of the important by-products, so that, as far as our fertilizer industry is concerned, we may become independent.</p>

<p>There is another aspect I just want to mention briefly. With the present needs of organized agriculture, it is becoming more and more important for the farmer to gear himself to more systematic and better production. To make this possible, electricity is one of the most important factors for him. Because farms are situated quite far apart, it is an enormous capital expenditure for a farmer to get Escom power on his farm. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot have an inquiry instituted into some system or other, possibly one which includes the subsidizing of fees for electric standards, to assist farmers in getting Escom power on their farms thereby bringing about more efficient production.</p>

<p>I now come to the livestock industry. I just want to mention a few interesting statistics at the start. In connection with the European Common Market I read the other day that the average size of a farm in the United Kingdom was 57 ha. In France, Luxemburg and Denmark the average size is 21 ha, in the Netherlands and Belgium 11 to 15 ha, in Ireland 17,5 ha, but in Italy only 7,5% ha. The average sizes of the farms have a connection with the high population figure of Europe, which has simply forced people to work more intensively. They are also able to do this because they have a different type of climate there. It is interesting to note that the average size of a farm in South Africa is 970 ha as against Britain&#x2019;s 57 ha. In 1930 there were 97 000 farms in South Africa with a total size of 83 million ha. In 1971 the number of farms decreased to 90 422, a decrease of about 7 000 farms, but the area had increased from 83 million ha to 89 million ha. Of that 89 million ha there is 11,6 million ha which is being cultivated and 1 million ha which is under irrigation. Therefore, it is necessary in my view that, in view of the population growth and the need in South Africa to provide more food for South Africa and Africa, we should progressively move in the direction of intensive farming. One of the important <span class="col_5569-5570" refersTo="page_0475"/>levels on which we shall have to improve our production substantially is that of meat production. The live stock of South Africa has since the thirties remained unchanged at about 11&#x00BD; million head of cattle, of which about 8&#x00BD; million are in White South Africa. Five years ago the White farmers&#x2019; live stock decreased to 6,7 million, but fortunately it has once again improved considerably during the past three years. This especially is apparent from the fact that breeding cattle for meat production increased by 33% over the past five years, i.e. from 2,7 million to 3,6 million. This is an encouraging sign. In my view it will become increasingly necessary for us to give attention to increasing our meat production here in South Africa.</p>

<p>According to figures I see that between 33% and 35% of America&#x2019;s total live stock is slaughtered annually. If these figures are analysed, we find that the stock is slaughtered at an average age of three years. An average percentage slaughtered annually is between 16% and 20%. This means, in turn, our stock is slaughtered at an average age of 4&#x00BD; to 5&#x00BD; years. This means, in turn, that our turnover takes so much longer to be realized. If we should give attention to those areas in South Africa where this is possible, namely in the high rainfall areas in the east coast region, which has an annual rainfall of more than 500 mm and constitutes a third of the area which is suitable for meat production, we should also give attention to the improvement of grazing and of the calving percentage, which is between 50% and 60% at the moment as against an ideal of 90%. If we could also give attention to increasing the weight at the weaning age, which can be done at the age of about six or seven months, and if we could, furthermore, give attention to the weight of livestock, especially of heifers or of breeding stock, being sufficient at that age, it would be possible to have the heifers covered by the bull at an average age of 15 to 17 months. At the moment this age is more or less three years.</p>

<p>In my view these are aspects to which scientific attention should be given, especially in those areas where this is possible. In that way we shall be able to speed up our turnover and bring about much better production of slaughter-stock. The prosperity of the farmer will also be substantially increased in that way. It is essential that attention be given to these aspects as well as to the improvement of feeding methods. For the improvement of feeding methods, better fertilizer application is necessary to improve field grazing, planted grazing and artificial feeding. I want to make a request to the hon. the Minister to give attention to encouraging farmers to a greater extent to improve their production systematically in this connection. Connected with this it is obviously necessary for farmers to keep better records and books in order that they may evaluate the data. It is no use simply not farming on a day to day basis. It should be possible to evaluate things in order that they may know exactly when something is a paying concern and when it is no longer so. In this way it will then be possible for them to curtail the unremunerative part of their farming operations and to expand the remunerative part. I am aware that in this regard considerable progress has been made in certain areas, but I nevertheless want to make an appeal that our extension officers should do a great deal more. We can only benefit by it.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. P. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I am rising to bring a few small matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister. If hon. members on the other side of the House are acting a bit strange, it can only be because there apparently is some problem on their side of the House. It seems to me as though the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South was not sure whether the sick bull the hon. member for Albany spoke of was a &#x201C;Botterbul&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It is without any hesitation whatsoever that I convey the sincere appreciation of the voters of Waterberg to the hon. the Minister for his approach ability and helpfulness. He is one of those persons who is always at the disposal of people who are in a fix or want to bring some need to his attention. It does not always happen that he says &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a request, but he says &#x201C;no&#x201D; in such a civilized and sympathetic way that it almost sounds like &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Secondly I want to appeal to him not to forget to have a look at the prices of agricultural products and especially at the prices of meat. Waterberg is largely a cattle-farming area and, at the same time, it is an area which is harassed by many plagues and many adverse conditions. Therefore, this area would welcome all the assistance possible in connection with cattle-farming <span class="col_5571-5572" refersTo="page_0476"/>and the production of meat. They are people who have to contend with chronic droughts, and with diseases such as foot and mouth disease. In addition to that, we have the ordinary production costs, the rise in the wages of labourers, and marketing costs. All these things have to be taken into consideration. We therefore want to ask the Minister to give this his thorough attention and to try and determine the best possible prices for our cattle farmers.</p>

<p>The third matter I want to refer to, is the question of financial assistance to our farming community. Over and above the commercial banks, we have two bodies in particular which are involved in this, i.e. the Land Bank and the Agricultural Credit Board. We who have to assist farmers who appeal to these bodies for assistance, sometimes have the problem that one is virtually sent from pillar to post and that one sometimes has to have a keen eye for a gap to arrive at a body which is in fact the right body to offer assistance to a farmer falling in a certain category. We know the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure assists certain categories of farmers only, but I nevertheless wondered whether there is not some way of effecting better and closer co-ordination between these two bodies, although I know that they cannot be regarded as being on the same level. I nevertheless wonder whether one cannot obtain better co-ordination in the assistance rendered by these two bodies so as to obviate one being sent from pillar to post and one having to work out in such minute details where one fits in and at which one of the bodies one is going to obtain assistance.</p>

<p>Finally, there is one small point I want to mention. We are aware of the fact that there is a major shortage of veterinary surgeons. In the Waterberg constituency, in the Ellisras area, which is a major meat-producing region, there is a need for a veterinary surgeon. We realize that veterinary surgeons are scarce, but we should nevertheless like to ask the Minister to see whether provision cannot be made in the foreseeable future for appointing a state veterinary surgeon to the district of Ellisras. Mr. Chairman, I thank you and I thank the hon. the Minister for the sympathetic hearing he has given me.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have now had two days&#x2019; debate on the three agriculture departments, and I do not intend to repeat the main points raised by this side of the House, because I think hon. members have taken note of them. I do, however, want to make use of this opportunity to tell the hon. the Minister that we welcome the fact that he has decided that an agricultural planning board is to be established. This is a matter which we on this side of the House have been advocating for a number of years, but without much success. Under the hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, Mr. Dirkie Uys, in particular, we often had a great deal of difficulty in bringing this idea home to him. For a time the hon. the Minister himself was not well-disposed to this idea either. We are pleased to see, however, that the hon. the Minister has now decided that such an agricultural planning board can in fact be established.</p>

<p>I am still going to deal with the hon. member for Houghton. I want to say at once to the hon. the Minister that the good spirit that has prevailed, owed its existence to the fact that he, his Deputy Minister, and members of his agricultural group were prepared to listen to this side of the House when our group came up with a good point in the interests of agriculture. If the hon. member, his deputy and his group are prepared to listen to us from time to time&#x2014;they need not accept everything we say on this side of the House&#x2014;but when something is proposed by us that is in the interests of agriculture, and they accept it, you will find that we on this side of the House will give them full co-operation and support. We have made this promise before. It is for this reason that we are making progress, and not talking past each other in this kind of debate. I believe, too, that we have come to a stage at which not only we, but the whole world, has become aware of what I called &#x201C;the possible food crisis&#x201D;, which we and the world are going to face as a result of the population explosion. The more urgent a problem becomes, the easier it is for hon. members on that side of the House and we on this side of the House to find one another. I believe that in the course of time we shall possibly be able to reach that situation at which we shall be able to speak to each <span class="col_5573-5574" refersTo="page_0477"/>other and not past each other, not only in the sphere of agriculture, but in other aspects of South African politics as well.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what the hon. the Minister said about his planned agricultural planning board. The hon. gentleman told us who would be appointed to this board, and we accept that as such. Now, however, I want to address a further request to the hon. the Minister. His agricultural adviser is now retiring. I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Minister said and also address a word of thanks to Dr. Faan du Plessis for the fine work he has done. After the hon. the Minister has constituted this planning board of his, he must give the board the opportunity of finding its own way in due course. If possible, we should introduce legislation to this House at one stage or another to discuss the composition of this planning board and decide on its functions. We see this board very clearly as a body that will not take over the various departments of Agriculture, but in fact, a body that will coordinate properly the functions of all these departments. Perhaps in the course of time we could even give them an agricultural financing division. I just want to conclude this point by saying that we are prepared to give such a body a chance. I hope, however, that in the course of time we shall have legislation before the House to enable us to discuss this matter thoroughly.</p>

<p>During the debate a few gentlemen also raised the point that we have raised before, namely the question whether food subsidies are essential or not. The hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Heilbron are thinking in terms of the possibility that we should rather give the farmer a decent price than consider granting food subsidies. I do not believe that there is an alternative to food subsidies. I think that we should also realize that there are millions of people in South Africa who will not be in a position to afford essential and basic foodstuffs if production costs continue to rise and the farmers were to get a decent price for their product. It is for this reason that we believe that food subsidies are the answer as far as keeping the price stable for all sections of the population concerned, and at the same time ensuring that the farmer gets a decent price for his product.</p>

<p>This has been a good debate, but it is a pity that the hon. member for Houghton should have introduced a false note into this debate. I am pleased that the hon. member is here to hear what we have to say. She said, <i>inter alia,</i> that &#x201C;Black people on White farms have apparently never been anybody&#x2019;s concern.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x2020;If the hon. member for Houghton had been here when the debate was introduced she would have heard that we on this side of the House are indeed very much concerned with the housing, salary and wage position of non-White workers on our farms. The hon. member also made certain illogical statements here. She said: &#x201C;I am not concerned about the depopulation of the platteland as far as White people are concerned.&#x201D; At the same time she said: &#x201C;You must keep the Black people on the platteland.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I am therefore entitled to ask the hon. member for Houghton, if she is prepared to see that White people leave the platteland, but that Black people must stay, who will be prepared to provide for those people?</p>

<p>*Who are the people who are still providing for them on the platteland? The hon. member is in the habit of making herself out to be the biggest liberal in South Africa, but the trouble with the hon. member for Houghton is that she is a person with the greatest degree of prejudice in South Africa. When she knows nothing about a subject, she employs this kind of tactic, viz. of making a pretence of championing the non-White on the platteland. If there is one group among our population that is concerned about the situation of our non-White labourers on our farms it is our farmers, because they are the people who live closest to these people.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, since yesterday I have <span class="col_5575-5576" refersTo="page_0478"/>listened to 52 speeches of which only one&#x2014;and the hon. member for Newton Park was quite right in this respect&#x2014;was negative. This was very encouraging, and I shall try to reply as quickly as I can to the questions which were put to me.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town referred yesterday evening to the problem which he had in obtaining an interest subsidy from a commercial bank on an overdraft or on a mortgage. This 2&#x00BD;<i>%</i> interest subsidy from the commercial bank, apart from all the other institutions from which he is able to obtain this, applies to a mortgage which is used to purchase a piece of land. However, if the commercial bank has a mortgage on a farm and this mortgage is incorporated in an open account, one cannot obtain the interest subsidy. I think it is in this respect that the hon. member does not understand the matter correctly. If this were not the case it would be possible to purchase a beach cottage with that mortgage, and we do not see our way clear to subsidizing anything of that nature. The other matter which the hon. member referred to, was that he could not use the Land Bank valuation on land when he allows his child to inherit. However, the Land Bank valuation may be used when someone sells a farm to his child. The transfer duties are then determined on the basis of a sworn valuation. When a farm is sold to a child at a very low price, the person doing so may, on the other hand, be liable to donations tax. Therefore this matter is more complicated than the hon. member is perhaps aware. I think the hon. member could bring the specific case to my personal attention so that I could look into it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lichtenburg said that the growth in agriculture was a counter to inflation. That is quite correct, and that is why we should so much like to have growth in agriculture. A subsidy of 8% on the gross value of agricultural produce is a figure to which the hon. member for Newton Park also referred. I should like to deal with this matter of a subsidy. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town asked why we were not subsidizing more foodstuffs. Let us take the case of maize. Suppose we were to subsidize the price of maize, for which the consumer is at present paying R47 per ton and the farmer is receiving R50 per ton. Suppose we then wish to increase the price next year, but keep the consumer price at R47 per ton. But a person could purchase maize and deliver it to the co-operative, for it is being subsidized, and he could make a profit of R10 per ton. It is therefore an impossible situation. We have tried this scheme before. One cannot have a wider margin than the transportation costs are going to be. It is easy to say that a subsidy should be paid, but to implement it so that it will work through as he wants it to work through, is a very difficult matter. We shall go into this matter. I should very much like the food prices to be low, and I also want the farmer to receive a good price for his produce, but I cannot simply come along here and say that I am in favour of subsidies. I have already stated on a previous occasion that the man with the key to the safe, is sitting in front of me here. It is not I who have it. The ideal situation, of course, would be for the Minister of Agriculture to be Minister of Finance as well!</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Albany raised the question of the R250 000 which was offered by the Livestock and Meat Industries Control Board to Rhodes University for the purpose of tick research. We just felt that we could not allow one board to give a quarter of a million rand to one institution for research purposes. We are sympathetic in this regard and I want to tell the hon. member that as the Secretary, Dr. Verbeek, said, the hon. member can have discussions with him on this matter. We want this research to go on and perhaps we can do this through our department. The Livestock and Meat Industries Control Board operates throughout South Africa and South West Africa and we could receive requests for financial assistance from universities throughout the country if we create a precedent of this nature.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Vryheid referred to co-operative home industries. I want to tell the hon. member that it is not all that easy to create co-operative organizations for the women who go in for home-baking, for example. I am in favour of this. However, we must bear in mind that there are registered confectioners who have obtained their licences from the Wheat Board. They would then say that the housewives were depriving them of business. The hon. member also referred to the matter of licensing in regard to free-range chickens. The housewife could simply, without going to much trouble, telephone the meat hygiene <span class="col_5577-5578" refersTo="page_0479"/>division of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and we shall give her the necessary information. It must simply be a clean place, with running water laid on, and the slaughter room should have a screen door. The place should simply be neat and clean. Then she can slaughter as many chickens as the likes. As long as it is done hygienically.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East said: Citrus for fitness. I am in full agreement with the hon. member. I know a person who ate an orange before meal every day for seven years, and who never had a cold in all that time. This is a message which we should disseminate in season and out, to keep our people healthy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni requested that we preserve our resources. He was quite correct. On the other hand, he said that we should retain the stock withdrawal scheme. That, as hon. members know, will cost us between R60 and R80 million. The hon. member said that as a result of the stock withdrawal scheme, there were people who have four lambing seasons in two years. However, we cannot continue with this scheme. It is not that we are unsympathetic either. I said yesterday evening that we would not for one moment allow our soil to deteriorate. We have spent a fortune on saving our soil, and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services will therefore go out of its way to ensure that the soil is not destroyed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Meyerton made a very good point. He said that the homelands would have to make their contribution in the production of foodstuffs. This is definitely the case. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and his departments are making the Bantu more agriculturally active, and affording them the opportunity of undertaking their own production. The exchange programme in regard to the Bantu is a matter to which we could give attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kuruman said that we should utilize State-owned land for the creation of economic units. The hon. member is aware that it is our policy, when State-owned land becomes available to consolidate adjoining units if this is practicable, but we cannot declare this to be an accepted policy, for one cannot always implement the policy in the same way in different places. But it is in fact our intention to eliminate uneconomic units, and we are in fact trying, under those circumstances, to consult the persons concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Houghton is not here at the moment.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I just want to tell the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke that what he said here was really a great encouragement to me. He told us how the farmers were really treating their non-White workers, and how a non-White worker had said to him: &#x201C;We must thank the <i>mudimo&#x201D;.</i> Sir, I still remember what was said last year to a farmer by a Bantu worker of his, when the potatoes on his farm were making a wonderful show of pink flowers; as they were driving past, the Bantu said to him: &#x201C;Our farm is really lovely this year&#x201D;. Sir, that is the feeling which exists between a farmer and his worker.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, the hon. member for Houghton started by saying that the right thing was that the uneconomic farmer must leave the platteland. She is always talking about humanity. Can&#x2019;t she show a little bit of humanity towards the White farmer, too? She does not care two pence for the uneconomic farmer who is struggling under adverse conditions. Sir, I have been a member of Parliament for eight years and not once during these eight years has the hon. member for Houghton got up and said: &#x201C;I plead with this Government to pay the farmers an economic price for their produce to enable them to pay their labourers higher wages&#x201D;. Sir, you have got to do both these things. Our farmers are prepared to pay their Native workers at least R3 a day; I know what their attitude is, but they cannot always afford it. Does that hon. member help us when we fix prices, or does she criticize us when we increase the price to the primary producer? The hon. member will never say: &#x201C;Let us help the White farmer to get a fair profit to enable him to pay higher wages to his workers.&#x201D; The hon. member says that the farm workers receive R7-20 in cash and kind and she asked me why I did not do what the agricultural unions were asking for. Sir, next week the South African Agricultural Union will be in session in Cape Town and I will be attending that meeting. I am going to give them a copy of the hon. member&#x2019;s <span class="col_5579-5580" refersTo="page_0480"/>speech, in which she said that the agricultural unions were asking me to increase wages by 25%.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member cannot hear what I am saying because she keeps on talking.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Constantia said that the Constantia Wine Farm was a showpiece. We thank him for that. Sir, the Constantia wine took the prizes on the shows in Germany and in France; they are amongst the most popular wines in the world. As the hon. member correctly said, Napoleon wrote about the Constantia wines. Sir, what I am about to say now will also answer the question raised by the hon. member for Gardens: During the next session of Parliament, in January or February, we are going to introduce a completely new Act to enable Constantia, under a separate Act, to do exactly what the hon. member for Gardens and the hon. member for Constantia asked for, and that is to make Constantia a show-piece in the sense that overseas visitors will be enabled to buy half a bottle or a little carton specially packed for them. I know that in making people stand in queues on Wednesdays to buy wine, we are making enemies of them, but we have no other solution at the moment. We must allow Constantia to operate under a separate Act and to use its profits to develop the farm. Now about the freeway at Kirstenbosch. I spoke to the Administrator of the Cape Province and he said he would consult me. He was still awaiting the final proposals of the city council. I cannot say which is the right decision to take. I did not see the plan of the freeway, but I appreciate that one does not want a botanical garden such as Kirstenbosch to be spoiled.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Bethlehem referred to increases in production costs in the determination of wheat prices. These are always taken into account, but the hon. member must be sure of one thing, viz. that I agree with him on the question of whether it is right to pay a subsidy of R&#x00BC; million per day on bread. Ask yourself, too, whether this is a healthy practice. I can say nothing further, but I think the hon. member is right. We are not treating that bread with respect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ladybrand said the available facilities for the storage of wheat were inadequate. We have obtained just over R100 million over the past five years. We are trying to obtain more in order to establish more facilities, for it is stupid and a very expensive method to harvest half a wheat or maize crop for bulk storage and then change over to bags. He requested that we do not grade Scheepers wheat as C grade wheat. Remember, the farmer who sows Scheepers wheat in his part of the world, harvests twice, and when there is a drought, he grazes his sheep on the stable as well. He therefore has wool, and meat, and then he has wheat of a slightly poorer quality. The bakers say that Scheepers wheat is C grade wheat. I will allow myself to be guided only by the Wheat Board and by the Wheat Advisory Committee, before we finally make Scheepers a C grade wheat.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fauresmith discussed the mosquito plague and future research, but the hon. member for Prieska told me in the Lobby the other day that there is a fly in the Prieska area which preys on midges. Therefore, there is now a natural enemy of the midge.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Mooi River said that the researcher at the Cedara Agricultural College does not have the incentive to lecture, and I agree with him. The principle has, however, already been implemented, because we pay a bonus to veterinary surgeons and to engineering experts to give lectures. We are going further into this matter and we will discuss it with the Minister of National Education. But the hon. member also said we must be careful not to cut the funds of the agricultural faculties, and I spoke to the hon. the Minister of National Education because we cannot afford to cut the funds available for agricultural education and I do not think he need be in the least concerned about it.</p>

<p><span class="col_5581-5582" refersTo="page_0481"/>*The hon. member for Omaruru referred to excessively low floor prices and consumer resistance in the same breath. I think the hon. member would like the floor price to be increased. He says the farmer has no incentive, because the floor price is not an encouragement. But in the years which he referred to, the prevailing price for meat was the floor price, and the Meat Board had to buy in at that floor price. At present it is not necessary to consider the floor price at all, for prices are far above the floor price. But I say: &#x201C;Very well, if we have to raise the price, we can do so, but it has no effect at the moment I do not know a single farmer who is concerned about his meat production because he is not receiving a decent floor price.&#x201D; He looks at what he eventually receives for his product; that is all they are interested in. The hon. member also referred to consumer resistance. There is only one thing which causes consumer resistance, and that is an excessively high price, and therefore we should not mention these two matters in the same breath. The hon. member then referred to the importation of meat; and so did the hon. member for East London North.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South also asked why only 300 tons were being imported. It is an experiment.</p>

<p>*I am so pleased he spoke Afrikaans, so that I can quickly get in this reply here. We have imported frozen mutton from New Zealand before. The price margin was not such that it served as an incentive to people. In fact, the housewives said they were not interested at all.</p>

<p>I won&#x2019;t. We are now going to carry out an experiment. There is something else we should be careful about, and this is one of the things the hon. member for Omaruru could be concerned about. We should not forget our local people and simply import meat right and left. I know hon. members want us to be careful in this regard. However, I want to carry out an experiment with the 1 000 carcases. There is a need for canning meat, there is a need for meat for the mines and there are various kinds of meat which are used to make meat pies. One could therefore let that meat thaw and also use it to make meat pies from.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prieska referred to floor prices and he said one very important thing, viz. that farmers who are able to do so, should now discharge their debts. Once again I want to join him in making an appeal to the farmers. When the maize price was announced, I made a similar appeal to farmers. In a bountiful year such as this&#x2014;with a good harvest, with a good maize price, with good export prices&#x2014;let us try to consolidate and to discharge those debts.</p>

<p>&#x2020;That is one point I forgot to mention to the hon. member for Houghton. She was not here when I announced that we had obtained another loan for the Coloured farmer-labourers of the Greater Western Cape. We have got up to R2 400 for a four-bedroomed Coloured house, with electricity and water, at 1% interest to encourage farmers to help their labourers so that we can have a happy labour force on the platteland.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast mentioned the problem of abattoirs. I referred to the chicken question, but now he asks about the small butcher who is forced to go to the big abattoirs. Finance cannot be obtained for the building of regional abattoirs. We find that municipalities are <span class="col_5583-5584" refersTo="page_0482"/>not prepared to build. I cannot argue with the municipalities on these matters. The municipality of a big city like Johannesburg asks why should it build an export abattoir with its taxpayers&#x2019; money to help the farmers to get an export venue. They are only prepared to build for their own special needs. We, therefore, obtained a loan from the Minister of Finance and through the Abattoir Commission we are now building an abattoir at Cato Ridge, for example, at a cost of R19 million. The Abattoir Commission is building an abattoir at a cost of R17 million at City Deep. The meat will be transported from City Deep to Pietermaritzburg and to Durban. A smaller abattoir will also be built in the vicinity of Durban. We find that the municipalities are not prepared to shoulder the responsibility. The Pretoria municipality came along and said it was not prepared to go ahead with the construction of an abattoir. The Abattoir Commission had to take over the project. We do not have funds and at this stage it is impossible to say that we can help with the financing of regional abattoirs. At the moment this is not possible. The smaller butcher, about whom the hon. member is concerned, may contact the department if there is an abattoir and it is neat and clean. We cannot disregard the hygiene aspect. Hon. members must have read in the newspapers about the salmonella which was found in meat in one of our big centres. We have to watch the hygiene aspect of meat. With our growing population we must be very strict in regard to the cleanliness of the meat which is sold.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Barberton referred to the wool scheme and the Wool Board. There are hon. members in this House who serve on control boards and who are attacked quite frequently on those control boards. I am thinking for example of the hon. member for Barberton, the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet and the hon. Senator Gideon Joubert. When I think of the approach of these people on the control boards, and their concern in regard to the matters which are discussed there, and I think how they help the Ministry to do what is best for the wool farmer or for the farmer whose produce is controlled by the board in question, then I say thank you very much to them, for it is necessary to do this at some stage or another. The work which they do is one which entails sacrifices, and they are doing it for the sake of a group of farmers who do not always see their standpoint as they ought to see it. The hon. member said that he had no definite assurance in black and white that the Government would support the wool farmer in a time of crisis. I want to give it to him now in black and white, because it will be recorded in Hansard. I am giving him that assurance now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karas referred to the midge plague, as well as to the pelt industry. I am pleased that he adopted a positive attitude in the interests of the pelt industry.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Orange Grove said that the price paid to the farmer was very low but that the consumer had to pay a scandalously high price. He said that the control boards were completely wrongly constituted and that they were a waste of money. Does the hon. member know what the cost of handling maize is? The cost of the control system for the handling of maize is less than 2 cents per bag per annum. He says that it is a waste of money. I think that he is not happy about the fact that the farmers are in the majority on the control boards. The producers are in the majority. How should we constitute the control board?</p>

<p>They are going into these matters. Does the hon. member think that they did not operate correctly in the past? Yesterday I quoted to the hon. member what is happening in Texas today. There farmers have had to kill 1 000 head of cattle and cover them with bulldozers because they do not have the control system which South Africa has. I am not completely happy about the control system and that is the reason why I have appointed the commission. I do not think, however, that it is the right attitude to say that the price paid to the farmer is very low and that the consumer is paying too much which leaves a gap in between. The hon. member took milk as an example. Does the hon. member realize that he referred to milk in a plastic bottle which costs 25 cents per litre whilst anybody can get milk delivered at his house for 18,8 cents per litre?

Sometimes people say that the middleman is making a fortune. Can I give that hon. member a licence to operate a retail butchery in any place in the country? Can I give it to the hon. member?

<p>I am not exaggerating when I say that South Africa is the only country in the world where a bag of mealie meal or a bag of flour can be bought for the same price right through the year. In order to keep the price of maize at the same level from the date when the price is fixed, namely in April, to the next season at the consumer price of R47 per ton, it is costing this Government R23 million for handling and for storage. All this is done to keep the price at the same level. In all the Western countries one finds that the cost of transport and storage is added to the price of the product. We are taking care of all this but we do not get a word of thanks for trying to keep costs down.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Potgietersrus referred to the good work which was being done by the agricultural colleges. I want to inform the hon. member that a young man may attend a college without requiring university exemption, in other words, he need only pass his matriculation examination. It is not a requirement for a person to have passed mathematics, for if he has matriculated, he can go to agricultural college. Short courses are in fact being introduced. During the past year there were 69 different short courses, and these were attended by 2 463 students. These courses are offered for short periods to afford students the opportunity of learning more about welding, bookkeeping and so on. Those courses have already been introduced and we have already announced that a sixth agricultural college is to be constructed in Nelspruit for students in that area.</p>

<p>Of course. Come and see; I shall show you.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Virginia raised a very important matter, namely the problem of stray dogs. I once saw for myself how 41 sheep had been savaged by a dog. It is a tragic sight. I have an agreement with my neighbours. I said to them: &#x201C;If you see one of my four dogs on your property, shoot it.&#x201D; If a dog does not know where its home is, it means that its master is not treating it well and that the dog is on the prowl looking for food. No matter how fond we are of our animals, we cannot afford their wiping out our sheep, as happened recently. If a person really cares all that much for a dog, he will ensure that the animal is properly trained. Just like a person, a dog has to be properly trained.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton mentioned various achievements in agriculture. A very important matter to which he referred yesterday evening was the question of overweight and balanced eating habits. Most of us do not eat correctly. I want to tell the hon. member that the people of Standerton treated me well. To tell the truth, the people of Standerton and I are fond of one another. I am pleased that that hon. member is my successor in Standerton, for I know he will look after them well.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for East London North.</p>

<p>&#x2020;You can see that this hon. member is a farmer from the way he spoke of the problems of the farm labourer. He has helped me a great deal. I have replied to the questions on the importation of mutton. We will pay attention to the price gap. The term for Land Bank loans was 32 years. We have reduced it to 20 years, for specific reasons. We found that too many farmers who obtained loans 20 years ago, are wealthy today. When you ask them when they were going to repay the Land Bank loans, they reply: &#x201C;I am not foolish. I am getting this money now at 7&#x00BD;<i>%.</i> Why should I pay off this loan? I can rather use this money to do something else.&#x201D; Well, it stands to reason. However, then the Land Bank asked whether it would not be better to reduce this period. After the 20-year period has elapsed, they can always consider the farmer&#x2019;s financial position and prolong the period. I think that it would be better to allow as many farmers as possible to obtain loans and to forget about the period, if it is not less than 20 years. In 20 years&#x2019; time, under the new management of agriculture, I think all loans will have been paid.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Boksburg must bear in mind that the Government of South Africa possesses 7% of the surface area of the country, while the Government of Australia possesses almost 40% of the surface area of Australia. In certain places we possess land which we want to reserve because the Government has to pay through its neck when Bantu Administration, Water Affairs or Community Development want such a piece of land. It is not our policy to alienate the land. If the municipality of the hon. member wants a piece of land for a specific purpose, we consider the matter. If it is to the benefit of the community, the municipality may buy it at the market price. However, I cannot say now that the 73 stands in Boksburg may be alienated to the municipality at once. The municipality could do all kinds of things with it, and tomorrow or the day after one of our departments may want a piece of land. As I have said, we do not have very much land.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the quality of meat and to meat inspections. We are looking into this. We could give more attention to inspection, but the housewife on her part, should really learn to know what a piece of fillet steak looks like. She gets the illustration of the different cuts <span class="col_5589-5590" refersTo="page_0485"/>from the Meat Board for nothing. When meat is so expensive, she must ensure that she buys more sensibly. She should say that she wants fillet or some other kind of meat which she has come to know well over the years.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury referred to the importance of co-operatives. I cannot differ with him. We are trying to combat the problem of duplication as far as we are able. We are helping the cooperatives to counteract duplication by means of the Registrar&#x2019;s office.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany advocated a compulsory tuberculosis test. I can inform the hon. member that we have a tuberculosis compensation system in terms of which we give the farmer R120 for every cow which we destroy because she has tuberculosis. It has now cost us R381 514 for 3 077 cows, which we slaughtered because they had tuberculosis. It will not be possible for us to say that all stud animals should be subjected to a compulsory tuberculosis test. In the first place we do not have enough veterinarians. What I am saying here has a bearing on what the hon. member for Waterberg said. Even at this juncture we are making use of private veterinarians to do this work for us. During the past year it has cost us R173 000 for private veterinarians alone. The hon. member asked for more veterinarians. He asked for the establishment of a second faculty, i.e. at Rhodes University. We announced the year before last that the faculty at Onderstepoort was to be doubled from 45 students per year to 90. To duplicate that faculty at another university would cost us more than R45 million. The M&#x04E7;nnig report recommended that the number of students at the one training centre should be doubled, so that 90 students could be trained. It would be a good thing if we could in due course establish a faculty in another province as well, simply for the sake of competition, so that the one could compete against the other. Now the one group of people will say it should be established in Stellenbosch, and the other group will say in Albany.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that it is simply impossible for us to announce today that no stud bull may be sold before it has been tested for tuberculosis. We simply do not have enough people. But I must say that before I purchase a stud bull I want a certificate indicating that it is free of tuberculosis. A farmer is not so stupid that he will purchase an animal if it has not been certified free of tuberculosis. Such an animal is not a stud animal. One does not keep a stud animal which has tuberculosis. It would have died long before it became a stud animal. I hope I have replied fully to the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterberg referred to the meat farmer and the treatment he receives from the Department of Agriculture. However, the hon. member must bear in mind that the way in which he treats the Department of Agriculture is the cause of the treatment which he receives. That applies to 99% of our M.P.s. A person should not arrive there with a long face when he wants to ask for something. If he is friendly, we try to help him. The hon. member also referred to better co-ordination between the Land Bank and Agricultural Credit. I shall give the hon. member a full elucidation. I have already replied to the question of the shortage of veterinarians, to which the hon. member referred.</p>

<p>The last speech I want to deal with, is the one made by the hon. member for Newton Park. We have given very careful thought to the possibility of an agricultural advisory council and we shall subsequently tell the hon. member precisely what we have in mind. The hon. member is quite correct. We should first establish this council, and then see what adjustments we could make. The hon. member also referred to the co-operation which they gave us. I hope the hon. member for Houghton will take cognizance of what I am now going to say. At the moment we have 80 000 farmers in this country on agricultural units which each have an average value of R200 000. My clients therefore own R16 000 million in this country. These are the people who will still be defending this country on the last day. These are the people who have no other homeland who realize that they are part of South Africa. They speak my language, and these are the people whom I represent here. These are the people to whom I am always sympathetic. These are the people, the farmers, whose language some members will never understand. I am grateful that hon. members help me to represent such people. I could not face participating in a debate at this juncture. In view of the speech made <span class="col_5591-5592" refersTo="page_0486"/>here yesterday by the hon. member for Newton Park, and in view of the atmosphere which prevailed here on both sides, I thought that I would thank hon. members for having made it easy for me. I appreciate that. I just want to say that yesterday was Christian&#x2019;s birthday.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House experience some difficulty in regard to this motion. We are dealing here with a certain piece of scheduled Bantu reserve or, as it is known in the legislation, a scheduled Native area, and it is proposed to excise some 10 000 ha of the area known as Mayen, a piece of scheduled area in the Northern Cape in the vicinity of Taung. As I say, the proposal is to excise some 10 000 ha of Mayen and to include as a scheduled area in replacement of this land, some 12 000 ha situate further to the north and west of the area known as Mayen. When the area known as Mayen is no longer a scheduled Native area, it will involve the movement of some 300 or more families&#x2014;one would suppose it would be in the vicinity of 300 people&#x2014;from the Mayen location as it is known on the map to an area, as I say, of State land to the north and west which falls within the consolidated area of this portion of trust land. The reason given for the excision of this scheduled Native area is that it is an extremity of the Native reserve in question and that if will become cut off from the balance of the reserve area by the construction of the Spitskop Dam. We take the view that any large-scale movement of people, regardless of their race, is a matter which is not to be undertaken lightly. People who have lived in an area for a long period of time, however humble their circumstances, do not like being moved. We believe that this is a matter which should be approached with circumspection and that if it is to be done at all, it must be done in the proper manner. I have said that people object to being moved where they have had their habitation for a considerable period of time, any people, and this applies particularly to Black people in this country who are settled under tribal circumstances in a scheduled Native area. They are people to whom the place where they live is important, and the association with that place with those who have gone before them is equally important. I hold the view that the mere fact that people in these circumstances live in the extremity of a Bantu reserve is not of itself sufficient reason for them to be moved. That is the only reason that is given in this case. Even if a better case were to be made out for the movement of these people, the method and procedure adopted in moving them is in our view equally important.</p>

<p>In our view, the first thing that should be explored and achieved is consultation with the people themselves. Attempts should be made to justify in the minds of the people concerned the fact that it is in their interests that they be moved. In the Select Committee there was in this case no adequate evidence to that effect. Secondly, Sir, if one looks at the map which was provided to the Select Committee, one finds that each of the blocks of roughly 20 000 acres or 10 000 ha that we are here concerned with, is a community of its own, either labelled in respect of the tribe that occupies it or of the headman whose area we are concerned with. This major location, as it is called on the map, appears to be a community of its own. There was no adequate evidence before the Select Committee <span class="col_5593-5594" refersTo="page_0487"/>that the tribal elders or headmen had been adequately consulted and, if they had, there was no evidence as to what their views in this respect were. There was no evidence that the people themselves had been adequately consulted or, if they had, what their views in this respect were; and, finally, Sir, there was no adequate evidence that the homeland Government concerned had itself been adequately consulted as to this move. Not only, in our view, must there be consultation, but where you have a Select Committee there must be evidence placed before it, not only that the consultation has taken place but what the effect of that consultation was. We are sitting in instances of this kind as a Select Committee, and what is the function of that Select Committee? The function of that Select Committee is to go into all those matters, which should be placed before it by adequate evidence, adequate representations, memoranda, documents and oral evidence, if necessary, so that the members of the Select Committee can adequately report to this House on their findings and on the reasons for their findings. This question of consultation and the placing of evidence before the Select Committee, in our view, is particularly important since the passing of the amendments in 1973 to the relevant legislation relating to these matters. According to those amendments, we brought about a position which, according to the speech by the hon. the Deputy Minister who handled this measure and which appears in Hansard of 12 February 1973 at column 394&#x2014;and this accords with my recollection of the situation&#x2014;enabled the Government of the day to pass resolutions through this House in advance in respect of consolidation matters and which did away with what one could call the right of appeal of a tribal community such as this who formerly, where they were required to move because of measures of this kind, could, if they objected, appeal to this House, and only after resolutions had been passed in this House and in the Other Place could they be required to move.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well let me read out what the hon. gentleman said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the consolidation of the homelands, population shifts will inevitably have to take place. According to existing legislation the State President may order a tribe to move from its dwelling place, but if the tribe refuses, such an order cannot be executed before both Houses of Parliament have approved the move, and this leads to considerable delay. It is now envisaged &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the object of these amendments&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the approval of Parliament, where suitable, be obtained prior to and contemporaneously with the approval of the consolidation plans. Since in practice it is frequently impossible to serve an order &#x2026;</block>

<p>He then goes on to deal with the types of meetings which have to be held to serve an order. This was the subject of debate, in which my old friend, Mr. Douglas Mitchell, who was here at the time, took part, and I remember very well that we debated this very matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if what I say in this regard is correct&#x2014;and I believe it is&#x2014;then the Select Committee&#x2019;s procedure and what it does assumes far greater importance than it did in the past. As I say, so far as this community of Mayen is concerned, those of us from this side who sat on that Select Committee were not left <span class="col_5595-5596" refersTo="page_0488"/>satisfied that the necessary consultation had taken place. In our view, the very greatest care must be exercised in matters of this kind, and it must be in the first instance, and all that relevant information should be placed before the Select Committee. This House, Sir, is merely asked to vote on resolutions which do not even express in the documents, which are filed in terms of the rules of the House, the fact that there was a difference of views in the Select Committee. Consequently, it is of particular importance that we be fully informed of this matter, and I cannot sufficiently emphasize, in these days and times, that the movement of comparatively large numbers of people is a matter not to be undertaken lightly, and in the nature of things, particularly the movement of comparatively large numbers of tribal people to whom place, area and environment are of even greater importance than to more sophisticated people. Then, I believe, all the precautions necessary should be taken and I believe even if it takes considerable time every effort should be made to persuade them to accept the change as a matter of consent, as a matter of being in their own interest, rather than the apparently superficial attitude which has been adopted in this case. We are accordingly against this first recommendation of the Select Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana says he is opposed to this motion which has been proposed should become a resolution of this House, because, as he put it, in the light of the evidence he received he is not satisfied that proper consultation took place with the people concerned, who are going to be moved and whose land is going to be excised from the scheduled area and to whom compensatory land will be given in the released area. Sir, I cannot quite understand that. The hon. member did take cognizance on the Select Committee of the fact that the department had informed the Bophuthatswana Government of its intention to effect this excision, and that the Bophuthatswana Government did have the opportunity to consult its own people at Mayen and to inform the department of its standpoint, but that the Government in question did not react to the notice it was given by the department. In other words, Sir, you can look upon this as you please, but we can also look upon it as a tacit agreement with this intention. Now I want to tell you, Sir, that the department informed the Government of Bophuthatswana in 1970 that it intended excising this area, and there are good reasons for its having to be excised. The hon. member mentioned one of these reasons. A dam is being built which will cover an area approximately 600 ha in extent, which will cut right through this area and will completely cut off Mayen, a narrow L-shaped strip of land, from the rest of the territory. This will have the effect, firstly, that a better rounding off will be effected if those people are moved just to the other side of the dam, where they will then be with their own people. At the moment there are no other people at the place to which they will be moved. This will place them, as I have said, with their own people, whereas at present they are cut off by the dam and are living on a narrow strip of land situated in White territory. This will amount to better consolidation and better rounding off, and it is to the advantage of those people, as I shall now indicate to you. Two of the then members of the executive of Bophuthatswana, along with the then chief director&#x2014;at the time they were still in the first phase of self-government&#x2014;went to Mayen and explained this matter to the people. In September of this year the department wrote to the Bophuthatswana Government again. In other words, due notice was given to the Bophuthatswana Government and the people of Mayen that it was the intention of the department to effect this excision and that neither the local people at Mayen nor the Bophuthatswana Government had lodged any objections with the department and the Minister against this proposed excision. That is why I think the Minister and the department are entitled to arrive at the conclusion that they may proceed. I think the hon. member is not quite correct in saying that he did not have sufficient evidence on the Select Committee to the effect that the authorities in question had in fact been consulted. That evidence was furnished. It was not said that negotiations had been conducted specifically with the people of Mayen, but negotiations were conducted with the Bophuthatswana Government, and this was put to the Select Committee. In this specific excision and removal 433 families are involved. In 1970, or subsequently, as many as 168 of these families voluntarily moved to the new place. In fact, I can understand this very <span class="col_5597-5598" refersTo="page_0489"/>well. The present area in which these people are living is an unplanned area, whereas the area to which they are going is a planned one with 400 prefabricated houses which have been erected there, there are two schools with six classrooms each, there is a clinic, there is a shop, and there are other facilities as well. It is therefore a planned area. One can understand that the people who moved appreciated the advantages offered by this area. Surely they would not have gone voluntarily if there had been no advantages for them there. The hon. member referred to the value of the land being exchanged. Approximately 10 800 ha is being excised from the scheduled area, and they are being compensated with more than 12000 ha. My personal view is that this is absolutely sufficient compensation and that the interests of those people are not being prejudiced.</p>

<p>The hon. member said he wanted the assurance that the removal would take place in a proper manner. Surely the hon. member ought to know that it is the department&#x2019;s approach and attitude specifically to cause these things to take place in an orderly and correct manner. For that reason it was very seldom necessary in the past to cause removals to take place by order. Things proceeded peaceably and it was seldom necessary to obtain an eviction order or any other order from the State President. These things proceeded orderly and meaningfully. I have no doubt that that will also happen in this case.</p>

<p>That is why I want to conclude by saying that I am convinced in my mind that the circumstances in the area to which these people are being moved are better than those in the area in which they find themselves at present. The new area has better planning and better facilities. That is point number one. Now I want to mention point number two. They are now not going to be cut off from their people because of this dam. On the contrary, they are being placed with their own people. No other tribe is living in that area to which they are being taken. Thirdly, I have no doubt whatsoever that the Department of Bantu Administration will cause this matter to take place in a proper and a dignified manner. If the Bophuthatswana Government and the local people had had any objections, there was sufficient opportunity for them to raise those objections. However, they did not do so, and for that reason I believe that they do not really have any objections against this removal.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to agree with every word that the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has uttered in this House tonight. First of all I want to say that I am not aware of and I may be ignorant of any rules of this House which prevent the hon. the Deputy Minister advancing reasons for the removal of these people. As it is, he comes to this House which does not have the advantage of having served on the Select Committee and therefore does not know the details involved, simply presents the report to the House and asks that it must be adopted. As the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has pointed out, that report does not even reflect the important fact that there were differences of opinion among the members of the Select Committee. Thus, reading the Select Committee report one is left with the impression that this was a unanimous recommendation. I think it is surely the duty of the hon. the Deputy Minister in presenting this report for adoption to the House to give us the facts of the case and to let us know that there was a difference of opinion on the Select Committee and also to tell us the reasons why the Government had decided that it was necessary to move the Mayen people from where they were residing to another area.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lichtenburg says that he is convinced that this removal is being done in the right spirit, that better facilities will be provided for the people where they are about to go, and that they will, having been removed, not be cut off from their own people by a dam which is about to be built. He is furthermore convinced that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development will carry out the removal in a proper and decent manner. I have not seen the facilities which are to be offered and I have not seen the place where the people are to be removed from, and for that reason I cannot argue with the hon. member about that.</p>

<p>As for the dam, it depends on whether the people who are about to be removed consider that to be a real disadvantage, i.e. the fact that the dam will cut them off from contact with their own people. On the third point I would say that I have had a good deal of experience <span class="col_5599-5600" refersTo="page_0490"/>with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and its methods of removal. I do not have the same unbounded faith in the manner in which removals are conducted. I have seen people who have been removed in other areas and I have seen the conditions under which they have been removed. I have seen the facilities which have been offered to them in the new areas where they have gone.</p>

I want to tell the hon. member too that tidying up the map should not be the prime consideration where one is dealing with hundreds of families which are about to be removed. He says that the Bophuthatswana Government has been consulted and that the fact that they did not disagree formally with the removal, means tacit agreement. I think that is rather a facile conclusion to have reached. I want to ask him whether he has any evidence whatsoever that the people of Mayen themselves agreed to be moved.

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for your protection. What is that hon. Minister laughing at? [Interjections.] As I was saying, many of the people who were removed from Doornkop went before the final removal because they had no option. The Government moved in with all its forces and the people went because they were nervous of the consequences if they did not go. These are people who have no power and they know that they have no power. For that reason some of them go before they are actually forced to go. Others go only when they are forced to go. Over the past few years, since this Mayen removal was first mooted, I have been putting questions to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and I have been receiving his usual crisp replies. He knows perfectly well that the Mayen people do not want to leave the area where they live. He knows perfectly well from the tone of the questions and from the correspondence which I have had with him that these people strongly object to being moved. [Interjections.]</p>

Neither the report nor the hon. the Deputy Minister gave us any reason. I should now like to read this letter and if the House prefers to disregard it, I will have done my best.

<p>I withdraw those words, Sir. Let me translate them into &#x201C;the mistakes of this Government&#x201D;. To continue with the letter:</p>

<block name="quote">history has it that Hitler after having signed a non-aggression pact with other European nations, went against his own pact by calling it &#x201C;merely a scrap of paper&#x201D;. What is intended for Mayen is tantamount to that.</block>

<p>Obviously, they feel very strongly about this. The letter goes on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">While our elders were staying happily around the confluence of the Orange and the Vaal Rivers, the Government persuaded them at length to move from there and come to a place found for them, which was Mayen.</block>

<p>Funny, the confluence is where diamonds were discovered, if I remember correctly. A coincidence, no doubt:</p>

<block name="quote">As nobody was prepared to listen to the Government, the cruel removal was carried <span class="col_5603-5604" refersTo="page_0492"/>out forcibly and ferociously. This has not disappeared from our memory. Some of the inhabitants died there, others died on their way while attempting so seek sanctuary in other lands. There were others again who through Providence managed to reach Mayen. After reaching Mayen, a &#x201C;title deed&#x201D; came from the Government and was handed over to the head of the tribe, whose name is well-known, although presently deceased. As the title deed also change hands, until, to our surprise, the Government informed us through its officers that it had discovered that it had omitted to insert something in the title deed and demanded it back to fill it in. Here again there was a hitch, as the leaders of the tribe were unwilling to hand over the title deed to the Government despite several attempts extending over the years to have it. Eventually the Government went round to the Bishop of the Anglican Church, viz. Bishop Gore Brown, to get it through him. He also came with the same story that it was wanted so that it could be put in order and promising its return as soon as this is done. As traditional African people trusted Church leaders and have a high esteem for them, the tribe and the leaders succumbed to the Bishop&#x2019;s request and handed it to him for transmission to the Government. Most respectful Mother Suzman &#x2026;</block>

<p>Hon. members will be glad to hear that it was not &#x201C;Ouma&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Mayen belongs to us. There is a title deed somewhere in the Deeds Office in Pretoria to that effect. If there are any changes contemplated about Mayen we claim the right to be fully consulted in every detail and respect.</block>

<p>This certainly bears out the suspicions of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that the people concerned have not been consulted and that their consent has not been obtained. The letter continues:</p>

<p>And I add with emphasis, says Chief Moseki, that what I am explaining here is what is in every resident&#x2019;s breast. The Government cannot emphatically deny that, for that is how they have intrigued us and will not return our title deed. At the confluence we were evicted with fire, our homes and our belongings being mercilessly burnt down, only because the Government wanted us to move from there and come to Mayen. From Mayen again we are being forced to go to a place that will be of their choice. We know that the Tswana homeland leaders have no real choice in the matter. If the Central Government deems it necessary that Mayen should be removed, then it will, despite the approval or disapproval of it. They will be regarding the title deed of their own merely making a scrap of paper, like Hitler did. Kindly appeal and make representations on behalf of Mayen to the State President to see that justice is done in this particular. We have every right to refuse to leave Mayen. If we have to leave, we demand proper consultation, not just to be steam-rollered out of Mayen because we are black and occupy a position of powerlessness.</p>

<p>To me this letter has a ring of truth about it and there are enough facts in this letter to bear out what this man says. I did not appeal to the State President because I knew that that would be useless, but I did write to the hon. the Minister. In turn I was informed by the Deputy Minister for Bantu Development that it had been decided that Mayen be excised from the scheduled area and that the proposed excision had therefore been submitted to Parliament for resolution. As far as the title deed is concerned, he informed me that no deed existed and that the land presently known as Mayen was State-owned land, which land vested in the South African Bantu Trust in terms of the Act since 1936.</p>

<p>These people have obviously not only not been consulted, but they have themselves voiced their strong disapproval about being moved. Perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister would tell this House in all honesty if the letter, or the sentiments that I have read out from this letter, in fact reflect what the people of Mayen feel. If so, he should give us some good reasons as to why he is ignoring the feelings of this tribe and is going ahead roughshod and removing people who, if these facts are correct&#x2014;and the hon. the Deputy Minister can tell the House this as well&#x2014;have already been moved by Government edict once before in their history, which I might say is equally the same history as that of the people of Doornkop. I think this is an ugly affair, where powerless people are moved around like a lot of pawns on a chess board because of this tidying up the geographic map of South Africa so that it will be reflected in neat little black squares and neat little white squares. I, on behalf of my party, wish to voice our strong objections to this move and we shall vote against the resolution.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. M. VAN A. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if it were not such a terrible tragedy, it could have been interesting that any arrangement aimed at the orderly coexistence of peoples in this country is thwarted by hon. members on the other side of the House without their having any grounds whatever for doing so except vague suspicions that things are not the way they are given out to be. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana made great play of the location-orientedness of that group of people which had to be taken into account. However, I should like to have the answer of that hon. member on another aspect. The facts of the matter are that this area of Mayen is an unnatural projection which will eventually be cut off by the waters of the Spitskop Dam. These people are hedged in on 10 000 ha of land. What does the hon. member for Umhlatuzana think should become of those people on that small area with their population growth? We should like to know what is to be done with those people. It is merely natural and orderly that these people should be removed from this unnatural projection to an area which is their own among their own people. We had the argument of location once again, but is location-orientedness more important to these people and to hon. members than ties with their people and to be among their own people? Consultation was mentioned here and the question was put whether these people had been consulted. On 22 January 1971 two councillors and the director visited the people of Mayen. They were informed what the planning for their area was, and they were therefore fully aware of what was going to happen. No objection was received and in the light of the considerations why they were moved, it is reasonable to assume that they were content with it. The hon. member for Houghton quoted one letter. We should be glad if the hon. member would show it to us so that we may read it. It is interesting that this letter was written by a person living at Jan Kempdorp, whereas Mayen has its own post office. Why would that so-called chief on whose behalf this letter was allegedly written not have written it himself from Mayen? One letter from one person who does not even live in Mayen now serves as a mandate for the hon. member for Houghton to raise objections to this reasonable, <span class="col_5607-5608" refersTo="page_0494"/>fair and just resettlement of people. Since the hon. member for Houghton has referred to just one letter, I want to emphasize that we on our part can produce proof that 168 families of the Mayen group voluntarily moved in 1971. We have proof that the people who are living there now, i.e. where they were settled at the time, are very happy. I am prepared to bring 168 letters which will prove that these people are happy where they were settled. Unlike the hon. member for Houghton, I am definitely not prepared to raise objections based on just one letter as a mandate and to say that it is unjust and unfair to move these people, whereas ultimately it will only be for their own good. As the hon. member for Lichtenburg said, all the services, and better services than those which the people at Mayen have at the moment, are being provided to them in the new area. For the sake of the geography, I want to say that Mayen is situated 12 miles from Warrenton, but very far from Taung. Mayen is approximately 50 miles from Taung by road. When these people are being moved into the territory of Bophuthatswana, they will be approximately 12 to 15 km from the Bantu town at Pampierstad. In other words, the whole removal is taking place in order to take them out of their absolute isolation and to settle them among their own people. We already have proof that those people who went voluntarily are happy in the area, where they have been ever since 1970. I honestly think that it is not right and fair of hon. members to advance an argument on the strength of just one letter, which was not even written from Mayen. I cannot imagine that the chief of Mayen himself cannot write and that somebody has to do it on his behalf. On the strength of that the hon. members now want to speak on behalf of those people.</p>

<p>I shall come to that. When we are dealing with the removal of people, it is a matter which must obviously be regarded in a serious light by all of Us since it concerns the whole pattern of race relations in our country. It is definitely something which ought not to be undertaken lightly. There are two aspects in regard to this matter. The first is the exclusion of a certain area and the inclusion of another area to compensate for it. The second aspect is the purpose of the removal, namely to move the people of the existing reserve of Mayen to the other reserve.</p>

<p>In regard to the purely physical aspect, the area itself, I just want to emphasize here what was said by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, namely that in my opinion sufficient data was not made available to us on the Select Committee so as to allow us to arrive at a properly balanced judgment. [Interjections.] In this regard, I want to add that in my honest opinion there was a too positive statement on the advantages of the new area as against those of the old one. As you know, Sir, section 3(b) of Act No. 18 of 1936 provides that when one area is excised and compensatory land has to be provided, such compensatory land shall be of at least&#x2014;this is what the Act says&#x2014;an equivalent pastoral or agricultural value. It is indeed true, as is also indicated in the memorandum, that as far as the size of the land is concerned, there is a replacement of an area of 10 800 ha by an area of 12 758 ha. It is stated in the memorandum that the comparable agricultural or pastoral value is 1,1 in the new area as against 1 in the old one. In other words, as far as that &#x201C;of at least an equivalent pastoral or agricultural value&#x201D; is concerned, there is little to choose between the two areas. There is, in other words, no obvious advantage &#x2026;</p>

<p>The land is poorer and in the light of these particulars there is no obvious advantage for the people of Mayen to be moved to the other area. I say that in my opinion the statements in regard to the new area are phrased too positively, for it is said in the memorandum that the new land is more <span class="col_5609-5610" refersTo="page_0495"/>than sufficient in so far as its value is concerned. It seems to me as though the expression &#x201C;more than sufficient&#x201D; is, after all, being qualified very strongly in the light of the facts stated in the memorandum itself. It is also said in the memorandum that the settlement will be to the advantage of these people and, as indicated here, the only reasons mentioned are the fact that the Mayen reserve will be cut off from Taung by the Spitskop Dam and, furthermore, that this Mayen reserve is a finger, a point, projecting into the other area. It does not seem to me as though either of those two considerations does in fact apply in respect of the question whether it is in the interests of the people themselves. It is also stated in the memorandum that sufficient&#x2014;this is the word they use&#x2014;land and grazing are available, not only for the existing population and their livestock, but also for reasonable future expansion. If the equivalent pastoral or agricultural value is hardly comparable at this stage, I honestly cannot see &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; how the positive statement can be made &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; how the positive statement can be made that sufficient provision is also being made for the reasonable growth of the population. To me this really looks like a statement which does not quite comply with the requirements of the truth. When the Spitskop Dam was built, was proper consideration given then to how this dam was going to affect these people? It seems to me it is the building of the dam which, essentially, made the removal of these people desirable. According to the available information, as far as I can remember, it was said that the Spitskop Dam was not going to benefit the Bantu at all. If my information in this regard is faulty, I should like to be corrected. The impression I have is that it will not be to the advantage of the Bantu. In other words, the impression is created once again that these people are being removed here, not because it is in their interests, but because steps are being taken in the interests of the White community. The hon. member for Houghton also said here tonight that there was no positive approval on the part of the people of Mayen or from the Bophuthatswana Government for this step. The hon. member for Licthenburg himself made it very clear that there was no question of the people of Mayen having lent positive co-operation or approval to these steps. As against that we have here the concrete proof produced by the hon. member for Houghton of a person who wrote a letter.</p>

<p>If I am told on the one hand that there is no proof that these people positively approved of the proposed steps, whereas there is on the other hand a document, the authenticity of which has not been called into question so far, to confirm this, I as a reasonable person must give preference in this regard to the particulars supplied here to us by the hon. member for Houghton when we determine whether or not those people were in fact consulted. It seems to me a reasonable person cannot arrive at any other conclusion. In the light of the information furnished by the hon. member for Houghton, I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will in fact be able to disprove effectively the impression which this letter created in my mind in order to enable us to arrive at a proper judgment. After all, it is very clear that proper consultation with those people did not take place. Because the Black people of our country are not being represented in this Parliament, an extremely heavy responsibility rests on us in this country to ensure that no injustice is done to them under any circumstances. I am not trying to say that an injustice was done to them in this case. However, it is the task of this House and especially of the Opposition to be on guard all the time so that possible injustices cannot be committed. It is very clear to me that all that was done was that a letter was written to Bophuthatswana Government. After all, if the fact that they did not react negatively to the letter by saying that they were opposed to the removal is construed to be positive approval of the removal, it does not make any sense. It seems to me that when such a removal is being considered, negotiations should at least take place in the spirit of section 5(b) of the relevant legislation, Act No. 38 of 1927.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I dealt with this matter last night, I pointed out that it was very dear that we are faced here with a problem of effective consultation. According to our information, it appears that at the beginning of 1971 a visit was paid by the chief director of the department as well as two members of the then Bophuthatswana Government to the people of Mayen for the purpose of explaining the removal to them. A departmental communication was also addressed to the Bophuthatswana Government, in which the matter was put to the Bophuthatswana Government on behalf of the department. As far as the aforementioned communication is concerned, I am still under the impression that it was said that the Bophuthatswana Government had not reacted to it&#x2014;if I understand it correctly&#x2014;and that that Government had consequently not expressed itself either for or against the removal of the people of Mayen to this new area. Furthermore, as far as the Mayen people themselves are concerned, no clear indication was obtained as to whether they were in favour of the removal or opposed to it. If I am, once again, interpreting the course of events correctly, this silence gave rise to the conclusion that these people did not oppose the removal and were consequently in agreement with it, and that on the basis of that silence the department was free to proceed with the removal. I want to say at once that it is an unfortunate state of affairs in which this House finds itself and in which I personally find myself, i.e. to use this conclusion which is drawn from their silence to justify the assumption that these people are in agreement with the removal. From the nature of the case it would have been far easier if this House had been notified whether the people were for or against it or whether the Bophuthatswana Government was for or against it. If we had known that they were against it, this House could then have taken a decision with full regard to the possible implications if that removal had had to be enforced. If I am interpreting the information correctly, we once again find ourselves completely in the dark as far as this matter is concerned. There are a number of possible ways in which the question &#x201C;how should we interpret that silence&#x201D; may be answered. If we consider the inhabitants of the Mayen reserve, the only possibility is that they could be adopting an attitude of silence because they do not want to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, because they do not want to approve of it and perhaps, too, because they want to adopt the attitude that they do not want to consent to it of their own volition or on their own initiative, for none of us readily parts with something we already have. That is certainly a possibility. In other words, they could be adopting the attitude: We are not going to move voluntarily, but if you force us to go, we will go; for that reason we are not going to give our consent to this in advance. That is a possibility. The other possibility is that they do not want to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, because they fear the possible consequences of doing so, for example, services which could be curtailed, and so on. When I say this, I think it is well known that when Bantu communities refused in the past to comply with the requests of the department when they were asked to move to a particular area, they sometimes had to pay the price of this action in the form of services and other facilities which were not made available to them. I am thinking, for example, of the years when we used all the means at our command to make the system of Bantu authorities acceptable to the Bantu peoples. It is possible that these people do not want to say &#x201C;no&#x201D; because they fear that if they should do so they will be punished or intimidated in some way or other for having said so. I say I am merely discussing possibilities. I say that I am faced with the problem of not knowing what interpretation to attach to the silence which they apparently maintained. I have to take these two possibilities into account. I want to repeat that it was the duty of the department to have come to us and said: Look this is the result of our <span class="col_5613-5614" refersTo="page_0497"/>observations and our consultations. The people want to move or they do not want to move. That is the task of the department. How can we judge the justness and fairness of this action if we do not have those basic facts? The same applies in regard to the silence of the Bophuthatswana Government. The same possibilities apply in their case as well. They might say that they do not want to express an opinion&#x2014;I say this is a possibility&#x2014;because they fear possible political repercussions. Then, too, they might be in favour of the removal. They might think it is a good thing and essential, but because they are also politicians, as are hon. members in this House, they might not say it openly because it might have political or party-political repercussions in the area. That is a possibility. But it is also a possibility that the Government does not want to say no because it fears that if it were to say no, it could lead to all kinds of other implications and that it could, more specifically, prejudice the relation between the Government and the department. Mr. Speaker, in all honesty, my problem is that I am completely in the dark as to how these people really feel about this matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The hon. member for Houghton quoted here from a letter in which the writer claimed that that letter also reflected the opinion of some or other chief in the Reserve. Moreover, I gathered from what the hon. member for Houghton said that according to her information, there was in fact fairly strong opposition to the removal among the people in the Reserve. Sir, I am not in a position to accept the truth of that communication or those statements, but in the same way I am not in a position to gainsay or disprove the correctness of the contents of that letter. I only wish to express the hope that the Deputy Minister will give us detailed information here about the particulars which were imparted to us by the hon. member for Houghton during the course of this discussion in this House. I am not in a position to comment on that. It may be that that letter is in fact representative. It may be that the information the hon. member for Houghton has at her disposal is not completely reliable, but then it is nevertheless the duty of the department to give us that information here to enable us to form a truly honest opinion in regard to this matter. In this regard I should like to emphasize, Sir, that I was unaware&#x2014;possibly it is my own fault that I did not make the necessary inquiries at the Select Committee meeting&#x2014;that these people of Mayen had already been moved from their former homes to Mayen; and now they are being asked to move again from Mayen to another area. Mr. Speaker, these are the things which create bitterness in South Africa&#x2014;I repeat, if the information is correct. For it would in fact place a heavier burden on us if it means that one group could simply be move from one place to another and could, after having arrived there, be moved once again to another place. In this way we will certainly be unable, either to achieve stability, or to gain the goodwill of people. Mr. Speaker, in the third place I want to repeat very clearly that if what I deduced from the particulars is correct, a mere communication in writing to the Bophuthatswana Government is surely not sufficient to ascertain the attitude of the Bophuthatswana Government in this regard. If there had in fact been consultation, we ought to have been informed in this House of the results of that consultation. We should not be placed in the position where we have to base our decision purely on the fact that a communication was addressed to the Bophuthatswana Government did not react to it, Sir, when we are dealing with removals, I want to assume that it is after all necessary to act in the spirit of section 5 of Act 38 of 1927. That section provides&#x2014;and I shall go into it further at a later stage&#x2014;in very simple terms, if I may take the liberty of quoting it to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5615-5616" refersTo="page_0498"/>The State President may, whenever he deems it expedient in the general public interest without prior notice to any person concerned &#x2026;</block>

<p>The procedure according to which this shall take place is laid down&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; order that, subject to such conditions as he may determine after consultation by the Minister with the Bantu Government concerned, any tribe, portion of a tribe, &#x2026; shall withdraw from any place to any other place.</block>

<p>In other words, if we have to go so far as to make section 5 applicable to this case, the section provides very clearly that that removal must take place in accordance with conditions which arise from negotiations between the Minister and the Government concerned. I just want to say, Sir, that a letter is not a negotiation in terms of and in the spirit of the provisions of section 5 of the Act; surely this is quite clear. Consultation has to take place. In this regard I want to say that the definition of the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; is very clear; this is not a delegated power. In terms of the section as it stand, it means the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development or another Minister of State who is acting in his place. Neither the Secretary nor any other official, according to my interpretation of the Act, has the right to conduct those negotiations. Even if we were to say that we were not going to make section 5 applicable in this instance&#x2014;and I am coming back to that later&#x2014;I still want to say that when it comes to the removal of tribes, it seems obvious to me that we should act in the spirit of section 5; in other words, that the matter should not only be treated with the utmost circumspection, it should also be conducted at the highest level, i.e. by the hon. the Minister or Deputy Minister and the relevant Government of the homeland concerned. This seems obvious to me. Sir, it is especially clear when we take into consideration that tribes which are under a removal order were deprived of a fundamental right last year. As you know, the original section 5 determined, if I may repeat it, that whenever he deems it expedient in the general public interest, the State President may order the removal of any tribe or portion of a tribe, or of any Bantu, from any place to any other place in the Republic, subject to such conditions as he may determine, provided that if a tribe objects to the removal, no such order shall be of any force and effect unless or until a resolution approving of the removal has been adopted by both Houses of Parliament.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I had no intention of taking part in this discussion, but the attitude of arrogance and of unconcern for the rights of voiceless human beings shown in some parts of this House last night, was so appalling that one cannot possibly leave this subject as it is, and this is really what I want to discuss. We are constantly having people paying lip service to the rights of other human beings, but when it comes to the crush, then they do not care a damn. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton last night produced evidence of opposition to this removal on the part of at least some of the inhabitants of this area. This was written evidence in the form of a letter from someone in authority, but what is the reaction that we get from the other side? I am not going to refer to the insinuations that were made here last night. I think it is better in the interests of the House that they be forgotten, but I will say that these representations are dismissed off-hand as being either phoney or as being of no concern and of no consequence to anybody. Someone got up and said it was only one letter and what can you judge from one letter? This, Sir, is a genuine letter and anyone who has seen it or has read it will know that it was written with deep sincerity and deep concern; yet it is simply dismissed as being nothing. We simply cannot go on in that way. What other evidence is needed? How many letters must we receive from people who are voiceless and who are concerned about their situation? It was argued that some of these people moved out of their own free will. What on earth does that mean? There are some people I would like to move far away from; but this does not for a moment suggest that everybody or even a majority of the people wanted to move. The point we want to make is that we simply do not know because we have no evidence of anybody having been meaningfully consulted. Under those circumstances I cannot possibly vote for the recommendation. We are simply told that in the view of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development removal of the Bantu and their resettlement are &#x201C;in their best interests&#x201D;. That may be so. I do not know. All I can say is that neither the Select <span class="col_5617-5618" refersTo="page_0499"/>Committee nor the hon. the Minister nor the hon. the Deputy Minister have taken the trouble to inform us. We now learn, not from the printed document before us, that there was no unanimity, but that there was a dispute in the Select Committee on this issue. Can the Minister or the Deputy Minister tell us what was the basis of this opposition, the basis of the dispute? Surely, if we are asked as members of this House to approve this recommendation we should be in possession of at least some of the facts. Or are we just simply expected to rubberstamp recommendations of this nature that come to us? No, I do not believe that our self-respect will allow this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I say that I am not satisfied with this document because I do not believe that there was proper consultation with these people who were to be removed and that there is evidence to suggest that there was considerable opposition to this removal. This is the point I want to make: I do not believe it is enough to tell people, even the most unsophisticated people, that it will be &#x201C;good&#x201D; for them to move or that it is in their interests to move. We know what a desperately sensitive situation this is, what a desperately sensitive issue the removal of people is, and what ill-feeling it can produce. That we can come at a time like this with an act of such insensitivity is absolutely appalling. I say again that we often hear lip service being paid to decent human relations. The Prime Minister has appealed to us in all sincerity to produce the kind of human relations that everybody wants in this country. But when it comes to the crux, the rank and file on the other side of the House have 5 000 excuses as to why there is nothing that they can do about it. I say it is against this background of unconcern that I want to protest most strongly. It shows an insensitivity in a sensitive area at a time when everybody should be bending over backwards to show concern for the feelings of fellow human beings which, after all, they are, however difficult it is to realize that when one listens to some of those off-stage noises that come from the back benches. This unconcern, this insensitivity, this &#x201C;we know what is good for you&#x201D; is, I suggest, the worst form of paternalism which should have no place in the South Africa of 1974. [Interjections.] Sir, there you can hear the off-stage noises. [Interjections.] This is a frightening manifestation of insensitivity and unconcern. This whole incident, in regard to the Select Committee and its report, is such a shocking example of this unconcern for people, for fellow human beings, that I refuse to vote for the motion before the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Just before I reply to the hon. member for Parktown, I want to tell the hon. member for Eden-vale that his entire argument centred round possibilities or &#x201C;ifs&#x201D;. I just want to tell him that if the impossible should happen and the sky should fall, we would all have lark-pie for supper.</p>

<p>Today we are engaged here in moving a section of the Tswana people, and where any removal takes place, be it of Whites or non-Whites, there are bound to be problems. Not everyone will be happy. There is bound to be a section of these people, of this section of that non-White population group, which feels unhappy about it. We accept that, but it still has to be done, for the benefit of that community. I want to give the assurance here today that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and its officials are doing their best to investigate and solve those problems, in such a way as to entail the minimum amount of distress for those persons who are directly involved. I want to compliment the department for having done everything in its power in this case as well. It has become necessary for this Bantu location of Mayen, as it is known, to be removed.</p>

<p>Name the reasons.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rossouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall name the reasons. Irrespective of the fact that the removal fits in with our new consolidation programme for that area, I can prove that it will also be to the benefit of these persons. Here before me I have a White Paper of 1973 which was submitted to us by the Department of Water Affairs. Here is a map on which I have indicated the area, and I shall also show it to hon. members. On this spot a dam, the Spitskop Dam, is being built in that area. If that dam is built and these people are not moved, we would be creating an island there. These people will be cut off from their true Bantu homeland. You may ask me whether the construction of the dam will be to the benefit of those people. Where these people are living at present they will not be able to make use of any irrigation lands. I want to tell hon. members in this House that the <span class="col_5619-5620" refersTo="page_0500"/>Mayen location is so situated that those people cannot in any way use that water to their benefit. The whole speech of the hon. member for Edenvale was based on possibilities. I want to tell him how justly this department acted. Over and above the removal which is going to take place, the department also conducted a soil survey of the area to which these Bantu will be moved. The whole world is being told that we are allegedly treating these people so unjustly. I just want to mention that the land these people will receive in compensation, compares very favourably with the land they have at present. In fact, they are going to be better off. They are not being deprived of one iota of land. On the contrary. More land is being given to them. All things considered, these people are getting approximately 800 ha more land for future expansion. Here is the plan, and each one of the hon. members can come and have a look at it. When they look at it, they will see that once the removal has taken place, the consolidated area will present a far more favourable picture. Last night the hon. member for Houghton had so many objections to the so-called inhuman action of the Government, of this side of the House. In reply to that I want to say that negotiations were commenced as long ago as 1971. After two members of the then Bophuthatswana Government had made representations to the people, 168 families moved and settled in the new area. No one threatened those families or told them that they had to go or that if they did not go action would be taken against them, as the hon. member stated. I want to tell the hon. member for Edenvale that those people moved of their own volition. But that is not all; hon. members can read the Bantu Land Act of 1913 and the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936 and they will find that it was laid down at that time that the persons involved in removals had to be protected. I want to make an earnest appeal to the hon. members of the Opposition. Come and tell us where the department or the Government has not up to the present acted honestly in respect of Black people. Name one place where we acted cruelly or took the people by the scruff of the neck and forced them out? There were indeed certain removals which did not take place smoothly, and this I accept, but one encounters stubborn people too. I have a pure and clear conscience because I know that the people who were removed from certain areas were always moved to better areas.</p>

<p>I want to come to what the hon. member for Houghton said last night. What she did was not nice at all. For whose consumption did she make those remarks of hers last night? Was it to blazon abroad the news, and to illustrate to the world how barbaric and cruel the National Party Government is in respect of the non-White population groups in the country? She said yesterday evening, and I just want to quote a short paragraph from her speech:</p>

<block name="quote">On the third point I would say that I have had a good deal of experience with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and its methods to remove them. I do not have the same unbounded faith in the manner in which the removals are conducted. I have seen people who have been removed in other areas and I have seen the conditions under which they have been removed. I have seen the facilities which have been offered to them in the new areas where they have gone.</block>

<p>We may differ with one another in the political sphere, and we may differ at any level and argue about matters, fight about them and subsequently reach finality on them, but this type of statement&#x2014;such as this statement made by the hon. member for Houghton, to which I referred a moment ago&#x2014;is not to the benefit of the country.</p>

Are any pleas made in this House on behalf of these people? Are any pleas made on behalf of the White people who, also on account <span class="col_5621-5622" refersTo="page_0501"/>of this consolidation, have to move away with tears in their eyes from the farms where they were born, and who have to make other sacrifices as well?

No doubt it troubled him, and that is why he inquired this morning about the consolidation which has already taken place and about the discussions between this Government and the Government of Bophuthatswana in respect of the removal of those people. Now the hon. member is shaking his head. When he shakes his head like that, I can hear it over here. [Interjections.] I say again&#x2014;and with that I conclude&#x2014;that I have an absolutely pure and clear conscience that everything is being done here to the benefit of the Bantu who are going to be removed. I want to emphasize again that among those Bantu there are indeed persons who feel heartsore because they have to move to a new area, but this is being done for the benefit of not only the Bophuthatswana Government or the uniformity of consolidation, but also to the benefit of those people themselves. I believe that among these persons&#x2014;and then I am not even speaking about the one letter&#x2014;there is a great deal of agitation, not about the removal of these people, but about other activities taking place there.

<p>I do believe it and I am sure that if that hon. member has any brains and the capacity to understand the argument I am putting across, he will believe it too. In terms of the amendment to section 5 of the Bantu Administration Act, No. 38 of 1927, which was passed in this House in 1973, a new subsection (1) (b) was substituted. What is the effect of this paragraph? The effect is that whenever the State President deems it expedient and in the general public interest that any Bantu people should move, he may issue an order ordering their removal after the department and the hon. the Minister have gone through certain formalities. But this paragraph also has a proviso and this is one of the protections I am sure the hon. member for Stilfontein refers to when he says that these Acts are passed for the protection <span class="col_5623-5624" refersTo="page_0502"/>of the Bantu people. The first proviso to this paragraph reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that if a tribe which is resident on land referred to in section 25(1) of this Act or in section 21(1) of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936 (Act No. 18 of 1936), refuses or neglects to withdraw as aforesaid no such order shall be of any force and effect unless or until a resolution approving of the withdrawal has been adopted by both Houses of Parliament.</block>

<p>What does this mean? It means that any Bantu who are resident on scheduled land, namely land specified in the Schedule to the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936, may not be removed, not even under an order of the State President, without the approval of this House and the Other Place. Has the hon. the Deputy Minister come to us today to ask us to approve the removal of these people? I want to say that the answer is &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Instead of coming to us in a direct manner and saying: &#x201C;Here are these people who in their best interests should be moved. We are presenting the case to you as to why they should be moved and we ask the permission of this House and of the Other Place for the serving of an order by the State President on these people that they should be moved,&#x201D; the hon. the Deputy Minister comes with a subterfuge. He comes with a resolution to excise the land from the Schedule of the Bantu Trust and Land Act. In this way he removes from those Bantu in Mayen&#x2014;I sincerely hope that the hon. member for Stilfontein and the other clever gentlemen who interjected a moment ago are now listening&#x2014;the very protection which this House gave them.</p>

Instead of using it he comes, as I have said, through the back door and, rather than ask Parliament to authorize the enforcement of an order of the State President that these people should be removed or that they should move, decides to have a piece of land on which they are resident excised from the Schedule of the Bantu Trust and Land Act. In this way he circumvents the provisions of Parliament and the will of Parliament, where Parliament decided that it wanted to protect those Black people. That protection is today being withdrawn, being taken away by this hon. Deputy Minister and by that Government on the other side. Do you then wonder, Sir, that we are opposed to this removal today, for that reason if for no other reason?</p>

<p>But let us go further into this matter. What I have said so far is sufficient reason for me to oppose this and for all right-thinking people in this House to do so, and I sincerely hope that I appeal to those people on the other side of the House who also have a heart and who also have a sense of fairness and justice. Fairness and justice are not being exercised today in respect of these people.</p>

<p>But let us go further. The whole question of consultation has been argued here since yesterday evening. What consultation exactly did take place? We do not know, because we did not get any evidence in the Select Committee to this effect. I am a member of that Select Committee. We were not given any evidence whatsoever of consultation which had taken place. I cannot blame the hon. member for Lichtenburg, who is the chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission, personally for it, because he was not the chairman of the commission at the time when what negotiations there was must have taken place. However, today he holds that high position. What does he tell us? I can only guess that he speaks with authority. If anybody in this House has access to all the information which is necessary and available, he has. <span class="col_5625-5626" refersTo="page_0503"/>He told us last night: &#x201C;The department advised the Bophuthatswana government.&#x201D; They were advised of the intention of the Government. Is that consultation? We heard from the hon. the Minister, who is not here, only two days ago on another matter that this is what they consider to be consultation. That side of the House regards as consultation the fact that the Bophuthatswana Government was advised. He goes on to say: &#x201C;The Bophuthatswana Government did not react.&#x201D; They did not reply. So, in the words of my hon. friend from Edenvale, because they did not reply, we can accept that they have agreed. Trying to defend the whole question of consultation, he goes further: &#x201C;The Bophuthatswana Government and the people were adequately advised.&#x201D; Sir, in this way he discharges the onus of consulting. I want to ask you, Sir, with tears in my eyes: Why did they not get together with the tribe concerned? Why did they not get together with the Bophuthatswana Government and talk with them? They are people. They are people of intelligence. They are people of reasonable mind. They are people with whom you can talk. But I do not think this Government has realized or learn yet that you can talk with these people. The Government is not used to talking with them; they only talk at them. That is all they do. That is all they are used to. The hon. member for Lichtenburg went further: &#x201C;The department came in touch with the Bophuthatswana Government and with the Mayen Bantu.&#x201D; That is consultation. I ask you. Sir! But you know, Sir, that is more evidence than we received in the Select Committee. When we asked what the attitude of the Bophuthatswana Government was regarding the removal of these people, the evidence we were given was the following: &#x201C;We cannot expect active assistance from the Bophuthatswana Government.&#x201D; But. Sir, members of this House have tried to make out that the silence of the Bophuthatswana Government, their failure to react to certain advices which they received, should be construed as consent.</p>

<p>Then we had the hon. member for Kimberley North saying that this move was in the best interests of the people concerned.</p>

<p>Exactly. This is exactly my point. Of course I cannot, because I have not got the evidence. I have no information at my disposal. No information was made available to me in the Select Committee. No information was made available to this House either. We are now being asked to apply our minds to this matter and decide whether or not it is in the best interests of these people that they should move. The hon. the Deputy Minister did not ask us that. All he said was: Let us excise this piece of ground from the Schedule to the Bantu Trust and Land Act. After that, he will remove them. However, we have to look to the interests of these people as well. When I say that we were not given any evidence whether or not this move was advisable or in the best interests of these people, I also want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he will tell this House why the fact that this was the second occasion on which this tribe of Bantu was being removed, was withheld. Why was this fact not mentioned in the papers which were laid before us in the Select Committee?</p>

<p>Why was this point not adduced when we asked for evidence in the Select Committee? Why was this fact hidden? Has the hon. the Deputy Minister forgotten the trouble he had when he moved them last time? Did he perhaps think that he might be able to hide the fact this time? Did he perhaps think that he might be able to get away with it without the adverse publicity which the Government, the department and the whole of South Africa got in this regard?</p>

However, I want to ask him then what he is going to do about the Bantu Affairs Commission and the officials of his department who are not keeping him advised as to the true facts. Why was this fact withheld even from the hon. the Deputy Minister, let alone from members of the Select Committee? Why were we not told these things? This is an important issue especially when we are given evidence in the Select Committee that 168 families moved in 1970 but that about 270 families were not willing to move. However, hon. members opposite, including the members of the Bantu Affairs Commission said that there was no opposition to the move. The evidence we were given on the Select Committee was that about 270 families were not willing to move. This is over 1000 souls. Let us take this point further. What other evidence did we receive in the Select Committee? When the hon. member for Umhlatuzana asked in the Select Committee whether it was anticipated that there would be any trouble if these people were forced to move, do you know what the answer was? The answer was: We will ensure that the Police are nearby.</p>

I deeply regret that in view of the facts that have only this afternoon come to our notice, the facts that we have now been able to adduce, it is impossible for us to vote for this motion as it is merely another way of circumventing the rights of these Black people who have already been pushed around once and who are now in the process of being pushed around a second time, for what reason we do not know.

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South and especially the hon. member for Edenvale remind me of the man who arrived late at work and who, when confronted by his employer said, &#x201C;Sir, my wife keeps on talking and talking and talking&#x201D;. When the employer asked him what she talked about he replied, &#x201C;She did not say, Sir.&#x201D; That is also my difficulty with those two hon. members. Mr. Speaker, we have had quite a bit of emotion regarding this matter and that is understandable. If you move people, whether they are Coloured or White, we can expect people to become emotional.</p>

<p>*Sir, it is essential that we consider these matters very calmly, and especially that we do not try to create the impression that <span class="col_5629-5630" refersTo="page_0505"/>the Government adopts an unfeeling attitude, as was suggested on the opposite side, towards people and their interests and their needs, for if there is any group of people that has an interest in the goodwill of the Black people, it is the Department of Bantu Administration and Development which, from day to day, consults these people and deals with their problems in a very sympathetic manner and does its best to be of service to them. This is also the approach adopted by the political head of that department, the hon. the Minister, and by myself. I want to state very clearly that we approach the problems of all these people very sympathetically. But, Sir, then we also come to the overall problems in a country such as this and in the world in general. This Government has a policy which is aimed at serving and protecting the interests of minority groups within our broad population structure. The hon. member for Parktown said here that they would like to see how these things were being done. Their policy is one of <i>laissez-faire,</i> of let there be an integrated society. Sir, we have the interests of every one of these minority groups at heart, and if one advocates a policy in line with that, one must also be prepared to deal with the problems which accompany the implementation of a policy of that kind, and this Government is not afraid of doing so. Therefore, I say here very emphatically that what is being done, is also being done and is especially being done in the interests of the various communities, and in this instance also in the interests of the inhabitants of Mayen. Sir, there are various places where we effected removals in the past, and there are various places where we will have to effect removals in the future. The hon. member for Houghton referred to Doringkop and Stinkwater; I cannot remember the other places she mentioned.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In future we shall also have to effect removals at Kromkrans and Braklaagte. Why do we move the people? The impression is created here that we move Black people simply because we enjoy doing so and, as they say, for the sake of ideologies. We move them for the sake of practical realities, in their own interests. Sir, if you were to go to Doringkop and Kromkrans, you would see the atrocious squatters&#x2019; conditions prevailing there. What would happen if an epidemic broke out there? Last year one newspaper correspondent after another phoned and said, &#x201C;The people are dying at Kromkrans; there is an epidemic; what are you doing?&#x201D; Sir, the medical authorities tell us that one cannot exercise health control in such a place; it is just not possible; there is no pure water and there is no control, and there are a considerable number of places such as these in the country. Sir, it is the State&#x2019;s responsibility to move the inhabitants of those areas, in their own interests, to areas in which sanitary facilities are in fact available and in which one can in fact provide health services on a sound basis. There are many such places in the country, but it is blazed abroad here time and again, with a great deal of emotion, that this Government moves people callously. These people are moved in their own interests, and that is the case here as well.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the letter the hon. member for Houghton quoted here. Firstly, I want to tell her there is no chief Moseki in that area. In that letter they say that the title deeds to that particular land are in Pretoria, and that they were handed over to the Government by some priest or other. Sir, for many years now title deeds relating to that area are not being dealt with by Pretoria, but by the offices at Vryburg or at Kimberley. Therefore that statement is simply just another wild statement which someone made in a state of emotion, or perhaps deliberately, in the letter to the hon. member for Houghton. And yet it was served up here and accepted by the hon. member for Edenvale and others. It constitutes their only evidence. But now I should like to tell you, Sir, that we receive many emotional letters about removals, not only from Black people, but also from Whites. This morning there was a letter on my desk written by a White man to the hon. the Prime Minister, a letter charged with emotion and drama, but I do not come along and quote it in this House, and I do not use it on political platforms, because it would cause feelings to run high between race groups in this country. We receive numerous letters of this kind, and I have to go from place to place in the country to pacify communities, White communities, because we require land for the settlement of Black people. But for the purposes of political gain, a big fuss is kicked up here, in order to create false impressions, <span class="col_5631-5632" refersTo="page_0506"/>and I say I find this regrettable. I say it is a great pity that the hon. member for Houghton, in her enthusiasm to attempt to win a right of existence for her tiny party, rants and raves in that manner. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We now come to the first removal. Yesterday evening I told the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South that I did not know that there had been a removal, and I spent the morning having the department find out for me when there had been a removal at Mayen, and I have now ascertained when it was. The hon. member cast a reflection on the department by saying that it had allegedly failed to inform me and the Bantu Affairs Commission. The removal there took place in 1896, when the British colonial government moved people when the rinderpest broke out, and this, in case the hon. member should not know it, is a pest which is almost as bad as the Opposition.</p>

<p>No, wait a moment. The member said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As no one was prepared to listen to the Government, the overall removal was carried out forcibly and ferociously.</block>

<p>This is what was said here yesterday evening. If we did move people to Mayen or Mamutla, we did so with their co-operation. The impression the hon. member tried to create here yesterday evening and the letter the hon. member quoted here, <span class="col_5633-5634" refersTo="page_0507"/>clearly referred to what happened in 1856. This is all the information I could obtain. I want to say in all earnestness that we should not just seize upon one single letter. It may create a totally false impression. A certain chief signed the letter, but we have no knowledge of this chief. Yet the letter is quoted here as though it is the gospel truth and as though it is the Government of the day which is committing these inhuman acts. This idea that we are only interested in the Whites and do not treat the Black man sympathetically, must be eradicated. I object to it most strongly. I work with the Bantu Affairs Commission and dedicated officials day and night to treat these people as well as possible and to act in their best interests. And yet we are constantly being accused of having no feeling for the people and the so-called proof which is furnished, is a load of rubbish, rubbish of the kind that was dished up here this afternoon and yesterday evening. Yesterday the hon. member for Kimberley North said that there were Whites in Taung who had to be moved. They have been to see me a few times and they have tremendous problems. But we do not come along here and say, &#x201C;Look at what is happening to the White people&#x201D;. We could also try to make capital out of it at election time. Let us differ, therefore, but let the matter be handled calmly and decently. I think we have listened to the hon. member for Houghton for long enough now.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Umhlatuzana referred to the question of consultation. Other hon. members also referred to this topic.</p>

<p>*Hon. members on this side indicated very clearly that there was indeed liaison with these people. However, there is no need for us to reveal all the details here. Two years ago we spoke to Chief Mangope at Mafeking about this removal and also about other removals. He promised to go into the matter and let me know. Later on he informed me of problems at Zee-rust. Finally, he came along and spoke to the hon. the Minister. He said they did not see their way clear to effect the removals; we ourselves should see to them. Initially the arrangement was&#x2014;and money was appropriated for this purpose&#x2014;that they would effect the necessary removals. It appeared that they had problems with their people and that they were not prepared to run any risks. They said we should cope with them ourselves. There were written representations as well. However, no reply has been received up to the present. I want to repeat to hon. members that we held numerous discussions on this question of removal, from the Northern Transvaal to the South, with the political leaders of the homelands concerned. What is the predominating feeling? Some are prepared and sometimes eager to help us to get their people together. There is no doubt about that. The majority, however, feel that this is a delicate matter which we should rather not assign to them. They are not eager to do it; they tell us frankly that they run into political problems. One can accept this. That is why we discuss such affairs with them and the department does the work as far as possible.</p>

<p>I was asked what the reasons were for this removal. The hon. member for Stilfontein indicated on a map the situation of the dam, and so on. Here is the map, and if hon. members wanted to have more details in the Select Committee, they would certainly have been furnished with them. Here I am showing hon. members on the map that Mayen is situated at this spot, with the dam being built just above it. Hon. members can see on the map that those people are being cut off from their area altogether. That is the one reason. We know that the people would like to remain together as a community; that is why we are making provision for that. The second reason is that we want to maintain good human relations, as we want to do throughout the country. The Mayen area has extensive boundaries and there has been friction between Black and White at Mayen for many years. This is an additional reason. Strong representations in that regard have been received and we have experienced problems there. We should like to eliminate the points of friction. In certain instances Whites are being moved, but in this instance the friction, which we have to take into consideration, contributed to the removal having to be effected at Mayen. Then, our other problems are &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the whole question of removal is concerned, I also want to say that Mayen is not a properly planned area. One of the major shortcomings of these Bantu areas is the degree of unplanned occupation we find there. We have millions of hectares of land in the country which are not being used productively because they are being occupied by a mass of people who are not active in the sphere of agricultural economics. Now we are getting the opportunity of placing them, and this is in the interests of those people, in a more densely occupied settlement which is properly planned with a view to agriculture. For those reasons, therefore, it is in the interests of both groups and especially in the interests of the population of Mayen, that they be moved.</p>

<p>I also want to react briefly to what I regard as a measure of exaggeration on that side of the House. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana said that &#x201C;300 families or more or in the vicinity of 3 000 people&#x201D; were being affected by this. In another discussion the other day I took exception because hon. members always mention exaggerated numbers. The hon. gentlemen are members of the Select Committee and they had the particulars before them. They know what the numbers are of the people to be moved and I can say right now that it is definitely far fewer than 3 000 people who are being affected by it. It is not even 300 families, but hon. members on this side of the house have already advanced arguments in this regard, and consequently I do not want to go into it any further. I just feel that we should not try to build a case on exaggerated figures.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South suggested that we tried to evade our responsibilities. In all honesty I want to say that we came to Parliament in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and the matter was first referred to a Select Committee before we could effect the removal at Mayen. There were discussions about it, frank discussions, emotional discussions drawling discussions&#x2014;in fact, any kind of discussion. But now the hon. member comes along and charges us with trying to circumvent the Act. I think this is a bad mistake, but I want to leave it at that.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to an argument raised by the hon. member for Edenvale. He suggested that we were not making a fair exchange with these people. The Act of 1936 lays down that in the case of land having pastoral and agricultural value, land of an equal value should be given to them by way of compensation. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that, before submitting figures to the Select Committee, we make very sure that we are not making a mistake at the expense of the Black people. The figures were submitted. The land is excellent grazing land and according to my information&#x2014;I myself visited Mayen and also saw the other land&#x2014;that land, from an agricultural point of view, is in fact superior to the land at Mayen. That is why they ought to get an equal area. However, we are not only giving an equal area; we are giving 10% more. If we were to work it out, we should actually have given 11951 ha for Mayen, even with the increase, but they are getting 12 758 ha, which is almost 10% more than what, calculated conservatively, we should have given them. So, I feel that hon. members should not come along here and philosophize and cast reflections on a department which is intent on going out of its way to act justly, and even more than justly.</p>

<p>With that I think I have also replied to the hon. member for Parktown&#x2019;s argument. I hope that, with this discussion today, we have at least brought it home to the Official Opposition and its satellite, which always tries to move as it moves, that we are really trying very earnestly, honestly and in a dedicated manner to do justice to the Black man, not to do him short in any way, but also to see to the interests of the White man in the process. It is most decidedly the case that emotions run very high when there is the slightest hint of the Black man&#x2019;s rights being prejudiced, but as far as this is concerned, people tend to apply double standards. I think we should guard against this. In general the White man in this country, the Government and the Departments of Bantu Administration and Development and of Bantu Education in particular, do a great deal for the Black man, and this is something for which there should be great appreciation. I believe we should put a stop to this kind of reflection we constantly get. It forms part of a pattern which is not to the benefit of our country.</p>

<heading>CONSIDERATION OF SECOND REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON BANTU AFFAIRS</heading>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the recommendation contained in the Report be adopted as a Resolution of this House.</block>

<p>I should like to elaborate on the recommendation to some extent. When the first report was debated, we found that hon. members said that they had insufficient information. I now just want to inform the hon. House of a few basic facts and I hope that this will be sufficient. I do not intend to be long-winded. If hon. members do not derive sufficient information from my explanation, I shall provide them with more later on.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to let it be known that discussions and negotiations concerning the possible purchase of Zebediela Estates and the properties it embraces have been under way now for a period of four years. To be specific, they were started in September 1970. An offer was made at that time on the initiative of the owners, and I had a discussion with them. There are a number of factors that have to be taken into account here. In the first place, we had to consider whether it fitted in suitably with the plan of consolidation; in the second place, this is, of course, a very well developed undertaking that is already world-famous, and we had to make sure that the property could be purchased on an economic basis. We therefore went into this offer very thoroughly. At the start we felt that it was not yet desirable for it to be included. We were uncertain about it. On <span class="col_5639-5640" refersTo="page_0510"/>the other hand the owners of this estate asked us to oblige them by not talking about it in public, because they had a large number of White employees who would naturally have been caused to feel uneasy and this could have caused problems. The matter was therefore discussed with them time and again on a confidential basis. This year it became reasonably clear how we should be able to consolidate there and how this piece of land could fit in properly with envisaged consolidation plans. Therefore the question of the price to be paid also had to be investigated and discussed with these people again. I can inform hon. members that we procured a number of valuations of the property. We procured the opinions of a number of experts on the property. It was very clear that the price at which they were offering the concern could, in my opinion, have been R4 million to R5 million less than a fair valuation. This was a very weighty consideration, and that is why we were also in a hurry to clinch the transaction. To be specific, the owners came to an agreement with us that they would accept that price as long as the transaction was finalized within a reasonable time. I mention the fact here, and I want to express my appreciation in this regard&#x2014;I think it is necessary to do so&#x2014;that these people, when they saw for themselves that we might require the land, did not insist on negotiations on the basis of the valuation of the land. I think it is fair to them that I let this be known here.</p>

<p>As a matter of information I also just want to say&#x2014;this has already been stated by the hon. the Minister&#x2014;that we do not see our way clear to taking over an undertaking of that nature and scope requiring a specialized management and where experts head the management, without taking over the existing management. The approach, therefore, is that that estate can only be taken over if we take over virtually the entire management, apart from the general manager. We should have liked to have retained his services as well. In terms of a provisional agreement they did in fact make him available to the department for a period of five years. The idea, of course, was that it was not practical for the department, as a Government department, to manage such an undertaking. The cumbersomeness of Government departments makes this quite impracticable. The idea, therefore, is that the Bantu Investment Corporation should take over the management and gradually include more Black people in the management. I just want to mention that as it stands today, the organization has already substantially reduced the number of Whites, who at the moment number about 70. It stands to reason that there is not much I can say about the profitability of the enterprise. In this regard I have information going back over a period of more than ten years which has been made available to us. However, hon. members will realize that in transactions of this nature, we cannot release all the details. I just want to tell hon. members that there are about 530 000 bearing citrus trees and that the ordinary, acceptable and current valuation is R10 per tree, although in certain cases we have paid more. We are paying about R5 million for these trees. Then there are 2 300 ha of irrigated land at R1 200 per ha, which is not high; there are also 700 ha of dry land and 10 000 ha of grazing. Hon. members will find that the valuation of the fixed property amounts to about R9 million. There are also, of course, many improvements in the form of White housing, Bantu housing, buildings, large barns, packing sheds and equipment which, conservatively estimated, could be about R2 million&#x2019;s worth. I want to release these figures at an early stage without more ado, so that hon. members can know that we have really gone into this matter very thoroughly. The turnover and so on, and the running costs, are matters of a more confidential nature as far as this organization is concerned.</p>

<p>Finally, I should just like to emphasize something that has already been announced by the hon. the Minister, viz. that we have not yet decided which homeland this enterprise will go to. This is a somewhat problematical matter, but we shall settle the matter through negotiations with the homelands concerned. It is imperative that there be clarity in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although the second report of the Select Committee on Bantu Affairs in its recommendation as placed before us suggests that this is merely a resolution to declare certain defined areas of land as released areas, it is quite clear from what the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, and from what was placed before the Select Committee, that in reality this is a transaction of a very different kind. It is in fact the purchase <span class="col_5641-5642" refersTo="page_0511"/>of a very large enterprise, an agricultural enterprise but with such ramifications that it can be described almost as an industrial enterprise. I believe that in this instance there has been introduced what amounts virtually to a new principle in the purchase of assets for the use of the South African Bantu Trust. In the past we have had areas of land&#x2014;in 99 cases out of a 100 farmland which in most instances was pastoral farmland rather than intensively developed agricultural land, generally speaking&#x2014;in regard to which in most cases it has been a question of evaluation of the property, an adequate price being paid to the White owner and then the land&#x2019;s being transferred to the Bantu Trust. It is put out for occupation by a tribal authority and a particular tribe and it then reverts to what we call peasant farming or the type of farming carried out by Black people in South Africa living under tribal conditions. Speaking generally, I think one can say that the viability of the proposition&#x2014;as a proposition to be continued to be run as the enterprise that it was&#x2014;has never been taken into account other than to create a value on which to assess compensation to be paid to the previous owners. One has in the past been faced with the situation, and the Select Committee has been faced with the situation, of having to decide whether it is a reasonable purchase of land to be placed in the hands of the South African Bantu Trust for tribal occupation where tribal farming methods will be carried out. Here, Sir, we have an entirely new principle. Here you have in reality the purchase&#x2014;and it is not a compulsory purchase; it has been offered by the previous owners&#x2014;of a very large and, I would imagine, a very expensive agricultural industrial undertaking which the newspapers say is valued at something like R8 million, which is the amount reportedly paid for it. Sir, what was the function of the Select Committee in these circumstances? As I see it, the function of the Select Committee is, first of all, to investigate this case with some care: to investigate first of all whether it is a viable undertaking, and I would imagine that that involves a viable undertaking in relation to the price that has been paid for it, particularly when you are dealing with taxpayers&#x2019; money of that order&#x2014;almost R10 million. Secondly, Sir, I would imagine that there ought to be a close investigation by the Select Committee of its profitability; as to whether it is an undertaking that is worth while buying at a price which is such that it can continue to make profits in the future, and that involves not a cursory glance such as, with respect, the hon. the Minister has given us this afternoon&#x2014;he has told us much the same as what was placed before the Select Committee&#x2014;but I would think, Sir, that is requires the most comprehensive survey in the nature of a feasibility study by persons qualified and experienced to do that&#x2014;businessmen, economists, agriculturists and scientists&#x2014;because we are dealing here with one of the largest irrigated citrus undertakings in the world. I say this for the information of the hon. members who do not know the Zebediela Estates. Sir, none of this information was placed before the Select Committee. We do not know the price that was paid; we do not know the profitability of the undertaking concerned; we do not know what water is available for this enterprise, and our information is that one of the outstanding features of the Zebediela Estates is that a technique has been devised there whereby the trees can be brought to bear and kept going with a minimum of water and that the margin between the trees wilting and their having sufficient water to be able to bear and to be productive, is of the finest order, and if one moves out of that knife-edge one way or the other, one is either going to be short of water or the trees are not going to bear adequately. In other words, Sir, the highest skill in the use of the minimum quantity of water that is available, on my information, not from the Select Committee but from other sources, is required to assure the success of the Zebediela Estates. I may say, Sir, that I have seen them, but that was some years ago, and one cannot speak here from one&#x2019;s own experience. Sir, the approach of the department in the purchase of an enterprise of this kind, in my view, should be exactly the same as the approach of one business house approaching the directors of this organization if they were to consider buying out the shareholding in a company of this magnitude. If the Select Committee of this House is to perform any function at all in a transaction of this kind, I believe it should be placed in possession of the facts so that it can make a similar inquiry to decide whether or not it should recommend to this House the purchase of an enterprise of this kind for the Bantu Trust and to be run by the Bantu Investment <span class="col_5643-5644" refersTo="page_0512"/>Corporation. I should like to say immediately, Sir, so that there can be no misunderstanding as to the attitude of this side of the House, that we would be quite happy to spend not R8 million but R28 million on the development of enterprises in the Bantu areas. I want to emphasize that. It is not a question of spending R8 million as a sum of money for the development of the Bantu areas; we would be perfectly happy, I say again, to spend R28 million on the development of the Bantu areas provided that the expenditure of that money meant the development of new industries in areas where industries do not exist and provided it meant the development of additional jobs which do not exist at the present time. Neither of those criteria are being fulfilled in this instance, as I shall show in a moment.</p>

<p>Now, I have dealt with the total absence of information before the Select Committee to enable the members of that Select Committee to judge whether this is a reasonable purchase of a large industrial enterprise, because in essence, what is it? In essence it is not the creation of something new. It is not the spending of a large sum of money to create jobs and enterprise where they did not exist before. It is merely a change of ownership. It is merely paying out White shareholders and substituting in their place other White shareholders, namely the shareholding of the Bantu Investment Corporation. That is all that this transaction is in essence. Now, as I have said, in my view the information is not available to us for us to be able to assess whether this is a good buy or not.</p>

<p>Then there is a further factor which I believe should be taken into account. I would imagine that successfully to run an enterprise of this kind, one needs not only highly efficient field staff&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister has said that the existing field staff, as well as the managing director, would remain there for a period of years under the auspices of the BIC in order to keep this going&#x2014;but I believe that one needs a board of directors with experience in the handling of finances, particularly in this type of specialist field.</p>

<p>The BIC will have to form a company.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>My friend says the BIC will have to form a company. I have no doubt about that, but no evidence was placed before us that the BIC is equipped to handle technically an enterprise of this kind. There was no evidence at all to that effect, and the only experience I have of this type of enterprise being taken over is the Tugela Estates near Weenen. That was in the nature of a showpiece. If my memory serves me correctly, it was bought for &#x00A3;250 000 at the time. It was a large irrigated farming enterprise. I and some of my colleagues went to see that place some years ago. There is virtually nothing left of the farming enterprise which was bought. The irrigation furrows are all clogged up. Virtually nothing is being grown there. One sees a few elderly women hoeing potato patches on what was once highly productive irrigation fields. It is to avoid this sort of thing that one wants to be assured, when one sits on a Select Committee&#x2014;and I think one is entitled to be assured&#x2014;that those who are taking over the enterprise from highly efficient private management, when they come to manage it on behalf of the State, are equipped to do so. Now, Tugela Estates, in comparison with Zebediela, was a small enterprise and conventional crops were being grown there, but here we have a very large enterprise in a specialized field. I believe that a Select Committee, if it is to be able to perform its duties properly, is entitled to be given a great deal more information. In fact, we have been told almost nothing.</p>

<p>If one looks at the map, one sees that the land which is to be purchased constitutes a tongue into an existing White area. The consolidation plans of this part of the world are not yet complete, although we were told that it was envisaged that this land which was to be purchased would very likely fit in with consolidation proposals for the future, and then we were told that if it did not fit in, the greater part of it could once again be sold off to White enterprise. Is this the way to go about these things?</p>

<p>No!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would have thought that the way to have done it would have been to plan the consolidation first and then make the necessary purchases afterwards.</p>

<p>There is one final point I should like to make. I want to deal with the question of priorities. I believe that the greatest priority <span class="col_5645-5646" refersTo="page_0513"/>at the present time is not the buying out of large existing enterprises merely to convert them from private ownership to State ownership. I feel that a far greater priority is the bringing of development to those areas which do not have any at the present time. There are enormous tracts of land which we call Reserves. The Reserves have a high population density and yet at the present moment there is no adequate gainful industrial employment. I believe it would be far better to spend available money on the development of industrial and economic enterprises in those areas so that something new can come into being. Development must be brought to an area where there is none at the present time. Urbanized, industrialized jobs must be created where they do not exist at the present time. None of those criteria are present in the proposed purchase of this particular enterprise.</p>

<p>For these reasons this proposed purchase will not be supported by the official Opposition. I should like to summarize the two points of our objections. Firstly, as in the last case, the Select Committee was not given sufficient facts upon which to do its job. We are being asked here today to vote for the purchase, with public funds, of a large enterprise and we are not in a position to say whether that is a desirable purchase or not. Secondly, we believe that the priorities here are wrong. We are wholly in favour of the industrialization, at public expense, of the homeland areas, but we believe that the priorities ought not to favour the acquisition of existing job-giving enterprises. The priorities ought to favour the creation of new job-giving enterprises in those areas which have none at the present time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member repeated once more that there was insufficient data and information before the Select Committee. He said that this was one of the reasons for their failure to support this motion. He intimated what kind of information he had wanted. The kind of information he wants, however, has nothing to do with the matter which was before the Select Committee and which is now being debated in this House. The information he wanted, had regard to the price to be paid for the land, the profitability of the undertaking that was being purchased and certain other managerial matters. But that is not the question before the House. The matter before the House is to declare this area a released area, in other words, an area in which the State President may declare released areas. This is the matter before the House. The other questions asked by the hon. member have nothing to do with the question whether this area should be declared a released area or not. The question about which the hon. member and his party must decide is whether they are in favour of or opposed to this area being declared a released area. The price paid has nothing to do with it. Released areas have been declared in the past, too, and they never asked what price was paid for that land, because at that stage it was not relevant. At the moment land is being purchased in my constituency. Hon. members can discuss that next year when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote is debated and at that stage they can charge the Minister with having paid too much or too little or with having made a bad buy.</p>

<p>The hon. member made another statement which I am unable to accept. He said that we were now concerned with an entirely new principle and that an agricultural enterprise which could be described as a business enterprise was being purchased. I want to tell the hon. member that every farming enterprise in South Africa is a business enterprise. This does not make the enterprise being carried on that specific land, any different from any other farming enterprise. There is no factory there; no processing is done. Everything done there, is done on every other farm. Products are cultivated there which are then packed and prepared for the market. Subsequently they are sold to a co-operative. The products are not processed in any way. In other words, this is not an industrial enterprise. It is a business enterprise in the same way as any other farm is a business enterprise. The only difference between that specific enterprise and other places where land is purchased, is that this one belongs to one owner while at other places where similar land is being purchased, the land belongs to more than one owner. This does not mean that the other land which is being purchased and which belongs to more than one owner is not exploited to its optimum extent economically or that the maximum economic potential of that land is not being utilized merely because it belongs to more than one owner. Other land that is purchased and that belongs to a number of individual owners, is exploited <span class="col_5647-5648" refersTo="page_0514"/>economically and to its utmost potential. This also applies to the land at present under discussion.</p>

<p>I want to give hon. members an example. The specific area at present under discussion comprises 15 600 ha. At present land comprising a total surface are of 14 000 ha is being purchased in my constituency. However the land belongs to 47 different owners. Those 14 000 ha of land, in my humble opinion, are also going to cost a few million rand. However, the price of the land is also irrelevant. That land is being utilized to the maximum by the farmers. There is an infrastructure with cooperative facilities, depots etc., at which the products are delivered. The same goes for the area at present under discussion. Those 14 000 ha, seen as a whole, are no different to this land in the sense that there is a different organization and a different type of farming; it is not that the one is a farm while the other is a business. In both cases we have precisely the same phenomenon. The land being purchased in the Delarey district is an agricultural enterprise that is being utilized in the best possible way, and the same goes for the land in the Potgietersrust district. If we are to describe the one as a business, then we must describe the other as a business too. They are precisely the same. In the vicinity of Dendron, the Bantu Trust is purchasing approximately 30 000 ha of land belonging to 48 different owners. Of this land, 2 000 ha is under irrigation. I want to ask hon. members whether the land to which I have just referred, differs from that of the Zebediela Estates merely because it belongs to more than one owner. About the same proportion of the land being purchased at Dendron is under irrigation as in the case of the land we are discussing at present. The only difference is that there are more owners. The hon. member is making a mistake by regarding this instance in an entirely different light. For that reason I do not want to agree with him in that regard. In my opinion his argument is an incorrect one.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that the priorities are wrong. He said that he was prepared to vote R28 million if a new undertaking were to be tackled. He said the only change that was taking place was the change in ownership, but that is an essential, important and major difference. The fact is that the profits of the enterprise at present accrue to the existing owners, who are Whites living in the White areas. If the ownership changes, the profits accrue to the BIC, which acts on behalf of the homeland. Then those profits remain within the homeland.</p>

<p>No, wait. This is a very major difference. The hon. member states that he is prepared to vote R28 million for it. He does not need to do so. This enterprise will provide the R28 million within a short time. Because the money now remains within the homeland, the profits that accrue may be used to develop the homeland. Now another reason why the Opposition acted so emotionally with regard to the first report, has become clear to me. They had to present themselves here as the great champions of the Bantu peoples because they know that they are too miserly to give up this piece of land to a homeland.</p>

<p>He asked what the profits were. I want to tell the hon. member that that is irrelevant here. What is relevant now, is whether or not this area should be declared a released area. The hon. member is being presumptuous to ask what the profits are. He now wants to create a precedent by throwing open the books of a business to the public of South Africa and investigating its profits. There are hundreds of people whose land has to be bought. Is it fair to expect that if I sell my land to the State instead of to anyone else, I should let the world know what my profits are? As far as I am concerned, this is a matter between the people who are selling their land, and the State. If they want to open their books of the past few years to the public of South Africa, they can do so. The Minister has <span class="col_5649-5650" refersTo="page_0515"/>been given these books to inspect and he can always appoint people to go through the books in order to determine whether the concern has been profitable and whether it is a good purchase for the State. But I regard it as entirely unnecessary for the domestic affairs of a company doing business with the State to be made public. I think that that is a poor business principle, but that is what these hon. members want to do now. If they want that information, I want to suggest that they go to the company and get it there.</p>

<p>I say that the hon. members are concealing something, and that is that they do not want to give up this land. I think that we should ascertain whether that party has yet reached unanimity in regard to the purchase of land. They have said that according to them it is unnecessary that more land be purchased for the homelands. They have said, on occasion, that the 1936 Act only provides for a maximum that has to be bought. Two years ago, when the Ciskei was being consolidated, the hon. member who represents the Transkeian areas said that he thought that in terms of their policy it was unnecessary to purchase more land. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, because his constituency was involved in the purchase of land, said: &#x201C;It is the maximum that is provided for in the Act; it is therefore unnecessary to purchase that land.&#x201D; They said at the time that even less should be bought. They said that more land could in fact be bought if that was what was wanted, but that according to their policy it was unnecessary. They went further and said that we should rather purchase land in the urban areas and give the people the right of property ownership there, and that it was entirely unnecessary to consolidate the homelands. During the same period the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was writing articles for the <i>Sunday Times.</i> In one of those articles he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Opinion is growing that the Bantustans should be geographically and politically consolidated and invested with meaningful powers.</block>

<p>This is important. He spoke about the consolidation of the homelands. He said that he was in favour of the homelands being consolidated. Other hon. members were not in favour of it. I want to ask them whether they have settled this matter within their own ranks. What do they stand for? Today they come along and vote against it. That is why I want to ask the hon. members what their standpoint is. Would they be so kind as to tell the world, the voters of South Africa and, in addition, those people whose cause they were espousing so emotionally a short time ago, what their standpoint is so that we and all the peoples of South Africa may know where they stand? The hon. member said that in the past, land was purchased for pastoral farming only. But surely that is not true. Through the years agricultural land has been purchased in the Western Transvaal that has been maintained in production by the S.A. Bantu Trust. In other areas, irrigable land has been purchased. Because there is an organization like the Bantu Investment Corporation today, the machinery to maintain that highly productive land in production, exists. The hon. member now says that he has no proof that the Bantu Investment Corporation and the S.A. Bantu Trust will be able to do this. What, now, is the most important consideration in making a success of such an enterprise? In any enterprise, whether it is a farming or a business enterprise, the management is what is most important. It is not the board of directors who are going to farm on that land. The board of directors of this specific company did not farm there but appointed a management to do so. The board of directors, of course, also has a role to play in this regard. The management is being taken over as it stands by the Bantu Investment Corporation. I now want to ask the hon. member what better proof the hon. the Deputy Minister could furnish him with today than to say that the management which is there now and which is making a success of it, will remain there as it stands? That is the most important factor.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>When one takes over an enterprise and one can retain its management for five years, one has a five-year opportunity to make adjustments and, perhaps, to retain those same people for a further period. That is the most important factor, but now the hon. member states that he has misgivings. I regard it as absolutely childish to come along with such an argument. This is the best guarantee one can have.</p>

<p>I believe, therefore, that hon. members opposite are against this because, in the <span class="col_5651-5652" refersTo="page_0516"/>first place, at heart they do not want to see further development taking place in the homelands. Their policy recognizes and makes provision for the homelands, but they do not want to see them develop. Every attempt on the part of the Government to do this, is opposed by them. What is more, they do not want to acknowledge the development that has in fact taken place there. They act as if it has not taken place and if they could reason it away, they would do so with the greatest pleasure because they do not want to have it. They do not want to see the homelands becoming political entities. They have other ideas for South Africa. They only include this to catch the voters, or something of that nature, but in reality they do not want them to be developed. The hon. member also said that he would vote in favour of more money if it was going to be a new enterprise, because this was supposedly only a take-over. I have already indicated to him that this is a very important change that is taking place. What is more, this specific estate that is now being purchased does not consist of land belonging to Olifants River riparian owners. It has its own water resources and these resources are being fully exploited. In other words, any potential this estate still has&#x2014;there is in fact still potential for further developments&#x2014;cannot be undertaken with the available water. They would have to obtain water from another source for this purpose. However they are not owners of riparian land on the Olifants River, which for the most part runs through the homeland. The homeland is in fact the riparian owner and can therefore obtain water. If this enterprise were to obtain water from there, then any other farmer or entrepreneur who was not a riparian owner could also lay claim to the water. I want to state this very clearly, particularly for the edification of the hon. member for Eden-vale, because he may perhaps state possibilities again. A riparian owner differs from a man who is not a riparian owner. If a man who is not a riparian owner gets water, everyone in that area who is not a riparian owner, is entitled to it too. That is why the position of the S.A. Bantu Trust differs from that of the existing owners. It is a riparian owner and it is already going to build a dam at the capital city of Lebowa, which is situated 12 miles from this estate, to provide that capital city with water. Now the Bantu Trust is in the favourable position that fresh water for this estate can be provided from that same dam. In other words, there is a possibility of expansion and of the creation of new employment opportunities. That is why, if the hon. member is serious and if he regards the growth of the homelands as a serious matter and wants to promote it, he and his party should not take up the standpoint they have taken up here today and try to block this motion. I therefore want to conclude by saying that this side of the House supports the Minister. We concur with this report, and we are going to put everything into the struggle to make this recommendation a reality. This side of the House is in earnest about developing the homelands. These are already becoming the fatherlands of those people, and we do not regard them merely as a political football for political gain. We regard this as a matter as being of the greatest concern for the future of everyone in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Lichtenburg has said that there are two reasons why we are opposing this resolution. I really cannot understand how an hon. member whose intellect I have grown to respect over the years that I have worked with him in this House and outside, can now spoil my whole impression of that intellect by making two such stupid statements. Either he has suddenly taken leave of his senses, or else he has made himself guilty of playing politics. Surely the hon. member listened to my friend from Umhlatuzana. Surely he has listened to debates and statements that have been made from this side of the House over the last few years regarding (a) the development of the Bantu areas and (b) the question of the acquisition of land for the further development of the Bantu people themselves. Surely he will know that that hon. Minister is now implementing policies we have pleaded for over the last 15 years. We have pleaded for the allowing of White capital and skills into the Black areas for their development. How we have pleaded with him to allow the money and the skills in to develop the Bantu areas! And now my friend from Lichtenburg says that we are opposing this resolution because we do not want any development of the Bantu areas. Sir, really, he disappoints me on that score.</p>

<p>Secondly, he knows our standpoint on the acquisition of land. It has been made clear so often. Of course, we want to see <span class="col_5653-5654" refersTo="page_0517"/>land acquired for these people. But, Sir, what are we being asked to do this afternoon? In the words of the hon. the Deputy Minister we are not being asked to acquire land; we are being asked to acquire a business enterprise.</p>

<p>What is wrong with that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I think it was the hon. member for Koedoespoort who asked what is wrong with that. I will come in a moment to the question of the principle of the acquisition of such a business enterprise. However, let us first deal with this question of the acquisition of land for the moment. I have here the memorandum which was submitted to members of the select committee for their consideration before the meeting of the committee. Item 1 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African Bantu Trust (hereinafter referred to as the Trust) which was constituted by section 4(1) of the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act), is empowered in terms of sec. 10(1) of the Act, to acquire land in the four provinces of the Republic of South Africa for Bantu settlement and generally for the carrying out of the provisions of the Act.</block>

<p>Sir, that I can accept, but the acquisition of land we are being asked this afternoon to approve, is not for Bantu settlement, and I do not believe that it is generally for the carrying out of the provisions of the Act. We are being asked to approve the acquisition of an asset which comprises a certain amount of land, a certain number of trees and certain other fixed property in the form of buildings and other developments, as well as goodwill, as it would appear. What is going to happen to this? The hon. the Deputy Minister has told us that he does not know what is going to happen to it because he does not know which Bantu authority is going to acquire this asset in time to come. He does not know where this land will go, whether it will be Lebowa or a new authority to be established for the North Ndebele people. Nobody knows. I accept the fact that we do not know. However, we speak about &#x201C;generally for the carrying out of the provisions of the Act&#x201D;. I want to put this to the hon. the Minister as a question and I hope that he will be able to answer it because it is important that the House should know the answer to this question before we are asked to vote on this motion this afternoon. It may perhaps require that we should adjourn this debate until we can get an answer to this question. I see that the hon. the Minister is laughing. He does not even know what the question is but he is laughing already! [Interjections.] That is the sort of intellect that we expect from that hon. Minister. That is what we have come to expect from him. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<p>He will not have the answer anyway.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis says that he will probably not know the answer anyway. Therefore, I shall not talk to him but to his deputy who might know the answer. The question is this. Is the S.A. Bantu Trust empowered to expend funds on the acquisition of assets which will vest in the Bantu Investment Corporation or a company but not in a Bantu or a Bantu authority? I know that there is a provision in the Act which provides that the Trust may acquire shares in an organization for the advancement of the Bantu people, but does that not refer to such establishments as the Bantu Investment Corporation itself? This is not going to fall under the BIC. In the words of the hon. the Minister and, I think, the hon. member for Lichtenburg&#x2014;and certainly from the evidence that we heard on the Select Committee&#x2014;in this case a company is to be established. I want to ask this question. Is it correct that the funds of the S.A. Bantu Trust should be expended in this way in acquiring an asset which will vest in a company and not in a Bantu or a Bantu authority? I ask this in all seriousness. Apart from anything else, let us have an unequivocal answer to this question and then we can go further with the debate.</p>

<p>I want to come back now to the hon. member for Lichtenburg. He has argued that the information regarding price and profitability is not the question before the House. Perhaps technically he is quite right. That is not the question before the House. The question before the House is whether this resolution should in fact be approved. However, in order to decide whether we shall approve this resolution we <span class="col_5655-5656" refersTo="page_0518"/>must know all the facts. He went further and asked whether we were in favour of the proclamation as a released area of this piece of land or not. He said that price was not our affair. How dare the hon. member show this sort of arrogance in the House! This is typical of the arrogance that we find when we deal with hon. members on that side of the House. Because they have decided, it does not matter what anybody else may think.</p>

<p>Yes, he did say so but by then the whole matter will be over. We are being asked to decide now and we have to decide now on the facts at our disposal. Surely, if we are being asked, in the words of the hon. the Deputy Minister, to decide whether or not Trust funds should be expended on the acquisition of an asset, we must know whether that asset is worth the amount that is being expended? It is all very well trying to hide behind the request of the persons concerned that their private business should not be bandied around. I want to say here and now that I agree that it is not advisable that the private affairs of concerns such as this should be bandied about in public as is going to have to happen in this House this afternoon. I want once again to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister and to the hon. member for Lichtenburg who is the chairman of the Bantu Affairs Select Committee that the time and place when this information should have been made available to us was when this matter was before the Select Committee where the matter would have been kept in committee. I want to register my protest this afternoon at the fact that we were not given any information in the Select Committee, and even when we requested it, it was denied to us. Sir, a question was put to the hon. the Minister by my friend, the hon. member for Walmer, and the hon. the Minister, in reply to that question, gave as much information as we got in the Select Committee. His reply was that the amount involved would be in the neighbourhood of R8 million. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that the valuation had been worked out on some formula; unfortunately he spoke too fast for me to make notes of all the facts that he gave the House, but on a valuation of R10 per tree, it worked out at R5 million, plus so many hectares at so much per hectare, giving a total of approximately R9 million, plus fixed improvements of approximately R2 million. Sir, I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister where he got those figures from. I did not make a note of his actual words, but he gave me the impression that he had called in certain experts who had given their opinion. Were those amounts arrived at as a result of actual sworn appraisements, or are they merely estimates? I wonder if the hon. the Minister would reply? Would he indicate whether they were sworn appraisements? He refuses to tell us. Did he call in the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure?</p>

Now, if we are to approve this resolution this afternoon we are going to set a very dangerous precedent. We are being asked to accept a completely new principle. As the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has said, we are being asked to purchase a going concern, not with the object of establishing more work opportunities for the Bantu, not with the purpose of settling Bantu people who at the moment need resettlement, not for purposes of consolidating the Bantu homelands, but simply for the sake of obtaining a going concern, which is a profitable concern, which will bring profit to the Bantu areas so that they can contribute over the next few years and raise a certain amount of money for development. But now the principle is this.</p>

That is the principle we are being asked to establish here this afternoon, that because here is a good investment&#x2014;and as a businessman I question that&#x2014;which will show a return of approximately 10% per annum, then what is to stop him at any time from buying any enterprise in Cape Town or any enterprise in Durban or Johannesburg or anywhere else for the benefit of the Bantu people, merely because the investment of a certain amount of money will bring a return of something in the neighbourhood of 10%? [Interjections.] That is what he said. But I want to query this and I want to say now that I have a little more information on this question, and now that the Minister tells me that the profit based on investment, the return on the investment in this case, is only going to be in the region of 10%, I am even more opposed to it than I was before. If he had been able to show that it could produce a profit of between 20% and 25%, then I could have agreed with it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South said here this afternoon that he had had a great deal of respect for the hon. member for Lichtenburg, but that his respect for the hon. member and his ability had begun gradually to dwindle. There the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South has a great advantage over the hon. member for Lichtenburg because our view of the abilities of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg could not be any lower than it is already. Every time the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is at its worst, he calls out very emotionally &#x201C;Now, Sir &#x2026;&#x201D; and it is not long before he is busy with something new. Each of his arguments was weaker than the last. What did the hon. member really tell us this afternoon? I am unable to point to one constructive argument which he has contributed to the debate. He started off by saying that the hon. the Deputy Minister had stated that the Zebediela Estate was being purchased for its industrial value. He said that it was being purchased because it was a going concern and not because of its agricultural value. That, however, is entirely untrue. The purchase has a twofold purpose. In the first place it creates viability for a homeland which is going to acquire that estate and that viability is of the highest quality. This estate lies within my constituency. I have been there a few times every year; I know that area and its people very well and I know about everything that is going on there. I can therefore speak from personal experience. The estate as it is at present comprises about half of the land in respect of which it is now being requested that it be purchased as a released area. The other half is a piece of land situated there with a fine broad ravine, with a great deal of water and equipped as a private game reserve. There is also a very large cattle farm. Both the cattle farm and the game reserve could be developed into <span class="col_5663-5664" refersTo="page_0522"/>something outstanding by any homeland that could get its hands on it. The estate itself is already a tourist attraction and that game reserve could be further developed as a tourist attraction. The purchase of the Zebediela Estates is to the detriment of absolutely no one. It can only be to someone&#x2019;s benefit. The people who are going to benefit from this are the people of the homeland which is to acquire that estate. The only people whose interests could possibly be prejudiced by the purchase are the existing owners because they are disposing of the estate at a very low price. I have heard during the past few years that the present owners actually wanted far more for the estate than they are now getting. After negotiating with the Government, they went so far as to accept a smaller offer which was to their detriment. This is a very advantageous purchase that has been entered into. It is a growing concern and a growth point and the hon. member for Lichtenburg was quite correct in saying that it is a growth point which could develop in such a way that the profits derived from it could be utilized for the further development of the homeland. I want to add at once that the whole area being declared a released area borders on existing homeland territory. The homeland territory, again, borders on the Olifants River. Between the Zebediela Estate and the Olifants River there are extensive areas which are homeland territory and which could still be planted with citrus trees or where farming of any kind can be carried on. The profits of this estate could assist in developing the other territory of the homeland with water from the Olifants River. The Olifants River is a perennial river running through the homeland. The Olifants River is only 18 miles from this estate. The irrigation that can be provided there can only be of the greatest benefit to that homeland. At the moment there is sufficient water to irrigate the existing estate. There are three dams on the estate, of which one is quite a large dam, namely the Compies Dam. This dam is situated in the Compies River. This dam has a very large cement wall and was an expensive dam to construct. This is one of the factors causing the valuation of the estate to be so high. The three dams have supplied water to the estate up to now but in the interim the present owners have, in addition, drilled a number of boreholes on the estate to make further provision for water. They wanted to ensure in this way that they would have additional supplies of water in the future. They struck a great deal of water. Two or three years ago, when the Compies Dam and the river dried up, these people relied exclusively on the boreholes. The boreholes kept the orange trees going throughout the entire period. The boreholes are only a reserve for when the dams dry up. They used them to the great benefit of the farm. There are now three sources from which water can be drawn. There are the dams, the boreholes and the Olifants River, all of which can supply water to the estate. In other words, the future of the estate is assured. These people are now concerned about what will happen to the estate if it is given to a homeland. The hon. the Deputy Minister staled very clearly that this concern is to be carried on by the Bantu Investment Corporation or some other company. I again want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Lichtenburg said by saying that it is not the directors who keep a concern going, but the management of the concern. Any concern whose management is faulty would go to rack and ruin. If they were to go into the economic operational aspect of this whole matter a little more deeply, they would be able to see very clearly that if the management had been making mistakes in the past, this estate would not have developed into a flourishing concern. In the same way any management could be appointed to that concern in the future. It would not be the directors, the BIC, the department or the homeland government which would operate that concern, but, in point of fact, the management of that concern.</p>

<p>This concern creates a viability for the homelands. If the United Party wanted to be consistent, they should have encouraged the purchase of this concern for the homelands, and for two reasons. The first is that it creates a viability for that homeland. The second is that that purchase also gives geographic content to their federation idea. If that area were to be purchased for the homeland, their idea of the viable homeland could be further developed. If I had been them, I should actually have greatly welcomed these purchases, and not condemned them.</p>

<p>Another point made by the hon. members is that they did not acquire sufficient information in the Select Committee. Surely that is not true. They asked questions for over half an hour in that Select Committee. The chairman gave them the opportunity to ask more questions and they <span class="col_5665-5666" refersTo="page_0523"/>stated that they had no further questions to ask. There were four officials who were prepared to provide them with the facts but they said they had no further questions to ask. How dare they, then, come here this afternoon and say that they were unable to get the facts at the Select Committee meeting? Surely that is totally untrue. Let us take the other argument they raised, a little further, namely that they did not inspect the balance sheet of that enterprise. As far as that is concerned, I want to let the argument advanced by the hon. the Deputy Minister suffice. If, as in this case, negotiations had been carried on for four years, how were the sellers to know that the Government would eventually agree to purchase the land? Surely, before it was finally purchased and they were assured of the fact, they would not be prepared to publish their balance sheets in the Press for everyone to see. No business would want to do so. Therefore the purchasers would not want to do so either. I do not hold it against the Zebediela Estates and the Schlesinger organization that they refused to have these balance sheets published. I should not have done so myself if I had been them. This enterprise, Zebediela Estates, has been in existence for more than 40 years. If the estate had not been proved to be profitable in the course of those 40 years, these people would surely have got rid of it a long time ago. They would surely not have kept it going if that had been the case. Nor would they have been continually engaged in making extensions there. Since I have known this place, so many extensions have been made that its value has increased considerably. No one in his right mind would make those extensions if he had had any misgivings about such an enterprise. Negotiations were conducted for years before this enterprise was purchased. The fact that they have now been finalized and that they have had to accept substantially less, almost 50% less, of the price they originally asked, shows that this is an extremely advantageous transaction being concluded on behalf of a people that can utilize that concern to provide for its future.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I also want to mention, for the information of those who are unaware of this, that the Zebediela Estate lies on the boundary of the capital city of the north Sothos, Lebowa-Gomo. It is situated 12 miles from the Zebediela Estate. This capital city has made such progress that a substantial number of people are able to to live there. Eventually the population of Lebowa-Gomo will be between &#x00BD; million and &#x00BE; million people. This is a vast city in the north at the gates of this Zebediela Estate, which need not remain an estate only but can also develop further through industries that can be established there. The railway line is already there and one of the largest mission hospitals in the homelands, namely Groothoek mission hospital is situated close to this estate. This whole complex gives us a picture of viability for a homeland which could come into being there in the future.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South raised in the course of this debate something which verged on a point of order, namely whether it was competent for us to consider a recommendation of the purchase of land which in this particular instance he said was not so much a purchase of land, but an investment in an industry. I must assume that in the absence of a negative ruling it is competent for this House to consider this and that the Bantu Trust Act can be applied for this particular purpose recommended, which includes not only the purchase of land but the industrial agricultural enterprise which is part and parcel of that land. I am assuming that this is correct and that we are not departing from the basic principle of the original Act although it is quite clear that this piece of land is more developed than many other pieces of land which have been purchased from parts of the released areas in the past.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear that we in these benches support this recommendation. We do not support, and we reserve the right to criticize this Government about, the details of its negotiations which I assume have not yet been completed. We are not voting for a sum of money, and we will criticize any expenditure which we feel is extravagant as well as any terms or conditions which may subsequently be imposed as a result of the release of this piece of land and its possible acquisition by the Bantu Trust. I assume that there could even be circumstances in which the negotiations might break down and that in spite of this being a released area this land would not be acquired by the Bantu Trust. Therefore, while on the one hand agreeing <span class="col_5667-5668" refersTo="page_0524"/>in principle to the release of this land so that one can negotiate for its final purchase, we reserve our right to criticize any aspect of the details of any negotiations or the possible subsequent purchase which can take place on behalf of the Bantu Trust.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>When his hon. gentleman has been here long enough perhaps he will understand that, in fact, the question before us does not relate to money but to the release of land. It is obvious that the Government intends purchasing it and we recognize this, but we are not discussing here the specifics of the cost or of the profitability. We will criticize this hon. Deputy Minister if, in due course, he asks for a sum of money which is required for this land and we believe it is either too high or that he wants to buy an enterprise which is not available enterprise in money terms. Quite dearly the vote is to release certain land. The recommendation is that the State President be given the authority to declare certain land a released area. The intention is there, but the details of the transactions are not before this House other than in broad general terms. We will not necessarily agree with the details when they are presented to this House.</p>

<p>Let us look at this in broader outline. First of all, legislators in this House have a commitment to purchase additional land. It is all very well for hon. members on my right-hand side to act as they do. I realize that they have raised points of doubt, but these points of doubt seem to reinforce a point of principle which was the watershed between themselves and ourselves in 1959. [Interjections.] In spite of all the brave words there is a reticence to purchase additional land if that land is going to be used for the Bantu homelands. We are not unmindful of what happened in the Eshowe constituency at the time of the last election when the issue of the purchase and consolidation of land became a political factor. I do not want to belabour these points, but I believe the points that have been raised will have to be considered, and the hon. the Minister will have to consider them at the time when the negotiations take place and the purchase is made. However, the fact is that we still are required to purchase over 1 200 000 ha of land in terms of the 1936 settlement. Any proposal which is not economically disastrous, to purchase that additional land, we believe should be supported as an act of good faith on the part of the White people of South Africa. The position with regard to this particular purchase is that there is no coercion. There is no pressure being applied on the part of the Government to an unwilling seller. In this instance the land is being made available. An offer has been made, which can be accepted or rejected. Thirdly, this particular instance does not involve the displacement, removal or shifting of vast numbers of people from one place to the other. Indeed, there are already a significant number of Africans working in this area. They can settle in this area, and it will not involve the removal of people from one place to another.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I say that these are the advantages. It is an advantage that people will not be removed. Therefore, when you can acquire additional land which does not involve vast removals, it is a plus factor. I think one should take these plus factors into account.</p>

<p>The point that has been made is that this is more valuable land than is usual. It is said that normally it is undeveloped land which is purchased. This is correct, but only partially correct. I think hon. members are aware that from time to time valuable farms are purchased. It is true that very often undeveloped land is purchased, but time and time again, valuable White-owned farmland has been purchased by the Bantu Trust and added to the total land available to the Africans. Here is a situation where a piece of land, like many other pieces of land in the past, has been developed. This one, however, is developed more intensively, for a more specialized section of the agricultural industry. It has become a significant factor in the citrus industry. It could also become a significant growth point in a particular African homeland. Therefore, there is no difference in principle. But there is no doubt that this piece of land is a very special one in relation to the South African economy and the economy of that <span class="col_5669-5670" refersTo="page_0525"/>area. However, we see no reason why land which has already been developed or which is partially developed, should not be included in land which is made part of released areas. Indeed, if one can inject a going concern, a concern in which there is already some know-how, in which there is already the infrastructure for development, and where there is already capital, not only in the form of money, but also in the form of buildings, irrigation, plantations, marketing, packaging and goodwill into the homelands, so much the better. So, Mr. Speaker, we believe that in principle the Government should proclaim this as a released area. This House should endorse the resolution. We believe that the Minister should try to get this land at the best price, quite naturally, and that he should take all the problems of the continued development of this particular industry into consideration.</p>

<p>We believe that the Bantu homelands do require areas in which there can be some diversification of their economy. We think that one of the problems of the homelands is the lack of economic diversification. At present in the homelands one has an economy based on a rural peasantry. Where there is an opportunity to bring into the homelands a new source of diversification, which could enable one to train and encourage the homeland Africans in a specialized area of agriculture, and in addition give them the opportunity of acquiring skills in such fields as marketing, business administration and management, we believe it should be utilized. We believe that while there are risks involved&#x2014;and let us agree that there are risks involved&#x2014;here is a piece of very valuable land which is very largely developed and which could act as a growthpoint for a new developing industry in the homeland areas. We believe that it should be supported in principle. However, I want to reiterate that we will come back to the hon. the Minister and we will criticize him and even attack him, if necessary, if at any stage, when the actual purchase of this property is before this House, he does not give us satisfactory replies in relation to the purchase price, and details of the negotiations and the on-going management of this particular project. Because this recommendation is not one of the mere handing over of a business but that certain land be declared a released area, we on this side of the House will support it with the reservation, as I have said, that we will continue to attack this Government if in any way it pays money which is excessive, if it does not ensure that this enterprise continues as an on-going enterprise, and if it does not see that the Blacks themselves have a greater say in the management of this particular project.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with the speech by the hon. member for Sea Point we have now, fortunately, had a more constructive contribution than we had earlier this afternoon. Although it is a little ironical, I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Sea Point&#x2014;after a very negative performance last night&#x2014;on what, to my mind, is at present a positive attitude. I want to thank him and I want to give him the assurance that we acknowledge that he can subsequently exercise his right to criticize if he objects to the price. The position here is simply that we are only asking for the approval of a released area. When this is done the transaction can be finalized. The fact remains that we have an offer here and we must accept it. It fits in with the rounding-off of the homelands and it also has a number of additional benefits which I do not want to dwell on now. Mention has been made of the railway line there, the development of Lebowa-Gomo, and so on. There are major advantages in this for us. If we were to refuse this offer and these people were then to state in public that they had offered certain land to the Trust and that we did not want to accept it, then we would have exposed ourselves to violent criticism. I want to say, too, that it does not matter whether one buys a large or a small farming enterprise. The basic principle is the same. One is buying a farming enterprise, whether large or small, in the interests of the Black people of this country.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Each piece of land is purchased after we have procured valuations by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. I have details at my disposal with which I have already furnished hon. members. I have provided these details because we wanted to dispose of this matter quickly, if possible. Otherwise we should have had the criticism which I mentioned at the start, <span class="col_5671-5672" refersTo="page_0526"/>namely that we had an offer and we ignored it. If we were to fail to purchase it now, we should probably have to purchase it for a much higher price at a later stage. Here we are acting in the interests of the taxpayer, too.</p>

<p>I should like to refer very briefly to what was said by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. He said that they were against this because they had insufficient details. I am very sorry, but they will not be able to get more details. We could just as well have let this matter stand over until next year and then resubmitted it with our consolidation proposals. Then we should not have provided any details about any place, because in the normal course we do not do so. What difference does it make if one purchases a major undertaking or a minor one? Why should one provide all the details in the case of a major undertaking? I provided the information at the outset, and it was provided in the Select Committee, with the sole purpose of letting people know that here we were dealing with a special offer which we had to consider. Then, Sir, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said that this was not a new development; that is correct. We should like to have spent money on new development, but the department and I are convinced that this existing concern will be of great benefit and can give rise to additional development, and therefore it is a proposition that must be considered. In fact we are buying existing developments everywhere. If we were only to buy undeveloped land for the Black people, then that would amount to us offering them what was left, and we must ensure that these people receive honest treatment as far as the purchase of land is concerned. We cannot look for and purchase pieces of land simply because they are undeveloped. In most cases it will probably be poor land.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South wanted to know whether we were legally empowered to handle this transaction in this way. As with the hon. member for Sea Point, I can give him the assurance that there is no legal provision preventing us from handling the transaction in this way. The Trust purchases the Estate, the BIC manages it through a company and there is nothing to prevent this. The idea is to get the Black people involved in the operation of such an enterprise as soon as possible. I want to say very clearly, so that everyone can understand it, that the land is not yet purchased. We have a basic agreement with these people but it is subject to the approval of this Parliament. It has been said here by certain hon. members that we have come to an agreement with the people. If, Sir, with the approval of this Parliament, land were to be declared a released area, then we should be able to take the transaction further because we think that we have a reasonably binding agreement, otherwise we should not have come to this Parliament with such haste. In this regard I just want to say, arising out of what the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said, that we should like to maintain the productivity of all the farms we purchase; that is our approach. In the past we have had the experience of certain improved farms being handed over to chiefs and of so-called &#x201C;peasant farming&#x201D; subsequently being practised there, with the result that productivity has been detrimentally affected. I wholeheartedly agree with him that the productivity of any land we buy should be maintained as far as possible, and that is why we have involved the BIC and will probably make use of agents, of White farmers, where necessary. I can tell hon. members that in the course of this year we purchased a citrus farm on the Kat River for approximately R1 million. That farmer continued to manage the farm until October, and through the XDC we are now taking over there in order to maintain productivity&#x2014;I think this is very important&#x2014;but the Black people are being involved in this matter as soon as possible. In conclusion, I just want to mention again that the owners of the Zebediela Estates, too, are desirous that we acknowledge the fact that the property is being offered at a price below its market value; that is what they feel and that is what they say, too, and I should like to repeat it here. I do not know what the difference is between the market value and the price we are going to pay, but they are convinced that by offering this estate at a price of R8 million, they are also contributing towards the development of the homelands. I am convinced that this is in fact the case, and I should like to express our gratitude to wards them for this.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that I have now replied very briefly to all the points touched on here, and I want to let that suffice.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with the delegation of powers for the appointment of Bantu Affairs Commissioners. I would be grateful if the hon. the Deputy Minister would give us the reasons for extending the authority for making appointments. In this instance the authority is being extended from the Minister to the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development and the Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner concerned. I think I can tell the hon. gentleman that the clause has our support, but we would nevertheless like to hear his reasons for this extension of powers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the light of the specific functions in terms of the Act of 1927, the appointment of persons who are able to fulfil these functions has often resulted in practice in quite a number of matters being referred back to the Minister for his approval. For the smooth functioning of the department, especially in this case, we want Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioners, who are persons with authority, to perform this task. They are familiar with matters and it is in fact on their recommendation that the Minister in the end has to take the decision. It is a question of efficient organization.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in this clause we have a further extension of <span class="col_5675-5676" refersTo="page_0528"/>the same principle that is contained in clause 1, which we have just disposed of, and I presume that the answer will be the same as those the hon. the Minister gave in reply to queries raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana on that clause. The hon. the Minister said that it was in effect really the Secretary or any other officer of the Department of Bantu Administration who take the decisions which are then forwarded to the hon. the Minister or the Deputy Minister merely for rubber stamping. I cannot say that we are altogether happy about this sort of provision. Hon. members on that side of the House know that we have repeatedly argued against a provision which provides that any other officer if authorized thereto by the Minister should have this power. To take it to its extreme, &#x201C;any other officer&#x201D; includes the tea-boy as well. We can accept, of course, that the hon. the Deputy Minister would not delegate such power to the tea-boy. However, this is the reason why we have always objected to legislation which is so widely framed that it could in effect apply to the tea-boy as well. We would rather see in the amendments under (a) and (b) the words &#x201C;any other senior officer or an officer above a certain rank&#x201D; or words to that effect, because what we are dealing with here is the power to decide where a Bantu Affairs Commissioner&#x2019;s court will sit and the area of jurisdiction of that court. These are matters of importance and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give us an assurance that he will in fact only delegate these powers to senior officials. I would almost go so far as to say that I believe he should give us an assurance that he will only delegate the power to officials with the rank of or above a Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner. The third amendment contained in this clause is a request to this Committee to agree that in future the regulations to be made in terms of the Bantu Administration Act of 1927 could be made by the Minister alone and not by the State President. When regulations are made by the State President, it is in fact the Cabinet which decides these matters. It is a manifestation which is occurring more and more with legislation which is brought before us, viz. that no longer does the Government believe that the Cabinet should take the responsibility of promulgating regulations in terms of this Act. It seems to give the Minister concerned unfettered power to promulgate regulations on his own without any reference to the Cabinet and without the levelling effect of reference to other members of the Cabinet. Of course, this is leading to empire building by individual Ministers and by individual funds. I believe this is not a good manifestation for yet another reason. That is that I believe that there are times where a Minister acting individually and on his own can make mistakes. Recently we had an example of what I consider to be a mistake. There the Minister in fact overstepped his authority. He went beyond what this House really intended he should have in the form of power to make regulations. I wonder if a decision would have been taken if this had not been done by a Minister acting on his own. I refer to a proclamation issued earlier this year, No. R95/1974, which amended the regulations in terms of the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936 promulgated in 1969. In regulation 72 of proclamation R288/1969 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any case where a person is charged under any of the provisions of these regulations, the burden of proving that he had lawful authority for the act or omission in respect of which he is charged, shall rest upon the accused.</block>

<p>A presumption is raised here which can be rebutted by an accused when he is charged with unlawful occupation of Trust land. The hon. the Minister has amended that regulation and it now reads:</p>

<block name="quote">In any case where a person is charged with a contravention of any of the provisions of these regulations, the burden of proving that (a) he had lawful authority for the act or omission in respect of which he is charged, and (b) that the land as described is not Trust land, shall rest upon the accused.</block>

<p>Here we have a situation where by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> the hon. the Minister raises another presumption and it is a presumption which I believe is bad at law. I am sure the hon. the Minister knows that, if he had come to this House with legislation to raise such a presumption, it <span class="col_5677-5678" refersTo="page_0529"/>would have been opposed by this side of the House. I raise this matter now as an example whereby I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he must not abuse his powers if these matters are granted to him in terms of this subsection. Such matters really require legislation or, at least, the sanction of &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member&#x2019;s real objection is to the term &#x201C;or any other officer&#x201D; being used here. Clause 2(1)(b) reads:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but it may also hold sittings at any other place which the Minister, or the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development or any other officer &#x2026; indicate.</block>

<p>In the following clause as well, reference is made to &#x201C;any other officer&#x201D;. This is what is causing the Opposition problems. What they really want to know is the status of the officer. They have just indicated by using an example that one may, in consequence of the delegation of powers, charge such an officer with taking important decisions. The hon. members want to have the assurance that the officer to whom decision taking powers are going to be delegated will have a certain status. At the Second Reading I explained here that the ranks in the department had been changed. Even Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioners do not all have the same rank. The position is that if we were to tie the delegation to one rank, it could in practice amount to delegating powers to an officer having a different status. However, it is also true that one changes the designation of a rank. In practice this causes major problems. All I can do is to give hon. members the assurance that these people hold high and responsible positions. The Minister does not delegate powers without first having discussed the matter with the Secretary of the Department. In delegating powers, he also selects his people so as to ensure that the delegated powers will not be abused. We feel that if we were to impose further restrictions in this regard, it would be prejudicial to the smooth functioning of the department. We should prefer not to mention specific ranks here.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In the previous two clauses we have not opposed the granting of delegated powers as set out in those clauses because, whilst one has a certain amount of caution in this regard, we accept that in a large organization a measure of delegation is accepted and necessary. However, in clause 3 we are dealing with an important power and the amendment proposed in clause 3 is that a power formerly exercisable by the Governor-General, which means that a decision by the Executive Council is required, is now to be exercised by the Minister. That is an old-established power, the power in terms of section 29 of the Bantu Administration Act. It is in respect of non-Bantu persons&#x2014;the ability, if they commit certain offences, to deny them entry into certain areas of the country and, in respect of Bantu persons who commit certain offences, that they shall not depart from certain places to which they have been assigned in South Africa. It is, in many ways, a modified form of banishment order.</p>

<p><span class="col_5679-5680" refersTo="page_0530"/>It is an old established power and the need for it has been recognized for a long time, but we believe that there ought to be a measure of formality surrounding the exercising of the power and not merely a ministerial decision which constitutes the Minister signing a document after discussion with his senior Ministers. As the law stands at the present time it would warrant, I believe, a report by the Minister concerned to the Cabinet, discussion by them and their recommendation to the State President for a decision by him through a formal document. In other words, it would require greater investigation and greater formality of approach before the power, which is a considerable one, could be exercised. We consequently believe that the law as it stands at the present time, is to be preferred to the amendment which is embodied in clause 3 and we shall accordingly oppose this clause.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I said in my Second Reading speech on this Bill. I am opposed to this clause. It makes it a little easier for the powers-that-be to use these really vast powers of banishment, of destroying a man&#x2019;s life, because that in fact is what it means. I am afraid I spoke rather too soon the other day when I said I was very glad to be able to say that at the present stage this power to banish somebody under the 1927 Bantu Administration Act was no longer being used. To the best of my knowledge there was only one person in respect of whom banishment orders had not yet been withdrawn and that person was, anyway, at home as the orders had been temporarily suspended. But this very afternoon I get news that an attorney living in Mdantsane has been served with a banishment order in terms of the Bantu Administration Act of 1927 and has been asked to remove himself to the district of Herschel. I am very much hoping that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give this matter his consideration and will at least give this man some time in which to organize his affairs before he has to remove himself from his home. I am obviously against the existence of this power in principle, but I cannot, however, debate that in any detail here because we are not discussing the principal Act, but I can object, and indeed do object, to any variation of the existing power which makes it even easier for the Minister to use this very Draconian power he has over the lives of people. I, too, am going to vote against this clause.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have sympathy with the allegations of hon. members that not enough attention will be given to the particularly important action which may flow from this amendment and that the matter of taking a decision rests with the Minister and no longer with the State President. I want to assure hon. members that the matter mentioned by the hon. member for Houghton was the subject of mutual discussions during the past six months, and that many problems had to be overcome before a decision was given. However, the practical application of this provision again comes to the fore, namely, that there are cumbersome preparations. I do not think the hon. member need have any fear that the Minister will act less responsibly when he has to decide on his own than when he has to make a recommendation to the Cabinet and to the State President. As I said during the Second Reading debate, the streamlining and smooth functioning of the department was thoroughly investigated before this amendment to the Act was proposed. I am afraid that we shall have to accept the position as it is, because we are satisfied that the necessary attention will be given to these cases. If the Opposition parties do not agree, we just have to accept that we do not agree in this regard. We feel, however, that it is in the interest of efficiency to have the legislation in the way it has been proposed.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very glad that the hon. the Deputy Minister does at least see our point of view on this particular clause. It is bad enough that a group of people, constituted as a Cabinet, should be able to decide on the freedom of movement of a person. However, when that power, which we are prepared to give to the courts because we believe that the courts are specially constituted for that particular purpose, is usurped by one individual, who will then decide on the freedom of movement of a person, something which can affect the livelihood, health, family life, in fact every facet of that person&#x2019;s life, I really cannot accept it. The hon. the Deputy Minister has not motivated his case. He has not told us why he does not want a case of this nature to come to the Cabinet. Is there urgency <span class="col_5681-5682" refersTo="page_0531"/>in a matter like this? Let me give an illustration. This can only happen after a man has been convicted in a court of law for inciting hatred between Bantu and White or Bantu and some other group. After that, the Cabinet meets and makes a decision about the banishment or not of the person concerned. But I do not know why it should be necessary that only one person must take the decision. Is there any urgency? Is there hurry? Is it not possible to call the Cabinet together to take the decision? Why is it necessary that this decision should be taken by one man alone, e.g. the Minister?</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just cannot comprehend why hon. members opposite are objecting so strongly to this clause. I want to point out to hon. members that it is completely within the power of the Minister to prohibit any ordinary person&#x2014;not a criminal&#x2014;from entering a Bantu homeland or a Bantu area, unless he has a permit. Now, if from the nature of the case, it is competent for the Minister to prohibit any ordinary member of the public from doing so, why should he not have the right of prohibiting an offender from doing so in terms of this clause? This provision is in agreement with the Act which has been in existence since 1927. It is &#x201C;trite law&#x201D;. In any case, the Minister has always been the person who has exercised this right throughout. I also want to refer to the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister, in which he pointed out that there were, as was revealed by a departmental inquiry instituted in this connection, quite a number of powers, as a matter of fact up to 31, which, according to the recommendations of that departmental commission, ought to be delegated in this way and sometimes even to a lower level. That is why I am completely unable to understand what fault hon. members have to find with this. I believe that they do not have any real objection. This is just being done for the sake of appearances, because they have become possessed with the idea of delegation. But, Sir, let us take the matter further.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member should not go too far. This clause does not deal with delegation. We are discussing the question whether it should be the State President or the Minister who should take the decision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Chairman, I am coming back to that. The objection of the Opposition is that this power should not be exercised by the Minister. I am making this point to prove that the Minister, according to the inquiry that was ordered, is indeed the competent and proper person to exercise this power. We have a parallel to this in that the hon. the Minister of Justice, another member of the Cabinet, is empowered to issue all banning orders. They are not referred to the Cabinet, or the State President. The issue of banning orders is vested in the Minister of Justice. It is an example of a similar instance and for that reason I think it is perfectly competent and desirable for the hon. the Minister to have this power and that it is very good administration for things to be done in this way.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Ermelo was correct if he was referring to section 29(3)(a). It is indeed so that the Minister has the power of restricting the admission of any person to a scheduled Bantu area, etc. However, the problem is with regard to subsection (3) (b), which is not covered by the instance mentioned by the hon. member for Ermelo. In this connection it is clear, after all, that the person has to be convicted of an offence under section 29(1), for subsection (3) to come into operation. In other words, the person concerned has already been convicted of an offence. Under subsection (3) the possibility is now being created for imposing an additional penalty in that in terms of subsection (3), if he is a Bantu &#x2026;</p>

<p>Order! I think the hon. member is completely off-side at the moment. We are not dealing with the principal Act now. We are dealing with the amending Bill only. If the hon. member reads subsection (3) he will see that it deals with the question as to whether the Minister or the State President should issue that order.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This happens for the very reason that the provisions of subsection (3) are so far-reaching. In the light of the far-reaching provisions, it is my contention that the Minister should not exercise this power on his own, but that the importance of this power, especially in the light of the fact that the person has already been convicted by a court, requires that it should <span class="col_5683-5684" refersTo="page_0532"/>be considered by the Cabinet as such before further action is taken. For that reason I in all honesty cannot see why it is necessary for this power to be transferred from the State President to the Minister.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This clause has the effect of widening the jurisdiction of the courts of the Bantu commissioners in the sense that two types of litigants, i.e. a deceased estate and a Bantu corporate body, can now litigate in the court of the Bantu Affairs Commissioner. As I understood him, the hon. the Deputy Minister during the Second Reading debate said that this was felt desirable because they were courts where there was no limit to the jurisdiction in so far as the amount was concerned. Now, I can quite understand the wish to allow deceased estates of Bantu persons and Bantu corporate bodies to litigate in the courts of the Bantu commissioners, but I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister should not consider imposing limits of jurisdiction similar to those which exist in the magistrates&#x2019; courts. It goes without saying, and I do not think one has to dwell on it, that we differentiate between matters which can be decided by a magistrate&#x2019;s court, that is to say civil proceedings, and those which can be decided in a Supreme Court, by the amount which is involved so far as money is concerned, or by question of status such as divorce This is done not because judges are more intelligent than magistrates, but because the rather more formal procedure adopted in the <span class="col_5685-5686" refersTo="page_0533"/>Supreme Court allows perhaps of a more careful enquiry than is possible in the rather swifter procedure which is necessary in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. I think I have stated the position fairly, to distinguish between jurisdiction in the magistrate&#x2019;s court and in the Supreme Court or a superior court. Now, this is a matter of every-day experience, and one simply states a fact when one states that. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not consider bringing in a similar provision limiting causes to those below a certain amount in so far as the activities of the courts of the Bantu commissioners are concerned. We are moving, after all, away generally from causes in terms of Bantu law and coming, particularly with this amendment, into causes or disputes which turn on the ordinary common law of South Africa. So whilst we support the clause, I would ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to bringing in limitations in respect of the courts of the Bantu commissioners similar to those, although not necessarily the same, which apply in the magistrates&#x2019; courts.</p>

<p>Sir, the point the hon. member has just raised, is, of course, not something which is relevant here. Provision is being made here for corporate bodies only, for which there is no provision at the moment. The question raised by the hon. member concerns the jurisdiction of the courts of Bantu Affairs Commissioners, and that is a completely different matter, but I may tell him that we are prepared to go into his request.

<p>Mr. Chairman, here we are dealing once again with delegated authority in terms of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, and the proposal here is to allow the functions of the Minister to be exercised by any officer of the Department of Bantu Administration acting under his authority. Sir, I do not think it is necessary for me to tell this Committee that perhaps the Bantu legislation which is of the widest ambit is the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act. The activities of the Minister acting in terms of that Act affect almost every aspect of life of the urban Black. It is a very considerable power which is exercised there by the Minister over a very wide field indeed, over a very large number of people. Consequently, Sir, I think one should approach any delegation of that power with a measure of caution, and whilst we accept once again that in a large department like the Minister&#x2019;s department, which is virtually an empire, some delegation of authority is necessary if the department is to function&#x2014;the Minister cannot possibly do it all himself; that I accept&#x2014;we suggest that there ought to be a limitation down the ladder as to how far his powers can be delegated, and accordingly I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After &#x201C;Development&#x201D; in lines 6 and 7, page 11, to insert &#x201C;not below the rank of Deputy Secretary&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sir, I think all those concerned have a copy of the amendment, so there is no embarrassment in that regard. Sir, we have chosen the rank of Deputy Secretary for this amendment because it seems, so far as one knows the Minister&#x2019;s department, that at that level there is a degree of specialization, and whilst we understand the need for the delegation of authority and power, we do not think that it should go below the rank of Deputy Secretary.</p>

<p>When he is reasonable I support him, and when he is not reasonable, I do not; it is as simple as that. Unfortunately he is very erratic. Mr. Chairman, we discussed this quite fully really in the Second Reading debate, and I must say that I, too, am nervous of putting the vast powers contained in the Urban Areas Act into the hands of &#x201C;any officer of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development&#x201D;. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister has many very efficient officers working under him, but it should really be some senior man to whom he <span class="col_5687-5688" refersTo="page_0534"/>delegates his powers in this respect, because the Urban Areas Act carries tremendous powers, some of which were mentioned during the Second Reading debate. It allows the local authorities to make provision for adequate and suitable accommodation for Africans employed in that area; it empowers the local authority to remove, to curtail or abolish locations, villages and residential areas; it provides for the power to have work carried out if the local authority has not done so; it provides for powers in relation to Coloured people residing in these villages; for powers to disapprove of the acquisition of land; and for powers to order persons conducting schools and other institutions for Bantu outside the location to cease to do so, just to mention some of the powers provided for in the Act. It contains the very important church clause about which there was considerable debate in this House many years ago; it provides for the power to prohibit meetings, assemblies or gatherings attended by Bantu if the Minister is of the opinion that such a meeting is likely to cause a nuisance to residents in the area, and so on and so forth. Sir, these are very extensive powers. The Act also provides for the power to order the establishment of advisory boards, to withdraw the licences of officials and so on, and I think that some limitation ought to be placed on the Minister&#x2019;s right to delegate these wide powers to any official in his department. We will support the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>Sir, it is true that the words as printed, i.e. &#x201C;and includes any officer of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development acting under his authority&#x201D;, do create the impression that the Minister will delegate all his powers all at once, but the practical position is simply that he will, after having given thorough consideration to the position, delegate selected powers only, not all his powers. In other words, the Minister will give thorough consideration to what powers he wants to retain and what powers he has to delegate for the purposes of practical administration. If we were to accept the amendment as moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, it would mean that no powers could be delegated by the Minister to officers below the rank of Deputy Secretary. I think there are only four Deputy Secretaries in the whole of our department who, in fact, specialize in various directions. The acceptance of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment would immediately prejudice the efficient functioning of the department. For that reason I am unfortunately unable to accept the amendment. It is the Minister&#x2019;s prerogative to decide what powers he is going to delegate. He may delegate these powers to a lower official, but what powers he delegates to whom, is and remains his responsibility. To tie his powers of delegation to a certain level will prejudice the efficient functioning of the department to such an extent that I, unfortunately, cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>The effect of this clause is to widen the areas within which authority can be granted for the sale of packaged Bantu beer. Areas are to be extended to include prescribed areas outside the jurisdiction of local authorities. This in itself has our support. We have no objection to it. However, I should like the hon. the Minister to give his attention to two aspects. One of the aspects is the commonly experienced unauthorized sale, or sale by unauthorized persons, of Bantu beer. One finds the beer hawked all over the country by unauthorized persons. This gives rise to the second aspect which is the pollution of the countryside by empty Bantu beer containers which are usually made of a substance not easily destroyed by natural elements. One consequently finds the countryside littered with containers of this kind. Usually the beer has been purchased from persons who are not authorized to sell it in the first instance. Whilst one recognizes that alcoholic beverages, if sold under control, fulfil a need, I would like the Deputy Minister to give us his assurance that he will inquire into these matters to see whether this mischief can be controlled.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides for certain laws which are applicable in the Republic to apply in the homeland areas. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister would give us some idea of the type of law he would wish to apply in those areas. Secondly, I should like to draw his attention to the proposed new section 50(2E) on page 13 and to make a comment. This new amendment we are introducing is such as to make the process of the High Court of the homelands run throughout the Republic and be served and executed within the Republic. In other words, court process in the homelands will be made officially recognized in the Republic and vice versa by means of this amendment. I wonder if it has ever occurred to hon. gentlemen opposite that difficulties in this connection were one of the reasons that led to the union of the four provinces which existed prior to 1910. I wonder if they have given thought to the fact that here we are doing exactly the reverse of what we tried to do at that time.</p>

<p>Clause 16:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is a clause which we shall be supporting but which one supports with a measure of reluctance. We have here a new concept. This clause empowers investment corporations which have entered into agreements with entrepreneurs to establish enterprises in the homelands to indemnify those entrepreneurs against any loss which in the opinion of the Minister cannot be recovered in a court of law and against which, in his opinion, there can be no insurance cover. It also allows the Minister of Finance of the Republic to take over the liability pursuant to any loss being experienced by an entrepreneur and a claim being made for indemnity against the corporation concerned. In his reply to the Second Reading debate, the hon. the Minister indicated broadly that this power was being asked for because it was felt necessary that indemnities of this type be given if there was to be development on an adequate scale in the homeland areas. It is because&#x2014;and I hope the hon. member for Lichtenburg is listening&#x2014;we believe in the large-scale development of the homelands and because we realize that under this Government there can be no such large-scale development unless we have a clause of this kind, that we are prepared to support it at this Committee Stage. I do not think that it would be out of place for me to indicate that this clause perhaps exemplifies more graphically than any other clause the difference between the policies of the Government and the policies of the official Opposition because the simple stark fact of the matter is that in terms of Government policy you cannot have effective industrial development of the homeland areas without the guarantees contained in this clause. In terms of the policy of the United Party, which stands for a sharing of power within one State, this clause would be wholly unnecessary and you would nevertheless be able to encourage and to have industrial development of the homelands areas. Having said that and having given an example of the merits of the policy of this side of the House and the patent demerit of the Government&#x2019;s policy in this respect, I should like to move the amendment which I have circulated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of subsection (2) of the proposed section 7A:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Provided that in any instrument establishing the independence of a homeland or in any treaty concluded upon such independence being obtained, there shall be included an undertaking by the homeland government to indemnify the corporation against any lose for which it may become liable thereunder &#x201D;.</block>

<p>What one requires is that if these dangers exist and if these apprehensions which exist <span class="col_5691-5692" refersTo="page_0536"/>in a clause of this kind&#x2014;I assume they do, otherwise the hon. gentleman would not have come forward with this&#x2014;I believe that some of the responsibility for what may take place after independence should be shared by the homeland Governments concerned. That is to say that the required indemnity and the required guarantee which is embodied in this clause should not merely be the responsibility of the Republican Government, but that a similar and equal responsibility should be placed upon the homeland concerned. I say that because I believe and my party believes in the principle of a free society and private enterprise. We believe that these principles should be encouraged in South Africa and that they should be encouraged in the homelands as well. It appears to be against some sort of invasion in that field that this clause is being asked for. Consequently I ask this House to approve the amendment which I have put forward embodying, as it does, the principle of a sharing of that responsibility to indemnify any loss which may occur in terms of this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened attentively to the arguments of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. I am very pleased to learn from him that their policy holds certain advantages. One of those advantages is that we do not need an amendment of the law such as this. Of course, we shall not, under those circumstances, be able to argue about all the other problems for which they will require legislation to implement their policy successfully. Nevertheless, I have some sympathy with the hon. members&#x2019; standpoint, to the effect that the homelands should be involved and should accept responsibility. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that the existing agreements are being concluded between the BDC, the entrepreneur and the homeland government. Therefore it is a triple agreement they are already involved in.</p>

<p>The next point is that we are unable to accept an amendment in connection with the present legislation which prescribes conditions for future independence. I believe this is something that may be discussed fruitfully in the future. However, I cannot accept that we should now write into the law what has to happen when a homeland becomes independent, even if it only concerns this specific aspect. Therefore, I am unable to accept the member&#x2019;s amendment, but the hon. member should bear in mind that when a homeland becomes independent, something which may possibly happen in the near future, matters such as this should be brought forward and be given due consideration when laws regulating independence come up for discussion in this House. I want to give the assurance again that the agreements binding on the homeland governments at this stage are of a threefold nature.

<p>Clause 19:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amendment being introduced by this clause has to do with the question of the acquisition of citizenship in the areas under the jurisdiction of various territorial authorities. At the present time, Bantu persons born in the area of a territorial authority or those persons domiciled in the area of a territorial authority, acquire citizenship of the area of jurisdiction, the homeland, of the particular authority. It is now desired to alter that provision because of the problems which arise as a result of substantial urban townships being adjacent to our metropolitan industrial areas. Many of them are in the homelands themselves, such as Umlazi in Durban. In terms of this amendment, it is desired to bring about a situation where citizenship can be acquired in a more defined area as the result of a relationship with the ethnic group which occupies, dominates and governs the area concerned. To be more specific, there have been, for example in Umlazi, Pondos or other racial groups, who have either been passing through or being there temporarily in order to obtain work in Durban, living and having children born in that Zulu area. In this way, those Pondos or other Bantu racial groups have acquired a domicile in an area such as Umlazi, although not being akin to the ethnic group that happens to have governmental authority over the area concerned, which in the case of Umlazi, of course, is the Zulu group. One can understand the argument, but we would like to know what the views of the homeland leaders are in this respect. We are dealing here with citizenship of a territory which has its own government in embryo and which, in terms of Government policy, will eventually have an independent Government. I would have thought that citizenship of an area is very much a matter which is very close to the heart of the Government of that area, closer, indeed, to the Zulu territorial authority in respect of Natal for example, than to the Government of South Africa in terms of Government philosophy. If I am correct in this, and I think no one can gainsay what I say, what is then the attitude of the homeland authorities to this alteration to the laws relating to citizenship? These are quite extensive. They apply to all the homeland authorities. They constitute considerable changes from the law as applied at the present time. I believe that we should be guided to a large extent, not by our own preconceived ideas of who should be a citizen of which homeland, but by what the homeland leaders believe <span class="col_5695-5696" refersTo="page_0538"/>should be the law governing citizenship in this regard.. I say that because not only their own views are important, I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with me that as strong views are held amongst permanent inhabitants of our urban Bantu areas as regards citizenship as are held among homeland leaders and the people in the homelands themselves. I will be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister would give us some information as to what the homeland governments feel in this regard and not only the homeland Governments, but also any of the recognized Bantu leaders.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have now had the same type of argument as before. I have already explained that I have introduced this amendment on the request of one of the homeland leaders. It has been very thoroughly discussed with him and referred to all the political leaders in the various homelands for their discussion. Now, however, reference is being made to other leaders. I do not know what is meant by &#x201C;other leaders&#x201D;, unless it is the same as before, when specific inquiries were made as to the views of the urban Bantu. In this respect our reply is quite clearly that the urban Bantu has political representation in his homeland that he has liaison with it. The political leaders of the homelands in turn have very strong liaison with Bantu in the urban areas. As far as we are concerned, and as the hon. member rightly says, this is an important matter for the various Bantu peoples, and it is for them to decide. They have decided on this amendment and there is nothing more for me to say by way of explanation. The liaison with any group of their people, whether they are living in the White area or in their own area, naturally is of no concern to us. They decided on this and for that reason this amendment was introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened carefully to the explanation given by the hon. the Deputy Minister but I am sorry to say that I find his explanation unacceptable. If one looks at the nationality laws of any country of the world, one will find that the laws that are universally accepted and which can be made to be accepted, are in fact those nationality laws which are decided upon and determined by countries in the full exercise of their own sovereignty. We have here a set of rules which, to say the very least, are extraordinary. They impose principles and concepts which would be unacceptable to any sovereign nation in the world. According to these laws, if they were to be applied to White people, I could qualify, at least under section 3(l)(c) and (d) inserted by clause 19, to be a Frenchman. This would be a determination imposed upon me by virtue of two paragraphs which have nothing to do with my inclinations and nothing to do with my allegiance; in terms of these paragraphs the use of languages, descent and so forth, would make me a Frenchman willy-nilly and whether or not I wish to be a South African. This kind of determination in the modern world is not sensible. I believe that if we are serious and if the Government is serious, in thinking about other independent nations with the right to determine their own laws and in particular their laws of nationality, it is entirely wrong to impose concepts such as these on nations which are on the way to self-government and independence. I believe that this is really a kind of colonial law, which has, properly understood, nothing to do with the laws of nationality practised in other parts of the world. I believe that although the hon. the Deputy Minister has said that he has consulted with some of the homeland leaders about this &#x2026;</p>

I think that if they were duly contemplating independence as separate nations and if they were to set up their own governments, with Ministries of the Interior and of Foreign Affairs competent to consider the relationships they would have with other nations and the problems that arise out of separate nationalities, such as the difficulties which arise in such matters as extradition and the establishment of nationality in matters of international dispute, they would find that paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) make nonsense. They are not relevant to modem life as it is lived in the international community. I think that this clause deals with homelands, that it deals with national policy. It deals with all <span class="col_5697-5698" refersTo="page_0539"/>kinds of concepts which are inherent in the policies of this Government but it has very little to do with the concept of separate independent nationalities as properly understood in the modern world.

<p>Mr. Chairman, this question of nationality is becoming more and more an issue among the leaders of the Bantu homelands. There is a feeling among many of these Bantu leaders that the cream of their people is being skimmed off. They are not being left behind in the homelands. They are moving into the urban areas. I know that the policy of this Government is that every one of those urban Bantu belongs to one homeland or another. I wonder whether we are not creating a situation here where we are going to have competition among the various homelands for the citizenship of their &#x201C;citizens&#x201D; within the urban areas.

<p>Mabopane. Thank you. I appreciate the assistance of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I believe that there is this competition there. Is the hon. the Deputy Minister aware of this fact and does he believe that these amendments which he is now introducing are going to resolve this problem? As I say, the homelands themselves are jealous of their people. They are particularly jealous of those of their people who have developed and advanced, who have shown initiative, who are today the entrepreneurs, the businessmen and the industrialists in their own ways in each of these townships. Most of those people are in fact resident within the townships. I raise this as an issue which can cause trouble between the various homelands and I should be very glad to know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister has in fact considered this matter in introducing these amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is precisely because of the difficulty experienced by homeland governments in meeting that particular problem in an area such as the one mentioned by the hon. member that this Bill is before the Committee tonight. The homeland governments will now have a larger measure of control in circumstances such as those.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 23:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with the question of prisons and the ability of the homeland Governments to set up a prisons authority to run prisons. To this we have no objection, but it goes further than that, Sir; it empowers the authorities in the Republic of South Africa to transfer prisoners from South African goals to serve their sentences in goals in the homelands, and a number of questions arise from this. Firstly, I would like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister what steps would be taken to ensure that the conditions in the homelands prisons are at least as good as the conditions in the prisons in the Republic; <span class="col_5699-5700" refersTo="page_0540"/>secondly, can a prisoner be transferred from a gaol in the Republic to a prison in a homeland without his authority or consent? Sir, I ask that question because the further question arises what facilities will be available for the relatives and friends of a prisoner convicted in the municipality of Cape Town, for example, to visit that prisoner, who has been transferred from the Western Cape to serve his sentence in a prison in the Transkei. There is the question of travel and expense in order to get there; there is the question of the cost of accommodation whilst the wife or the relative is visiting the prisoner, and then there is the expense of travelling back. There is the additional problem of where the prisoner is to be released, because if a poor man who has his home in the Western Cape is convicted here of an offence which warrants a gaol sentence and he is then transferred to the Transkei to serve his sentence, it may be quite impossible financially for him, after serving his sentence in the Transkei, to find his way back to the Western Cape. Sir, these are real problems. They are problems upon which we would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views, and if we receive satisfactory replies, then this is not a clause that we will oppose.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana has mentioned the example of the Transkei, but the Transkei Constitution Act has already been amended to make provision for this.</p>

<p>I mentioned it only as an example.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The specific problems mentioned by him have not yet arisen. The hon. member asked what guarantee there was that the conditions in the goals in the homeland areas would be the same as the conditions in the goals here in the Republic. At the moment, of course, the goals in the homeland areas are to some extent under the control of White staff; Bantu staff are steadily being trained, and the standards in the prisons in the homelands are therefore exactly the same as in prisons in White South Africa. As soon as these people achieve complete independence, it will be their concern, of course, but the process of evolutionary development and training is already under way there.</p>

<p>In the second place the hon. member referred to facilities which would be available for visiting if someone were to be transferred from a goal in Cape Town, for example, to a goal in the Transkei. I may tell him that persons may at present be transferred from one goal to another by the Prisons authorities. The same facilities would therefore be available there. I take it that short-term prisoners would not easily be transferred; I cannot see this happening, but what would happen&#x2014;and I think this is basically the object of the legislation&#x2014;is that a long-term prisoner who is a citizen of some homeland would prefer to be sent to a goal in his own homeland rather than to be detained in a goal in a White area. I think that this is what this provision is basically concerned with. If such a person has been sentenced in the White part of the Republic, it would mean that he might already have come from the homeland to work here and that he would then be returned, if he is sentenced, to serve his sentence there. Any really disrupting practical problems which might arise would naturally be kept in mind by the authorities in handling these very delicate matters. I do not think I have anything to add to that. This is more or less the way the whole matter will work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There is one other question I should like to put to the Deputy Minister. The hon. the Deputy Minister, I am sure, will appreciate that there are certain rights vested in certain individuals in terms of section 10, those who have a right to be in urban areas. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister give us the assurance that this provision will not be used to circumvent the rights which are given to the urban Bantu to acquire permanence in the urban areas in terms of section 10? Can he give us the assurance that this will not be used to circumvent those rights in so far as they exist?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that the protection enjoyed by people under section 10 cannot be circumvented by means of this provision. We cannot see this happening in practice, nor do we intend that it should.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I must admit that it is comforting to receive the assurances of the hon. the Deputy Minister, but I wonder why he has not written into this <span class="col_5701-5702" refersTo="page_0541"/>clause those particular assurances he has given us. I particularly refer to the assurances, firstly, regarding long-term and short-term prisoners. The hon. the Deputy Minister says short-term prisoners are not going to be transferred. I do not know why he does not write into the clause that short-term prisoners will not be transferred. I will tell you why I raise the matter. If you look at the new section 15A(2), it says that a convicted Bantu person who has been sentenced to imprisonment and is still liable to serve the sentence imposed or part thereof may be transferred, etc. What part thereof? Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister must not pull a face and turn around and ask why. I am simply asking him. He has given an assurance, but what good is that assurance when an affected Bantu person suddenly finds himself moved away and he is in fact only a short-term prisoner? It is no use to him whatsoever, this assurance the Deputy Minister gives tonight, if it is not written into the Act. I wonder whether he will not consider a reasonable amendment, an amendment along those lines which he can introduce before this Bill is taken to the Other Place.</p>

<p>The other point is that the Deputy Minister said, or implied&#x2014;I got the impression from his reply&#x2014;that a Bantu person who is removed from the so-called White Republic to a Bantu homeland will only be removed to his own homeland. Was I correct in drawing that inference from what the Deputy Minister said? It was an inference that I drew and I want to urge him to see that this only is what happens. What is the good of taking a Zulu person who is here in Langa and who is convicted for some offence and putting him in a prison in the Ciskei or in Lebowa or in Bophuthatswana? Once again I want to say that if my inference is correct from what the hon. the Deputy Minister said just now, I want to ask him again if he will not write this into the Bill. I do not want to fight with him here tonight. I do not believe it is necessary to fight with him, but I wonder whether he will not at least consider writing into the Bill some provision whereby our prison authorities, authorities which are not under the control of this Minister and who owe this hon. Minister nothing, will be limited in the transfer of the prisoners under their control to the homeland to which the prisoner concerned belongs.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one other question which I believe the hon. the Deputy Minister must tell us about, and that is the question of farm goals, prisons where these people are put to work. To the best of my knowledge none of them exist in the homelands at all. I wonder, however, if it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to assist these homelands to establish such farm prisons where they will be able to work. What is his intention in that regard? Will these people be sent to these farm prisons to do hard labour?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are no farm goals in the homelands. I do not know whether they would want farm goals in the future. However, I cannot imagine that they would. Now the hon. member wants to know from me whether we would send the prisoners there if they were to decide to have such goals. I do not think we can speculate about that at this stage. That is not the intention at the moment. There are no farm goals in the homelands at the moment, nor do I believe that the homelands would be willing to have such goals. He wants to know, too, why we do not write such a provision into the Act. I just want to refer him to clause 23 of the Bill (the new section 15A(2)(a))&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; on the authority of the Minister of Prisons of the Republic and with the concurrence of the Minister or Executive Councillor of an area &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is clear from this that these people will transfer a prisoner in consultation with each other. In my opinion no purpose would be served by imposing a restriction or an obligation in that regard. After all, one cannot cover every possibility in legislation. Suffice it to say that the Minister in the homeland and the Minister in the Republic will handle these matters with discretion. I do not think we can go further than that. Therefore I am not prepared to have anything written into the clause in this regard.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 24:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have a question or two to put to the hon. the Deputy Minister in respect of this clause as well. Firstly, in 24(b) on page <span class="col_5703-5704" refersTo="page_0542"/>21 there is an amendment which enables the Bantu homeland Governments to legislate in connection with the provision of financial assistance to citizens carrying on or undertaking farming operations. I quite approve of this type of empowering law, but I would like to know what the hon. the Deputy Minister envisages in this regard. I do not know of any farming undertaking being carried on by private enterprise in the homelands, i.e. to say by homeland citizens. I would be glad to hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister what he has in view in this regard and what developments he hopes will take place, or are taking place in this respect. I support the clause but I would like to know what is involved. Secondly, in the same clause, on page 23 of the Bill, the new section 31(B), there is a whole variety of new fields in respect of which a Bantu homeland Government can legislate. For instance there is tourism, legal aid, there is amusement and entertainment tax and then there is the licensing and control of places of amusement and recreation and there is the control of betting and wagering. There is also the licensing of totalizators. What is the policy in this regard? We know that in South Africa we may not have casinos or places to which people may have recourse for gambling purposes. That is not allowed in the Republic. Is it the intention to permit casinos to be established for example at Umtata, or in a variety of other places one could mention in the homelands, not to mention just outside Eshowe?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<p>You want a licence for one?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is it the intention to have casinos or to permit casinos to be established in these places? It is remarkable how the chatter in the House dies down when one talks on subjects of this kind. Is it the policy to permit dog racing in these areas? We have horse racing already which I believe has much to commend it, but there are other fields in which betting and wagering take place and where the control and the licensing of that betting and wagering will fall under the homeland Government. I would be glad to hear what the policy of the Government will be in this regard in the interim period prior to the independence of the homelands when I imagine there will be a fever of activity in this field if these powers are genuinely to be exercised.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the first point raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana concerns the financing of farmers and citizens who carry on farming operations. He says he does not know of any individual farmers, but I can tell him that there are fairly large numbers of private farmers in all the homelands. The idea is to allow the homelands to accept legislation in terms of which agricultural financing may be provided, in the first place, to individuals or private farmers and, secondly, to co-operative organizations in particular. In other words, what we are doing is to set them on the road to deal with this very important aspect of financing, which I am deeply interested in, which really involves major development and which constituted one of the bottlenecks. From the nature of the case the homeland governments may decide on the particulars thereof, because we do not lay down the particulars for them as far as these matters are concerned. What we are doing is to give them guidance, and the idea is to finance private farmers and co-operative societies.</p>

<p>In the following paragraph which the hon. member referred to, there is a great variety of matters in respect of which the homelands are allowed to legislate and exercise control. Of course, this already applies in the case of the Transkei. We do not have any casinos in the Transkei yet, but as hon. members can see, it is for those people to decide on the matter. We do not tell the homelands that they have certain powers and then place a restriction on the manner in which they will be able to exercise those powers. This is really a matter for them to decide. We cannot give people certain rights and at the same time deny them the power to decide on those rights. It is therefore quite clear that they will have the power to decide on all the matters mentioned in the legislation. This the Transkei is doing already and no problems have arisen in that respect. Neither do we expect any problems to arise in the other areas. I have seen in the Press that applications have been submitted for casinos, or whatever they may be, in Bophuthatswana. I have also seen that the Chief Minister said later that these were merely rumours and that they have never considered anything of this nature. In any case, it is for the various homeland governments <span class="col_5705-5706" refersTo="page_0543"/>to decide what they are going to do with these powers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer to certain of the items inserted by this clause, namely 31I and 31J as inserted by paragraph (e). Item 31I deals with the regulation, restriction and control of horse racing, the prohibition, restriction, regulation, and control of other racing and the restriction, regulation and control of betting and wagering. Item 31J deals with the licensing of totalisators in regard to horse racing. I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether due consideration has been given to this aspect particularly in regard to the fact that in the Republic the control of horse racing is mainly in the hands of the Jockey Club of South Africa. In terms of the rules and regulations which appertain to that club, all horse racing in South Africa takes place under the auspices of the S.A. Jockey Club. There is a system of control and of licensing of owners, trainers and jockeys and all those who are connected with horse racing in any way. Horses that are not registered on the studbook are not able to take part in horse racing which is under the control of the Jockey Club of South Africa. I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether there was any discussion on this matter with the Jockey Club of South Africa. If the homeland Governments should decide that their control, restriction and regulation of horse racing as is provided for in this clause is wide enough to permit the Jockey Club of South Africa to be the responsible body for the control of horse racing and all that is entailed in horse racing, in the homelands, to ensure that horse racing is carried on in a proper manner and to enable persons who might wish to partake in horse racing in an area under the jurisdiction of the homeland Governments to do so while they still retain the licences they hold in terms of the Jockey Club of South Africa&#x2019;s rules which, as I have said, are very stringent rules, is the Deputy Minister satisfied that they will be able to to so?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I know nothing about horse racing of course, but I want to say immediately that the Jockey Club of South Africa was not consulted. I have made inquires and they have definitely not been consulted, but I think that if the homeland governments should be interested to such an extent that they would want to enact legislation for the control thereof, they would call in authorities who would take cognizance of what is happening in South Africa. I therefore do not want to anticipate anything, but I think common sense tells one that they will take cognizance of it. We may then advise them how to set about things. The Transkei has not yet decided to do anything in this direction, but they are being given the basic right to introduce something of this nature. It is for them to decide in which way this is ultimately going to be carried out, but I can foresee that, as was said by hon. members, we shall call in expert advice from, for example, the Jockey Club and that they may possibly be given certain rights to exercise control over this matter as well.</p>

<p>Clause 25:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the same criterion applies here as applied to clause 8 which we have already dealt with. We are dealing here with the definition of the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; in so far as the Bantu Affairs Administration Act of 1971 is concerned. The word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; was previously defined as meaning the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. In other words, the very many wide powers which were to be exercised by the Minister in terms of that Act, previously had to be exercised by the Minister personally. It is now proposed to widen the definition of &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; to include &#x201C;any officer of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development acting under his authority&#x201D;. Just as with the Bantu Urban Areas Act in respect of the urban Bantu, so the Bantu Affairs Administration Act in respect of the rural Bantu and many of the urban Bantu as well, has wide powers governing virtually every aspect of the life of the Bantu who is at work for the White man in the White areas of South Africa. Conditions of service, where he shall work, for whom he shall work, housing, transport, the administration of urban local townships and almost every aspect of life is governed by this <span class="col_5707-5708" refersTo="page_0544"/>Act and by the powers of the Minister in terms of this Act. Once again, whilst one can understand that in a piece of legislation with as wide an ambit as this one, the hon. the Minister would wish to delegate some of his powers, there ought to be, we believe, some limit on the extent down the ladder to which those powers can be delegated. We feel, accordingly, that the delegation of powers ought to be limited to the rank of Deputy Secretary and above.</p>

<p>Accordingly I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After &#x201C;Development&#x201D; in lines 6 and 7, page 25, to insert &#x201C;not below the rank of Deputy Secretary&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This means that the Minister will have fairly wide powers of delegation. It can relieve him of the burden which rests on him to quite a considerable extent. However, it does not permit him to extend those powers to officials of his department below the rank of Deputy Secretary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the arguments advanced by the hon. member were basically the same as those we heard in connection with the other clause, because we are concerned with the same type of delegation here. From the nature of the case I can therefore furnish the hon. member with the same reply. The position is that although the Minister does not delegate left, right and centre, he cannot allow himself to be bound by the status or position of a particular official, because this would place certain limitations on him. He delegates with discretion. I therefore regret that I am unable to accept the amendment of the hon. member.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regret that the hon. the Deputy Minister keeps hiding behind this explanation, which he gives every time. What are we doing here? With respect, Sir, we are amending the definition of the term &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;. This means that in every instance, when you read through the Act and you come across the term &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;, you have to read &#x201C; &#x2018;Minister&#x2019; includes any officer of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development acting under his authority&#x201D;. We must look at all the powers which the Minister is given in terms of this legislation, and then we must ask ourselves: Do we really intend that these powers should be exercised by any officer of the department acting under the authority of the Minister? I believe that it is not right. I do not believe that we do intend these powers, mighty as they are&#x2014;as has been pointed out by my friend from Umhlatuzana&#x2014;to be exercised by any officer of the department. I believe that it is right that we should limit the range of the definition &#x201C;any officer of the department&#x201D;. I happened to open the Act here a minute ago, and I found that section 22(2) reads, <i>inter alia,</i> &#x201C;any regulation made by the Minister &#x2026;&#x201D; The Minister is going to make regulations. In this case we now, however, have to read &#x201C;or an officer of the department acting under his authority&#x201D;. This includes any officer. According to subsection (3) of section 22, the Minister may furthermore &#x201C;make regulations as to &#x2026;&#x201D;. In this case again we have to read &#x201C;or any officer of the department acting under his authority&#x201D;. What are the powers with regard to these regulations? He may make regulations regarding the regulation and control of the land owned by the board, the powers, functions and duties of inspectors, the procedure relating to the calling for and acceptance of tenders for the execution of any work, the adoption of the establishment and maintenance by a board of a medical aid fund, the movement of Bantu labourers between the administration areas of different boards, and generally regarding any other matter in regard to which he may consider it necessary to make regulations. These are wide powers, all of which we are not being asked to hand over to &#x201C;any officer&#x201D; of the department. In the circumstances, I believe that it is only reasonable that the hon. the Minister should accept the amendment of my friend, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the arguments of this hon. member are purely hypothetical. The position, as I have explained, is that the Minister uses his discretion, even if one takes into account the extension of the definition of the term &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;. Of course, he uses his discretion in deciding what rank the person concerned should have. Then he puts that in writing and gives it to the Secretary of the department. The fact that a specific official in a certain capacity can do certain things does not mean that this is a blanket delegation. I am sorry to say that we are having <span class="col_5709-5710" refersTo="page_0545"/>the same argument all over again. I leave it at that.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned a day or two ago I had already dealt with the question of the extent to which this Bill impinges upon a free society and the extent to which it impinges upon the rule of law. I would now like to look a little more closely at clauses 1 and 10 of this Bill and to spell out precisely what they mean. I am quite aware that this is merely empowering legislation and, consequently I expect the hon. the Deputy Minister to say to me: What are you worried about? We are not actually legislating to give these powers to a particular Minister in a homeland at this time. I expect him to say to me: We are merely giving these as powers in the various enabling Acts, to cover a field upon which the homeland Governments may legislate if they wish. I am quite aware of that, but these are fields in which the hon. the Deputy Minister, as a Minister of the Republican Government, is empowered to exercise authority in respect of the homelands at the present time. He has these powers in terms of the Unlawful Organizations Act of 1960, and until such time as independence is granted he is empowered to legislate in that field in respect of the whole of the Republic of South Africa&#x2014;not necessarily only this Deputy Minister, but also one of his colleagues.</p>

<p>Let us look at the powers which we propose to give to the homeland Governments in terms of clause 1 of this Bill. They are to be empowered to legislate &#x201C;for the purpose of maintaining public safety, public peace, order or good government&#x2026;&#x201D; Let us pause here for a moment. This means in simple language that they can do just about anything. These words are sufficiently wide to enable a Minister of a homeland Government to say: &#x201C;I require these powers for the purpose of maintaining public safety, public peace, order or good government.&#x201D; If one takes the last of these, good government, nothing could be wider. So it is in regard to those fields that he can legislate in respect of the following. Firstly, there is the prohibition of any organization of which Bantu are members or allowed to become members. In other words, because we are dealing with a homeland area, and because we are dealing with an area inhabited by Bantu people, he can legislate for the prohibition of any organization. Nothing could be wider than that. It could cover any type of organization, a political organization to which one is opposed or a social, business or religious organization. All of these fall within the ambit of this particular empowering clause. The clause goes on to provide that he may prohibit the membership of such an organization, he may prohibit the furtherance of the objects of any organization and he may prohibit or restrict any Bantu being an office-bearer of any such organization. This, of course, could empower the prohibition of the leaders of political parties in the homelands, in the form in which this is drawn. He may further legislate for the restriction of the presence of any Bantu to a particular place or area, which means the power of house arrest or banning powers in relation to a particular town or magisterial district or tribal area merely on the pretext of good government. These provisions also embody the prohibition of the publication or dissemination of the contents of any speech, utterance, writing or statement of any Bantu. This does not necessarily refer to a person belonging to one of the prohibited bodies or organizations, not necessarily a person preaching sedition or undermining the authority of the State but merely a person who in the opinion of the authority concerned makes speeches or utterances which are against good government. One could not wish for provisions wider than these that are set out in clause 1. These provisions are in respect of the Transkei.</p>

<p>If one looks at clause 10, one finds similar provisions, almost identical provisions, in respect of all the other Bantu homelands <span class="col_5711-5712" refersTo="page_0546"/>because clause 10 amends Schedule 1 of the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act.</p>

<p>As I have already indicated, we have expressed the view in the past that there are times, for example, times of war, or times of national emergency, when a Government is entitled to ask its legislature for powers of this kind for a limited period. As I have indicated, this party has been prepared to honour that and support it in the past in the interests of good government and peaceful and orderly progress. However, there is nothing to show either that these empowering provisions are required at this time, separately from the powers that the hon. the Minister or the Government have, or that they will be used only in those recognized times of emergency which I have already indicated are permissible. Consequently I cannot see any good reason for the hon. the Minister asking this House to legislate in this regard. One can understand that in a multi-racial or, as the Government likes to call it, a multi-national country, a greater strain is placed upon the Executive than one would perhaps expect in homogeneous societies. One can understand that in the isolation in which South Africa finds itself there are perhaps greater strains placed upon the Executive than one would find elsewhere in countries which are not so isolated.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I always strike a positive note. I defy any hon. member on that side and particularly, if I may say so in a friendly spirit, the hon. member for Potchefstroom, to name an occasion when I have spoken irresponsibly in this House or anywhere else. [Interjections.] Sir, I was dealing with the real difficulties which face the executive authority in South Africa at any time, and particularly at this time. I will accept that difficulties face the executive at this time. I will accept that difficulties face the executive authority in the homelands, in terms of the difficulties which face the Governments of the homeland territorial authorities; I am quite prepared to accept that they have difficulties as well. They are embarking upon a new field of endeavour so far as they are concerned, and they are governing territories that would be required in their turn to look to a new authority and these constitute difficulties, but I believe that one of the skills of government which we require and which we have and which we wish to breed and to generate in those to whom we are delegating authority is the ability and the skill to govern without emergency regulations of this kind even under the most difficult circumstances, because, Sir, this is what the art of democracy is all about. The art of democracy is to acquire skills to carry out executive government under the ordinary laws of the land and without resort to extraordinary legislation and extraordinary powers such as are envisaged and set out in clauses 1 and 10 of this Bill. Sir, what I have said applies to the present Government and it would apply equally to a United Party Government should we be placed in power, and it would apply equally to a United Party Government endeavouring to implement its federal policy. But I believe that there is a deeper ingrained sense of preparedness to govern even under the most difficult circumstances without recourse to Draconian legislation of this kind on our side of the House than there is on the other side of the House, and consequently I believe it is a mistake to bring in legislation of this kind in respect of the various homeland governments. If an emergency situation should arise&#x2014;and I hope that there never will&#x2014;either in the homelands or elsewhere, the hon. the Minister and his colleagues have powers at the moment to deal with that situation, and just as we were prepared in 1960, when there was an emergency situation, to support the Government in their efforts to restore law and order&#x2014;unlike some other people in this House we would not hesitate to do so once again in the event of a national emergency. But, Sir, the present times are not those times, and I am very grateful to be able to say that. Consequently we will not be supporting this Bill at Second Reading.</p>

<p>For the rest, the remaining clauses are not of any great consequence and we are not opposed to them. There are clauses 2, 4 and 8 which enable the Minister to guarantee the raising of loans in respect of the Bantu areas. They have power to raise loans at the present time. The provision that their governments should have statutory authority to furnish guarantees has our support. Then, Sir, there are clauses 3 and 7 which fall together, and these amendments are designed to eliminate overlapping in legislative authority in the homeland areas prior to the stage of self-government, <span class="col_5713-5714" refersTo="page_0547"/>that is to say, an overlapping between the powers of the authorities which have powers at the present time, be they the legislative council of South-West or this Parliament, and the powers which are to be acquired by the homeland legislative bodies. Clauses 5 and 9 have similar powers to eliminate competitive legislative authority, and finally there is clause 6 which deals with the question of labour bureaux in so far as South-West Africa is concerned. Now, we have no objection to the remaining clauses of the Bill. It is really a matter of debating clauses 1 and 10 and I hope that I have given sufficient reasons to indicate why this side of the House cannot support the Bill at Second Reading.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>On Monday night, and tonight again, we have had from the hon. member for Umhlatuzana the usual negative sounds we hear from that side when security legislation is involved. Once again we had the usual hackneyed clich&#x00E9;s about the &#x201C;free society&#x201D; and the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;, the usual suggestion, with regard to the security of the country, that this side of the House wants to play the part of an oppressor in regard to the rights and the freedoms of the individual, that we advocate an unjust dispensation in which the freedoms of the individual will be suppressed, and that this legislation implies an inherent threat to this &#x201C;free society&#x201D; and the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. It is true that in a brighter moment the hon. member tried to sound positive this evening, and that was also spotted at that moment by the hon. member for Potchefstroom. However, in the course of my speech I want to confront the hon. member with what he said on Monday evening, a speech in which no positive note was discernible. If we were to analyse his speech critically&#x2014;and that, too, he tried to anticipate but, as I shall try to indicate, unsuccessfully&#x2014;it was in the first instance a motion of no-confidence in the legislative assemblies of the various Bantu peoples. He even conceded that clauses 1 and 10 only furnish these legislative assemblies with legislative powers, legislative powers relating to public order, public security and good management of the country. This legislative power is not just going to be exercised out of the blue by an individual, but will be exercised by a duly constituted Parliament, under the control of persons duly elected under the constitution of each homeland. It will be duly thrashed out in debate in the legislative assemblies and subsequently an Act will be placed on the Statute Book of each homeland. But what does the hon. member say? Without knowing what these legislative assemblies are going to say, without having any indication of what the content of this Act is going to be, he prejudges the issue and insinuates by implication that these Acts which are now being placed on the Statute Book will interfere with the freedom of intercourse, the freedom of the individual and the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. Sir, the hon. member&#x2019;s attempt to anticipate matters and say that he expects us to say this, fools nobody, because he has not made a single statement to contradict what I have just said. He did not indicate to this House why his attitude was by implication a motion of no-confidence in the legislative assemblies. Secondly, the hon. member&#x2019;s speech bears testimony to naivet&#x00E9; or to a refusal to face the present-day situation. In his speech he concedes that the rule of law is not temporarily suspended in a state of war or, as he calls it, a national emergency, but that there may be measures that are in conflict with the rule of law during such a period. He put it like this&#x2014;</p>

The bombs must first fall, there must first be violence and revolt, the corpses must first be seen, before extraordinary measures may be taken. Preventative measures to check war, violence or revolt must not be taken. We must not see the danger a long way off and try to avert a situation of national emergency.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member not want to hear my reply first? In this respect we are in a period of transition. This is a further positive step to transfer meaningful powers to the home-ends. It is illuminating that that side of the house begrudges these meaningful powers we want to transfer to the homeland governments. This further underlines the inherent lack of confidence in the homeland government expressed by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. The hon. member&#x2019;s attitude is entirely unrealistic. How can he want to wait for war or for a national state of emergency? We are living today in a world which differs from that of the 19th century, when the rule of law was established in a stable democratic situation and when authors such as Dicey could formulate this for us in a calm and clear manner. We are living today in dangerous times. I want to refer the hon. member to Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Cyprus. I want to ask him to make a survey of the number of coups d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat that have occurred in Africa up to now. I want to ask him to remember what Danny the Red achieved by means of student unrest in France, when he virtually paralysed the economy of France. I want to ask him to take a look at the mother of democracy, England, which is today experiencing a crisis of authority. I want to ask him, too, to read what the Le Grange Commission, on which his party was represented, reported.</p>

Having done that, he will realize that we are living in a time, the spirit of which necessitates extraordinary measures because we are faced with certain threats. I want to submit for his consideration a better definition of the rule of law than his, and the exceptions to it. I want to give him ex-judge Broome&#x2019;s definition of the rule of law&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, of course, is an invaluable right subject only to suspension when the security of the State is in danger.</block>

<p>I want to make the statement that the security of the State is in danger in every state in the west. It is in danger in South Africa, too, and we are not going to allow a crisis of authority to arise in South Africa as well through acting hesitantly.

<p>The hon. the Minister will tell you. Against this background we receive a request from the homelands requesting the right to do what is necessary because they, too, are concerned about this. They are also concerned about the security of their state. They, too, feel the need to take preventative measures, because they, too, discern certain underground activities. What measures are they asking for? They are asking for measures that will have the effect of safeguarding these very concepts, democracy and the rule of law. That is why this Bill puts before each one of us in this country, the question of what is to be done by a country when its security, its public life, its orderly society, its democratic structure are endangered. What must a State do when the foundations of its stability are threatened by undermining activity, by undemocratic and underground attempts to seize power, by the planning of violence, revolt and public unrest? What must a country do then, but what is more, what must a homeland, still in its infancy, do <span class="col_5717-5718" refersTo="page_0549"/>then as far as democracy is concerned? What must a homeland do when it considers the history of Africa with its record of coups and of destructive violence? What must it do when it looks at the West which, despite its long history and tradition of democracy, is staggering under the effects of its hesitance to maintain authority, law and order in a fair, but firm way?

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>To us on this side of the House the answer is clear. We have not hesitated to bring such legislation to Parliament nor do we hesitate now to extend these legislative powers to the homelands when they ask for them. If we look at this Bill, we see in it a fine balance between the fact, on the one hand, that we are in earnest in leading the homelands to full independence. It is for that reason that we are giving them more power by way of this legislation. That is why we are giving them meaningful power in order that they, too, may see to their own domestic security and accept responsibility for it. On the other hand, the Bill also proves that we are in earnest in not leaving those territories to their own devices, but that we want to continue to assist them to grow and develop. That is why those clauses to which the hon. member referred to so cursorily, also appear in the Bill, to the effect that we would request authorization for our Government to stand security for loans incurred by the homeland governments. Here I want to take the hon. member to task for saying in his speech that clauses 1 and 10 were the only important matters in this Bill. It is a person with a negative outlook who does not say that it is important that through this Bill the National Party Government is saying: &#x201C;Go on, develop, borrow money because we will continue to hold your hand along this road of development.&#x201D; The hon. member said that this was not important. I want to quote his words. What was his summing up of this Bill? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed, clauses 1 and 10 really constitute the whole Bill. The other clauses do not deal with measures of importance.</block>

<p>In other words, as far as that hon. member is concerned, the development of the homelands is not important.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I support this Bill in the full confidence that it is a positive Bill and that it constitutes further proof of our confidence in the homeland governments, in the legislative assemblies of the homelands, in the future of the homelands and in the maintenance of law and order and authority in the whole of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>I think that hon. member should stand up and make his speech instead of sitting down and making it. I resent some of the remarks that have been made by the hon. member for Vereeniging about the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and the hon. members on this side of the House. The hon. member said towards the end of his speech that we have no concern for the development of the homelands and that this had no consequence in our approach. He said that this step that is being taken is a step on the road to the development of the homelands. He was referring to clauses 1 and 10 in particular. I would say that the tradition of this House and this Parliament is that of Westminster. I would say that this is one of the last bastions of the Westminster system in Africa. We agree that in Africa one cannot wholly accept and apply the Westminster system.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to answer questions at all. The position is that we at the present time in the history of South Africa should not be seen to be departing from the Westminster system. We should not be seen to delegate a power when such delegation is not commensurate with the Westminster system. The hon. member for Vereeniging had a lot to say about the situation in Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and England with regard to terrorists. The hon. member should realize that these territories, these homelands, to which this law which we are discussing tonight applies, are not yet independent. He must realize that this Parliament, which is still to my knowledge and to the knowledge of the members on this side of the House the sovereign Parliament of South Africa, has all these powers in terms of various laws and can apply them. I do not believe that the time is ripe for such powers as are envisaged in this Bill. We have the powers, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said, under the Unlawful Organizations Act. We have the powers under Proclamation 400, which still applies in the Transkei. We have powers under the Riotous Assemblies Act, which applies to the whole of South Africa. We have the powers under the Affected Organizations Act, to act in the case of organizations receiving money from overseas. We have the powers of banning and house arrest. We have the powers of restriction that apply to Sobukwe at the moment. These powers exist. Why is it necessary to legislate in order to empower another authority and other authorities to have similar powers at the present time in South Africa when we know perfectly well &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I referred to the legislation before us, and not the legislation on the Statute Book. I abided by your ruling and withdrew my previous remarks. I am referring to this legislation. I think it is an additional piece of legislation, and it can confuse people, because it is bad legislation. If one looks at clauses 1 and 10, one sees that a certain Act is amended. In fact, the First Schedule to Act 48 of 1963, as amended by section 4. etc., is amended in clause 1. The preamble, however, states that part B of the First Schedule of the Transkei Constitution Act is to be amended. Clause 1(1) reads further:</p>

<block name="quote">6A. Subject to the provisions of section 1(2) of the Second Bantu Laws Amendment Act, 1974, &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here we have a separate Act: Subsection (2) reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law contained &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is confusing. I think it is even confusing to a country lawyer. It would probably even be confusing to the hon. member for Pretoria Central if he had to interpret a case in terms of this Bill, because he would not have to look at this legislation only. He would have to look at other Acts as well. This is a bad way of legislating. One finds the same thing repeated in other clauses.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the thing that amazes me about these two particular clauses is that there are Acts on the Statute Book at the moment that apply to people who do things such as those mentioned in clause 1 (1) and (2) and to organizations as mentioned in clause 10 (1) and (2). We have established a High Court of the Transkei and we have appointed a senior judge as Judge-President of the Transkei. I believe that these provisions are tantamount to an act of no confidence in that High Court that has been established in the Transkei and are probably an act of no confidence in the Judge-President of the Transkei. I believe that there are Acts on the Statute Book of this country which will cover everyone of the matters included in these provisions. I believe that this is bad legislation. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana put our case excellently tonight and I support his opposition to this Bill. I oppose this Bill completely.</p>

<p>Of course I accept it; it came from certain homeland leaders. But what did this same hon. member for Umhlatuzana say in 1962? It is interesting to note what he said at the time when he was still the hon. young member for Zululaod. I am referring to Hansard, 1962, Vol. 4, col. 6189. That hon. member is accusing us of not conducting negotiations with the homeland leaders. I am quoting what he said at the time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to come back for a moment to the question of the Transkei. I have attempted to point out to the hon. the Minister that he has all the powers at his command at the present time &#x2026;</block>

<p>The same song which the hon. member for Albany was singing a moment ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; powers which, if put into effect with vigour and determination could bring the communist agitators there to book. That cannot be denied, Sir. But until the hon. the Minister gets the cooperation of the people there, the cooperation of the ordinary Bantu living in the Transkei, he is going to have a very difficult job indeed in bringing to book any communist agitator with the powers he already has even together with the powers he is seeking under this Bill. I venture to suggest that his difficulty at the present time is stopping the agitation which he tells us about in that part of the world is because he has not got the co-operation of those people, the cooperation of the ordinary Bantu of the Transkei. They are people who talk; they keep nothing to themselves. Had he had their co-operation his agents&#x2014;I presume he has agents there; every Minister would&#x2014;would have been able to catch the communist agitators within 24 hours.</block>

<p>Sir, the Minister will reply to that.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, reference was made here for the umpteenth time to the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. There is a complete failure to recognize that our well-tried law of procedure and law of evidence rules were formulated at a time and under circumstances which were quite different from those prevailing today. They were intended to protect the ordinary law-abiding citizen against an autocratic ruler. Today the State has to be protected, and protected against subversive activities aimed at the structure of the State itself. The <i>modus operandi</i> of those elements is that they themselves abide by no legal rules and then rely on the State having to abide by a law of procedure and a law of evidence which are inappropriate against such activities and which they know can easily be circumvented. I want to go further, Mr. Speaker. We know that it is extremely difficult in criminal law to distinguish between preparatory acts and acts which proceed directly to attempts. Whatever the theoretical situation may be, we know that in practice it is extremely difficult to determine when a preparatory act, which is not punishable, proceeds and ends and when an attempted act, which is in fact punishable, begins. If the object is therefore to maintain law and order, in other words, to ensure the security of the community, and if one takes certain steps oneself and does not act arbitrarily, one is not contravening the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. In other words, Sir, the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; is not an exact, concrete concept. Learned authorities on constitutional law are even of the opinion that this is not a juridical concept, but is something which should fall under the category of political science. In short, Sir, if one amends or adjusts certain legal rules, one is still acting completely within the cadre of constitutional law. In this regard, allow me to put the following question to the Opposition: What, when all is said and done, is the difference if one suspends the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; in an emergency or during a war, or makes certain exceptions to it in the public interest? In this debate I should like to refer to what an American writer, J. E. Johnstone, wrote as far back as the forties&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Should the Communist Party be outlawed? We lawyers, who tend to be traditionalists and conservatives, have been slow to recognize the menace of the Trojan horse. We have dogmatically adhered to constitutional absolutes and individual rights which were adopted primarily for protection against domestic tyranny, and thus have blurred over important distinctions. It is one thing to afford seditious aliens the guarantee of a fair trial. It is quite a different thing to permit them to hide behind one constitutional guarantee in order to carry on their seditious activities in advocating the violent destruction of the Government and the assassination of our Constitution. To conclude, it is time for us to reorientate our thinking and for a militant Bar to recognize that our most important obligation is to preserve the whole Constitution.</block>

<p>Sir, the principle which is under discussion here has been argued so frequently in this House. It is a principle which is recognized in all civilized countries in which democratic systems of government exist. In the first place, it must simply be accepted that there are powers in operation today which cannot be combated with the ordinary legal processes. It is in fact the practitioners of this political dogma who raise a hue and cry and abuse all the legal instruments at their disposal when they come into conflict with the law.</p>

<p>In the second place, it must be emphasized once again that the objectives of this type of person and organization include the complete overthrow of the existing order. They want to create chaos and anarchy. If there are persons and organizations who in fact have no respect for the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;, any governmental authority which takes cognizance of the process of subversion, will take drastic steps to safeguard its territory and its people. We find grounds for this even in the judgments of competent and well-known jurists, <i>inter alia,</i> Mr. Justice Snyman, who has already given judgments in this regard. Sir, if one sees that the true foundations on which one&#x2019;s entire society is based are being threatened, surely one cannot allow the use of the ordinary legal rules against them.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the question of intimidation and other terrorist methods which are applied by these people. They create a fear psychosis in the responsible subject. They create a situation in which the ordinary law-abiding citizen is afraid to lend the authorities any assistance. In this way, proper order and the maintenance of law and order itself is defeated. The ordinary subject is not prepared, under <span class="col_5729-5730" refersTo="page_0555"/>these circumstances, to come forward and offer assistance, for if he were to do so, he is singled out for retaliation. I just want to quote here from a paper what an authority had to say in regard to this same matter on a certain occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any country where intimidation and other terrorist methods are used to bring about such a reign of fear so that people dare not help the authorities maintain law and order and proper government lest they be singled out for retaliation, the Government of that country, of any country, is forced to consider whether it should not supplement the traditional legal rules and procedures to meet these extraordinary circumstances. A Government does not then depart from the rule of law; it strengthens the rule of law. The alternative is anarchy and chaos.</block>

<p>Elsewhere&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Police cannot go to a judge to request the continuous detention of a terrorist if they do not have sufficient information at their disposal to make out a formal <i>prima facie</i> case for his detention. Furthermore, in the nature of things, facts may be known which might not be in the public interest to disclose. If a terrorist can hold a machine-gun to the head of an innocent man, why must there be objections to his detention in order to enable the authorities to complete their investigation or to take measures to safeguard the public? The State cannot wait until it first has a wealth of information at its disposal before clamping down on terrorists. That would amount to abdicating its duty to maintain the safety of the public.</block>

<p>Then, in conclusion, I want to quote what Sadar Wallabhai Patel had to say when he was defining the Preventive Detention Bill (1950) in India&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The majority of the detainees are communists. Our fight is not with communists or those who believe in the theory of Communism but those whose avowed object it is to create disruption and dislocation and tamper with communications, to suborn loyalty and make it impossible for normal government based on law to function. Obviously we cannot deal with these people in terms of ordinary law. When the law is flouted and offences are committed, there is the criminal law which is put in force, but when the very basis of law is sought to be undermined and attempts are made to create a state of affairs in which, to borrow the words of the father of our Prime Minister, men would not be men and law would not be law, we feel justified in evoking emergency and extraordinary laws.</block>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>There is one interesting point I should like to raise. As I understand it, homeland territories and Governments have at the present time the right to legislate extra-territorially, for their own subjects, in certain respects and to certain degrees. I would like to know whether&#x2014;because from reading this particular document I am not quite sure&#x2014;it is possible for legislation of the nature contemplated in clauses 1 and 10 of this Bill to be of an extra-territorial nature, relating to organizations or people who are not within the territory of the homelands. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could deal with that point when he discusses the matter. The powers granted, the implications of these powers <span class="col_5731-5732" refersTo="page_0556"/>and the legislation which might possibly be brought into effect, are very wide. These are powers to the homeland Governments to pass legislation in due course. One thing is interesting, particularly with regard to clause 1 relating to the Transkei Constitution Act, and that is that it is clear that these powers do not apply and cannot apply to persons other than Bantu. In other words, a legislative body of the Transkei cannot legislate, say, for an Indian, Coloured or White or for the restriction or banning of such persons. I want to say that we welcome this. This is obviously a correct move. When one has powers of this kind, powers that are inevitable&#x2014;and we decry the fact that there are powers of this kind&#x2014;it is entirely necessary to see to it that the powers are restricted as far as possible. On the same principle, why is it that the broad generic term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; is used? If it is intended that the Transkeian citizens should legislate only for their own citizens, why then by using the generic term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;, bring into and under the power of the Transkeian legislation people who are Xhosas, people who are from Bophuthatswana, Zulus or people from other territories? If the power does not apply to Coloureds, Indians or Whites, surely if this Bill does nothing else, it should retain its logicality in terms of Government policy.</p>

<p>Let us look again at these specific powers granted. The first power relates to organizations and the prohibition and the banning of such organizations. So, if in due course legislation is placed on the Statue Book and, subsequent to that legislation, in the opinion&#x2014;because I assume that those words will be put into all legislation&#x2014;of the Government of the Transkei, an organization&#x2019;s activities run contrary or pose a threat to law and order or good government, it can then be prohibited, banned or wiped off the face of the earth. This is a very convenient power for any Government to have; it is a very nice power. Let me ask hon. members on the other side of the House a question. Suppose the United Party is on the point of taking power in South Africa. [Interjections.] I am going to ask hon. members a question and I am asking for an answer from the other side of the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member is talking about Zambia. I shall come back to that in a moment. The second power enables a homeland Government to legislate in order to prohibit Bantu from being members of a particular organization. The third power relates to the actual arbitrary banning or restriction of persons, the very power which has found opposition in this House and elsewhere since it was first mooted. Finally, it is granted the power to gag any Bantu for an unlimited time and thus silence the opposition, if necessary, to the established regime. True, this is merely enabling legislation, but we do not pass enabling legislation like this unless we assume or know that the Governments concerned are going to enact such legislation. This is a factual situation. It is true that these powers are limited and that prior approval of the Minister is required before such powers are exercised. Taking into account this Government&#x2019;s past record on bannings, what confidence does that limitation give us? It gives us none at all and cold comfort to those who may run foul of the Transkei authorities in years to come. When the epitaph of this Government is written&#x2014;and may it be soon&#x2014;if it could leave nothing else behind it, other <span class="col_5733-5734" refersTo="page_0557"/>than the legacy of democracy in homeland territories, it would be remembered with at least a degree of respect if not love. The problem is that this is a Jekyll and Hyde Government. It is a Government that hands to developing territories and authorities the trappings and the uniform of democracy, but at the same time it hands to those people and Governments who have the uniform of democracy, the arsenal of autocracy. That is what this Government is doing. We heard a little earlier a rather derisory comment about Zambia. The Nationalists deride African countries to the north who use authoritarian measures for their own ends &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and yet, while deriding such countries, they create the very same machinery for States and Governments in the making in this country, machinery which they need not create because they have <i>de facto</i> control over the areas themselves The Nationalist Party should not abrogate or deny responsibility for these areas. This sort of power should not exist at all. If it does, this sort of power should, until independence, vest in the highest authority which is this sovereign Parliament.</p>

<p>This piece of legislation highlights some of the basic differences between the philosophy of the Nationalist Party and that of the United Party. I talk now, partly in reply to the hon. member for Brakpan and the hon. member for Vereeniging, of our attitude on the rule of law. The hon. members for Vereeniging and Brakpan took great pains to tell us that the rule of law, which was created and written many years ago in a quieter society and time, is really a somewhat outdated set of principles. We were told that South Africa is in a state of danger and that this legislation is being brought as a preventive measure to stop the dangers that we know are about to beset us. Yet not many months ago we had manifestos, documents and papers fluttering all over the country telling us that we are the most stable and sound country on the African continent. I believe that it is true that we are in fact a stable country, but then they must not come with the story that we are facing imminent dangers which threaten to beset us. If they wish to introduce legislation of this nature, they must tell us what the dangers are and who they are legislating against. They must tell us what sort of measures they anticipate introducing and what sort of opposition they hope to stifle by that means. The very term &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;&#x2014;I am referring to the hon. member for Brankpan now&#x2014;has come to mean different things to different people. To a Fascist, for instance, the rule of law means governing under the guise of legality. It means, roughly, rigid obedience and subservient obedience to laws passed by decree.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>To such a Fascist it means the total subservience of the individual in the interests of the State. It means, <i>inter alia,</i> restrictions on the liberty of people in the furtherance of the so-called security of the State. This interpretation of the rule of law inevitably leads to arbitrary bannings by the regime of their opponents in the so-called interests of peace. If we look at the other side of the coin, the anarchist or the subversive element, as you may describe him, looks upon the rule of law as a system in which he can undertake any activity without fear of any redress except through or by the most cumbersome machinery. The welfare of his countrymen is to such a subversive person irrelevant, as long as his selfish desires are attained. The true security of the State is of no consequence to such a person. One of the many dilemmas which we, and modern Governments in general, face, is that very often the people who claim the protection of the rule of law most vociferously are those people who refuse to meet the obligations of the individual under the system. Communists, anarchists and subversive elements do not play by the rules, but when things go wrong, they claim the protection of the rules quickly enough.</p>

<p>I know it is the hon. member&#x2019;s point. But my problem with members on the other side of the House is that South Africa and this Government are losing their sense of balance in regard to this principle. At a time when South Africa is not in a state of emergency, at a time when it is the Government&#x2019;s bounden duty, in terms of its own policy, to uplift the homelands, to extend to those territories enlightened government, and also in this <span class="col_5735-5736" refersTo="page_0558"/>unique period to foster the creation of a real democracy, the Nationalist Party, instead of doing this, is broadening the application of arbitrary powers, thus allowing the further erosion in South Africa of the benevolent, democratic application of the principle of the rule of law. As I have said, the differences between our two parties are great: Ours is the democratic approach, theirs the autocratic approach.</p>

<p>No, the autocratic approach. You see, I have problems with hon. members who talk about the rule of law and about Dicey; because when they talk about it, they use the phrase, but none of the members on the other side tell us what they really think the rule of law means. I am not certain whether members on the other side understand what the rule of law means. As I see it, the rule of law means broadly three things:</p>

<p>Firstly, it means that no man shall be punishable, except for a distinct breach of the law. That is the first rule of the rule of law. This time-honoured view is quite compatible in South Africa. It fits in with Roman-Dutch law and English law, and has for many years found application in South Africa, at least to a partial extent. There have been exceptions, particularly in the case of non-Whites, where the principle has been neglected. However, until the advent in South Africa of the rule of the Nationalist Party, the principle of arbitrary restrictions never found root. Under this Government, as is evidenced by the provisions of clauses 1 and 10, arbitrary restrictions are becoming a way of life.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>With the same lack of success, Sir. These arbitrary powers are used against its political enemies. They make a mockery of the whole principle. Under a United Party Government this concept would remain very much alive. We cannot go along with clauses 1 and 10 of this Bill, because we do not believe that people should be restricted, banned or gagged before having been convicted of a punishable offence. Here there is a vast difference when you think of the actions of the Government over there. Deportations, namings, bannings and restrictions are all part of the Government&#x2019;s suppressive arsenal. I think that it is a very sad commentary that these type of weapons are now being broadened and extended to other areas.</p>

<p>The second point, for the benefit of the hon. member for Brakpan, relating to the rule of law is that it means the equal subjection of all classes to ordinary law administered by the ordinary courts. I know that this hypothesis has never really fully applied in South Africa. Many different laws have applied to different people, such as the Native Law of Persons, which has always applied exclusively to Blacks. Then there are the pass laws, the laws relating to land ownership and in other fields the many exceptions granted to the Police Force in the execution of their duty, the short prescription times, etc. We understand that there is a need for differentiation in this way. But in this respect, and in one respect in this Bill, it is only since 1948, since the Nationalists came into power, that we have discarded the aspect relating to the ordinary law administered by the ordinary courts. The Nationalist Party has, as is here obvious, often and regularly sought to by-pass the courts in the furtherance of its political aims. This Bill is an open sesame to pre-independence homeland legislation and with the same result, namely the by-passing of the courts.</p>

<p>Then there is a final point in regard to the rule of law. The third principle forming the basis of the rule of law is that the rules of constitutional law are not the source but the consequence of the rights of individuals, defined and enforced by the courts. In other words, the laws of the <span class="col_5737-5738" refersTo="page_0559"/>country are tailored to the reasonable needs of the individual. Herein lies a very big difference. The Nationalists believe that there can be no security of the individual unless the security of the State is guarded by every means possible. We believe that the security of the State becomes automatic in a society where the individual is secure. Perhaps this is the key to the whole matter. However, if the only way to secure the safety of the State is by this sort of method, and from now on the safety of the homeland territories too is to be secured by negative arbitrary action, then this in time is going to escalate and is going to become an ever-escalating process. By passing these two clauses in this Bill we are transferring and infecting territories other than our own and other authorities with our State security psychosis. That is what we have here. We have a Nationalist Party Sate security psychosis. What they are doing is that they are now infecting other areas with their psychosis. When one has a disease, one tries to isolate it. You do not infect everybody else. The hon. member for Brakpan talks about fighting subversive elements. I want to say that if you want to save South Africa for the future, you will never achieve it through this legislation. You fight it by getting to the root cause of the problems. You fight it by creating viable entities in the homelands, by creating a system in terms of which the people are socially uplifted so that they have an economic future and political expression which will be meaningful. That is how you fight communism. When will the Government learn? You do not fight it with tanks, guns and Saracens. You fight communism with the weapons of democracy and not with the weapons of autocracy. The weapons of democracy are food, political expression, economic upliftment, education, political rights and to get rid of petty apartheid. That is how you fight communism. The argument has been put that all the other homeland Governments have asked for this. I can see hon. members all standing up, singing the same little song. It has been said that by opposing this piece of legislation&#x2014;and the two hon. members who spoke before me made this point&#x2014;we are interfering in the development of the homelands; we are interfering in those matters which are their right. The hon. member for Vereeniging says that it is a vote of no confidence in the homelands&#x2019; legislative assemblies. This is a serious charge. I think that no sane Government or Opposition would wish to interfere, since our task is to assist, encourage and aid them. It is not a good argument, because the Nationalist Party, in raising this argument have never in the past had qualms about interfering in the affairs of the homeland territories. They have always had a very big hand in the affairs of the homelands. They have told us that the development of the homelands will be a gradual development. The Nationalist Party has not agreed to every request put by the homeland Governments in the past, they have not given them every legislative power they have requested, they have not given them all the land they want, they have not given them all the finance that is required, they have not allowed all the industries to be placed inside the homelands instead of on an agency basis until recently. The Nationalist Party has never in the past hesitated to deny requests from the homeland Governments. What nonsense to come and tell us now that because we do not agree with this particular measure we are interfering in the affairs of the Transkei Government. What absolute nonsense. Surely, until independence is declared, this Nationalist Party has <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> power over the territories concerned. These territories and the Government of the territories in the final resort remain in the hands of this sovereign Parliament. Our task is to assist these Governments to build viable States and surely it is our task to assist with a steadily-paced transfer of power. It does not mean the duty to assist and encourage Governments in the making, to descend into the realms of autocracy. It does not mean that at all. It is our right in terms of the legislation and in terms of the control exercised over the whole of South Africa to control the pace of development. We say in any event that this is not a case of development.</p>

<p>We talked about consultation. We are told that this has been asked for. Do hon. members know what the people in these areas say? I want to quote from <i>The Star</i> of 15 August-</p>

<block name="quote">Leaders of opposition parties in the homelands have critized the new banning powers offered to homeland governments. Chief Tidimane Pilane, leader of the Bophuthatswana opposition &#x2026; said: &#x201C;The new laws are an abomination and we do not need them in the homelands. They will be used against political opponents <span class="col_5739-5740" refersTo="page_0560"/>and it will mean that some of the best brains in the homelands will be silenced. It is my belief that the central Government has made this move so that the homelands governments can act against people whom the central Government wants to silence.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was his reaction and that was what he said. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Baldwin Mudau, deputy leader of the opposition in Venda said the new powers would be used to silence individuals in opposition.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The central Government has shown by this that it is not interested in working peacefully with all parties in the legislative assemblies, but only with those who sing &#x2018;His Master&#x2019;s Voice&#x2019;, right or wrong,&#x201D; he said.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;If laws such as these are necessary to bolster homeland leaders, then &#x2018;self-government&#x2019; is nothing but a sham.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is the view, Mr. Speaker, of the leaders of the Opposition of the homelands concerned. That is also the view of the official Opposition on this side of the House. We say, if you wish to develop the homelands, use the weapons of democracy. Uplift them, invest money, build the infrastructure and assist in every way possible, but do not hand over to governments in the making legislation which is retrogressive and which in years to come could lead to the temptation to deny to the peoples of those territories democracy which is their right.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. G. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the hon. member for Sand-ton is under great tension. According to what I have heard it seems that he is walking around with a letter in his pocket. I cannot believe that he still has that letter in his pocket. I am saying this because he is far too light for that. He floats about in midair, and I therefore do not want to give any further attention to what he said; it was far too confused.</p>

<p>What I did in fact deduce concerning the standpoint of the official Opposition in regard to this legislation I did not hear from the hon. member for Sandton but from the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. The inference I draw from it, is that I may not dip my cattle to rid them of ticks. I must wait until they fall ill, and then I must inject them to save their lives. I am really curious to hear what the hon. members of the Progressive Party have to say about it. I have a sneaking suspicion that their standpoint is going to be that I may not dip and that I may not inject the cattle either.</p>

<p>It is clear that the expression &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; or &#x201C;supremacy of the law&#x201D;, has caused great confusion in the past. The concept is frequently used emotionally and this is in fact what the hon. member for Sandton also said. The meaning of those words depends on the meaning the speaker wishes to attach to them. The concept &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; has an interesting quality. Everyone who wishes to interpret the concept, accept that it is a good thing, that it exhibits a good quality such as courage or justice. Divergent meanings are attached to these words, as the hon. member for Sandton also mentioned. Only recently I came across seven different meanings in authoritative writings. When reference is being made to personal rights there is a measure of consensus in this respect, viz. that it means that an accused shall have the right to deny his guilt in open court and to defend himself by means of legal aid. This general principle is staunchly endorsed and applied in South Africa. The Republic of South Africa is a democratic state. The object of democracy, which hon. members sometimes overlook, is to create circumstances in which each individual can achieve the greatest measure of welfare. However, the individual cannot be allowed to acquire for himself in a selfish way the greatest measure of welfare at the expense of the common welfare. In order to achieve the object of democracy it is therefore necessary for the individual to exercise his specific rights and liberties in such a way that it is not to the detriment of State security. Now the question arises to what extent the State is compelled to intervene to protect the welfare of the community. There is always a difference of opinion in this regard. This is the reason why so many divergent interpretations are given to the concept of &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. Some people place emphasis on the maintenance of law and order. Other interpreters mean by this preference to fixed rules such a &#x201C;Bill of Rights&#x201D; in a constitution Act. This concept is also identified with democracy. The democracy with which this concept is identified, is the Westminster model, as the hon. member for Albany termed it. It is also said that the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; can only be maintained <span class="col_5741-5742" refersTo="page_0561"/>in a country with a democratic form of government, but it is not as simple as this either. For example, when a dictatorship changes and a democracy is introduced, that does not inevitably solve the problem of personal freedom, for suppression can be exercised by one, two or by a majority. As far as this matter is concerned, the hon. members of the Opposition will probably be inclined to agree with me. Suppression by a majority actually constitutes a greater danger than any of the other kinds of suppression. The power of public opinion in a democracy usually suppresses the opinion of the dissidents in its midst to a greater extent than a dictator can do by means of physical methods. When intervention in the rights and freedom of individuals is referred to now, there is a tendency to refer exclusively to democracy as this concept is understood in the Western world. I think, however, that no investigation in this regard should stop there. A wider investigation is necessary. In particular it is certainly necessary today to consider what is happening on the continent of Africa. What are the rights and the privileges of the people on the continent of Africa? What systems of Government do they have? I am now going to deal briefly with these countries, not in order to level criticism at these countries, but only to carry out this investigation which is now taking place in this House properly and completely. While these African countries were fighting for independence, most of the African leaders recognized democracy and expressed the desire to maintain democratic principles. Nigeria and Ghana in particular, two former British colonies, were held up as the living proof of the success with which the democracy of the West had been transplanted to Africa. Dr. Azikiwe, the Governor-General and subsequently President of Nigeria, had this to say in 1959&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We should be tolerant and allow our official actions to be thoroughly scrutinized, no matter how it hurts. Failure to tolerate the existence of an opposition party would be disastrous to the existence of democracy. We should not give the impression that we have extinguished British colonial rule only to enthrone in its stead its Nigerian counterpart.</block>
