<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to make an announcement in regard to the business for next week. As hon. members know, the Votes of the Minister of Health and of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs will be discussed today. On Monday we shall dispose first of the Second Bantu Laws Amendment Bill and then proceed with the various Votes until all of them have been disposed of; I hope that this will be the case by next Thursday. On Thursday and Friday we shall proceed with the Third Reading of the Appropriation Bill, which we shall then dispose of on the following Monday. After that we shall proceed with the legislation appearing on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>Sir, in addition I just want to give informal notice now of my intention to give formal notice on Monday that we shall start with morning sittings as from Saturday, the 26th, and that we shall try to finish by the end of the month. If we could have the hearty co-operation of hon. members, this should in fact be possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes at my disposal under this Vote, <span class="col_5743-5744" refersTo="page_0562"/>I wish to deal with a most important matter that has arisen between the doctors on the one hand and the medical aid schemes on the other. It is with regret that I feel it is necessary to deal with such a matter here this morning. It appears that the South African Medical Association, which is the recognized mouth-piece of the doctors, on the one hand and the medical aid schemes on the other hand, have found that they have great differences of opinion with regard to the workings of the medical aid schemes. I must point out that the South African Medical Association is a voluntary organization. It probably consists of 80% of the practising doctors in the country. If that is correct, then about 20% of the medical practitioners are not controlled by this body. Sir, when I talk about &#x201C;control&#x201D;, I refer to the voluntary control that this body exercises over doctors. The Medical Association has found it necessary, because of the differences of opinion which have occurred, to canvass its members to see whether or not it is possible for them to contract out of the medical aid schemes <i>en masse.</i> Whether this action is due to the unsatisfactory remuneration of the doctors, as they see it, or whether it is due to the conditions of service, or whether it is due to the unsatisfactory or inefficient working of the schemes, or a combination of all these things, I am not in a position to say. But I do say that if the doctors do contract out <i>en masse,</i> it could possibly lead to a chaotic state of affairs, and we must do everything in our power to avoid this. I do not think it is impossible for people who are sensible and not hard-headed, to come together afresh and to start negotiations anew. I would like them to sit down and take their time about ironing out their differences. I do not think that there are any differences at all between the doctors and the medical aid schemes that cannot be ironed out. If the doctors feel that their remuneration is too low or that their conditions of service are unsatisfactory, then there are ways and means of settling these things. If the only issue is the fees paid to the doctors, then we must face the fact that one of two things must happen: Either the contributor, if he is unable to contribute more, must get less for his money or he must be asked to contribute more. If the contributor finds that because of the prevailing circumstances it is uneconomic and in some cases almost impossible for him to contribute more, then we have to look for funds elsewhere, and where could this come from except from the Government? If the Government does not do this and does not help, then they will be failing in their duty. Sir, for years we on this side of the House have been saying, I think quite rightly, that we have to have a revision of the whole of the medical aid schemes as they operate at the moment. They have been in operation for some time. We who have been practising have got certain complaints. On the other hand we hear complaints that the doctors do not come when they are called to attend patients because they are too busy. We have complaints from doctors that they are not prepared to work for the remuneration that they are receiving; they say that their remuneration is too low, and that the time that is taken for their accounts to be paid is too long. We have had complaints about personality clashes. Well, this cannot go on if medical schemes are expected to work satisfactorily. I say to the hon. the Minister that we should rather have another look at the whole set-up and see whether or not we can do something to alleviate the position. I know that we on our side of the House would be prepared to go along to try to solve the problem if there are problems which are difficult to solve. But on the other hand I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he must now give serious consideration to the proposals I have made over and over again in this House, that the Government must take some part in helping these medical aid schemes to work effectively. How can they best do this? They can do this by helping with Financial contributions towards it, and let us now start to think along the lines of a nation-wide medical aid scheme to which three parties will contribute: Firstly, the contributor, the worker; secondly, the employer who would like to see his workers come to work in a healthy state, and who are in many cases doing this now; and, thirdly, the contributions from the Government.</p>

<p>Sir, for parliamentarians there is a special case. Why should there be a special case for parliamentarians? The whole matter is one of principle. I say to the Minister that we must look at this again and see whether it will not work. I am sure that it will, and if it works for us I am sure it can work for the rest of the country as well. I do not believe that raising the remuneration of doctors alone will solve the problem. It can only solve the problem today. Tomorrow it will start again. When we dealt with the matter of remuneration during the debate on medical schemes I warned that the period between the review of the tariffs by the body that was going to be set up, was too long. I warned the then Minister, Dr. Carel de Wet. I think the Medical Association also did not see the dangers of this long period in between reviews. Now that it has come about, and with the continual escalation in costs, it means virtually that there must be a remuneration commission sitting continually to keep reviewing the matter. If we do not settle this problem, we are going to land ourselves in plenty of trouble. The whole of the health services of this country can easily break down. I see it happening already. I see people writing to the newspapers about these things and I see in the Press that the Medical Association is seeking assistance. Everyone who belongs to this seems to be dissatisfied. There must be a fault somewhere. I ask the Minister to see to it that we get together and, as I say, we from our side will help because we do not want to see any disaster happening. I leave it at that.</p>

<p>In the few minutes left to me I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I am dissatisfied with the way venereal diseases are being handled today in our country. Since we have been using contraceptives, and especially oral contraceptives, I have seen a continual rise in the rate of venereal disease and I think it is time that the Department of Health got together a body to see how best we could warn the public against the dangers which are facing them every day.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to react to what the hon. member for Rosettenville said because he spoke about the sentiments prevalent between doctors and the department, and I should prefer to take up another line. Firstly, I want to pay tribute to a former member of this House, the late Dr. Aubrey Radford, who, at the age of 78 years, was still a sitting member of this House, someone who, to me, was the personification of that which is noble in the medical profession. Due to the attitude he adopted, I never saw him as a politician. In the speeches he made here, too, he always had that refinement we find in the description &#x201C;a gentleman and a surgeon&#x201D;, for he was a person of high integrity. That is why I think it is fitting that we pay tribute to him, and I want to express the hope that the person who succeeded him in his constituency will also look up to him as a fine example.</p>

<p>Secondly, I should like to congratulate the Department of Health on having presented us, for the first time in a long while, with as comprehensive and detailed a report as the one that was tabled here. We know it is not yet complete, but if we peruse that report carefully, we can clearly see the extent to which the health services and the responsibilities of the State have expanded. To me there is one aspect which runs consistently throughout the report, and that is the question of health education. Sir, I honestly believe that many of the catastrophes and set-backs which have befallen the individual, the community, peoples and even continents, would have been far less severe if the available health knowledge of the time had been applied. Many children still die as a result of contagious diseases because we do not succeed in educating the whole population in health matters. It is tragic that we still have to see in the report that a disease such as diphtheria is still fatal in some cases. I want to tell you, from personal experience, what happened when I was still a general practitioner. During a diphtheria epidemic a small child was brought to see me. I had to perform an operation on him to open up an air passage, but the small boy died the next morning. I went to speak to the mother and because one naturally inquires about the background, I asked her whether the boy had not been inoculated against diphtheria. Her reply was, &#x201C;Oh, doctor, Johnny was not feeling too well on that day, and so we forgot about it.&#x201D; The bitter grief of that mother is something we cannot regard as something trivial. In this morning&#x2019;s newspaper we read another report that, after the wife of the President of America had been operated on, the wife of the Vice-President of America also had to undergo an operation for cancer yesterday. This makes headlines throughout the country and throughout the world, but <span class="col_5747-5748" refersTo="page_0564"/>it is because these are the wives of a President and a Vice-President. Now, one should like to know, if this happens in their case&#x2014;and we hope that in their case it was in a very early stage&#x2014;how many of our women are not susceptible to that condition? The degree of success which may be achieved by research, medical science and surgery is considerable. There is an 80% chance of a cure if such a condition is detected at a sufficiently early stage. It is so easy to make representations once again to the public and to every woman in this country. It takes a doctor half a minute to find out whether or not a small lump is concealed somewhere. One so often finds cases of people who come in too late. Then they say that they did in fact know about it. It is never anything serious. A typical expression in the medical world is &#x201C;it is not serious&#x201D;, until it is too late, for cancer is a disease which spreads unobtrusively and perniciously. That is why, in lay terms, we speak of cancer as one of those things which destroys without one&#x2019;s noticing it. Health education goes further. On one occasion Tolstoy, with a piece of bread in his hand, said the following, &#x201C;What am I to do with this? Should we eat it on our own? Should we share it? Should we give it away? Should we sell it, or should we use it to win the favours of the underprivileged?&#x201D; What I can gather from that, is that that piece of bread indicates that one of the most essential aspects of our health education is nutrition. How many of us know what to eat and how much to eat? Nutrition education is a multi-disciplinary task. The State cannot undertake it alone. The State would never be able to succeed in achieving any marked degree of success in convincing the public to eat the right kinds of food unless everybody&#x2014;the Church, the schools, the local authorities&#x2014;makes use of every opportunity to educate the public in connection with the foods they should eat. Health education goes further in many other spheres too. It is of no avail our having a medical research institute which conducts research into certain foodstuffs and makes certain recommendations if we do not apply those recommendations in practice. We also have the instance of the genetic investigations which will certainly be able to contribute a great deal to our having fewer cases of mental deviation in this country and encountering fewer cases of physical deviation. Every married couple can make sure that their genetic or chromosome composition is not such that there might possibly be a hereditary defect in their children. We have these services which may be used. If we use them, we shall succeed in keeping our hospitals empty. Then it would not be necessary to be concerned about the fact that we have too few doctors. Our motto should be that prevention is better than cure.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that health education covers a very wide field. We have our industrial development in respect of which the department deals with air pollution. Pollution inside the factory and pollution outside the factory fall under different pieces of legislation. So, in turn, it falls under other legislation if it takes place in the mining industry or under other circumstances. We cannot afford this; health knows no limits and no bounds; it goes beyond these things and affects mankind as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House should like to associate ourselves with the tribute paid by the hon. member for Brentwood on the occasion of the decease of Dr. Aubrey Radford. We appreciate very highly the hon. member for Brentwood having brought up this matter here this morning. We should like to extend our sincere sympathy to the family of the late Dr. Radford. We should also like to endorse the hon. member for Brentwood&#x2019;s argument on health guidance. I can tell him that we on this side of the House feel just as strongly about it as he.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Rosettenville said this morning that it was high time that a contribution by the State was made towards medical aid. He was asked during his speech by the hon. member for Caledon why it was necessary. I do not believe that the hon. member for Caledon is still asking why it is necessary, because I think everyone in this House realizes that this has become essential. Unless medical services are to break down completely and para-medical services are to break down completely, we must have a contribution by the State. All I want to say on the matter &#x2026;</p>

<p>Why do you not set it out?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Caledon must first listen. All I want to say is that a contribution can be made <span class="col_5749-5750" refersTo="page_0565"/>immediately. It can be done completely painlessly. It should start with free hospital services throughout the country. If the Government would make this contribution at this stage, it would at least lessen the burden on the patient. We on this side of the House have said that free hospital services would be a way of alleviating pain and suffering and also the burden on the pockets of the patients. We believe that this is something which can be done immediately. Despite what the hon. member for Caledon says, it is only in this House that it can be decided whether that is to be the policy or not because it is this House which votes the money for hospital services run by the provincial councils.</p>

<p>I should like to pass on to another matter. A very disturbing practice has crept into dispensing in this country. It has become evident that at least in two places, in Port Elizabeth and at Krugersdorp, dispensing will be done by medical men. We know that medical men should under certain circumstances be allowed to dispense, e.g. when no pharmacies are available. Where pharmacies are available, however, it seems to be quite wrong that medical men should organize themselves into dispensing chemists. That is exactly what is happening. I have a case here where two doctors in Port Elizabeth have decided to supply medicines to patients who have previously obtained their prescriptions through the normal pharmaceutical channels. One of these doctors when interviewed said that it was their intention to develop a practice which would provide an improved service to their patients as it was ascertained that his patients were not completely satisfied with the pharmaceutical services which were presently offered. It is a most extraordinary statement because, as we all know, pharmacies do not only work during business hours; they also arrange for pharmaceutical products to be available to the general public after hours. In many cases pharmacies are open from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. to supply after-hour service. Local pharmacists are on call in exactly the same way as the medical profession. This doctor who was interviewed, said that they would select their drugs as they now do and not according to their bulk purchases. He said that they would dispense at a price lower than that charged by the pharmacies. In this particular case the doctor had calculated that by large-scale purchasing of one particular antibiotic and repacking it into a consumer quantity, he Would gross 89% on his costs. The repackaging would be done by the doctors in their spare time, according to him. This is a most extraordinary statement to make because I did not know that doctors had any spare time. He expressed amazement that the pharmacists on the average purchased these drugs in packs of 20 and not in packs of 500 as he was going to do. He said that the dispensing would be undertaken solely by practitioners and that they would observe the requirements of the Act, but he was not pleased with the fact that it was necessary to keep a prescription book as demanded by the Act. There is a lot more in this connection, but my time is very short. That is in regard to the doctors who started a pharmaceutical firm in Port Elizabeth. But this is not all. There is another pharmaceutical firm at Krugersdorp. This pharmaceutical firm comprises medical doctors. There are altogether five doctors in this firm and they sent out a circular letter. It was stated in this letter that its purpose was &#x201C;to introduce our company to your profession.&#x201D; These doctors, I may say, had formed themselves into a limited company. They call themselves Clinical Ethicals Limited. The letter goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As you will see from our letterhead the name of our company is Clinical Ethicals. We are promoting a company solely owned by doctors and we have no tie-up whatsoever with any pharmaceutical companies. One of the objectives of the company is to promote pharmaceuticals and at present we are promoting a range of products as listed at the end of this letter. If any recipients of this letter feel that they have a product which can be promoted by our company, please contact us at the above box number. Due to the structure of our company we do not use medical representatives, but instead we have a public relations officer in the person of Dr.&#x2026;and if you should encounter any problem whatsoever in regard to our company please feel free to contact him, care of Parliament Building in Cape Town.</block>

<p>This is an extraordinary statement. Then follows a list of all the drugs that are available. I do not think it is necessary for me to say what is going to happen in this regard. Can you imagine these medical practitioners going into the pharmacy business and doing this on a big scale? Look what they are going to do. They have <span class="col_5751-5752" refersTo="page_0566"/>the opportunity now of visiting the patient, of diagnosing what is wrong with the patient, then of prescribing to the patient, and then thereafter, of dispensing for the patient. Can you understand what is going to happen? Only those lines that are popular with these pharmaceutical companies of doctors are going to be stocked by them. In other words, to reverse that argument, they are only going to prescribe those items which they have in stock. How is this going to influence the practice of medicine throughout the country? The cheek of calling their company Clinical Ethicals I think is the most unethical thing that has been done by these doctors.</p>

<p>They are retailers. I know that the hon. the Minister has already given this mater some thought and I would like to quote from what the hon. the Minister said during his Second Reading speech on the Medical, Dental and Supplementary Health Service Professions Bill (Hansard, col. 2794)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die bestaande bepaling dat geneeshere met sekere voorbehoude vir hulle pasi&#x00EB;nte medisyne mag berei, word in klousule 52 ook na tandartse uitgebrei.

Gewoontevormde stowwe en gevaarlike afhanklikheids-vormende stowwe word op so &#x2019;n los basis in sekere sodanige praktyke gehanteer dat dit &#x2019;n gevaar vir die publiek inhou.

Gevalle het onder die aandag gekom dat geneeshere by wyse van &#x2019;n rondskrywe aan pasi&#x00EB;nte die feit onder die aandag gebring het dat hulle medisyne goedkoper verkoop waar daar wel aptekers in die gebied praktiseer. Ek is van mening dat sodanige optrede absoluut oneties is en die Raad behoort daarvan kennis te dra.</block>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chariman, both the hon. member for Wynberg and the hon. member for Rosettenville referred to the relation between the medical profession and the State, and also made a few remarks about the operation of the medical scheme. I, too, should like to deal with this subject. Although I agree with these two hon. members in certain respects, I also have serious reservations about certain standpoints they advanced, especially as far as a State contribution to the medical schemes is concerned. If we in South Africa should ever allow our health services to be modelled on a national basis, we should have to bear in mind the fact that we shall inherit all the evils of such a system as well. As far as I am concerned I feel that this would open the door to socialism, a philosophy towards which we in South Africa are not striving.</p>

<p>Sir, I have the privilege of being a member of an honoured profession, a profession which enjoys high standing on account of the professional standards which have been built up over the years and on account of the maintenance of an irreproachable professional code of self-discipline. However, I was rudely disillusioned recently when I discovered on a visit to London that the medical profession has lowered itself to the level of a political pressure group and is prepared to resort to strikes with the concomitant result of loss of life and the suffering of patients, something which, in my opinion, is in direct contravention of the Hipocratic Oath which every one of us takes. However, we here in South Africa are in fact still fortunate that our medical profession has maintained its status and professional integrity within reasonable bounds. It has therefore been possible for the profession to be able to enjoy a considerable degree of autonomy within the framework of the official structure of the State. It is clear, however, from leading articles which have recently appeared in the journal of the Medical Association, that there is a large degree of confusion among certain members of the profession about the concept &#x201C;the autonomy of the profession&#x201D;. Just as the sovereignty of the State is not an absolute concept, so the autonomy of a profession or of a university <span class="col_5753-5754" refersTo="page_0567"/>is not an absolute concept either. The sovereignty of the State, for example, is restricted by its relations with other countries, by particular boundaries, economic strength, and so on. There are indeed particular spheres in which the medical profession, through the agency of the Medical Council and the Medical Association, and even individuals, has a measure of autonomy in respect of particular tasks, interests or delegated powers. But this autonomy, too, can never be absolute, because the profession still functions within the framework of the official structure of the State, and from the nature of the case has its own responsibilities towards society in general.</p>

<p>That is why I want to make a plea here, in the first place, to the Medical Association, to have the standing of the medical profession preserved, not to have our beloved profession used as a political pressure group and to have preserved intact the high standard of impartial action which the Medical Council has built up and maintained over the years and which has inspired high respect and confidence into the State and the public in general. The medical code of ethics, as contained in the Hippocratic Oath, should be placed first so that the interests of the public in general and society will enjoy priority above self-interest.</p>

<p>According to recent reports there is some dissatisfaction, as the hon. member for Rosettenville rightly said, about the question of the medical schemes and their operation. I believe that this dissatisfaction may be eliminated by means of adjustments. In the same way it would be possible to eliminate the dissatisfaction about the composition of the Medical Council. I believe that we shall be able to iron out these problems by means of the necessary consultation.</p>

<p>However, I should also like to address a few words on this matter to the hon. the Minister and his department. As fax as possible the autonomy of the medical profession should remain intact within its own position of authority. I also believe that the hon. the Minister will always, as the past has shown, have a willing ear to listen to people when problems are being experienced, and that it will not be necessary for the medical profession to come along with threats of contracting out, and so on. The profession should always be consulted by its association as far as the drafting of legislation is concerned. This is what has happened in the past, and I believe that in the future, too, the hon. the Minister will have proper consultations with the Medical Association and the profession before legislation is introduced.</p>

<p>We do not want to allow the fine relation which has existed up to the present to be disrupted. There should be regular liaison and dialogue with the Medical Council and also with the Medical Association, as is in fact happening at present. We may not allow the medical profession to degenerate through its association into a trade union or a pressure group from which irresponsible action will flow. Certain European countries are at this very moment suffering as a result of the irresponsible action taken by trade unions. The public of South Africa will suffer if there is no unanimity, or if the balance is disturbed between professional interests on the one hand and the responsibility of the State on the other.</p>

<p>Nor may we allow the State to yield to the pressure which is being exerted on it to start thinking along the lines of establishing a national health scheme. I am speaking as a doctor who has worked under the national health scheme in England. Such a scheme is, on account of the evils which are associated with it, neither in the interests of the public nor in the interests of the medical profession. The State&#x2019;s task is, in the first place, the regulation of health services, but the execution of professional duties must, as far as possible, be left in the hands of the profession.</p>

<p>We in South Africa are really fortunate that our physicians have been acting very responsibly virtually throughout and we respect them for that. The hon. the Minister and his department have always displayed a sympathetic attitude towards the profession, especially in the light of the fact that both the hon. the Minister and the Secretary for Health are members of this honoured profession. From the nature of the case, therefore, they have to have the interests of this profession at heart. However, we must also take into consideration the fact that the hon. the Minister and his department must, at the same time, take the broad interests of the country into consideration as well, and for that reason a balance must be sought between professional interests and broader public interests.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member for Newcastle will not take it amiss if I do not reply to him during the course of my speech because there is a very important matter which I should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister. I refer to the chronic shortage of district surgeons. It is a shocking shortage. From the answers which the hon. the Minister gave in reply to questions of my colleague, the hon. member for Rosettenville, today, we heard that there were 89 vacancies for full-time district surgeons. At the moment there are only 47 full-time district surgeons in employment. This is a terrible imbalance, in the sense that there are 47 persons in service while there are 89 vacancies. This is shocking, to say the least. There is something wrong here. There are 300 part-time district surgeons in employment, 295 of whom are White; there are no Coloureds; there are four Indians and one Bantu. This also is a shocking imbalance. There is something wrong. I want to refer to the <i>Government Gazette.</i> No. 4427 dated 11 October which records 35 vacancies for part-time district surgeons: eight in the Transvaal, six in the Orange Free State, 21 in the Cape and none in Natal. This is a vast improvement. Let me add that I have taken <i>Government Gazettes</i> at random and I have found that on 16 February 1973 there was a shortage of 59 part-time district surgeons. On 30 May 1973 there was a shortage of 52, on 7 September a shortage of 45 and on 1 March 1974 a shortage of 43. There has been however, an improvement in bringing the shortage down to 35 part-time district surgeons at present. I maintain, however, that this is an unhealthy state of affairs and that these shortages are due to nothing else than to lack of planning over the past 25 years. Sir, this is a serious matter. There is lack of planning somewhere. Obviously the remuneration of part-time district surgeons is so inadequate that the profession does not attract the medical practitioners in the platteland districts. This does not only apply to the platteland. I found in the latest <i>Government Gazette</i> dated 11 October that Brakpan, Meyerton, Orkney and Vanderbijlpark too are without part-time district surgeons.</p>

<p>In the Orange Free State, Sasolburg and Theunissen, amongst others, are without part-time district surgeons. Here in the Cape one finds that Simonstown, Sutherland, Uitenhage and Ceres do not have part-time district surgeons. The hon. the Minister of Transport is the member for Ceres and he does not even have a part-time district surgeon! Unless these part-time district surgeons are properly remunerated for their services, there will be reluctance on their part to give their full enthusiasm to their work. In many instances, if not in most, medical practitioners refuse to accept these posts because of the scanty remuneration. Greater and greater demands are being made on those district surgeons who are in service. A tremendous responsibility is placed on their shoulders, and I feel terribly sorry for them. What do the departments of Police and Justice alone, not require from district surgeons? Medical attention must be given to policemen of all races and also to their wives and dependants. This also is the case with the Prisons Department. District surgeons have to conduct <i>post mortems</i> and give evidence in court. So much time is wasted, and don&#x2019;t I know it! District surgeons have to examine patients in cases of alleged rape, they have to examine mental patients and intoxicated persons at all hours of the night and day. This is a terrific strain. The Department of the Interior calls upon district surgeons to perform vaccinations and inoculations of persons who wish to travel abroad. The Department of Labour calls upon district surgeons to examine apprentices; the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions asks district surgeons to examine old-age pensioners and military pensioners, to say nothing of the Department of Health itself which has multitudinous duties, which the hon. the Minister is too well aware of himself. There is no need for me to go into this. What is the result, Mr. Chairman? There is too much work for too few district surgeons, whether they be full-time or part-time, and it is obvious that they cannot give of their best. They are overworked and, I would say, underpaid. I suppose the remedy is to upgrade salaries and allowances to attract the dedicated and vigorous younger doctors to make a career in this department and, secondly, to employ more registered trained nurses. Whether they are male or female does not matter.</p>

<p>I think his speech shows great lack of planning on his part. I thought he would argue with the Minister about weight-watchers or something like that.</p>

<p>*Sir, hon. members speak so readily of the collapse of medical services, but when they do so they are speaking of the doctors only. I think we should view this matter in a somewhat broader perspective. I should like to make eight statements here in order to indicate from what angle, in my opinion, we should view this problem. On the one hand there are the people who make use of medical services; there are the Government and the State institutions that have to make the facilities available, and on the other hand, there are the people who have to render the services, i.e. the doctors, nurses, and so on. I think the matter does not concern doctors only. Sir, how can we ease this problem? I should like to view the matter from eight angles. In the first instance, we must exercise control over the run-away horse, i.e. over-population. In other words, we should give more attention to family planning, which I shall come back to in a moment. In the second instance, I think there should be a continuous survey of the service needs of all the population groups, due regard being had to their economic conditions. In the third instance, I think there should be a shifting of the focus from an expensive hospital-centred service to a more simple clinic service. In the fourth instance, I think that more effective use should be made of our scarce professional manpower by delegating medical functions to a larger extent to supplementary staff as members of the medical service team. In the fifth instance, there should be the education of especially our Bantu people in their homelands, in order to teach them to make use of the greater benefits of preventive medicine. In the sixth instance we shall, in order to narrow the gap between the demand for medical services and the supply of medical services in the homelands, have to give attention to the training of more Black medical students in the first place and, in the second place, the training of medical assistants. In the seventh instance, we shall have to give attention to the more effective distribution of professional manpower throughout the country among all sections of the population. In the eighth instance, we shall have to work in the direction of gradually eliminating the overlapping which arises as a result of divided control over medical services. It is easy to say that we should train more doctors&#x2014;just by way of examining one of the points I have mentioned. But let us look at the circumstances prevailing in South Africa. As far as the White population group is concerned, the number of doctors, per million of the population, who are trained annually in South Africa, is already the highest in the world. The annual figure for South Africa will probably be 130 plus in 1975. In the U.S.A. it is 40, in Canada 50, in the Netherlands 41, and in the United Kingdom 56. You see, Sir, excessive demands for services are already being made on the White group. The medical profession is making much more than its fair demand on that professional pool of manpower, from which other services have to be supplied as well. We have been on the horns of a dilemma. It is easy to say we should train more non-Whites. It sounds easy, but up to 1960, 26 Bantu matriculated annually with mathematics as a subject, Bantu who do qualify for possible medical training, but from those Bantu other professional directions have to be catered for as well. But this Government&#x2019;s positive policy of education for the non-White races has resulted in that number having increased to 181 in 1970. In other words, 181 passed mathematics at matriculation level. From these 181 candidates, other professions have to be catered for as well. This year, for the first time, we reached the position where the number of applications for training as Bantu doctors exceeds the availability of facilities at the University of Natal. The Government has been planning for some time and has a very large specializing hospital at Ga Rankuwa, to the north of Pretoria, where a medical faculty exclusively for Bantu might possibly be established in the future. It is very easy to say we should establish a medical faculty there now; it is easy for hon. members to speak of a &#x201C;lack of planning&#x201D;, but one has to find the staff to provide the necessary training, and that is not so easy. These are not people one can buy off the peg at a trading store. One has to train them, and it takes years, and then one still finds the type of thing happening, as happened recently at the University of Natal. When <span class="col_5759-5760" refersTo="page_0570"/>they had the opportunity of appointing a Bantu gynaecologist in a Bantu faculty, a Black man with 13 years&#x2019; experience, they did not do so, but some other &#x201C;lightier&#x201D;, with only 1&#x00BD; years&#x2019; experience, was appointed. This is what happened in terms of the plea hon. members so often raise: Let us give the universities control over everything. But where could one possibly find the staff to man these universities? I repeat, this problem is not an easy one.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the salaries of district surgeons, which the hon. member for Umbilo mentioned. This is an old, stereotyped suggestion which is being made in that regard. All they say is: Pay him a bigger salary.</p>

<p>*Another matter I should like to touch on&#x2014;I obviously cannot touch on all the eight points I wanted to deal with&#x2014;is the question of the training of health assistants or the use of health assistants. It seems to me as though the group of people whose services may be utilized more effectively than has been the case up to the present, is the group we have had very much to say about in this House, the pharmacists. A pharmacist undergoes a five-year period of training. He subsequently spends 90% or 95 % of his working hours behind a counter, counting pills. No man needs five years&#x2019; training in order to be able to count pills. Those people have a very sound professional training.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The point that I want to make is that the State should well have been aware of the necessity for more matriculants and the necessity for more doctors. It is almost childish to talk about our output of doctors each year in relation to other countries, and then deal only, as the hon. member did, with Whites where the Whites represent only 3&#x00BD; to 4 million people and there are nearly 18 million people making up the non-White races in this country. Surely it must be self-evident to any State Department how necessary it is to provide this vital and important service to the community? I think a large number of problems which hon. members have mentioned today arise as a result of the fact that the actual amount on the Estimates which is allocated to Health is somewhat niggardly in comparison with the overall amount budgeted to maintain the affairs of the State. It amounts to, 0023% <span class="col_5761-5762" refersTo="page_0571"/>of the total Budget. I think that in this respect the hon. the Minister should perhaps make greater efforts to ensure that much more money is made available for health requirements in future. When I speak of, 0023% I am referring to the total estimates for Health in so far as the Republic is concerned. I am aware of the fact that certain health services in the homelands will be financed from funds allocated to those homelands. However, these sums are hopelessly inadequate to meet the problems of the day.</p>

<p>With regard to the homelands, I particularly want to refer to the incidence of tuberculosis. We find, for instance, that there were 55 000 new notifications for the calendar year 1973 of whom 46 800 were Africans. That immediately illustrates the tremendous problems with which the State has to deal and which the hon. member for Fauresmith last year described rather nebulously as &#x201C;a disease which we are unable to control&#x201D;. He said that the hon. the Minister had said on another occasion that it is a mysterious disease and that is why it is so difficult to control, although I find it hard to believe that the hon. the Minister would have made such a foolish statement. I want to say that the homelands are virtually the main source of the unfortunate continued strength of this particular disease in our country. It is our number one killer and it is our number one infectious disease. Out of the R90 odd million for this year the State has only allocated R19 million for this purpose. This shows an increase of less than R1 million over last year. I believe the State should allocate very much more to the campaign against tuberculosis. I feel that the overall budget should be increased in order to accommodate the additional requirements to combat TB. Arising out of what the hon. member for Fauresmith said, I want to say that I agree with him that it is necessary to provide additional medical aides for this type of work particularly if you have to provide a service for such a large and vast community where there is such a complete inadequacy of technically trained people at this stage. I think that the State is very fortunate that an organization such as the S.A. National Tuberculosis Association, Santa, has come to the aid of the country and is playing such a vital and important part in the affairs of our community. It might interest members to know that at this stage Santa has been able to establish 370 associations in the homeland areas of the Transkei and the Ciskei each of which will comprise at least 20 to 30 persons&#x2014;this is a very conservative figure&#x2014;giving us an overall figure of 10 000 people who will be able to spread educational matter and who will be able to give assistance in the discovery of cases. They will be able to assist in giving the BCG injections which will be required as well as in regard to other facilities which are necessary to assist in the prophylactic treatment of tuberculosis. If we are able eventually to overtake this particular disease in the homelands, we shall be rendering a service not only to the Black community, but to the whole community of South Africa because tuberculosis unfortunately knows no barrier. It is something to which everyone is susceptible and to which everyone is exposed. Therefore, rendering that service renders a service to the entire country. In that sense I believe that where the State is fortunate enough to have a private agency which is public in the sense that it depends on public funds, the wonderful co-operation which already exists should be extended even more, and the services used very much more than has been the case in the past. Santa for instance has been able to illustrate to the State Health Department by means of pilot schemes which is established at its own expense&#x2014;initially at Ga Rankuwa, Daveyton and other areas in the homelands and at Sebokeng and Krugersdorp which are areas adjacent to local authorities and even in platteland areas such as Ficksburg&#x2014;that it can create a form of machinery whereby it can do a complete detailed search for new contacts and also provide a method whereby immunization can take place on a very much wider and broader field than we have experienced hitherto. It is pleasing to know that the State has welcomed the service which it has rendered, but I believe that we should even do much more. We should not only encourage it; we should help also to promote it to a very much greater extent than we have hitherto. This will enable us also to overtake the other difficult problem in regard to the re-introduction of people, in whom the disease has been arrested or has been laid dormant, into a normal social existence and into the labour market. The latter factor is another very serious set-back in the life of the average Black worker who finds himself afflicted with the disease and has to leave employment immediately. There are many methods which can be <span class="col_5763-5764" refersTo="page_0572"/>used, particularly if we make use of the wonderful service which has now been established through the South African National Tuberculosis Association. I would like to say that there are other fields&#x2014;I am dealing specifically with tuberculosis because I place so much importance on it&#x2014;like the establishment of cr&#x00E8;ches and daycare centres where pre-school children infected with tubercle bacilli and require prophylactic treatment could be treated and looked after and which could play an important part in the march to victory in regard to this particular disease.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the hon. member for his constructive contribution in respect of a disease which most decidedly gets the attention it deserves in this country, although we may certainly give it more attention. I particularly appreciate his friendly and constructive reference to the contribution made by Santa. This is an organization which is of great help to the department in combating this evil, which is in point of fact a very difficult one to combat.</p>

<p>This morning I should like to draw the attention of this Committee to the situation in respect of industrial health in our country. If we look at the picture of industrial health in this country, we see that it is by no means a favourable one. There are many reasons for this, but in particular it may perhaps be ascribed to the fact that there are too many departments and bodies which accept responsibility for this problem at present. In the second place there is obviously a lack of co-ordination between the various bodies, and in the third place there is of course, also a lack of properly trained staff to carry out this function efficiently. It is fact that more and more workers today are becoming increasingly aware of the detrimental health conditions under which they have to perform their daily tasks. We pride ourselves on the fact that we have very effective and enlightened labour legislation. In fact, our labour legislation can indeed serve as a model for the rest of the world. As a result of our effective industrial legislation, we do have relative labour peace, for which we are very grateful, but this labour peace is in danger of being seriously disrupted if we do not give attention to health and the prevention of accidents and unhealthy working conditions in particular industries. There are signs that the labour force is becoming aware of the health problems they are facing. They are becoming aware of the fact that they are working under unfavourable conditions and that not enough is being done, in many instances nothing at all, to guarantee their health, and that they are not being trained to cope with the dangers facing them. People are becoming unhappy about the effect which their work situations have on their health. We have already had one serious outbreak of labour unrest in this country, at the time of the strikes in Durban last year. Although wage claims played a major role in that labour unrest, there were also many clear indications that the people who revolted did not only revolt against the wage structure, but that their working conditions too, especially as far as their health was concerned, had affected them adversely. Sir, we should take very thorough cognizance of that. Working conditions should at all times afford optimal safety to the worker. This is the only basis, Sir, on which we can really build a happy and satisfied labour force. We must take into consideration the fact that 628 000 workers are working in our mines and industries, of whom 595 000 are Bantu. In agriculture and in forestry there are 1,75 million workers, of whom only a small handful are Whites. In the factories there are 1,25 million workers, of whom only 250 000 are Whites. Sir, you will see that the vast majority of our labour force consists of people who have not yet been trained, as the White has been trained, in dealing with matters concerning his own health. They are people who still think naively on certain matters, but who are becoming aware of the dangers facing them on account of their labour situation. Health promotion and protection is an important part of working conditions, to which all industrial, developing countries devote very intensive attention. It is strange that we in South Africa, as the industrial colossus, as the leader on the continent of Africa, have allowed ourselves to develop a real backlog in this sphere. It is a fact that it will be very difficult for us to make up this backlog, in the light of the tremendous rate at which our industrial development is taking place at present. Active steps are, therefore, imperative in order to combat the manifold health problems in our industries and other professions, as is already the case in connection with other preventive measures. It is interesting to note that we in <span class="col_5765-5766" refersTo="page_0573"/>the industries have to contend with health hazards which are actually man-made and artificially created by ourselves. This being so, these are in fact the easiest illnesses to prevent and treat. By making arrangements merely to minimize those health hazards, we would be rendering these workers a major service.</p>

<p>If we look at the condition in certain of our industries, for example&#x2014;I just want to mention a few on the basis of a report which has come into my possession&#x2014;we find shocking conditions prevailing there. I read here in a report which was drawn up by the National Research Institute for Occupational Diseases that shocking conditions are prevailing, for example, in our lead industry and in our battery factories. It was found, for example, that in a particular battery factory a Bantu woman who had contracted lead poisoning, was summarily dismissed from service after that institute had made arrangement for her to be admitted to hospital. This is the type of attitude we still encounter. These people, when they become ill as a result of the work they are doing, are summarily dismissed. There is no machinery to prevent this or even to discover these cases. If they are not discovered by chance, they pass by unnoticed. I referred to a Bantu women. Now, it is strange that, in terms of legislation, no woman is allowed to work in lead factories or in factories where lead is the predominant element. This is the type of situation which arises. The fact is that the Department of Labour, which is charged with the task of inspecting factories, and so on, is performing a gigantic task. I do not want to point a finger at them. They are, however, being crippled due to a lack of properly trained staff. There is no health motivation among these people, and they are not health-orientated. That is why this job is not being performed effectively. I want to quote another example, which is also dealt with in the same report. The factory concerned has closed down in the meanwhile. That factory, in Durban, simply discharged the asbestos dust, which had accumulated in the factory, out of the factory into the atmosphere. The question is quite rightly posed in the report whether the relatively high percentage of bronchial cancer in Durban should not be ascribed to this type of thing. When there are properly orientated health inspectors to investigate cases of this kind, this type of situation will not arise. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate that the hon. member who has just sat down did not have more time because he was dealing with a very, very important subject. One would wish that for such an important subject the hon. member could have had more time to develop his theme. However, I hope very much that he will pass his remaining notes on to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>There are only two aspects to which I want to refer arising out of the report which has been presented to us by the department. I have to refer to these aspects in the form of questions because I do not have time to deal with them specifically.</p>

<p>I refer in the first place to paragraph 82, pages 39 and 40, where we have statistics about hospitals and numbers of beds, etc. It seems to me very strange and at the same time disturbing that particularly in the psychiatric sections of our hospitals we had more patients than we had beds as at 31 December 1973. If one had time one could mention hospital after hospital seeking to treat and to deal with psychiatric patients who are in mental distress: Alexandra, Fort Napier, Komani, Oranje, Sterkfontein, Tower, and so many others to which the report refers. I should like to have some information from the hon. the Minister as to what he is doing to rectify this very serious situation. In paragraph 141 on page 47 we read these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In co-operation with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development a favourable attitude towards family planning has been fostered in Bophuthatswana, KwaZulu, the Ciskei and the Transkei.</block>

<p>Family planning is, of course, of tremendous importance and I only wish that we could take this statement at its face value. However, when one contrasts this with a speech made recently by Chief Gatsha Buthelezi and reports in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 30 September, one realizes, as he makes it very clear indeed, that at least the Zulu people find it almost impossible to accept this whole concept of family planning and that for only one major reason. I quote from his statement as it appeared in <i>The Cape Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Family planning and the problem of population explosion will never really be tackled adequately as long as we live in a race-torn society. The elimination of <span class="col_5767-5768" refersTo="page_0574"/>racism is a prerequisite in dealing with the many problems in South Africa.</block>

<p>To put it in another way. Prof. Seftel in his inaugural speech at Wits University last year, put it this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Birth control programmes must be linked to socio-economic uplift. You cannot expect Africans to practise contraception when as many as half their children in rural areas at least will be corpses by the age of five years.</block>

<p>I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether in fact this whole programme of family planning which is so important in South Africa is receiving the kind of reception that is referred to in the report.</p>

<p>I want to go on to the whole question of the serious shortage of doctors which faces our country, a fact on which many, many people have commented on many occasions. I hope that the hon. member for Fauresmith will watch his blood pressure because he will probably be very upset by some of the statistics which I am going to present during the course of my speech. Although the White group comprises 17% of the total population, almost 86% of all medical students are White. Africans, who comprise over 70% of the population, have only 3,4% of the total number of medical students. There is another way to put this, bringing it right down to earth. Let me again quote Prof. Seftel&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While there is one White doctor for every 400 Whites, there is one African doctor for every 44 400 Africans in South Africa.</block>

<p>This suggests that our priorities are all wrong, when we are thinking in terms of the health needs and medical requirements in South Africa. The number of African graduates has actually increased, very marginally, but nevertheless the number has actually increased over the last few years. However, when one looks at the training of doctors in over-all terms, referring to figures from 1950 to the present moment, one sees something very startling indeed. In 1950 0,75 African doctors were trained per one million people. In 1960 that figure rose to 1,20, while in 1970, 0,65 African doctors were trained per one million Africans, once again only at the University of Natal. In between 1964 and 1972 only 268 African doctors, 197 Coloured doctors and 524 Asian doctors were trained in South Africa. This whole question of the shortage of doctors has reached very serious and urgent proportions. I hope we shall hear something more about this from the hon. the Minister when he replies to the matter in this debate. When I look at the figures that were given to me for 1972-&#x2019;73, I feel that there must be some mistake in the information furnished to me in answer to questions I have put in this House, at least I hope that there has been some mistake. In 1972 there was a total of 579 medical graduates (<i>vide</i> Hansard, 1973, col. 651).</p>

<p>According to the information given during this session by the hon. the Minister, and I refer now to cols. 33 and 34, there was a total of 441 medical graduates. If these figures are accurate, there has actually been a decrease of 117 White, 15 Coloured and 11 Asian medical graduates and an increase of about five African medical graduates, giving an overall decrease of 138 medical graduates between 1972 and 1973. That is according to information given by the hon. the Minister himself in reply to questions I have put in this House. If that information is correct, it reflects a very serious situation indeed. I believe, however, that this information is not correct, because I have checked the figures with some of the medical schools in this country. The two sets of figures simply do not tally. I should like to hear something about this from the hon. the Minister. There have been many commissions. As far back as 1966 there was a special commission investigating the whole position of the shortage of doctors. All kinds of plans were proposed. In 1971 the hon. the Minister suggested that there was going to be a doubling in the intake of medical graduates at the University of Stellenbosch, the University of the Witwatersrand, the University of Cape Town, etc.</p>

<p>When one looks at the figures of today, one finds that that simply is not happening. Sir, the hon. member for Fauresmith has reminded us of the complexities of the problem and the very real need that exists. One is mindful of this, but I want to suggest that there are some ways of meeting the present situation, and I want to suggest them very quickly in the last minute or two I have. There are six steps which I would ask hon. members to look at very seriously. Firstly, if we really want to face <span class="col_5769-5770" refersTo="page_0575"/>the situation, let us listen again to Dr. Bozzoli and throw open the Witwatersrand University to all our graduates rather than restricting it to only one group. Let us do the same thing in the case of the University of Cape Town. Secondly, let us stress the teaching of mathematics for Black people in this country. In 1972 there were only 495 Africans who had passed in mathematics. Thirdly, let us once and for all scrap this whole question of salary apartheid, which is driving African doctors who are qualified to look for jobs outside of South Africa in countries where the rate for the job is applicable. Sir, let us also scrap this whole health colour bar, which makes it impossible for a professionally trained doctor to give instructions to a matron or to a sister or to a nurse simply because their colour happens to be different. Then. Sir, a comprehensive scheme of health centres in the rural areas to develop the whole question of community medicine is absolutely essential. The last thing I want to say is that we have simply got to pump in more money into the health services in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Fauresmith answered all those questions, but I want to deal with a few statements made here by the hon. member for Pinelands. The hon. member mentioned the question of family planning. Sir, to drag family planning into the political arena is a shame. Family planning has to do with the interests of family life and with the socio-economic problems that we have to deal with. I think it was highly irresponsible on the part of the hon. member to refer here to a statement made by a Bantu chief with regard to the mortality rate amongst the Bantu. It is highly irresponsible to suggest that a Bantu child in South Africa only lives to the age of five years. [Interjection.] The hon. member asked what was the good of family planning if the mortality age amongst the Bantu was five years. Did he not say that? Of course he said it. Sir, do you see the irresponsibility of such a statement? I want to state categorically here today that the medical treatment received by people of all colours and creeds in this country is comparable with the medical treatment received by people in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Sir, I know the hon. member was quoting, but why could he not confirm the statistics with the Secretary for Health? If he had gone to the Secretary for Health he would have found out that the statement which he quoted here is a lot of rubbish. The hon. member quoted those figures here for political reasons. I want to say to him that he must not toy with the health of the people of South Africa to achieve his political ends. Let him rather try to use whatever he has between his ears to promote the development of health services in this country. He will then be making a worthwhile contribution.</p>

<p>*I should like to confine myself to the profession I had been practising before I was elected to this hon. House.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Dental health is an integral part of the general health of our community. I think it has been proved over and over that dental health should receive priority because it is very interesting to note that the first diagnosis of many sicknesses is often found in the mouth. Take a simple sickness like measles, although it is not so simple if one looks at its complications. The first symptom of measles is spots in the mouth. A septic focus in the mouth can cause many ailments, can cause sinus infections and blindness. Dental health, Sir, is of great importance to the public in general. We have to deal with this problem in South Africa, that with a population of over 20 million there are plus-minus 1 800 practising dentists in South Africa. Of these 1 800 dentists, 70% are in private practice, and with this 70% in private practice, only 15% of the community can receive professional services&#x2014;only 15% of the population of South Africa! I should like to know what the manpower loss is per year due to mouth ailments.</p>

<p>*Since there is an acute shortage of dentists, I believe it is absolutely essential that we pay attention to the factual position today, where the dentist concentrates on treatment and not on the other aspects which are of equally great importance, such as preventive guidance, educational guidance, and so on. Today the dentist simply has to concentrate on the treatment of teeth.</p>

<p>&#x2020;He has to concentrate on extractions conservation prosthetics and orthodontics. The dentist has no time to put it across that in his profession the old saying that prevention is better than cure also applies. In this profession there are means and methods to develop the dental health of our people to a large extent. I should like to congratulate the Dental Association with their dental health week. I think it was a great success.</p>

<p>*I think it promoted dental health among our people that this dental health week was held and that publicity was given to it. In future it is going to be necessary to use all mediums available to us to bring home to our people the importance of dental health services. I want to make an earnest request to the hon. the Minister, that he should consider the establishment of a national council for dental health. The establishment of such a council is, in my humble opinion, absolutely essential in order to take care of the health of our people. Such a council will not be peculiar to the Republic. Many countries throughout the world have already established this kind of council. What is basically important, is that such a council should be under the control of the Department of Health, and for such a council to concentrate on the educational aspects of dental health and on the preventive measures which can be taken.</p>

<p>&#x2020;When one thinks about fluoridation today, one realizes that one can prevent dental caries to a large extent. One can do this by the application of fluoride, by means of the different toothpastes one uses and by means of mouth hygiene. By these means, one can prevent a large number of the destructive illnesses which affect the <span class="col_5773-5774" refersTo="page_0577"/>mouth. I feel that it is absolutely essential for us to work along these lines.</p>

<p>*It is important that we involve the community in this. With the establishment of a council such as this, we should, involve the whole community, the whole population. If this is not done, we shall find that this will not have the required effect. I want to put it this way, that if we could afford one generation of young children the required education with regard to oral hygiene, and could take the necessary preventive measures for them, the required dental and hygienic measures, we would find that, after one generation, we would have wiped out the tremendous backlog we are experiencing today. What we find today, is that most of the time of dentists in the Republic of South Africa is spent on restorative work. If they were able to save this time, they could use it for further education.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>When he shows his teeth, and we manage to extract some constructive suggestions from him, we are always pleased to do so.</p>

<p>One of the aspects that was discussed this morning was the shortage of doctors. I do not intend to deal with this matter in any detail. I should, however, like to put certain questions to the hon. the Minister in connection with the question of the staffing of Bantu hospitals which is provided for in this Vote we are discussing. We know that the Department of Health is responsible for the running and staffing of these Bantu hospitals.</p>

<p>In the constituency which I represent there is a very large non-White hospital, the King Edward VII Hospital. This hospital is subjected to tremendous pressure. As far as additions to this hospital are concerned, they have been restricted as the hospital falls in a White area. This has resulted in tremendous build-up of patients and it has become absolutely essential for a hospital to be established in the neighbouring Bantu areas. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has already announced in this House that it is the intention to build a new hospital in the Umlazi area. I understand that building operations are to commence next month and that the hospital will be completed in 1978. A total of 1400 beds are to be provided at this hospital. The question that I should like to put to the hon. the Minister is whether he is satisfied that there will be sufficient staff available to run this hospital once it is completed in 1978. Obviously, the next hospital to be built will be in the Kwa Mashu area and staff will have to be found to run this hospital as well. It is therefore of paramount importance to ensure that there is a sufficient number of doctors who qualify to meet these ever-increasing needs.</p>

<p>The other matter I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister is the question of family planning and the part that is being played by his department in this very important field. As far as U.N. is concerned, 1774 has been termed the World Population Year. When one reads various reports available on this subject, one realizes that the population explosion has become a world-wide problem. It is a problem which is being dealt with by various countries on a regional as well as a local basis. In the main, however, this is a world-wide problem. If one looks at the figures of projected increases in population one realizes the tremendous problems that beset the world as far as this population explosion is concerned.</p>

<p>First of all, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether South Africa was represented at the World Population Year Conference which was held at Budapest in August, as this was a vitally important conference at which the entire problem was to be discussed on a world basis. Coming back to our own position in South Africa, we find that we are also faced with a rapidly increasing population. We know that a projection of population figures shows that there will be an increase of some 26 million in the population of this country by the year 2000, so that by that year our population will be nearing the 50 million mark. This also brings about the problems <span class="col_5775-5776" refersTo="page_0578"/>of a shortage of food. From various reports we know that starvation and famine are unfortunately rife in various parts of the world. It brings about other social problems such as shortage of housing and it leads to the overburdening of the welfare services that have to be provided within a community. We know too that there is the problem of unwanted children and unwanted pregnancies. We know that the problem of unwanted children often results in neglect and deprivation in the economic and emotional spheres. We know to that delinquency often develops because of the abuse of alcohol and drugs. This often leads to crime. If one studies surveys on criminology one finds that this is the type of background which often leads to crime. In recent times we have had the incidence of the battered baby where young children are ill-treated. All these things show the necessity to have a coordinated plan of action in regard to family planning services in South Africa. We know from the Estimates that a sum of R1 900 000 has been allocated to family planning services under subhead K &#x201C;Medical Poor Relief&#x201D;. This shows an increase over last year&#x2019;s figure. We also have to take into account that the amount of R90 000 which was previously shown under subhead P as contribution to the Family Planning Association of South Africa is now included in this amount. I think that the hon. the Minister should give an indication as to what is available and what his plans in this regard are. To carry out a family planning programme demands not only considerable finance, but also a well co-ordinated information and education system to advise the population and to overcome old customs and traditions. At present we have various levels of government which are undertaking family planning services. If one looks at the position of the local authorities one finds that this is a development which is taking place on an increasing scale. We must also remember that they too are subject to difficulties in regard to suitably trained staff. When one looks at the last report of the Durban City Medical Officer of Health one will see that the attendance at family planning clinics is steadily increasing, and that they do claim to be able to assist in the educational aspect. Specialized staff, however, have to be provided for the family planning clinics because they play an essential part in the successful implementation of family planning services. If the various methods of contraception that are advocated by the family planning clinics are found to be satisfactory, this fact will gain the confidence of the community. Where there are failures, this represents a 100% failure as far as the person attending the clinic is concerned, and does in turn have an adverse effect on the work done by the family planning clinic.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to the family planning situation at provincial hospitals. The departments of obstetrics at these hospitals have in recent times appointed persons to assist in family planning services. I refer particularly to the King Edward VII hospital which has a very large number of obstetrical patients. In 1973 there were over 25 000 confinements at this hospital alone. I think the important aspect here is the availability of training for the specialized task of instruction and the carrying out of new methods and devices in the field of birth control such as the IUD system and other systems which are now becoming more common and which are being used particularly among the more unsophisticated sections of the community. Here, for example, at the King Edward day hospital where they have family planning activities taking place, it is required that nurses undergo a certain amount of in-training. I understand that there is a training course which is provided in Pretoria to assist these people. This means the creation of new posts for registered nurses to assist with family planning activities in these obstetric units that are in existence in the various obstetric departments of our provincial hospitals. This is really based on three levels of government. There is the part played by the state department, the part played by the provincial administration and the provincial hospitals and the part which is played by the health clinics of the local authorities. This means that there has to be co-ordination of these efforts. We also have the welfare organizations and family planning associations, which in the private sphere are also endeavouring to bring about a more satisfactory situation as far as family planning services are concerned. They also assist in the education of people to accept family planning as a part of life. This matter requires the co-ordination of the various spheres of government as well as the professional assistance of trained people to undertake this very important task at the various family planning clinics. I think that <span class="col_5777-5778" refersTo="page_0579"/>the hon. the Minister is probably fully aware of the situation as far as the population explosion is concerned. I do hope that the hon. the Minister can give us some indication today of an increased plan of action so as to ensure that an effective service is provided for the benefit of the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to repeat: This member does not know what he is talking about, and he is proving it more and more. This pharmaceutical firm is not a retail firm.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not say what some newspapers had said. One newspaper said that, when I was not here in Parliament, I acted as a partner to a firm in Krugersdorp. Of course that is not true. I resigned from that firm as far back as 31 December last year, and I am not associated with <span class="col_5779-5780" refersTo="page_0580"/>any partnership. I have more right to speak in public than does Prof. Chris Barnard, for he is still working at a hospital and I am not.</p>

<p>Let me mention a few facts about Clinical Ethicals. I did not write that letter. I am not responsible for it. The purpose of that letter was twofold. This firm deals with certain products about which it decides itself, products which are made by pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. Then certain pharmacists thought that one of these pharmaceutical companies had sold shares to the doctors, and that the doctors were now prescribing those remedies. That is not so. Then this company felt unhappy about it. The main reason why this letter was written was to make it clear to the pharmacists that the doctors had not taken out any shares in that firm Clinical Ethicals. That is why they said, &#x201C;We have no tie-up whatsoever&#x201D;. Of course, that is not altogether true. What was actually meant, was that there was no financial arrangement between the two in the sense that the one held shares in the other. The other reason why the letter was written is that pharmacists practise substitution. This letter was not addressed to the public Press or to laymen; it was written to pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies. It was a business letter. I have said it before in this House and I say it again: substitution does indeed take place. This applies to many different concerns. Sir, I may just give you one quick example. I want to mention the names of the products. Butazolidine, butuna and butrex are all the same product which is manufactured by different firms. Basically these three products all have the same chemical formula. But butrex sells at 95 cents per 20 pills at the pharmacy, while butazolidine sells at R1-85. If, for example, I should prescribe butazolidine and the pharmacist should supply butrex while charging the price of butazolidine, he gets Rl-85 instead of 95 cents. Substitution of this kind is not something which occurs very generally, and not all pharmacists are criminal offenders, but I have said before that not all pharmacists are angels, as is the case with doctors too. So there are problems in connection with substitution. It has already happened that a man has phoned me and said that his wife was sick. I replied that he should give her another two of the black and red capsules. He then said, &#x201C;But she has no black and red capsules&#x201D;. I replied that I had prescribed such capsules earlier on that afternoon. He then pointed out to me that she had pink pills only. Because the pharmacist had not supplied his wife with that specific product, but with something having more or less the same ingredients, the man most probably thought I was crazy and did not know what I was doing. Therefore, substitution is a real problem. That is why that letter was written. Unfortunately there were certain statements in the letter which were not true. For instance, the letter referred to a court decision which in reality was a decision of the Medical Council. The writer of the letter was somewhat confused. There was also a reference to a company which was allegedly &#x201C;solely owned by doctors&#x201D;. However, the company is not &#x201C;solely owned by doctors&#x201D;. Two of the directors are not doctors, and there are shareholders who are not doctors either. In the letter there was also a reference to me as a member of Parliament. It is a simple fact that I am a member of Parliament and I said the other day that someone could even send me wine &#x201C;care of Parliament&#x201D;. Nor do I like the idea that the writer mentioned my name and said &#x201C;care of Parliament&#x201D; and I do not resent the hon. member for Wynberg not liking it either. However, this is not unparliamentary or unethical. I believe it would have been more ethical if the hon. member had come to me and asked me what the true facts of the matter were instead of telling a story which was not true.</p>

Do you know why? Because the patients cannot develop a buyer&#x2019;s resistance to the medicine. Because the patient is ill, he buys a certain pill. This is what the company said and I want to know whether it is ethical. The main objective of the company to which I belong is to reduce the costs of medicines, and in certain instances we have already succeeded in doing <span class="col_5781-5782" refersTo="page_0581"/>so and we shall achieve even greater success. So I have nothing on my conscience. If I can bring down the costs of medicine&#x2014;they can be greatly reduced&#x2014;I shall do so, and if I have to make use of the House in order to do so, I shall do so too. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for their contributions to this debate. Since this was not going to be a lengthy debate, I first waited to hear what hon. members&#x2019; views on matters would be, what representations they would make and what suggestions they would put forward to see whether I could not react to them in such a way that we might also obtain in this respect that measure of co-operation which would be fitting in the sphere with which we are dealing here.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In the first place I want to refer to the hon. member for Rosettenville, who has been a member of this House for many years. He has always been the member who introduced the discussion of the Health Vote. I always make notes of what he says and I also noted with particular interest what he said this morning. He was perturbed about the relations between the department as such and the medical profession&#x2014;perhaps to a lesser extent&#x2014;and mainly about the relations between the medical schemes and the medical profession. I must confess that I am also perturbed about the relations in the latter case. However, I can inform the hon. member that negotiations are at present being conducted with a view to getting these people together. It has been indicated to me that they will try to resolve all their differences, or as many as possible, behind closed doors. I welcome that development, because it will be better for them to agree to disagree on perhaps a few points and to seek those areas on which they can find one another. All of them should be imbued with a spirit of aiding the health of all the inhabitants of our country.</p>

<p>He is also a little bit worried about the Medical Schemes Act and all the criticism levelled at the Act over the past few years. Since I took office as Minister of Health two years ago, I have had experience of the practical implementation of the Act and the effects this has given rise to. I myself do not feel happy either about some of the provisions, even about some of the principles, embodied in this Act. Early in the year I gave the Medical Association my personal undertaking that I would look at the Act after this session of Parliament. That is what the department is doing at the moment. The department is investigating all the aspects of that Act. It is investigating possible impediments to the smooth functioning of the Act and various points of friction which could possibly be eliminated. The department is investigating the financial aspect, which the hon. member mentioned.</p>

<p>The question of Government aid is something which has been raised very often in the past. That poses a problem for us because the granting of Government aid entails our going to the public and asking for more money. One of the hon. members, however, has pointed to the fact that we are slowly creeping towards socialism. That being the case, where does the autonomy of the medical profession come in? The problem consequently has certain aspects which are not all that easy to solve at this juncture.</p>

<p>*Dr. Reinach, chairman of the Central Council for Medical Schemes, sent word that he was engaged in going into all these aspects. I can give the hon. member the assurance that this Act was submitted to all interested bodies, and that all the amendments and the suggestions that may come from those persons will be considered thoroughly in the course of the next few weeks and months. It is our aim, if it is at all possible, to give attention next year to amending the Medical Schemes Act, at which stage it will then have gone through a trial period of five years. As everybody knows, a remuneration commission is appointed every three years. This commission has to report to me in regard to the fees which may be charged by medical practitioners who have contracted in. The hon. member also mentioned that so many of the members had contracted out. I do not wish to go into the objections raised by the Medical Association. At a meeting of the federal council of this Association all their people were advised to contract out. This is an unfortunate turn of events&#x2014;that I must say. Since then fewer of those people have contracted out than we thought would be the case. Therefore there are still many of them who have an interest in this impartial commission of which Mr. Justice <span class="col_5783-5784" refersTo="page_0582"/>Erasmus is the chairman and which investigates the question of medical fees every three years. There is no longer a preferential tariff as used to be the case. At present it is a tariff based on a realistic calculation of what the medical practitioner&#x2019;s work is worth. It is difficult to arrive at such a figure, but we must have specific rules somewhere, somewhere we must give up part of our autonomy for the privilege of having our accounts paid regularly. I therefore wish to announce for general information that the remuneration commission appointed under section 30 of the Medical Schemes Act, 1965, completed its work on 30 June 1974 and submitted a report to me. The following recommendations were made&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) That the items in the tariff of fees for dental surgery&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) with the exception of maxillofacial and oral surgery from item 906 to 979, be raised by 12% to the nearest five cents;</li>

<li>(ii) in respect of maxillo-facial and oral surgery (except consultations) excluded above, be raised by 16% to the nearest five cents;</li></ol></li>

<li>(b) that the items in the tariff of fees for medical fees be raised by the percentage mentioned after each discipline, rounded off to the nearest five cents&#x2014;</li>

<p>In terms of the provisions of the Act the Minister is obliged to amend the tariff of fees as recommended by the commission, and has no discretionary powers. The necessary steps for the amendment of the tariff of fees are being taken now, and the tariff will be amended as soon as possible by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> The amended tariff of fees comes into operation on 1 January 1975.</p>

<p>The necessary steps are also being taken to publish the report of the commission.</p>

<p>I should like to express my thanks and appreciation in this way to the members of the commission for the task performed by them.</p>

<p>*The hon. member also expressed some ideas with regard to the increase in venereal diseases. Of course, we are always a little worried about venereal diseases, because these are diseases which are hidden behind so many cloaks. There is a certain stigma attached to these diseases and people do not always come forward for treatment. One of the problems is that this disease is not a certifiable disease, and it is not easy to make it a certifiable disease. But every effort is being made to tackle this problem on as comprehensive a basis as possible and to get as many people as possible to come forward for treatment. They are treated at all levels of government, from Central Government and provincial government levels down to the level of district surgeons and private practitioners, and in all instances the Government is always willing to supply these services free or to subsidize them. As far as prevention is concerned&#x2014;this is an important matter&#x2014;the department is once again looking into its present preventive campaign, and I think we can expect improvements in this field also. For quite a long time people were not really worried about venereal diseases because of the availability of very potent antibiotics, but venereal diseases are coming to the fore again because of the resistance developed by bacteria against these antibiotics, and that is why I think that we will have to make a renewed effort to try to stamp out venereal disease.</p>

<p><span class="col_5785-5786" refersTo="page_0583"/>*Then there is the hon. member for Brentwood. I want to identify myself with the sentiments and the sympathy he expressed and the tribute he paid in respect of Dr. Aubrey Radford. I, too, enjoyed the privilege of sitting here during those years when he was still here, i.e. from 1966 to 1970. His disposition, the dignity which attached to him and his wide knowledge and great age were things which always struck me, and I take pleasure in paying tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brentwood, who unfortunately had to leave, also spoke about health education as a matter which was getting to be so extremely important in the world in which things around us are moving so rapidly and technology is making such rapid strides that we are totally confused by it and that even as regards their own health, people never know where they stand and do not have the time either. They imagine that with all our technological knowledge at present we can succeed in making man live for ever. I want to say that as far as that is concerned, the department is by no means adopting an attitude of indifference. We are very well-equipped, in the first place, as regards nutrition education, the correct foods to eat, and to undertake the correct kind of planning in respect of the education of the general public, and this applies to all the people of South Africa, all 22 million of them, without distinction of persons. As far as nutrition education is concerned, we already have a very extensive structure with a fairly well-staffed administration contacting the individual and the group on all levels, through mass media and through person-to-person education, through people who have had the right training and are already providing this nutrition education throughout South Africa. This is also done through brochures and the Press and the radio and all the means of communication he mentioned. Of course, we are also doing this in the homelands, if I may add this. We also have a programme for nutrition and other education for the years ahead, and we set specific targets. Perhaps we do not have quite enough personnel, but the personnel we have at the moment consists of 23 posts. These are spread all over the country, in our regional offices and in our head office. He referred to our genetics programme and the importance of people having to know the dangers of the hereditariness of diseases so that one may take precautionary measures in the case of diseases which are hereditary, i.e. congenital diseases. Do you know that one out of every 14 babies born today suffers from some handicap or other, physically or mentally? Actually, it is alarming to know this, i.e. that there are so many babies who have intellectual or mental deviations. That was why the department launched a national programme for combating genetic deviations as far back as July 1971, and why research is being done continuously. Therefore, this is also a whole facet of administration, this continuous research and the compilation of a register which will help us to know what is going on and what we should recommend to people with regard to genetic diseases.</p>

<p>The hon. member also stated his problem with regard to the overlapping of legislation and of services, and so did the hon. member for Fauresmith, with whom I shall deal later on. The idea of a comprehensive community medicine, a community health service, outside the hospitals in the rural areas, is something which has become very popular over the past two years and which, whereas it may have existed to a lesser extent earlier on, has been initiated and given shape to by this department in such a manner that it is already becoming a characteristic and is being accepted by way of the establishment of chairs of community medicine at the universities. We have already established three of them. In other words, in this respect, too, we are developing a new form of health service where there used to be tremendous shortcomings as a result of the disintegration of medical services.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Wynberg had some doubts about dispensing by doctors who own pharmaceutical firms or companies owned by doctors exclusively, and even manufacturing companies. I do not know whether he mentioned all that; I just deduce it from what he said. I should just like to comment on that. I think that hon. members do perhaps have a very clear idea of my feelings in regard to the matter; I think that I have made my views clear in the past during the discussion of various measures that have been passed through this House. However, since this matter has been raised again, I want to reiterate that I am of the opinion that a medical practitioner has an irrefutable right to dispense medicine for use by a patient being treated by him. I do not think that there is anyone who will disagree with that. <span class="col_5787-5788" refersTo="page_0584"/>Moreover, I do not think any pharmacist would disagree with that. In recent years, however, there have been developments that have given cause for some concern. Certain doctors dispense medicines on a large scale in competition with pharmacists, sometimes within a stone&#x2019;s throw of those pharmacies. Companies have been formed which have been owned exclusively by doctors to manufacture and sell medicines for profit. In my opinion&#x2014;and here I am trying to be fair; I am not referring to any hon. member in this House; each case has to be judged on merit&#x2014;these developments, as they have been put to me and according to the information I have been given thus far, are undesirable and could be regarded as being unethical. I think we must all realize that the medical, dental and pharmaceutical professions are brother professions. They should not compete with each other. Each should, so to speak, stay in his own home, in his own factory. They should not practise in competition with each other; they should stand side by side and aid each other. We must make optimum use of the manpower we have in this country. All these people are scientists; pharmacists are scientists. We spend a great deal of money every year in producing graduates in pharmacy. We have at the moment. I think, about 1 600 pharmaceutical students and about 4 000 registered pharmacists.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>About 270 students take up pharmacy each year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. As I say, the question of the availability of manpower is an important one. These professions must aid one another. We invest this money in the training of pharmacists but where do they go once they have qualified? This problem was raised particularly by the hon. member for Fauresmith. Where must these graduates go? Must they spend their lives selling tablets or other commodities? I think I have made my view clear that we must restore the pharmacist to the rightful position which he occupied previously. If then there are developments which we feel are not healthy and which may tend to harm the relationships that exist among these three professions, we must do our utmost to try to prevent them. As I say, the establishing particularly of manufacturing concerns by doctors can lead to malpractices. A man&#x2019;s profit motive, his personal gain, may conflict with his duty as a professional man. In the circumstances, I have asked the Medical Council to investigate the matter and to report to me in this regard in due course.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Newcastle also referred to medical schemes. In this regard he was of the opinion that a contribution on the part of the State was unnecessary. I have already dealt with this aspect. The hon. member will therefore forgive me if I do not go into it again. I think I have already stated my standpoint. This is the position. We do not wish to follow a course along which the medical profession will eventually degenerate into a trade union. There are professions and professions, such as our legal profession, the architectural profession, the teaching profession and the medical profession. These are professions which we do not wish to see as trade unions. We do not want people to exert pressure which the public may interpret as being mere profit-seeking. The hon. member for Newcastle said that we had to preserve the prestige of the medical profession, and on that score I am in full agreement with him. The tendency of the profession towards becoming a trade union is one of the problems giving rise to friction between the profession and the authorities having to regulate these services. The services rendered by the profession should not be rendered in such a way that it is made impossible for our people to retain their health. One can solve the problems between the medical schemes and the Medical Association by way of civilized negotiation. We could come together in order to eliminate the minor misunderstandings which will crop up. In respect of the hon. member&#x2019;s statement that we should preserve the autonomy of the profession, I just want to say that as far as I am concerned, the autonomy of the profession has never been in jeopardy. Various views are held on autonomy. I believe that only Parliament should have full autonomy, even though that is a relative term, perhaps even for states, at this particular stage in world history.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Parliament is the autonomous body in this country, and because what the hon. member has said now is actually a reference to differences with the Medical Associations, differences which are specifically concerned with the concept of autonomy, I think that I should react to what appeared in the Press this week. This appeared not only in articles in the <span class="col_5789-5790" refersTo="page_0585"/>Sunday Press, but also in the daily press yesterday, articles according to which the chairman of the Medical Association, not the Medical Council, gave a factual version of what had happened prior to the Medical, Dental and Supplementary Health Service Professions Bill having been passed. He gave a factual version of what had happened, but at the same time he made deductions in respect of which I think he was on the wrong track. I want to advise him to go and read the Second Reading speech I made at the time of the introduction of that legislation. In a friendly manner and as one colleague to another, I want to advise him to do this. He should just read up carefully what I had to say about autonomy, and then he should note that I related this to the demands made by the representatives of a profession with regard to the representation on a council which, as a statutory council, they want to be so autonomous that it would not be possible for the State to have any control over it. In our times things are slightly different. Perhaps these things will never happen in practice, but the State must reserve to itself the final say, even if it is with the qualification that it has to consult, and that has in fact been written into the legislation. Consequently I cannot change the council, which consists of members of the Medical Association for probably as much as 90%, in such a way that nominees representing an interest group will exercise control over a statutory council which will be under an obligation to the public of South Africa as well as to the profession as such. They have to prescribe sound training standards and also carry out other functions which are very important. Then there has also been an editorial in the <i>S.A. Medical Journal</i> to which I must refer. Allusions are being made to my having expressed two opinions on autonomy which supposedly differ from each other. What I said I said in two sentences, but this journal quoted it in a way which did not indicate the connection between the two. In the one sentence I said the council was not fully autonomous, whereas I said in the other that appeal from a decision by a committee could not, in matters relating to training, be referred to the Minister because the council was autonomous&#x2014;in other words, within the Act. But this autonomy is not full autonomy. It is very easy to quote matters out of context and then to create the impression that they are not logical. I do not intend dealing with this gentleman any further.</p>

<p>Business suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 2.20 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>At the time of the adjournment I was replying to the speech made by the hon. member for Newcastle. I had told him that it was my endeavour that there should be good cooperation in the profession which he and I had served for many years and would still be serving in the future in the circumstances in which we found ourselves at present, in which our loyalties and duty had, however, become broader than just the single loyalty to our profession. My door will always be open for official and meaningful co-operation and discussions, but circumstances and, from the nature of the case, the matter itself may nevertheless lead to my having to decide at times&#x2014;because somebody must decide&#x2014;whether such consultation or discussions will serve any useful purpose. He need therefore have no fear that on the part of the department or on my part there will be the slightest evidence of an indication, or an approach, through which these relations which have been good all these years will be clouded by an attitude amounting to our simply wanting to ride roughshod over everybody&#x2014;I find this English idiom to be so descriptive&#x2014;and to say &#x201C;I have spoken&#x201D;. This is simply not the position. This is not in our nature, nor will this be the case in the future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi spoke about the problems with district surgeons in our country. This is true. The shortage of district surgeons who are employees or part-time employees of the State is something which we find alarming.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member attributed this to various reasons, amongst them salaries. He also mentioned bad planning. I can tell the hon. member that you can do family planning, but it is very difficult to plan for district surgeons as such. He mentioned salaries. I can assure him that the department is well aware of the fact that these differences which exist between us in regard to salaries have come a long way, but we are very sympathetic, and we should be because the solution of the problem depends on whether we can be <i>ad idem</i> with them on the <span class="col_5791-5792" refersTo="page_0586"/>point as to whether the services they render to us are well paid for. But I can assure the hon. member that the department has submitted proposals time and again, but lately perhaps a little more intensively on our part, to the Public Service Commission for the betterment of the remuneration of full-time doctors, and full-time doctors as such are linked to part-time district surgeons. I can assure him that in many instances the remuneration of part-time district surgeons over the last few years&#x2014;and I practised 26 years ago&#x2014;is so much better in all respects, for instance as regards the allocation of medicines, salaries, etc., that the inevitable conclusion to be drawn from these demographic tendencies is that we do not find young people, qualified people, willing to settle in the country any more. We have perhaps also a little difficulty in the towns, but in the towns we mostly have enough district surgeons. The proposals that have been submitted to the department have been found acceptable and these are being forwarded to the Minister of the Interior. I expect a very positive answer, because I know that at the moment we can at least tell these people that as far as remuneration is concerned, they need not worry too much about the future. There is a growing shortage of all professional people in South Africa, mostly in the engineering and scientific trades, but in many other trades and professions there is a shortage. We must take that into account. The figures he mentioned are factually correct and I have no fault to find with that. He mentioned the lack of planning and certain medicines that can be applied to see that this matter is set right. I can tell him that we have a comprehensive programme to involve all types of medical auxiliary services, including the nursing profession, in a comprehensive medical scheme that has been in operation for the past two or three years. That scheme, which is something new, will definitely ease the burden on men qualified to do certain specific work for which they have studied for six to eight years or more, and we have decided that we can use our time and our manpower better to train people for perhaps fewer years to try to help our well qualified people and to aid them in providing a good medical service for all the people in the country.</p>

<p>*Then the hon. member for Fauresmith made a very interesting statement on how the problem of limited manpower could be solved. I listened to it attentively. He referred to family planning and a survey of needs, etc. I should like to tell the hon. member, if he will not take this amiss of me&#x2014;my time is somewhat limited&#x2014;that we are actually engaged in implementing most of these matters which he raised. There are, for instance, family planning, to which I shall perhaps return later on, a continuous survey of needs, the shift of the emphasis away from expensive hospitalization to clinics and day centres and the outpatient services, services which have developed tremendously of late. We co-operate with the local authorities and the provinces in appointing district nurses, along with district surgeons, to render a comprehensive service, i.e. instead of our rendering three or four services side by side with one another. The training of more Black medical students is receiving the attention of the Government. Oh, perhaps I may as well say now that the Government has given very urgent attention to this matter and has already taken decisions relating to principles, and what I may add at this stage is that the planning for a medical school for Coloureds in the Western Cape is in progress. As regards the question of delegation, this is being done already. I agree very emphatically with his statement that the disintegration, the divided control of medicine, should be eliminated, because we are in the process of a kind of integrated service in which one can, through decentralization, enable all our existing Government structures and Government bodies to perform their normal functions. This is the reason for existence or, as they say in French, the <i>raison d&#x2019;&#x00EA;tre,</i> for any Government institution&#x2014;in fact, for any governing institution. It has to meet a need, and we are in the process of seeing to that. He need therefore have no concern in that respect. Then he also reacted to the hon. member for Umlazi as regards problems which arise, problems which arise in any case, as a result of the rapid development of our country. We are doing everything in our power in this respect to solve these problems. The prospects are good. Over the last number of years the number of non-White students passing matric with mathematics as a subject and gaining exemption has shown a tremendous increase. Over the past seven or eight years this number has increased as much as three times over, and this is where we can therefore obtain an escalating new <span class="col_5793-5794" refersTo="page_0587"/>supply of students who are capable of taking the purely medical and engineering courses. Of course, I agree with him on the pharmacists, and I do not wish to enlarge upon it any further.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I always like to listen to the hon. member for Jeppe because his interest in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis is infectious, not in a bad sense.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He is perturbed that not enough money is being spent on certain health services. Sir, I do not propose to go into the matter more deeply now, but I can tell him that as far as tuberculosis is concerned, the treatment nowadays is vastly different from the treatment even two or three years ago.</p>

<p>*As he knows&#x2014;and he understands Afrikaans very well&#x2014;we are in a position at present to make an infectious tuberculosis patient uninfectious through treatment within a month. Then he can once again associate with members of the public and he can receive out-patient services, and in this regard our financial obligations have increased tremendously. These people&#x2019;s services can therefore be utilized profitably in the community once again, and this is extremely important. I do not wish to go into this matter any further, except just to tell him once again that I have great appreciation for the campaign launched over the past year by Santa&#x2014;the South African National Tuberculosis Association&#x2014;which is rendering supplementary services in this regard&#x2014;in an attempt to collect R3 million for the control of tuberculosis, and that I was honoured to be able to take part in it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock spoke about industrial health. This aspect of industrial health is something which is near to my heart, and because this is the case I have been giving special attention to it lately. In a moment I shall make an announcement in this regard. I think it will be a good reply to the hon. member for Cradock. I am very pleased that he raised this matter, because it is something to which too little attention was given in the past. Sir, we have far more than 1 million workers and far more than half of them are non-Whites. Sometimes these people do not even know to what extent their working conditions influence them. It is our duty as scientists and as a scientific department to give attention to environmental health and to take congizance of the rightful demands which may arise from the circumstances under which these workers have to live; to analyse the position expertly and then to take steps as the Government. For that reason the Cabinet has decided to appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate this matter urgently. We cannot start immediately, for these people are not available at the moment. Although it is urgent that something be done, it is not so urgent that they need to commence their work immediately since something is after all being done, but we appreciate that what we are doing at the moment is not satisfactory. The commission&#x2019;s terms of reference are to inquire into and report on&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) the nature, incidence, extent and effects of occupational diseases in the Republic of South Africa and the territory of South-West Africa;</li>

<li>(2) the extent to which existing statutory measures as well as existing facilities with regard to the effective protection of industrial and other productive workers may be falling short or may be overlapping;</li>

<li>(3) the need for and the availability of the various categories of trained persons who may be necessary to ensure a full-fledged preventive and promotive health service for workers, to exercise effective control over working conditions which may be injurious to health, to establish health services as well as advisory services in industry and to provide industries with guidance;</li>

<li>(4) the measures which ought to be taken for the adequate safeguarding of the public against dangers other than general environmental pollution arising from industrial activities (including agriculture); and</li>

<li>(5) any other related matters which the commission may deem necessary for the purposes of its inquiry.</li>

</ol>

<p>The composition of the commission is as follows: The chairman is Mr. Justice R. P. B. Erasmus of the Supreme Court of the <span class="col_5795-5796" refersTo="page_0588"/>Orange Free State. The members are Professor A. Strating, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H., D. T.M. and H., M.D. (Head of Preventive and Promotive Medicine, University of Pretoria); Dr. P. P. Roets, M.Sc. (Physiology), D.Sc. (Industrial Hygiene) (Head of Industrial Hygiene&#x2014;Iscor); Dr. B. C. Jansen, D.V.Sc. (Pretoria), D.Sc. (Potchefstroom), Ph.D. (Stellenbosch) (Chief Director, Veterinary Research Institute).</p>

<p>As a result of certain practical problems this commission will only be able to commence its work on 1 April 1975. I am pleased that the members of the commission have agreed to serve. Sir, so much for the hon. member for Cradock.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands&#x2014;I am sure that he can understand Afrikaans well&#x2014;raised certain problems today. In the first place, he mentioned the shortage of beds in psychiatric hospitals. I share that concern with him.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think we have approximately 28 000 psychiatric patients at the moment. We have approximately 20 000 beds of our own. Nearly 7 000 beds have to be provided by means of hiring. In other words, we have to obtain beds from private concerns. I have gone into this question of psychiatric hospitals and institutions all over the country since I assumed office, and I must say that I was not happy about the position. I therefore asked for an investigation into the whole question of psychiatric hospitals, including the available accommodation and facilities, the personnel and the patients themselves. Arising from this the Cabinet early this year approved additional capital for this purpose. I may say that it is a fair amount; some R75 million is to be spent over a period of years in order to make up the backlog. I may say that we are not embarking on a crash programme. This will take years. We do not have the manpower and it is simply physically impossible to make up the backlog over a period of less than ten or 15 years. Nevertheless, we are on the move. We are busy trying to rectify a position which has gone backwards over the years because of the general attitude towards the psychiatric patient, or mentally ill patient, as he was known some years ago. Now there is a new approach; we have new methods of treating these people and of accepting them as part of the community.</p>

<p>A great deal can be done through a system of treatment for out-patients in order to alleviate the plight of these people. I think we have progressed significantly since the passing of the Mental Health Act. I was going to refer to the Mental Disorders Act, but that terminology is no longer used in terms of the new concept to which I have referred. We are now approaching the whole problem of the mentally ill person on a comprehensive basis, in terms of which a mentally ill person is treated as a person, and we are progressing favourably towards a solution of some of these problems. Where suitable accommodation can be obtained, we hire the necessary beds. As I have said, we have about 7 000 hired beds at the moment. But I regard this state of affairs as temporary. The hon. member will be able to deduce from what I have already said that at the moment I am faced with a position about which I cannot yet satisfy myself but that I am satisfied that we have progressed far over the last few years.</p>

<p>The hon. member was also perturbed about the fact that we do not have enough medical practitioners for psychiatric treatment. I think he also referred to the position as far as general medical practitioners are concerned. I am not sure whether the hon. member was referring to medical practitioners in general or only to medical practitioners in the field of psychiatric treatment.</p>

<p>I was referring to medical practitioners in general.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I do recall now that the hon. member referred to medical schools. I cannot remember the hon. member having put any questions to the Department of Health as far as this matter is concerned. In fact, this matter falls under the Minister of National Education. I feel, therefore, that he should approach the hon. the Minister of National Education in this regard.</p>

<p>*In any case, I do not want to say that we are not concerned about it and that we are not giving any attention to it. I can assure hon. members that as far as this matter is concerned, the Department of Health is always consulted, that we are asked for advice and that, in fact, we are also the department which gives advice in this regard. As far as that is concerned, therefore, we are not entirely out of the picture.</p>

<p><span class="col_5797-5798" refersTo="page_0589"/>The hon. member for Rustenburg asked for the establishment of a national council for dental health. As far as dental services are concerned, I can tell him that a request for a national dental health service was received a long time ago. This matter was also entrusted to the Schumann Commission at the time. They recommended that this service should fall under the provincial administrations. Those findings were not announced before 1971, and in the meantime we appointed a commission of inquiry into dental services. They felt that it should fall under the Central Government, so that the necessary control, co-ordination and authority could be exercised with a minimum of overlapping, which is one of our major problems. We have already implemented quite a number of the recommendations made by that commission. In 1973 we appointed a new director of dental services. He set to work and has already established a national dental service. Therefore, as far as that matter is concerned, he has started with a comprehensive task. This is actually health policy, and implicitly embodied in it there are also certain proposals on what has to be done. I think that within the foreseeable future further negotiations will be conducted in this respect, and the hon. member&#x2019;s request will receive due attention.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Umbilo was worried about the staff position at hospitals, in particular the new hospital at Umlazi. I can tell him that whenever we plan for a new hospital, we are also worried about the staff; I want to be perfectly honest with him. Time and again, however, we have been able, as we went along, to find the necessary staff before a new hospital has been commissioned. It is true that we cannot start off with a full complement of staff, but I am quite sure that we are tackling this problem, including the question of training, in the correct way. I may say that I was not passing the buck when I was replying to the hon. member for Pinelands. We have taken note of the position and we are at the moment involved in an investigation into the whole question of training and producing enough medical practitioners. Once a hospital starts functioning, the required staff are usually drawn. If the facilities are there, these people are attracted.</p>

<p>*The hon. member also referred to the question of family planning. I am referring now to family planning as such. We must bear in mind that family planning is not population control or population planning. Family planning is concerned with the family, with its own conditions, its economic conditions, its sociological conditions and its own problems. That is where the start has to be made. The success of family planning depends on person-to-person contact, and all health clinics, from the Central Government&#x2019;s clinics down to the private clinics, are fully capable of implementing family planning. The department established a comprehensive family planning service at the end of last year, and all bodies are involved in it at this stage. I may point out to the hon. member that at this stage there are 147 medical practitioners and 364 nurses who are employed in our family planning services on either a full-time or a part-time basis. There are 126 nurses rendering services on farms in their areas. One should also have regard to the increase in family planning. The hon. member for Pinelands was also interested in this. In 1973 there were almost 270 000 persons who had accepted it, and this estimate was approximately 15% too low. We also afforded protection to women, not by putting up a fence between the women and the men, but in fact in another way. Whereas in January we afforded protection to only 76 000 women, the number was 164 000 in December. Consequently it is clear that women are coming to us to an increasing extent. Next I come to the number of woman-months during which women are afforded protection, and in this respect I am perhaps getting rather technical.</p>

<p>However, I hope that hon. members will forgive me for it. As far as the Bantu are concerned, this number came to 1 077 000 in 1973. In the case of Coloureds it was 412 000, in the case of Indians 111 779 and in the case of Whites 103 013. I want to point out that personal guidance is provided, and in this regard 84 field workers and 14 liaison officers have already been employed. We have obtained the co-operation of the homelands governments. I am only going to mention the two leading ones. The hon. member for Pinelands also expressed his doubts with reference to an article which Chief Buthelezi had written on family planning. As far as I am concerned, Chief Buthelezi wrote this article in a very judicious manner. I do not think that he wrote it in order to condemn <span class="col_5799-5800" refersTo="page_0590"/>family planning. On the contrary, he pointed out the possible problems in accepting it. The problems indicated by him are the problems with which we, too, have to deal. We hang family planning on the peg of socio-economic problems, of general health problems. As far as this is concerned, I am not discouraged as a result of articles of that nature. To tell the truth, we are obtaining splendid co-operation from the Government of Bophuthatswana, and apart from other governments, we are also obtaining the co-operation of the Government of KwaZulu. I do not wish to mention all the governments by name. The KwaZulu Government even agreed to our making a film with a Zulu signature tune in order that family planning may be promoted further there.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Umbilo also referred to the Budapest congress. This congress degenerated into a political squabble. That was what we had expected. Taking the timing of the congress into consideration we had decided that it would not be proper for us to attend. We came to that conclusion as a result of the way in which the congress was constituted and the way in which it later developed proved that we were perfectly correct.</p>

<p>As far as family planning is concerned, I want to point out that the Treasury has made available as much money as we can spend. The Treasury regards family planning as top priority. We were allocated about Rl,9 million for the previous year, but the amount might just as well have been doubled or even trebled because in terms of a Cabinet decision family planning is to be accorded top priority. If it is approached in a very judicious manner, it must be accorded high priority.</p>

<speech by="#mcintosh">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>What plan does the department have for spending increased expenditure? I must say that R1,9 million is a small amount if it is compared to the extent of the problem.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The amount that can be spent depends on the available manpower. The hon. member need not worry about that. If he wants details about that programme, he can easily obtain them from my department. I envisage that no restriction will be placed on our efforts to increase family planning in a scientific manner. We should also take into account the various social and other prejudices of people. We must not forget that we have a heterogeneous population and that is an important aspect. There should be no restriction on our progress.</p>

<p>*I may just say that we have a target in this regard. Within the course of five years we want to involve 50% of all risky women in the family planning scheme. We should like to achieve a population-growth figure of 1,5% for everybody. I cannot go into everything today, but this is a comprehensive matter which is receiving proper attention. I want to invite hon. members to come and look at our exhibits, as well as at the special attempts being made to give reasonable and proper attention to this very important facet of health care.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Krugersdorp raised a personal matter. I thank him for his contribution and his explanation. As I said at the beginning, a fundamental approach does not have anything to do with persons. Every case is being judged on its own merits, and I think we may as well leave it at that for the moment.</p>

<p>Finally, I should very much like to make an announcement. Two years ago I appointed a commission which had to inquire into private hospitals as well as the unattached operation units. Actually, this commission was basically motivated by the fact that medical expenses were too high and that we were not sure whether things were going well at all private hospitals. This commission sat for two years, and only a week or two ago, after very hard and thorough work, it submitted a report to me, which I am studying at the moment. There is a possibility that I shall still table it during this session. Whenever commissions are appointed, they are expected to complete their work within a reasonable period of time. The Government will give its attention to this report. In conclusion, I should just like to thank all hon. members who took part in this debate. The hon. member for Pinelands, who was the only speaker on the Progressive Party side, made a good contribution. All the other members&#x2019; contributions were good, too, whether we differ with one another or not. Fortunately this is one of my portfolios in regard to which I need not think of politics, and as a scientist I enjoy it. I think all of us have made a contribution towards bringing about greater clarity and telling the public outside what is being done to keep our people at <span class="col_5801-5802" refersTo="page_0591"/>least healthy, in order that they may not only live better from day to day, but also think better. Furthermore, I should also like to extend my sincere thanks to my officials for their contributions behind the scenes.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the privilege of the half hour? I regard this as possibly the most important Vote of the Budget this session, because of the situation which is arising from the frustration, the desperation and from the unhappiness of the Coloured people. The Government has denied them effective participation in the political processes and that is a situation which is now leading to resentment, frustration, possible conflict and even catastrophe. In fact, there are many amongst the Coloureds who recall bitterly that in the past radical improvements have only been made in response to crises of threatened violence. They ask whether this is the only basis on which they can now proceed. They warn that the Government is moving from crisis to crisis and that the time will soon come when they will not be able to avoid the crises arising. They ask in all reasonableness if it would not be wise for the Government to anticipate such events and make the necessary changes while there is still time to do so. In short, the position is ugly, the problem is difficult and it may in certain vital respects hold the key to the whole problem of race relations in this country. The political frustration of the Coloured people is easy to understand. It stems from their deprivation in the past of the parliamentary, provincial and municipal rights which they enjoyed and the replacement thereof by other rights which they have come to reject with ever-increasing dislike. For them the Coloured Representative Council has failed as a means to satisfy the real aspirations of the Coloured people. Whatever intrinsic merits it may have had and whatever constitutional changes may now be contemplated, whatever hopes may be held out for the future, the hard fact is that it has been rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Coloured people as being powerless to give them what they want in their lives. They realize, as indeed we on this side of the House do, that you cannot have two sovereign Parliaments in one State and they see no movement to resolve that dilemma. They believe that the CRC will always be a subordinate body which will be impotent to redress their wrongs and to remedy their disabilities&#x2014;in other words, a symbol of their frustrations. It seems to me that the Government has reached the end of the cul-de-sac in so far as this policy is concerned. Even at municipal level, progress as far as the Coloured people are concerned is minimal. They see the whole set-up as an ineffective instrument to give them a better life and to give them that socio-economic justice they demand. I am afraid that we are long past the stage where we can argue as to whether the despair and condemnation of the Coloureds is justified. It has become a hard political reality which exists whether we like it or not. If the political frustration of the Coloureds is understandable, their desperation and unhappiness at the discrimination visited on them in the social sphere in the land of their birth, the only country they know as home, is all too apparent. That discrimination is reflected in hotels, cinemas and restaurants which are open to Black and Brown foreigners but which are denied to them who are born South Africans. It is reflected in public amenities which are always inferior to those available to the Whites, in separate entrances and queues in Government places, and in a host of hardships and humiliations which are generally described as petty apartheid. Whatever they do, they seldom escape the constant reminders of their inferior status. It is a tragedy of our time that in spite of the good intentions so frequently expressed by the Government, the Government itself is the main author and constant guardian of these discriminatory standards. Let me just ask one question. Who is it that accepts open commerce in the banks and in the supermarkets but insists on signs and separate entrances in post offices and in Government departments? The cornerstones of Government policy in this regard seem to be the Group Areas Act, the statutory race classification and the Immorality Act. I cannot deal with these in detail and I do not propose to, but there is no doubt that one of the major grievances of the Coloured people and one to which they constantly come back is the unfair implementation of the Group Areas Act. They see this Act as the main instrument of their misfortune. They ascribe much of the harshness of their lives and the frustration <span class="col_5803-5804" refersTo="page_0592"/>of their highest hopes and aspirations to the Group Areas Act. They were moved from their traditional places by the sea, by the vineyards and by the mountains where they grew up, places they had occupied for generations, and this is a source of grievance. What has turned that grievance into a festering resentment is that they were moved without consultation, they were moved without their consent and without any real material compensation or improvement in their state and situation. I know that their original circumstances in many cases were not too good, they were unsatisfactory, but then they say that at least they occupied those areas voluntarily. Now they have been compelled to move to areas they dislike and very often to communities with which they have little in common, where they are deprived of their traditional recreations, distant from their work and served by inadequate and expensive transport. The amenities which they shared in the past with their White neighbours have been replaced by rudimentary and inadequate services in the areas to which they have been moved and in which they now live. If the housing was poor, and it was in many cases, they claim that was at least preferable to the harsh little boxes or the widespread homelessness in the group areas. Those who have succeeded in raising their own standards and acquiring means to greater comfort, for better environment, are unable to find good land on which to build their own private homes. It is incredible, Sir, that while these conditions persist there has been no halt in the obstinate and relentless implementation of the group areas laws, not even a slackening off until the present consequences of the vast replacement of people have been absorbed and remedied.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I come to race classification and most particularly to the arbitrary and rigid manner in which it is applied. I think we all agree it is a reality of our plural society, and has been throughout many, many years, that there will be and always has been a perceptible, if small, movement across the colour line. It is a genetic fact that children of mixed races or mixed relationships may be of dissimilar colour, some fair and some dark. They seek to find a place in society among those they most resemble and where they can find their greatest happiness. But, Sir, it seems to be the relentless task of race classification as applied today to hunt down the stragglers from the flock, to identify them with permanent labels, and to return them to environments which have become alien to them. I have spoken about clause 16 of the Immorality Act before. Today I only want to remark that it is hated less for the restraints that it imposes on sexual conduct than it is for its more insidious implications, because they believe it is seen as a living reminder of the fundamental repugnance of the White for the Brown, for whom the White are largely responsible. Surely, Sir, against this background it does not require much imagination to realize how these constant reminders of an inferior status must frustrate people, people who are seeking a place in the sun for themselves and their families. Their extreme bitterness today, is estranging them not only from the Afrikaner whom they identify largely with the Nationalist Party, with the Government, but from the White man himself, and that bitterness is having a ripple effect which is affecting other facets of their lives.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there is discrimination in the economic sphere, discrimination which typifies the spirit underlying job reservation. Here again, it is the Government that is and has been the greatest sinner. At a time when equal pay for equal work and responsibility is increasingly recognized in private industry, who is it but the Government that rigidly applies different salaries for the same work? Who is it but the Government that denies the existence of job reservation in respect of Coloureds but applies it in the Civil Service? Who is it but the Government which mouths promises about reducing the wage gap, but has increased it beyond all measure in the years in which it has been in office?</p>

<p>Who is it but the Government who is responsible for the inferior educational and training facilities available to the Coloured people? It is small wonder that the percentage of poverty-stricken Coloureds is so much higher than among Whites. It is small wonder that there are so many who are not only poverty-stricken, but unable or unwilling to improve their own position. These are some of the things&#x2014;it is not an exhaustive list&#x2014;that have turned the social and economic problems of a section of the population that should be closest to us into what is, I believe, the burning political issue of the day. It is a situation which, to my <span class="col_5805-5806" refersTo="page_0593"/>mind, is of such extreme urgency, that to suggest that its resolution can wait until the report of the Theron Commission is published in perhaps 18 months&#x2019; time, is to be utterly unrealistic. The question now is this: Can this political problem be solved quickly by political means? Are there any immediate political measures that we can now take which will quickly defuse this problem, or at least convince the Coloured people that those measures will provide the machinery whereby they can help themselves and bring about their own redemption? We on this side of the House see the solution as a federal arrangement, the main facets of which have been outlined so often that I need not speak about them this afternoon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I should like to draw attention to the fact that in terms of this arrangement, the aims and aspirations of the Coloureds can be identified with those of the Whites. Our federal policy will give them full citizenship and autonomy within their own community. In addition, it will give freedom for White and Coloured communities to develop greater co-operation in all matters of common interest. If it is the ultimate wish of both communities to merge their interests to a degree that is agreed upon by both communities, we will arrange to share one legislative assembly. I believe that is the direction in which we should be working. I believe that is the solution which would be of more benefit to the Coloureds than any outlined to date, and that we should work towards that end. We on this side of the House are not in power, and history has proved that we have small chance of persuading this Government in the immediate future to accept our proposals. In the long term, of course, it is inevitable that they will do so. The question, therefore, is whether there is anything that can be done within the limits of the Government&#x2019;s own philosophies and policies. I believe that if the Government insists on rejecting the federal idea and maintaining a unitary form of government, its only solution will be to provide direct representation for the Coloured people in this Parliament. So sincerely do I believe that, that I want to say here and now again what I have said before: If the Government decides to take that step, even if it does not coincide with the federal arrangement we would like to see, we on this side of the House will support such a move.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I had a Press statement published in every newspaper in the country the day before the hon. the Prime Minister was to hold an interview with the Coloured people. What have we had from the Government? We have had talk of a statutory liaison committee between Parliament and the Coloured Representative Council which would only have liaison and advisory powers. It solves nothing. There has also been talk of a statutory standing committee consisting of members of the Cabinet and the Executive of the Coloured Representative Council. For that committee to make any contribution at all towards resolving the existing problem with which the Government is faced, namely the impossibility of having two sovereign Parliaments within one State, it would have to have statutory powers binding on this Parliament and on the Coloured Representative Council. Now that sort of development, after some initial confusion, does not find favour with the Government. Let me tell the Government, however, that whatever sort of consensus they are looking for, a <i>sine quo non</i> for any agreement within the limits of their policy, would be a change in the system of election of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council to make it fully elected. It should be given real executive power. Its own powers should be meaningfully extended so as to make it less subject to the overriding controls of the State President, the Minister and the Cabinet of this Parliament. There will also have to be involvement of the Coloureds in local <span class="col_5807-5808" refersTo="page_0594"/>government, i.e. at municipal level, in a meaningful way. This should perhaps take place in the manner suggested by the Slater Commission, which envisaged metropolitan boards for various municipal and local government areas, on which all races would serve. That is a sort of federal concept at local government level. Clearly, too, there will have to be participation by the Coloureds in the day-to-day administration of Government services which affect them, i.e. in the civil service, in statutory bodies taking decisions about them and, more meaningfully, in services such as the Police and the Defence Force. Nothing suggested so far, however, has given us any real indication of what the Government believes is the ultimate place of the Coloureds in our society. Only a little more than a month ago the hon. member for Moorreesburg referred to Whites and Coloureds not as a &#x201C;nasie in wording&#x201D; but as &#x201C;partners in the South African society&#x201D;. It is true that he referred to the Coloureds as junior partners. Many thousands of people in South Africa would support his point of view though they may argue as to whether the Coloureds should be junior or equal partners. The hon. the Prime Minister, however, does not agree with the hon. member for Moorreesburg about the word &#x201C;partnership&#x201D;. The hon. the Prime Minister talks about &#x201C;buurskap&#x201D;. There is a marked difference in meaning between those two words. [Interjections.] I was not speaking to the hon. the Minister of the Interior. He is an extremist and as such is right outside this argument. I was talking about the difference between &#x201C;buurskap&#x201D; and &#x201C;partnership&#x201D;. Partnership means the right to participation in, and responsibility for, a common undertaking. &#x201C;Buurskap&#x201D; on the other hand means a certain degree of friendship between people without their necessarily being involved in any common undertaking. I do not want to take this matter any further. I think this matter is too serious to be a debating point. Instead. I should like to quote the Minister of Defence, who spoke a week ago at Kimberley and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ry die brander; moenie dat die Kleurling veryreemd raak van Blank Suid-Afrikanie. Ons is Wit en Bruin Suid-Afrikaners met dieselfde landstale en dieselfde godsdiens.</block>

<p>I should like to vary that just slightly and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ry die branded moenie dat die Kleurling vervreemd raak van Blank Suid-Afrika nie. Ons is Wit en Bruin Suid-Afrikaners met dieselfde landstale en dieselfde godsdiens.</block>

<p>This seems to indicate a step forward, but it is still too vague to mean anything to the Coloured people. What I want to try to impress upon the Minister and on the Government this afternoon is that time is running out and none of these generalizations are acceptable to the Coloured people. They want realistic answers now; they believe that their future can only be assured by the granting to them of what they call &#x201C;full citizenship&#x201D;. If what is called &#x201C;full citizenship&#x201D; is not acceptable to the Government at the present time, then what axe we going to do? I believe that the position can only be saved by socio-economic steps which will be seen to be steps on the road to full citizenship and which will be meaningfull enough to gain time for a fuller consensus on political matters based on consultation.</p>

<p>What should those steps be? In the economic field, I believe the bare minimum should be that all bars to equal economic opportunity should be progressively removed. This would mean an end to job reservation in so far as it applies to the Coloureds; it would mean equal pay for equal work and responsibility; it would mean the closing of the wage gap; it would mean the abolition of the traditional discriminatory job policies. In all these matters the Government should be giving a lead. It should be made clear that all skilled technical and professional jobs are open to the Coloured people subject only to the process of collective bargaining and the safeguard against exploitation of either White or non-White of the principle of the rate for the job. Facilities for the training of Coloureds for all such avenues of employment should be made increasingly available. From this it follows that if there are members of one race group who want to use the professional services of individuals or groups belonging to another race group in a private capacity, there should be no legal hindrance placed in their way. In addition, membership of any professional organization or society should not be prohibited to the Coloured people on the grounds of race and should be regarded as a matter for the domestic control of the organization or society concerned. In the <span class="col_5809-5810" refersTo="page_0595"/>economic sphere it has already been indicated that there is comparatively speaking a high percentage of Coloured people who are poverty-stricken and unable or unwilling to improve their own position. We believe that this problem can only be tackled by a national commitment for the improvement of their socio-economic position by way of a co-ordinated, integrated programme which will lead, <i>inter alia,</i> to better education facilities and far greater opportunities for training. Such an advance would also lay the foundation for better housing and better living conditions and, where necessary, compensatory education for those living under conditions at the moment which make compensatory education necessary.</p>

<p>What about social change? I believe that the removal of social discrimination or discrimination in the social sphere is seen by the Coloured people as an essential step towards full citizenship, and there is much that the Government could do to give a lead in this sphere. I believe that it could commence by removing many of the statutory forms of discrimination and steadfastly attacking and dismembering petty apartheid. It will also mean steps to allow for the provision of better and adequate public amenities. The objective should be that in respect of all public controlled amenities such as beaches, public transport, etc., the policy should be to provide as nearly as possible equal and parallel facilities for the various race groups where they are present in any significant numbers, plus open amenities which would be available to everyone. That is the area of choice. Where it is not possible or practical to provide parallel facilities there should be elasticity where the presence of mixed groups is likely to be commonly acceptable such as in the case of cultural institutions of a high standard like the Nico Malan theatre. There are also public amenities that are provided by private persons or companies, namely, hotels, cinemas, restaurants and so forth. We believe that these should be available to the various groups at the option of the owners. The owner must be in a position to grant or refuse admission to who ever he pleases. In other words, in the sphere of amenities, the guideline should be the maximum freedom of choice and the minimum degree of compulsion against the background of our present customs and traditions.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there is the whole administration of the Group Areas Act, which will have to be revised. Apart from insisting that there should be no removals without adequate accommodation, that there should be adequate compensation paid to those moving and that there should be no interference with the traditional livelihood of those concerned, it is now clear that there will have to be proper consultation between the groups in the demarcation of statutory residential areas; that case work should be done to ensure that people find themselves in communities with which they have something in common; that there should be no removal in areas where large sections of the population are still without homes or are inadequately housed. Sir, the determination of the race to which an individual belongs, I believe, should be based on the old test of appearance and acceptance, and the test of descent as at present applied should be done away. The Immorality Act, in so far as section 16 is concerned, will without question have to be repealed, and the sooner the better. I am very sure that there is much else that could be done; I am sure that there is much else that should be done. I have indicated this afternoon what I believe to be the bare minimum which will have a chance to restore better relations between White and better relations between White and Coloured in South Africa. It is not possible at this stage to over-emphasize the urgency of immediate action by the Government, or the necessity of giving a clear indication of the direction in which it is going, a direction which will have to give hope for the future and a new enthusiasm for cooperation between White and Brown. We believe, Sir, that the only course is a clear commitment to the direction of ultimate full citizenship.</p>

<p>Sir, if one puts a kitten among the pigeons and hon. members on that side make that much noise, it is clear that they are being hurt.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to add that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition chose his time very badly. As you know, a commission of inquiry was appointed which is engaged in a thorough inquiry into all aspects of the development of the Coloured population group. Since the appointment of that commission, United Party congresses have met, and it is very interesting that on those occasions this matter of the development of the political life of the Coloured population was not of very great earnest to them. On the contrary, they continued in the same old way to &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; talk about the federation policy, which is just as obscure today as it was before, and in addition they tried to patch up the quarrels among themselves and to keep the team going. What is more, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition again today left so many back doors open in his general statements, that he will subsequently be able to head in any direction if it seems to him that things are becoming too hot for him to handle. Sir, I want to draw your attention to the fact that although he made the suggestion that the political life of the Coloured population should be bound up with that of the Whites in one Parliament, he stated the proviso: Provided that the two communities, the White population and the Coloured population, accept it. Surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has received many answers to this question over the years. It was one of the major issues in this Parliament, and in the political history of South Africa, this question of the intertwining of the political rights of the Coloureds and the Whites. It is a question which has been discussed in this Parliament for so many years. It is this sort of matter which sometimes even had members now sitting on that side, sitting on this side, and then on that side again, so far-reaching and so serious was this political struggle. Now, if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition states today that we could proceed with this matter, providing that the two communities agree to it, he has repeatedly had an answer from the White community in advance, i.e. that he should venture cautiously along that road. That is why I am saying that the hon. member chose his time very badly and that, in view of the history of this matter, he has not interpreted the answers he has received over the years very well.</p>

<p>But what is more, a Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council election is imminent. What does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition now want to achieve by raking up this matter again today, as though it were a matter which has, within a few months&#x2019; time, become such a vital issue. What else does he want to achieve except to create tremendous confusion among the Coloured community?</p>

<p>What can he achieve, except to cause those people to wonder whether they should proceed with their election? What is more, the persons who bear the responsibility as members of the executive are similarly in a very uncertain position in view of the positions they hold and the responsibilities they bear. This is the result when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition comes forward with a suggestion today that we should go back and once again merge the political structures of White and Coloureds to be able to achieve something. That is why I am saying the hon. the Leader of the Opposition chose his opportunity badly. He should now listen and he will hear and read in the next few months that it is not only the interests of the Coloured population which are at issue: the opinion of the White population of South Africa, how we are <span class="col_5813-5814" refersTo="page_0597"/>going to arrange this matter, is also at issue. Therefore I want to repeat in all earnest that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition could have waited with this matter until the commission in question, which has been appointed and conducting its investigating over a wide field and also in loco, brings out its report. Surely that would be the opportunity to discuss this matter again. [Interjections.] Sir, I shall tell you what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s problem is. He is afraid that the hon. member for Sea Point is going to steal a march on him. What is more, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has seen during the past years that the National Party Government is geared to change. As South Africa progresses and its various population groups grow and develop, the National Party Government is prepared to make adjustments and to make arrangements in accordance with the responsibility which the various population groups are able to accept. In other words, I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that he jumped into the fray here today because he is afraid that this Government will perhaps do things for which he would like to take the credit. In saying this I do not want to endorse anything he said, but involuntarily one does get the impression that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has decided that he cannot wait for this commission&#x2019;s report, because there will then perhaps be nothing left for him to do. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party would do well to study and consider the whole political situation in South Africa all over again from the start. In view of what is happening in the world, he will surely agree with me that matters such as good order in society, peaceful development, progress and political rights based on inherent growth in the life of a specific population group, and its economic and social development, are all matters of importance. We cannot simply go off half-cocked and try to be popular by off-loading political rights on a population group. As a matter of fact, it was one of the problems of the past that when the Coloureds formed an integral part of the political battle of the White parties, they were used as a political football. I do not believe that I am doing the hon. the Leader of the Opposition an injustice if I say that his party excelled in that. They made a special study of it. [Interjections.] They used the Coloured population on a large scale to strengthen their party, to win seats and to win an election. While they were busy with this, the slum conditions of District Six never really gave anyone cause for concern. It was only during the time of the National Party that the slum conditions of District Six, Windermere and the Cape Flats began to cause people concern.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the hon. member for Piketberg but I do not think that he has made a serious contribution to the debate. He did not make it clear whether he is a &#x201C;tuislander, branderryer of &#x2019;n voorstander van junior of senior vennootskap&#x201D;. However, it would seem to me as if the &#x201C;tuis-landers&#x201D; on the opposite side have won. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The one point that my hon, leader made was that it is quite clear that we are not making the debate on the future of our Coloured citizens into a political football match. We are trying to take the debate out of such a situation. We are trying to deal with this situation with statemanship. I rise to support the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the urgent plea which he made to bring about a better understanding, a better relationship between the Coloured and White citizens of South Africa. That is our approach to this matter. It is my sincere hope that the initiative taken by my hon. leader will not be in <span class="col_5815-5816" refersTo="page_0598"/>vain. We have made it quite clear and we shall continue in this debate to make it quite clear that the stakes are too high and too urgent to try and make political gain out of this issue. I hope that this debate will be conducted in this spirit. If we can succeed in that and take positive actions as a result of this debate, then the exercise would have been worth while. However, I feel that the hon. member&#x2019;s contribution to this debate was a little futile [Interjections.] In this regard our federal policy has been stated often enough and there is no reason for us to change our views. However, there is one cardinal facet of our federal policy which is important, viz. consultation at all levels. We welcome therefore the talks which have taken place between the Government &#x2026;</p>

<p>We welcome the talks which have taken place between the Government and the Coloured leaders and trust that they will continue and continue in a spirit in which all parties concerned approach the matter in an open-minded fashion. One thing is sure; we cannot continue talking indefinitely. These talks will have to produce results otherwise they too will be a futile exercise. If with these talks the Government can reach mutual agreement with Coloured leaders on the essential steps that must be taken to remove the impasse with which we are faced and to diffuse the tension, the Government can count on our support&#x2014;I want hon. members to listen&#x2014;I repeat, the Government can count on our support even if these measures are not necessarily in line with the policy of this side of the House. The frustrations of the Coloured people have been demonstrated in recent weeks by the no-confidence vote in the CRC and the rejection of the CRC by the two major Coloured political parties, and not only by the rejection of the CRC but also by the rejection of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. As my hon. leader said, this rejection is a hard political fact which we all have to take into account. We might well ask ourselves why there has been this rejection. The answer is a simple one: As an instrument of government, the CRC has been unable to fulfil the real and justifiable aspirations of the Coloured citizens of South Africa. They want a very simple thing, namely to be full citizens of this country, the land of their birth, and this is the direction in which we should be moving and moving very quickly, as my hon. leader outlined. Not only has the CRC been rejected by the politicians&#x2014;and this makes the matter even more serious&#x2014;but it has also been rejected by the great majority of Coloured people, namely the professional people, business people, artisans and people in all walks of life. They never really accepted the CRC as an alternative to their rights on the common roll, especially when after the first election the Government took the unusual step of nominating members to that council, many of whom were defeated candidates. Now, as the result of the many disabilities to which the Coloured people are subjected, they see the CRC as a symbol of their frustration and inability to right their wrongs. Out of these circumstances and against this background arise the urgent demands for direct representation in this House. That is what is happening among the Coloured people. They are demanding to have representation in this hon. House because the instrument of government they have had up to this point has not fulfilled their aspirations. If the Government continues to reject our federal proposals and continues to accept a unitary system of government and, at the same time, is determined to make the CRC work, it will have to institute far-reaching changes to give the CRC a real share in the decision-making processes in all matters that directly affect the Coloured people. This is a challenge to the Government. In this regard the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Defence is of great interest. He made it at a youth conference of the Nationalist Party in Kimberley. I have a newspaper cutting here in which this speech is quoted. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die hele stelsel soos ek dit sien, veronderstel veelvuldige deurlopende skakeling tussen Blanke-en Kleurlingowerhede en maak oorlegpleging &#x00EA;rens tot op die hoogste moontlike vlakke.</block>

<p>This is an indication of a new direction which we on this side of the House welcome. <span class="col_5817-5818" refersTo="page_0599"/>In the past the Government&#x2019;s policy has been more and more separation, and here the hon. the Minister of Defence says &#x201C;die tyd het nou aangebreek vir beter skakeling&#x201D;. We agree with the hon. the Minister that there has to be a greater measure of liaison and closer co-operation among the various bodies that represent the different race groups. If this liaison body is to be effective, it has to be given real and meaningful powers. The liaison which the hon. the Prime Minister and other hon. members on the Government side have hinted at is that there may be a Coloured person as Minister of Coloured Affairs. They suggested a Cabinet committee which might consist of the members of the Executive Committee of the CRC and members of the Cabinet. There has been talk of a statutory consultative committee. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister, who has the power to take the necessary steps, that if that &#x201C;skakeling&#x201D;, that liaison, is to be really effective, he should give serious consideration to enabling the CRC to elect members who will represent our Coloured citizens in this House. This form of liaison might also well be extended to lower levels of government.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one thing became very clear to me this afternoon, and that is that the United Party felt and decided in their caucus that they had to change their policy in respect of the Coloureds. I believe it was insisted upon in their caucus that they change the policy in such a way that the Coloureds are to obtain representation in this Parliament. They could not come back, however, for they had that policy in 1972. At that time they changed that policy and now, two years later, they cannot revert to it again.</p>

<p>If we relate the motion and the amendment which were adopted earlier this year by the Coloured Persons Representative Council, as well as the speeches subsequently made by Coloured politicians, to the policy of each one of the three parties which are represented in this House, one thing is very clear to me and that is that that motion, that amendment and those speeches rejected each one of the policies of those parties. The Coloureds insist on unconditional and unqualified representation with the Whites in one Parliament. This is what is being requested on the part of the Coloureds. Not one of the White political parties which are represented in this House complies with that requirement. I want to leave the Opposition parties at that, for it is the National Party which governs this country and it is the task of the Government to ensure that everyone living in the country is treated justly and fairly. I believe that this should be the treatment which agrees with the Christian conscience and which affords everyone in the country the opportunity to realize himself to the full. That is why this side of the House advances the standpoint of separate development, and it is the basis of the policy of separate development that every population group should be able to decide on its own destiny, that every population group should have the right to have an exclusive say in its own matters and that every population group should have the right to retain its identity as a group or as a people.</p>

<p>No, I am not a homelander; I am Nationalist to the core. That is why the policy of this party in respect of the Coloureds is very clear, and that is that the White man has an exclusive say in those matters which affect the White man&#x2019;s interests. Then there is the gradual development of the Coloured in order to grant him autonomy over his own affairs. Where there are common interests, the liaison machinery envisaged by the hon. the Prime Minister and his Cabinet council after consultations were held, will be put into operation. What I have just delineated, is separate political <span class="col_5819-5820" refersTo="page_0600"/>development for the Coloureds. This is accompanied by separate development in other spheres as well. There is the Brown businessman in his own residential area. Do hon. members want to argue it away? There are the Brown people occupying high posts in Coloured education. Do hon. members want to argue this away? There are separate denominations. Do hon. members want to argue that away? There are separate rural areas in which the Brown man may practise agriculture. Do hon. members want to argue that away? There are separate residential areas for the Coloureds throughout the Republic of South Africa. These are not things which came into being yesterday or today. The things I have mentioned have come into being over the years. Many of these things have a proud record. I say with a deep sense of gratitude that the D.R. Mission Church, which has been in existence for almost a century, has a proud record, i.e. it is the work of Coloureds, Brown people, who have built their own church. Can we cancel this out? Can we talk it away? And now Brown politicians are asking for an end to this road of separate development.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe the time has come for us to speak to each other very honestly. It is as the hon. member for Piketberg has said; we cannot push aside the White man&#x2019;s will for separate development in this country as if it were a minor and fleeting obstacle.</p>

<p>It is not something of that kind. The White man&#x2019;s will to exist cannot be cried down by fiery speeches and motions on the part of the Coloureds, nor by speeches on the part of the Whites who are heading in the direction of integration. I want you all, especially the Opposition, to take cognizance of the fact, that the Brown people&#x2019;s will to continue existing and to preserve and develop that which is their own cannot be eliminated. I want to ask whether sufficient regard is being had to the Coloured&#x2019;s will. I want to ask who is responsible for the Coloured having developed in this way over the years. [Interjections.] If we are going to do this, the price the Coloured will have to pay is not too high for him. Then that price has already been determined. I want to ask who is going to come off worst. Is it not going to be the Brown man himself? [Interjections.] To me the well-being and happiness of the Coloureds are to be found in the further extension and development of that which is already their own. The Coloured is in the process of coming into his own in the economy and in the business world. The Coloured Development Corporation made an amount of R6,2 million available to 354 Coloured enterprises between 1962 and 1972. This is what should be developed further. This is separate development, to be able to build up one&#x2019;s own economy.</p>

<p>There is Coloured education. There is a tremendous shortage of teaching staff in schools for Coloureds. Surely this is a challenge to the Coloureds to come forward and produce their own people to man those posts. There is a staff shortage at the University of the Western Cape. Surely there are opportunities and challenges. There are as many as 1 900 Coloured schools with half a million pupils. Do we just want to argue this away and do away with it?</p>

<p>The Coloured can develop his own sport. This afternoon I want to ask, and I am asking this with sadness, where the Coloureds were at the multi-national meetings which have already taken place in this country. Where were the Coloureds when the double wicket cricket championship took place? Where were they at the recent Rapport cycling tour? Are there not people in the ranks of the Coloureds who are dishonest towards their own people and are denying them these things? Then the Coloureds also have their own residential areas, their own rural areas. There are 2 million morgen which already belong to the Coloureds and on which millions of rand have already been spent for the purposes of developing the land. That is why I believe that in the Coloured&#x2019;s own residential areas, whether rural or urban, there should also be the creation of his own machinery of government, a full-fledged government of his own from the municipal sphere right up to the Parliament he already has. What remains&#x2014;and matters of common interest will remain because we shall be interdependent&#x2014;must be managed by the Cabinet council. Content and status may be given to this council. It is the management of these common interests which may serve to stimulate the relation between White and Brown and which may be the basis on which White and Brown may live alongside one another in their separate areas. This can contribute to their helping one another. This afternoon I am <span class="col_5821-5822" refersTo="page_0601"/>thinking of defence, for example. One of the Coloured leaders said that he would not let his son die on the border for South Africa. This afternoon I want to tell him in this House: I am prepared to let my three sons die on the border for White, Brown and Black in South Africa. I issue a challenge to that leader; I do not think he is more cowardly than I am.</p>

<p>We shall also be able to supplement one another economically. We need each other, not so? The White man needs the Coloured and the Coloured the White. This afternoon I want to say: Whoever wants to keep the Coloured subservient in the country is an advocate of integration, for the process of integration is the process under which the Coloured will suffer most. Is the Coloured willing to surrender in this process what he has created over the years? The people who, however, want to afford him the opportunity of being himself, of holding his own and of developing, are those people who want to give him that area where he may govern himself and decide on his own destiny.</p>

<p>There has never been any suggestion that we as Whites want to drive the Coloured to the Black man. The Black people take such a pride in their own identity that they will not accept the Brown man. We want him to be himself. That is why we are telling him: Here is our hand; we want to help you to be yourself. Sir, good neighbourliness with specific boundary-lines&#x2014;this is what we want to achieve, so that every neighbour, in his own sphere, in his own domain, may do as he wishes and, where we need one another, we may unite against our common enemy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Oudtshoorn told us that it is important to bear in mind that the Whites also have a will to exist. Furthermore, the hon. member said there were tremendous challenges, challenges the Coloured people ought to accept. Surely, there ought to be no difference of opinion whatsoever in this House on that point, i.e. that the Whites also have the right and the will to exist. After all, this matter has often been finally decided upon in the past. What is more, this side of the House has admitted again and again that every group in South Africa has the right to maintain its own identity and control its own, intimate affairs. What is therefore irrelevant here is whether the Whites will go under in this process. Neither is it the wish or the policy of this side that, in this process of allowing justice to be done to the Coloured people, the Whites should lose their identity or for the Whites to go under in this process. What we ought to discuss here today, however, and what was quite rightly stated by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in his speech, is the fact that the Government, through the Coloured Persons Representative Council, established a body for the Coloured people for a specific purpose, a limited purpose, a body which could never be the final answer to what would be the political destiny of the Coloured people in South Africa. It is because Coloured belonging both to the Federal Party and the Labour Party realize this that a motion of no-confidence in separate development and in that body was adopted. They do not see this Coloured Persons Representative Council as the final political dispensation of the Coloured persons in South Africa. There is no need for the hon. member therefore to come along with the argument that the Whites also have a will in this respect. This everyone recognizes. The Coloured person of South Africa accepts the challenge held out to him in regard to his education, his own university and so on.</p>

<p>If we have a common destiny, there is only one thing the Coloured people desire. It makes no difference whether one applies this under a unitary system or whether one applies this under a federal system&#x2014;the Coloured people want to work out, together with the Whites, the destiny of both groups in this country. Hon. members on that side simply do not want to appreciate this. We would no longer be able to tell those people from day to day what they should do, where they should live, how they should decide and what their future should be. Unless hon. members on that side of the House appreciate this, we would not be able to develop sound and healthy relations in <span class="col_5823-5824" refersTo="page_0602"/>South Africa. The hon. member for Piketberg really surprised me. He, of all people, wanted to know whether the United Party had abandoned its entire policy. He said the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had chosen the wrong time and, toy discussing the representation of Coloured people in this Parliament, merely wanted to raise old controversies.</p>

The hon. member for Turffontein should know as well as I do&#x2014;this was made quite clear by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that if one is not prepared to accept a federal system in South Africa and if the Government persists with its unitary system, there will be no other solution than that the Coloured people be given representation in this House. One cannot have two Parliaments within the same body politic next to one another at a sovereign level. If the hon. member for Turffontein is going to participate in this debate, he should tell us how he is able to reconcile those two things.

<p>I think we have reached the stage where we can consider what progress has been made among the Coloured people in recent times as well as those spheres in which progress are still going to be made in future. From all quarters an appeal is made to this Parliament, and to hon. members opposite in particular, to shake off their indecisiveness as to the future place the Coloured people should have in our political life. This situation has become even more urgent on account of recent developments on the continent of Africa. A greater say on the part of non-Whites in their own affairs and the abandonment by Portugal of its position in Angola and Mozambique have once more focused attention on our attitude towards the Coloured people. Sir, it is not even necessary either to point out the imminent danger of increased terrorism around us. The takeover by Black nationalism in Angola and in Mozambique in the near future gave new impetus to these developments. That is why we find today that certain non-White leaders express themselves in stronger terms in a militant way, and in this way South Africa and the White legislature are to a certain extent being held to ransom.</p>

<p>There are thousands of Coloured people who are watching this situation and still have to decide which side they are going to support. For that reason the wise person in this House will do everything he possibly can to diffuse the situation, as was said here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition; he would try arrive at the greatest possible measure of unity in the political thinking of Whites and of Coloureds. Against this background it is quite clear that the positive aspect of independent development for the Coloured people&#x2014;and there is a positive aspect and that positive aspect is communal development&#x2014;will have to gain far greater impetus; that there should be equal treatment to a far greater extent and that there should be greater opportunities for economic progress among them.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it would be a very difficult task to furnish hon. members of the United Party with replies to their speeches. It is quite clear that not only did the Leader of the Opposition come to this House today with a policy they have never had before, but also that the policy of the party has changed between the time the hon. the Leader of the Opposition finished his speech and the hon. member for Newton Park began his speech, and I want to predict that when the hon. member for Bezuidenhout rises to speak, we shall find that they have changed their policy again.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to confine myself to the subject under discussion, and not waste my time furnishing replies to what hon. members of the Opposition have said here. Sir, we in South Africa are engaged in a gigantic task of emancipation. In order to be able to fulfil this task in a meaningful way, I think it is essential that both parties, the <span class="col_5825-5826" refersTo="page_0603"/>guardian and those who are being emancipated, would have to apply to themselves the golden rule of &#x201C;do unto others as you want others to do unto you&#x201D;, or to put it the other way around, &#x201C;do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you&#x201D;. Sir, in that spirit I want to try in the short time available to me to put myself in the place of both these parties in order to try and arrive at working norms. In the first place, I want to say that the White guardian, the White people, the White Parliament here and the Government itself should seriously ask themselves this question: Had we been in the place of the Brown people, what would we have expected of our guardians?</p>

<p>Sir, the first thing I would have expected of them, would have been sympathy and responsibility. I just want to say now that I have known the Leader of this party for many years. I have never come across a person acting with more sympathy and greater responsibility than the hon. the Prime Minister does when expressing himself in regard to the various peoples of South Africa. This also applies in the case of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>The second thing I would expect of them, is for them to recognize my human dignity. This is the task and the call of this White Parliament, this White people and this Government, to guide the Coloured people along and to help them to make a decent living, to try and promote their human dignity in general and to see to it that this human dignity will never be disparaged through any action, word or deed. The third thing I would have expected had I found myself in the position of the Coloured person, would be opportunities, opportunities for spiritual development and opportunities for intellectual development. And what do I mean by that? I mean education facilities and university facilities and opportunities to prepare myself for the life we are living. I would have expected opportunities for economic development. I would have expected opportunities for social development. These are the tasks I think this Government should strive to fulfil, and which, I want to say immediately, I think it has exerted itself to fulfil throughout all these years. But I have not come here to make excuses.</p>

<p>What I am doing here is to make an honest endeavour to arrive at some basis. We have made progress as far as emancipation is concerned. They who are under guardianship, and who are in the process of being emancipated, expect that progress should be made. I think they expect to be consulted on the future, and that they should not only form the subject of discussion as to what the future holds for them, but that they themselves should be consulted on the future, because only then would we be able to achieve anything. But then we should also bear in mind that the guardian would expect something in return. It is not only those who are being emancipated who have certain expectations and reservations; they who are engaged in the process of emancipating the other race would also have certain expectations and demands, and unless one appreciates the attitude of both of them, one would come to a dead end and would not achieve anything in life.</p>

<p>What is the first thing we would expect? We would expect a growing sense of responsibility on the part of those people we are emancipating, i.e. the Coloured people. Secondly, we expect of them to use the opportunities afforded to them for their development and for them to grab these opportunities with initiative and enterprise. I think this is a very reasonable request or expectation. In the third place, we expect of them to develop an identity of their own. I know this is a difficult task, but we expect this because the guardian has an identity of his own he does not want to share with any other nation in the world. We as Afrikaners in South Africa know only too well what we are talking about, because we have not always been the governing group in this country. For that reason we can appreciate that we are going to ask the Brown people for no more than what we have asked for ourselves. We are satisfied to assist him in developing an identity of his own. We are more than satisfied; we are prepared to help him in achieving this. However, we ask him not to claim our achievements and our identity as his own. If they want to do this, they would be doomed to failure and would never be able to become a self-respecting community and people.</p>

<p>My time is running out fast, but in the few minutes I still have available, I want to deal with matters in a realistic way. We have heard many theories, but let us consider which development possibilities this side is referring to. I have already made reference in a previous debate to the 10 000 morgen of the most fertile irrigation <span class="col_5827-5828" refersTo="page_0604"/>land in South Africa situated in the rural Coloured areas of, for example, the Richtersveld, in the curve of the Orange River. I challenge anyone to gainsay me in this respect. That land is situated on the banks of the Orange River, which is in permanent flow now. Those 10 000 morgen should be subdivided into small holdings of five morgen each. Not many years ago some of my own people were being rehabilitated on the banks of the Orange River in the vicinity of Kakamas on small holdings of some four morgen. I am really proud of that section of my people. The same opportunity should be afforded the Coloured population. I expect the Coloured population to approach our Government through the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. Those two bodies should come together and decide in which way this area could be developed most rapidly. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as he usually does, the hon. member delivered a very friendly speech. It would have been a fine speech had it been made in 1954 and not in 1974, because in his speech there is no evidence of any appreciation of the urgency of the situation as it affects the Coloured people. It may indeed be said that they expect us to be more sympathetic towards them, to show greater regard for their feelings on human dignity and their needs for spiritual, economic and social development. However, the crux of the matter is not these spheres of development, but in which way we shall succeed in affording them the opportunity to be full citizens of the country of their birth. This is the problem facing us today, whether we are on this side of the House, whether we are sitting in these benches or whether we are sitting on the other side.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is was in this spirit that I listened to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I think he did impart an element of urgency into the discussion. He did emphasize the need for change and yet, with all respect. I do think that in a sense he missed the bus, he and his colleague, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central. I do not believe the essence of the problem lies in more and better consultation, but in joint decision-making with Coloured people at all levels of government in South Africa. I do not believe it lies in autonomy for the Coloured people within their own community; it lies in full citizenship for Coloured people within a shared South Africa. I do not believe the question of whether the Coloured people should be represented in this House should depend on the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s rejection of the United Party&#x2019;s policy. The Coloured people should be represented in the Parliament of South Africa, in the statutory bodies of South Africa wherever the Coloured people live and are to be found. It should not be dependent upon the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s rejecting the policy of the United Party. I think the hon. Leader of the Opposition should admit that he made a ghastly mistake when two years ago he said that there would be an all-White sovereign Parliament which would be the regulator of his federal system. Let us get away from the concept of an all-White sovereign Parliament regulating anything and let us realize that the days of all-White political institutions are gone and that we are now dealing with a shared South Africa and a shared political structure. [Interjections.] I do hope that this is going to emerge. I do hope that under the pressure of events the United Party is going to abandon its policy of last year and return to its policy of four or five or six years before. [Interjections.] I want to deal particularly with the question of the Coloured Representative Council, because the National Party is confronted with a very real dilemma. Does the CRC provide the viable base on which to build the future political rights of the Coloured people? When one looks at the history of the relationship between the Government and the CRC it is one of the most distressing chapters in the history of White-Coloured relations. Seen in perspective it is one of the most inglorious chapters in the history of the National Party. It is a history of callousness, of cynicism, of insensitivity towards a subject people, to say nothing of grave errors of political judgment and of crass political stupidity. This has been the history of Government CRC relationships over the past six years. The legislative and administrative steps involving the CRC have to be seen against the background of Coloured suspicion and Coloured mistrust of the motives of White South Africans. This was latent in South Africa for decades, but it welled to the fore in the 1950s because of the numerous Acts of rejection. They were listed today by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I am talking about the Group Areas Act, the Immorality Act and the Race Classification <span class="col_5829-5830" refersTo="page_0605"/>Act. These were all Acts which brought to the fore the mistrust of the Coloured people. The Government was insensitive to this and did not appreciate that this was the mood of the Coloured people. They showed callous disregard for the wounded feelings of Brown South Africans. They removed the Coloured representatives from this House. It is of course correct, as the hon. the Prime Minister said, that this was not an adequate form of representation, but it provided the focal point for the growth of representation, and provided the area of joint decision-making. It could have been extended to the northern provinces; it could have been extended to women; it could have been extended to allow Coloured people to represent Coloured people. Instead this was abandoned in favour of a scheme which the Government at that stage said would be a better scheme; it would be a scheme which would create more opportunities for the Coloured people, more freedom for them and a greater sense of responsibility. And so the Coloured representatives were removed on the basis of this new experiment. But from the time this experiment commenced the Government seemed to show disregard for the feelings of the Coloured people and the stature of this body. I think it is as well to know that the CRC is dead.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Whether the hon. member on my right likes it or not he should realize that it is dead. It is not going to be resurrected. This council was first of all packed with 20 people representing the Government-supporting party, 14 of whom were actually defeated at the polls. The chairman of the executive of the council was a person who came third in the election in his own constituency. And so all was set for a show-down. If one examines the records of the requests from the CRC and the reports that were produced each year right up to last year, one sees that the Government just ignored these requests. Time and time again they just brushed them aside with smooth words, high-sounding phrases and out and out rejections. As the CRC continued this council became more and more angry, more and more vociferous, moving towards a head-on collision with the Government. Then, last year, on two occations the leaders of the two main parties came under attack. Mr. Sonny Leon had his passport withdrawn by this Government while Mr. Tom Swartz was the target of disparaging remarks by the hon. the Minister of the Interior after he had addressed a United Party congress. The Coloured Representative Council virtually ceased to exist since that time. One therefore has the situation that the CRC ceases to exist both as a fact of government in South Africa and as a basis for the future political development of the Coloured people. If the Government was going to create such great opportunities for development through this council, they have broken down. I believe that Mr. Tom Swartz, a man who in all good faith was prepared to head an executive committee and take all the risks involved, has been humiliated by this Government. I believe the Government&#x2019;s record in relation to Mr. Tom Swartz is nothing less than a disgrace. They let down a man, who, while he might have been misguided, was prepared to do his best in a way he thought was best for the Coloured people themselves. The Federal Party, which once upon a time supported separate development, but equal separate development, has now rejected the whole philosophy of apartheid and of separate development. The Labour Party is becoming more and more militant and more and more aggressive towards both the Government and the White people of South Africa. The Coloured people are less and less in the mood to compromise, less and less in the mood to negotiate, but perhaps more and more realizing that when they have to deal with this Government the only way is the way of confrontation. The decline and demise of the Coloured Representative Council is now permeating through to the management committee system. Even this system is showing signs of collapsing. The fact is that the Coloured Representative Council no longer provides the basis for the future political development of the Coloured people. Theoretical discussions about homelands, semantic discussions about separate or parallel development may serve to provide the ammunition for people who are arguing amongst each other within the National Party, but they are irrelevant as far as the future of the Coloured people is concerned. As far as the Coloured people are concerned we have to accept that they are going to be full citizens in a shared South Africa. This means full shared social, economic and political opportunity</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it has become fashionable at this time to make all kinds of glib statements about the Coloureds. In this debate as well we have had to listen to a good quota of statements of this kind from the opposite side of the House. I do not intend following up on what the hon. members on the opposite side had to say in this regard. What I believe is necessary and would be a good thing is to emphasize and place in their correct perspective a few basic facts in regard to the Coloureds, who form the subject of this debate.</p>

<p>In general, &#x201C;the Coloured person&#x201D; or &#x201C;the Coloureds&#x201D; are referred to as though they were a homogeneous people or ethnic group. The fact of the matter is, however, that not only are the Coloured heterogeneous in appearance, but are in fact heterogeneous in ethnic descent. With the designation &#x201C;Coloureds&#x201D; a variety of ethnic groups is in reality being indicated. Thus there are in the first place the Griquas, who are a dwindling community situated for the most part in the North Western and North Eastern Cape. Then there are approximately 150 000 Cape Malays, descendants of Moslems from the Dutch East Indies who have remained loyal to their faith and who are to a large extent concentrated in the Cape Peninsula. There are, in addition, persons of mixed White/non-White descent, as well as persons of mixed Coloured/Bantu descent.</p>

<p>Apart from the difference in ethnic descent, there are among the Coloureds considerable differences in respect of politics, educational and socio-economic development as well. All Coloureds are definitely no longer on the level&#x2014;and I want to emphasize that I am stating this in parentheses&#x2014;of &#x201C;outa Moos&#x201D; and &#x201C;aia Siena&#x201D;, as we came to know them previously, particularly in the rural areas. But at the same time it would be absurd to wish to imply that almost every second Coloured is a potential Dr. Van der Ross, an Adam Small or a Sydney Petersen. There are in fact Coloureds who have achieved and are maintaining a high level of spiritual and moral development and material welfare. However, it is also true that the vast bulk of the Coloureds are on a far lower spiritual, cultural and moral level. Unfortunately it is also true that the more developed members of the Coloured community are all too frequently more interested in agitating for integrationist measures than in the upliftment of their own people.</p>

<p>Unlike the case of the various Bantu peoples, the Coloureds do not yet possess the accepted characteristics of a separate people or nation. They have no traditional homeland or own territory, within the boundaries of which an individual separate nationality can be established. They are, on the contrary, settled firmly with the Whites in those areas of the Republic of South Africa which could be regarded as being the heartland of White South Africa. They are very closely integrated into the economy of the Republic, and their destinies are inseparably linked to those of the Whites. They have no language and culture of their own, but comprise to a large extent part of the Afrikaans language and cultural community. As far as their religion is concerned, we find that approximately 90% of the Coloureds are Christians, while the Malays, as has already been mentioned are Moslems. I am mentioning these facts because any attempt to plan and to establish an acceptable and workable dispensation for the Coloureds which does not take these basic facts into account is doomed in advance to failure, however many glib statements and ideas may be made and thought out in this regard.</p>

<p>It is essential that any dispensation which is planned or proposed for the Coloureds <span class="col_5833-5834" refersTo="page_0607"/>will be acceptable to them. If it is not accepted by them, it cannot after all, be forced upon them or enforced with any hope of successful application. In view of this it is essential that in the dispensation which is planned and proposed for the Coloureds, cognizance should be taken of their just aspirations, needs and desires. However, it is equally essential that the proposed dispensation will also be acceptable to the White voters. Therefore, thorough consideration should be given to the interests and opinions of the Whites in this regard. To make up to the Coloureds only while disregarding the interests, sentiments and views of the Whites, as hon. members on the opposite side have consistently been doing throughout this Session, can only mar relations and do irreparable harm.</p>

<p>Over the years the Coloureds have already been stirred up to such an extent against the Afrikaners in general and this Government in particular that, in spite of their cultural, historic and other ties with the Afrikaner, they are prejudiced against the Afrikaners in the political sphere, and are displaying a measure of reluctance in co-operating with them in this sphere. During this session as well hon. members on the opposite side have, in season and out, raised a hue and cry over the political rights of the Coloureds, and have bandied concepts such as &#x201C;sovereignty&#x201D;, &#x201C;self-determination&#x201D;, etc., about. However, they have contributed nothing to the real promotion of the interests of the Coloureds, or to the creation of the essential infrastructure on which those political rights should be based. It is therefore clear that, if a better dispensation for the Coloureds is to be devised and applied in this country, it is only this National Party Government which is able to and will do this.</p>

<p>In the first and last place, it is not policies and statutory provisions which are going to determine the place of the Coloureds in this country, but attitudes, the attitudes not only of the Whites to the Coloureds, but also those of the Coloureds to the Whites. Bantu and Indians. We on our part should not, in my opinion think of the Coloureds in terms of a problem, and speak of a &#x201C;Coloured problem&#x201D;. At the same time, however, our actions should not be motivated by any false guilt feeling. On their part the Coloureds should display a greater willingness to co-operate with rather than to confront the Government. They should demonstrate their willingness and ability to exercise the rights which they already have in a responsible manner and to utilize the political and other machinery which has been placed at their disposal in a meaningful manner.</p>

<p>I believe that with unity of mind and unity of energies, a wonderful dispensation can be established for the Coloureds, on the basis of the guidelines stated on a certain occasion by the hon. the Prime Minister: In the first place, that the identity of the Whites shall be maintained; in the second place, that only the Whites themselves will determine their future in South Africa; in the third place, that the same rights which are claimed for the Whites in this regard will in due course be granted to the Coloureds as well; and in the fourth place, that peace, tranquillity and order in this country shall not be disrupted. But then the attitude adopted on both sides should be the correct one. For laws form only the skeleton of a democratic community. The people are the flesh and blood. But most important of all is the spirit and the attitude displayed. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with great interest to the speech made by the hon. member for Mossel Bay. I want to tell you that I was impressed by his earnestness in this regard, as well as by his well-balanced approach. Basically, he made four statements which, it seems to me, could be of the utmost importance in this debate. The first was that no arrangement will be a valid one in South Africa if it does not meet with the approval of the Coloured population. He followed this up with a second statement, namely that any such arrangement would obviously have to meet with the approval of the White population as well. He made a third statement, namely that the suggestion that the Coloureds have an individual, separate, distinguishable identity, is simply not true, and arising out of that, that our destinies in South Africa were inseparably linked to one another. He elaborated on that. Unfortunately he did not, in the last four points which he stated here, really do justice to the logic of his own basic statements. Although it is true to say that we should continue to preserve the identity of he Whites, that only the Whites should be allowed to decide on their own future, that they do not in this regard want to share the responsibility with anyone, that we grant the Coloureds that same right, and that peace and tranquillity should be maintained <span class="col_5835-5836" refersTo="page_0608"/>in order to achieve these things, he did not arrive at the basic problem, namely how we can maintain that linking of common destinies to which he referred. How we can maintain this if we do not have the machinery by means of which Whites and Coloureds jointly, are not only able to deliberate but are able to exercise authority, as the leader of this Party said, in regard to matters of common interest he failed to tell us. That is what is at issue here.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that I found it appalling as newcomer to keep on discovering here that we are still hurling reproaches at one another over what the position was 20 to 30 years ago, or what people had said 20 to 30 years ago. We are not living 20 years in the past. We are living in another era. The rate at which circumstances in South Africa are changing makes it essential that we should adopt a realistic policy in view of the present circumstances. Two things are very clear. The one is that the political machine which we created for the Coloureds in the form of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council has not succeeded in satisfying the Coloureds. It is not my desire here to score points off anyone. Yet it is very clear that that Council failed hopelessly as a political instrument to give expression to the aspirations of the Coloured population.</p>

<p>&#x2026; but particularly because it could not assure the Coloureds of justice and fairness, as the hon. Leader of the Opposition indicated. In view of the facts which the hon. member for Mossel Bay stated here, it is not possible for any Coloured Persons&#x2019; Council, as a separate instrument, ever to achieve those objects for the Coloureds. If it were possible to give those Coloureds a sovereign parliament in a separate geographic area, then it would be a different matter, but the basic characteristics of such separation, as the hon. member indicated, do not exist in South Africa. The possibility of a separate Parliament which can further the interests of the Coloureds in all spheres as a sovereign political institution is quite unimaginable.</p>

<p>Do hon. members know what I would do if I were the Government? I am not trying to evade the question. Let us be honest now. I believe that the federal structure in South Africa is going to be the inevitable method by means of which we are going to reconcile the political interests and aspirations of people with one another. I believe this. If we want to bring about a policy in South Africa in terms of which justice has to be done and the rule of law applied to every population group, without the possibility of domination of the one by the other, it is my honest conviction that the federal policy is the only solution.</p>

<p>I believe that the facts of the situation, the facts which the hon. member for Mossel Bay and I have mentioned here, are going to force us in that direction. I see no other alternative for South Africa. If the Government of the day does not see its way clear to accepting such a policy within the framework of its ideology, it should nevertheless accept the responsibility, in the times in which we are living, of allowing the Coloureds, as far as possible, to give expression to their feelings, their frustrations and their aspirations. That is what I am asking. I just want to say that none of the alternatives which have so far been voiced from the opposite side, come anywhere near complying with those requirements. Sir, merely to create a consultative liaison body between our executive authority and the executive authority of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Council and to hope that one will in that way be able, without that liaison body possessing any real powers, to meet the political needs of the Coloureds and what goes with it, is in my opinion futile wishful thinking. Sir, the only possibility, if we do not want to accept a federal policy is to <span class="col_5837-5838" refersTo="page_0609"/>create a body which could then, in its resolutions, bind this Parliament as well in respect of those matters which are common to the interests of both Coloureds as well as Whites. We accept that it is essential, in respect of the individual and preferable interests of the Coloureds and those of the Whites, that each group should have the highest possible degree of autonomy to manage those affairs which are inseparable from itself. On the other hand, we have no objection either to all possible authority and powers being allotted to the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council if these other matters, which made its functioning completely impossible, were eliminated. But, Sir, this is only one component of the answer, and one component of the solution which we shall have to seek in this matter. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. J. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I could not help gaining the impression that for the last two minutes of his speech, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat was waiting for the bell. We have been listening here to a typical tea-room argument. One frequently hears this type of discussion in the Lobby and in the tearoom, when we argue round and round a point without getting anywhere. Sir, it is not my intention to carry on theorizing where the hon. member for Edenvale left off. Since we have now heard the theoretician. I should like to go into the practical aspects of this Vote. Sir, it has become clear to me that even today there are more Coloureds who are interested in the improvement of their economic position than there are Coloureds who are interested in politics. There is a top layer of Coloureds today who are very interested in politics and in the political future of the Coloureds, but there are a very large number of them who do not yet take any interest whatsoever in politics. Sir, the National Party has proved that it is interested in the future of the Coloureds. The National Party has protected the Coloureds against the competition of the Bantu, and one wonders what the socio-economic position of the Coloureds would have been today if it had not been for the policy of the National Party over the past few years. Today I should like to discuss more specifically the role of our local labour committees. It is perhaps a good thing for one to glance for just a moment at the background to these committees. Sir, in 1962 a statement was issued by the National Party. At the time the hon. Minister P. W. Botha was Minister of Coloured Affairs, and a statement was issued which read as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Western Cape is traditionally the area where the population is composed of a numerical preponderance of Whites and Coloureds, and since the Government is giving positive effect to the development of the Bantu homelands and has also announced a positive socio-economic development programme in respect of the Coloureds, it has been decided that the replacement of the Bantu in the Western Cape shall take place gradually and without any disruption of the economy.</block>

<p>To put this into effect, certain steps were announced. Firstly, a Standing Cabinet Committee for the Western Cape was appointed. An interdepartmental committee with a full-time secretary was appointed, and a public committee of eminent persons from the Western Cape who were associated with various economic interests and organizations, was appointed. This executive committee received a function. The function of the committee was in the first place to submit proposals to the interdepartmental committee in regard to the most effective steps to carry out the policy of the National Party. In the second place, the committee had to make recommendations in regard to the gradual replacement of Bantu labour and to furnish the public, employers and employees with advice and information. In the third place, it had to be of assistance in the establishment of local committees in each magisterial district. It is these local committees which I now want to spend a little time discussing.</p>

<p>The objective of these committees was as follows: Firstly, to ensure the moral upliftment of Coloured failures in the magisterial district where they were then operating so as to make them full-fledged and responsible members of their community; secondly, to cause preference to be given to the available Coloured labour; and thirdly, to establish incentives which would persuade the Coloured worker to offer his labour, and also to develop qualities such as stability, reliability, higher productivity and responsibility. The functions of these labour committees have developed in the operation of these committees over a number of years, and I want to state here today that very good work has been done in <span class="col_5839-5840" refersTo="page_0610"/>various spheres. Promotional work had to be done among our people in respect of the upliftment and the training of our Coloureds. I say that we have today, to a very large extent already, realized the initial functions of these committees. But these committees were given a further objective as well, namely liaison with Coloured leaders and organizations, in order to decide on joint action to overcome labour and related problems. With this we have also made a start already. I want to tell you, Sir, that in my constituency the local labour committee consulted with the advisory committee of the town council which existed at that time, and we told these people: We want to discuss matters with you and negotiate on such matters as the negative approach to work which exists among some of your people, and we want to discuss with you the abuse of pensions which exists, and the unemployment which exists, and in addition we should also like to hear what you have to say to us in regard to steps which can be tried out by employers to persuade the Coloured worker to offer his services. We should like to hear from you what deficiencies exist, according to you, on the part of the employers which are prejudicing the labour situation and which are preventing the Coloured worker from coming forward to offer his services. We want to hear your proposals. Sir, this meeting took place, with very good results. Now I feel that as far as the future of these committees is concerned, since it is no longer necessary to convince the Whites that they should train their people that they should pay them good salaries, and that they should provide their people with social services, we should now move in this direction of liaison, and more liaison. There should be more meetings of this type where we can consult with similar committees such as these labour committees of the Coloureds, and exchange opinions. The hon. member for Namakwaland said that we do not want to talk about these people, but talk with them. The National Party is honest in its policy. It is honestly concerned about the progress and the welfare of the Coloureds, and for that reason we want to talk to them and listen to their ideas and thoughts as well. I feel that we could make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to adopt such a course in the further development of these committees. What I should very much like to see is the appointment of a permanent representative on these committees in the form of a secretary from the department. It is one of the problems experienced in regard to these committees that there is not always an active and energetic secretary. Our experience has been that when a member of the staff of the Department of Coloured Affairs acted as secretary to a committee, business proceeded smoothly and everything went well. It does not seem to me as though I will be able to touch upon the matters which I wanted to touch upon in the time which is left to me. However, I want to return briefly to these labour committees.

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the National Party came into power in 1948, it was the declared policy of the party that the Coloureds should be represented in this Parliament by one Senator and three members of the House of Assembly. That was the policy on which the party was voted into office. The three members of the House of Assembly would not be elected directly, but through the Coloured Council. It was only 22 years later that the Government abolished the representation of Coloureds in this Parliament, and with that threw overboard the principle of representation of the Coloureds in Parliament. This may perhaps have satisfied the negative apartheid spirit of that time, but I believe that time will show that that step was one of the greatest political blunders the Government party ever made. There are various reasons for this, but I want to mention only two. The first is that it seriously undermined the credibility of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development, or &#x201C;separate sovereignties&#x201D; for all South Africa&#x2019;s peoples, as it is called, for wherever the Government has to explain the policy of separate sovereignties today in its full consequences, the explanations founder time and again on the question: &#x201C;What about the Coloured population?&#x201D; Immediately the Government is in a quandary and this makes its entire approach sound and appear spurious and suspect. There is no one who thinks or who will ever think that there can be a different destiny for the Brown man in South Africa than that of the Whites.</p>

<p>Another reason why I believe that the abandonment of the principle of the representation of Coloureds in this Parliament was a political blunder for the National Party, is the fact that the National Party has since that time not floundered about so helplessly, remained so uncertain and voiced so many conflicting opinions <span class="col_5841-5842" refersTo="page_0611"/>in regard to anything else as it has in regard to the question of what political future it foresees for the Coloureds. It was, in addition, that step which gave rise to the laughable idea of an artificial homeland for the Coloureds, somewhere along the dry West Coast of this country.</p>

<p>How serious the quandary for the governing party is as a result of this step which it took appears from the following. A week or two ago the hon. the Minister of Defence addressed a conference of young people in Kimberley and he then encouraged them to seek what he called a &#x201C;unique solution&#x201D; to the position of the Coloured population. I do not think that any reasonable person would object to a unique solution, provided that it was indeed a solution which would be generally accepted, and particularly by the Coloured community. What is interesting about this situation is that this was not the first time that the hon. the Minister of Defence had spoken of searching for a unique solution. Nine or ten years ago he was himself Minister of Coloured Affairs, and the principle mental effort in regard to the future of the Coloureds was then his responsibility. What was the guidance which he then gave? In September 1965 he said the following before the Congress of the National Party in the Cape, referring specifically to the Coloured community (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We find ourselves in unique circumstances, and for that reason we must display the courage to seek our own unique solutions.</block>

<p>That was nine years ago. There is nothing wrong with the hon. the Minister of Defence, who is also the Cape leader of his party, seeking a unique solution to the position of the Coloureds. Nor is there anything wrong with his asking his party to help him seek for one. What is significant, however, is that after nine years he is seeking as much as he was at the beginning, and is even making up to the children of Kimberley to ask them, after all these years, to help him seek the unique solution. The hon. the Minister and hon. members on the opposite side will discover one thing, namely that all their searching for a unique solution will be in vain, for the simple reason that they will have to choose between two traditional solutions. The two traditional solutions between which they will have to choose are, firstly, that of baasskap, and included under that is everything which denies the Coloureds the principle of representation on those authoritative bodies or body where decisions affecting their lives and future, together with those of the Whites, are taken. By that I mean of course a body such as this Parliament. The Government can create just as many liaison bodies as it likes, and no one will oppose it, but as long as the liaison bodies remain part of the system where the final and binding decisions on everything affecting the real interests of the Coloureds will remain the responsibility of the Whites, so long will those bodies as well continue to fall into the category of the baasskap approach. As all of us know and ought to realize today, baasskap at its best can only be a temporary &#x201C;solution&#x201D;. The only alternative, in fact the only course which will indeed be a solution, is that of collaboration and co-operation, and not separate development which has set the Coloureds on a road to nowhere. Co-operative development must be the direction, and in the political sphere this entails the recognition of the basic principle of citizenship, namely that the Coloured community will receive participation, I am emphasizing the word &#x201C;participation&#x201D; in bodies, even the highest, where binding and enforceable decisions are taken which affect their weal and woe to exactly the same extent as that of the Whites.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I have said it. The principle which has to apply is that in bodies in which binding and enforceable decisions are taken in regard to them, the Coloureds must have participation. If that principle is accepted, there can be consultation in regard to its application and the best method of doing so. Regardless of whether we move in the direction of a federation or a confederation in South Africa or remain a unitary state, that principle has to be accepted, regardless of whatever system we introduce here. In other spheres, this entails the elimination of discrimination and an eventual system of open, free and voluntary association and communication between the White man and the Brown man. We hear such a great <span class="col_5843-5844" refersTo="page_0612"/>deal about identity, as we did again here today. Take the instrument forms of open communication which have developed for generations between the Afrikaner and the English-speaking South African. Would anyone tell me today that any of the two White groups, which have been living in that intimate association, have lost their identity? The Afrikaner least of all has lost his identity. The co-operation between Afrikaans and English-speaking people did not detract from the existence, and the right to exist, of separate and individual schools, churches, cultural bodies, business bodies, clubs or whatever hon. members may care to mention. This has not been enforced by any government. This was individual choice within an open community where a specific cultural group freely chose to preserve its identity in its own manner. Why did the identity of the Afrikaner, in that intimate association, which developed for generations, not go under? On the contrary, it grew stronger. The English-speaking person is not a threat to the Afrikaner and the Afrikaner is not a threat to the English-speaking person, but suddenly they see among two groups which are even further removed from one another a threat to the identity.</p>

<p>No. A few days ago I read about the problem which nature conservationists have in ensuring the survival of the cheetah. The greatest problem they have is that the mother devours her own offspring. We have seen today how the United Party, and particularly the hon. member for Bezuidenhout on behalf of the United Party, devours its own offspring. In order to explain this, I just want to tell hon. members something. I am not disclosing any secrets because the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint towards the Coloureds is a matter of public history. When the National Party came forward in 1948 with the measures to remove the Coloureds from the common voters&#x2019; roll, the United Party, and I with them, fought this to the utmost. In that way we caused one constitutional crisis after another. We had the country up in arms and we had protest marches through the streets of the cities of South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, then Japie was sitting on this side. I beg your pardon, I mean the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was sitting on this side. Then, eventually, after court cases and appeal cases the Coloureds were placed on a separate voters&#x2019; roll. The United Party then had to adopt an attitude as to whether it would restore <span class="col_5845-5846" refersTo="page_0613"/>them to a common voters&#x2019; roll. Under the leadership of Mr. Strauss we were unable to take that decision. We could not agree on that. Then, under the leadership of the present Leader of the Opposition, who is a man, we adopted a standpoint, namely to restore the Coloureds to the voters&#x2019; roll as it was prior to 1948. I take my hat off to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He had the courage. However, we had to defend that standpoint, and it was then that we discovered that we had been fighting all the time for an untenable, undefendable standpoint. What did we then have to ask the people of South Africa? The people of South Africa, fortunately, had enough sense not to listen to what we had to ask, namely: Allow us to restore a group of male Coloured voters in the Cape to the voters&#x2019; roll on a monstrosity such as a qualified franchise. Nowhere in South Africa, however, did we have a dispensation for the Coloured women, nor for the male Coloured voters in the Free State and the Transvaal, where they comprise the second largest group. We then had a slightly watered-down dispensation for Natal. We were placed in an illogical, untenable, ridiculous position. In 1961, at the National Congress of the United Party, I was entrusted with the task of informing those people that we were adhering to an untenable standpoint and that we should adopt a different standpoint. That congress agreed to that unanimously. With this as the main reason, we then came forward with our federal policy. It was a logical answer, whether or not it was acceptable, whether or not it was feasible; it was something which one could defend on a logical basis. The basis of the policy was self-determination, to the greatest possible extent, for every community, but with one central Parliament in which everyone, either through their own people or through others would be represented in a central federal parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I noticed throughout the early part of this afternoon that the hon. member for Turffontein was getting very excited. It appeared to us that he had come out of a long hibernation, and we wondered what it was that stirred him to life. I thought, as I studied him during the afternoon, that maybe his conscience had come to life. The question arises whether&#x2014;I put the question in a purely zoological sense&#x2014;in fact such an animal as a chemeleon, a political chameleon, has a political conscience. I am not sure whether it is a political question &#x2026;</p>

<p>We have heard from the hon. member for Turffontein a dissertation on United Party history and policy. This was very interesting. If this truly is how he understood it and still understands it, we forgive him for leaving us. But, in fact, we doubt whether he has ever really understood it, and he certainly does not appear to understand it now. However, in order to remind him what he used to think of that policy not very long ago, I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">The Cape Coloured people present South Africa with an immediate problem which the United Party is ready and historically equipped to face and overcome, but the Government has no answer to this vital problem in South Africa.</block>

<p>For once I am delighted to associate myself with the sentiments of that hon. member.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall leave the hon. gentleman at that because I do not think that he made any constructive contribution to this debate. In fact, I listened to a number of speakers representing Piketberg. Oudtshoorn, Namakwaland, Mossel Bay, Malmesbury and Turffontein. I think that some of these hon. members&#x2014;with the exception of the hon. member for Turffontein&#x2014;made interesting and constructive contributions to this debate. However, I think it is also fair to say that not one of them brought us any nearer to any kind of Nationalist Party solution of this particular problem. I can say honestly and sincerely that I listened with great attentiveness hoping to hear of some real advance, some new break-through, some new inspiration. I think that if hon. members opposite wish to be entirely honest, they will agree with me that there has not been such a thing this afternoon. We wait hopefully for some news from that quarter of the House.</p>

<p>Surely it is common cause on both sides of this House that we are facing a critical <span class="col_5849-5850" refersTo="page_0615"/>problem? We know that on the manner in which we solve this problem depends the future of our race relations, the good order and progress of South Africa, international goodwill and such questions as the security of our defence system. All these things to a greater or lesser degree are interdependent and depend in part upon our solution to this problem. In response to this we have had over the months and years and again this afternoon, uncertainty, speculation and vacillation. The replies that we have had from that side of the House cause us more concern than relief. If there is truly a belief on that side of the House that this problem can be solved by slogans and clich&#x00E9;s, surely then it is time to rethink and to reconsider our position?</p>

<p>In the time available to me I want to put briefly four propositions which have emerged in various forms from what was said by speakers on that side of the House. One solution that seems to have emerged is that one should search for a primarily political solution to this problem. In other words, one would more or less bypass the urgent economic and social requirements of our time, abdicate direct responsibility on the part of the Government of the day to solve those problems and say more or less this: We shall give to the Coloured people certain political powers through their own institutions which will enable them to solve those problems for themselves. It therefore poses this question: Must the Coloured people then acquire sufficient political power either through the CRC or through other supplementary institutions or with them, to gain their own salvation without this Government? If one takes this kind of view, there are two possibilities to be faced. One will have to create institutions for the Coloured people which will be of such a nature that they can hold their own with reactionary White sentiments, overcome conservative White sentiments and overcome White reaction in those areas where Coloured interests should be paramount. Is it possible to create such institutions? Will the White people of South Africa, will the Nationalist Party, tolerate an institution in which the Coloured people can insist on making their own interests paramount? That is the question which the Nationalist Party has got to face if it sees the route to the salvation of the Coloured people through a political institution.</p>

<p>There is another school of thought which seems to emerge, and this is that the Coloured people can make do with inferior, that is to say, subordinate institutions provided you add to this better liaison institutions together with a gradual social and economic progress. Sir, this looks very much like the paternalism that has been going on for many years. If the time were available and if the temper of the people allowed it, maybe we could possibly coast along in this manner, but I believe that both sides of this House would agree that there is not the time and that the temper is not right for this kind of gradualism.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another sentiment which one finds emerging, and I would call it &#x201C;the game of delay&#x201D;. It may be that in the minds of some people there is a kind of deliberately planned frustration policy. This I would ascribe to those people who secretly, clandestinely, believe that the whole problem will eventually be solved along the homeland self-development lines. It might be believed by such people that through apartheid measures, through the group areas, through race segregation, economic bribes, despondency and rejection, the Coloured people will then themselves say in despair: &#x201C;All right, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, give us a homeland; let us get out of this place; we cannot live with people like you.&#x201D; They will create an emotion of rejection and in this way the homeland apologists, the homeland advocates, will at last triumph. Sir, is the fourth possibility the true one, that there is really no answer as yet; that in fact what we heard from that side of the House this afternoon is true and that there is really no answer; that they will go on improvising, that they will go on procrastinating, that there will be constant sematic evasions that we will constantly hear of &#x201C;unieke oplossing&#x201D;, of &#x201C;buurskap&#x201D;, &#x201C;junior en senior vennote&#x201D;, &#x201C;&#x2019;n nasie in wording&#x201D;, &#x201C;parallelle ontwik-keling&#x201D;, and so forth <i>ad infinitum</i>&#x2014;smokescreen after smokescreen? Sir, this &#x201C;pie in the sky&#x201D; policy is going to solve nothing. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF COLOURED RELATIONS AND REHOBOTH AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if, arising out of recent events in the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, the opinion has taken root in the minds of the public of South <span class="col_5851-5852" refersTo="page_0616"/>Africa that the politics of the Coloured leaders is confusing and if that idea has perhaps taken root among the Coloureds themselves, viz. that their political leaders are in a state of confusion, then I think that this arises out of the chaotic confusion in respect of lines of action which was evident today from the speeches of hon. members of the Opposition, because within half an hour or more we witnessed the United Party&#x2019;s policy changing for the umpteenth time, as the hon. member for Turffontein also indicated.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, not only is it a policy which has changed, but one was given the impression of desperate irrationality, and that is why the hon. member who spoke just before I did, tried to project that image one finds among them on to this side, but, Sir, it is no good; that kind of confusion does not exist on this side. This side knows what it wants and, as the hon. member for Turffontein, who formerly differed from us, said, it projects that image towards the Coloured population as well. What this party undertakes to do, it does. Let us differ on that point, but let us then also ensure, when we make certain statements here, that they are responsible statements. Sir, this afternoon I want to mention the hon. the Leader of the Opposition by name. He made a very irresponsible statement here today, apart from the other statement that he again wants to relate the situation of our Coloureds to the situation of the population of Mozambique, as he did during the Budget debate. I want to tell him once again that this is a far-fetched comparison. I do not think that our Coloureds, in the process of growth and development they are undergoing at this stage, would like their situation to be compared with that of the population in Mozambique.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said here this afternoon that he held the Government responsible for the inferior educational facilities and opportunities available to the Coloured. Sir how one-sidedly can one view a situation? Look at the way the situation with regard to Coloured education has changed, thanks to the dispensation that has applied over the past five years, namely the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council having an Executive of its own, a member of the Executive in charge of education, and an Executive which takes an interest in this matter and is continually giving attention to it. In 1969, in the first year, there were 1 693 primary schools. In this year, 1974, there are 1 792 primary schools. In 1969 the number of teachers at the primary level was 13 351. This year it is 16 743. In 1969 the number of pupils at the primary school level was 438 545; this year it is 530 222. I could continue in this way and could detail for you the same tendency as reflected by these figures, in regard to secondary schools, special schools, technical colleges and training institutions, of which there is a fine concentration here in Bellville South. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s problem is that when a group of members from this side of the House went to look at it a week or two ago&#x2014;among the best educational facilities in the country&#x2014;and when even an hon. member from the Progressive Party accompanied us, he was busy with an emergency caucus of his party. No one was able to come along to see and to appreciate what is being done there. I could continue in this way and mention that the introduction of compulsory education for Coloured children from the age of seven years was approved early this year. It has already been approved that from next year on, eight-year olds will be subject to compulsory education. This bears testimony to enormous progress, and if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition fails to acknowledge this and then, in his political vendetta against the Government, makes a statement such as the one he made here this afternoon, then I should like to quote to the hon. the Leader from the report of the Education Council for Coloured Persons.</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The Council regards the introduction of compulsory education as an historic step forward and regards it as one of the greatest&#x2014;if not the greatest&#x2014;step forward in the historical development of education for the Coloured people in this country.</li>

<p>Since the hon. member refers to that now, I agree that the Coloureds do complain about it. However, they sit around a table with us and discuss their needs. We understand their difficulties as far as double-shift classes are concerned. But half a loaf is better than no bread and I want to point out to the hon. member that in the haste to introduce compulsory education, one cannot provide all those facilities overnight. But I also want to tell the hon. member, if he wants to take note of this, that the Cabinet has approved an amount of R21 million, additional to the amount that has already been approved, to be utilized in the planning of school building facilities for Coloureds for the years 1975 to 1978. The Executive spoke to us again recently and said that the need was so great that this amount would have to be increased. This matter will enjoy the earnest attention of the Government. But I do want to tell the hon. member that that Executive, the institution about which hon. members want to give the impression that it has failed and means nothing to its people, co operates with the Government and achieves results of this nature which give rise to the progress I have indicated to hon. members.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the debate on the Coloureds is a very important debate for us every year. I am very grateful to have been able to listen to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and also to the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party, because in South Africa is important not only to listen to the leader and the members of the governing party, but it is also extremely important for the inhabitants of the whole of South Africa to listen to the leaders of the various White parties. It is also very important for the leader of each political party and of every national group to provide an answer to the population questions of South Africa. In the times that lie ahead we shall have to listen to an ever-increasing extent to what the non-White leaders of parties say about how they see the solution of South Africa&#x2019;s population questions. Today I want to deal in particular with the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party and the speech he made. This is extremely important and that is why I am so pleased that the Progressive Party has in fact won seats to enable us to listen to their solution to the questions of South Africa more often. I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party that I have not yet had many answers from him, in the course of this session, to the major questions with which South Africa is struggling. I want to deal with a letter and its reply in <i>Deurbraak</i> of September 1974. A person wrote a letter to <i>Deurbraak</i> and under the heading &#x201C;What is the future of the Whites under the Progressive policy?&#x201D; he put certain questions. In replying to these questions I shall come to the question of what the replies would be if a Coloured were to put those questions to the Progressive Party. The author, an Afrikaner, writes (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a Christian humanist I associate myself with many of the Progressive Party&#x2019;s ideas. I wonder whether you perhaps have an answer to the question to which I and all Afrikaners clutch at so feverishly. As I understand it, the P.P. wants to strive to grant all Black people full representation in Parliament as soon as possible. It goes without saying that within a few years a majority would follow which would put a Black government in power; owing to superior numbers, possibly for ever.</block>

<p>Now comes the reply from the Progressive Party through the mouth of the editor, Mr. Van Eck. This is the reply which the Progressive Party furnishes to the Afrikaner and the White, as well as to each race group in South Africa, because there is one thing which we in South Africa cannot reason away, namely that there are not only different individuals, but also different national communities which are so much a reality that one will never be able to reason <span class="col_5857-5858" refersTo="page_0619"/>them away. Here, then, is the reply furnished by the Progressive Party, the great learned, rich party. The heading in <i>Deurbraak</i> is &#x201C;No guarantees for continued existence&#x201D;. They go on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the policy of the Progressive Party to extend the franchise to all people in South Africa as soon as possible in accordance with the system of a qualified franchise.</block>

<p>I now want to ask the Leader of the Progressive Party when the day will come when the Progressive Party will tell us on what ethical principles qualified franchise rests. The hon. Leader should not laugh now. He always laughs off everything when one is discussing a serious matter [Interjections.] The Progressive Party must tell us what is the content of qualified franchise, how they would apply it in South Africa and what the moral principles are on which it rests. When, as they foresee it, will all the Coloured people in South Africa have the full franchise? I ask this question because the Progressive Party and the Young Turks of the United Party are an extension of British Imperialism&#x2019;s attitude of &#x201C;Equal rights for all civilized men&#x201D;. This is a historical matter, but the hon. member for Edenvale says that we should not talk about history. Surely one cannot escape from history in South Africa. The hon. members&#x2019; opinions grew out of a specific way of thinking and they represent a way of thinking that has been rejected throughout Africa. That is why I am now asking the Progressive Party to reply to this question for the Coloureds, too. When do they foresee every Coloured man and woman having the full franchise here in South Africa? The Progressive Party then goes further and states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The majority of voters, therefore, will be Black and Brown.</block>

<p>Let us now analyse this. The majority of voters would not be Brown people, but Black people. Therefore they would have to say to the Coloureds, just as they say to the Afrikaner and the White man, &#x201C;We can give you no guarantees&#x201D;. A disputable academic point is whether the Coloureds, in their diversity and their historic depth, have a certain approach to life peculiar to themselves, certain things characteristic of them alone, and whether or not they are also characteristic of that of the White man, does not matter. There are many things in respect of which the Coloureds may be clearly identified. They have a language, a religion, a culture and many other things which are not the same as those of the Venda, the Xhosa or the Zulu. However, this great party with the high degree of morality tells the Coloureds that they cannot give them a guarantee in South Africa, because the majority of the people who will govern South Africa will be Black people. What future do those people have then? Then the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party states that they have the solution to the population question of South Africa in respect of the Coloureds too! The Progressive Party has no solution for South Africa and its people. They may be living in a dream world, thinking that a certain elect, the rich and the learned, will be able to carve out a niche for themselves in South Africa and enslave the other people to them, as there have been people throughout the history of man who, through their wealth and learnedness, have been placed in a position of power to subject other people to their will. The Progressive Party will enslave not only the White man and the Afrikaner, but also the Coloureds in South Africa, just as it will enslave the Zulu, the Xhosa and the Venda, or whoever. They have no solution to the problem. The majority of voters, that party states, will be the Black people. They then go further and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that this is a reality no one can do anything about. The Whites are and will always be a minority group.</block>

<p>Not only the Whites, but the Coloureds too, will always be a minority group.</p>

<p>But that is just the problem. The Progressive <span class="col_5859-5860" refersTo="page_0620"/>Party does not have a solution to the population question in South Africa. They acknowledge it. They simply tell the Whites that they are a minority and that they must accept that. Similarly, they tell the Coloureds the same. They simply tell the Venda that they are in a minority and they have to accept that. But who, then, is to govern us? The hon. members of the Progressive Party want a small, select group of people who are prepared to give up their identity, made up from each of the Bantu peoples and a small select group from the Indian population as well as a small group from the Coloured population to form the government of South Africa. This would be determined in accordance with the qualified franchise. Do we not know that problem from our history? One first states that Std. 6 is the qualifying level of education, but when there are too many people in Std. 6 one makes it Std. 8. To begin with, the qualifying salary that must be earned is, say, R1 000, but just as soon as a number of people are earning R1 000, the qualification is shifted upwards. The Progressive Party is not a party to be trusted.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rissik addressed a number of interesting questions but he did not address them to this side of the House, the official Opposition, but to the Progressive Party. I take it that they will endeavour, in the course of this debate, to furnish the hon. member with a reply. However, I do not want to go any further than the &#x201C;endeavour&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to return to the subject of this debate. The subject of this debate is the future of more than two million people. They are people who are not blind and who can read, they are not deaf and they can hear, and they are people who participate indirectly in the argumentation of hon. members across the floor of this House. I asked myself a question, which is what my summary of this debate would have been if I had been a Brown man. The hon. member for Namakwaland posed the same question. I would have been rather disappointed. I have no doubt at all that this is what would have passed through the mind of any Brown man.</p>

<p>Here we have two million people whose destinies have for 26 years been in the hands of one Government. What has happened over 26 years, more than a quarter century, could only have happened as a result of the action and the conduct of one Government. This afternoon we find the spectacle&#x2014;I cannot call it anything else&#x2014;of hon. members opposite attacking us because of our lack of policy. They attack us because we dare say that they do not have a policy, knowing full well that after 26 years they are still wandering around in the wilderness of ignorant policy-seeking, and still have no answer. What did we hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister? Before the debate I heard a rumour that we could perhaps hear a new note from the Government in this debate. It is not yet too late. However, I listened to the hon. the Deputy Minister and he, too, referred to this side of the House as if we were in a state of irrational, helpless confusion, although his party, in the person of an hon. Minister of the Republic of South Africa, goes to the young children to ask them to help that party find a unique solution. Who is in a state of confusion now? What has been achieved in respect of this problem, after all these things have been said? What did that hon. gentleman achieve in that way in respect <span class="col_5861-5862" refersTo="page_0621"/>of a solution to this burning issue in South Africa. A few months ago this Government came into power once again. In the normal course of events it will remain in power for a further five years.</p>

<p>Sir, I have appreciation for the note on which the hon. member for Maitland concluded his speech, where he tried to interpret the Afrikaner way of thinking to this side of the House. I think, however, that if he wishes to interpret that way of thinking, he should accept the idiom of this side of the House, or before he accepts it, he should first reflect on it, for then he will really be able to interpret the Afrikaner way of thinking, the Nationalist way of thinking and the meaningful way of thinking in regard to politics in South Africa.</p>

<p>We listened to quite a number of crisis speeches on the opposite side. These were crisis speeches, crisis thinking, etc., as if all and sundry should now flee. There are two things I want to say at once. A responsible <span class="col_5865-5866" refersTo="page_0623"/>Government cannot ignore these things. It has to do the right thing at the right time. If a responsible Government wishes to flee, however, or run with all and sundry, or allow itself to be stampeded, it cannot perform its task in a responsible, moderate and far-sighted way.</p>

He will forget about it completely if only we could suggest something acceptable. [Interjections.] One is dealing with an Opposition which does not believe in its own case.

<p>The policy of the National Party has a definite foundation. Its relations&#x2019; policy has a definite foundation, and the first point is the recognition and acceptance of the group basis of the ethnic multiplicity of the South African population. The Progressive Party refers to &#x201C;the Coloured people&#x201D; and the United Party refers to &#x201C;the Coloured people&#x201D;, but when it comes to the meaningful political effect of the implications of this, they have forgotten it. Then they want to stir up the whole mixture into &#x201C;one common society&#x201D;. Surely that is absolute nonsense. Surely one cannot take such a political step in South Africa. [Interjections.] On the one hand one wishes to recognize the various ethnic groups in their existence, but when it comes to the point where one wants to carry the political implications of this further, one wishes to deny it!</p>

<p>The second principle is that the domination of one ethnic group by another, cannot be maintained indefinitely. It is the National Party which says this. We do not require lessons from the United Party or the Progressive Party to teach us that one cannot have eternal domination of one people by another. It is in fact the policy of the National Party which is simultaneously separation-orientated on the one hand and development-orientated on the other, and what this amounts to is that one has to effect separation, so that the one does not dominate the other politically or has to interfere in the social structure of the other. That is the basis of the policy of the National Party. For that very reason efforts are being made to achieve the eventual transfer of an effective say to the non-White peoples.</p>

<p>Let me quote to that hon. member what Prof. Vosloo, I think, of Stellenbosch said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The strongest dividing factors which occur to a greater or lesser extent in every country, and in particular in South Africa, are race, ethnicity, religion, nationalistic aspirations and socio-economic differences. These dividing factors form, as it were, the raw materials of politics in every State.</block>

<block name="quote">The presence of these dividing factors under the same political umbrella &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is what those hon. members want&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; offers a fertile breeding-ground for a pattern of hostile, cumulative conflict.</block>

<p>Now hon. members want to hold up to us here the enmity of the non-Whites. One can imagine into what a pattern of hostile, cumulative conflict one is going to force South Africa when one does not bring about separation, but brings other minority groups, as the hon. member for Rissik indicated the Coloureds are, under one political umbrella in South Africa. What is Parliament <span class="col_5867-5868" refersTo="page_0624"/>in terms of the federal system but that one is forcing everyone in under that umbrella?</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. P. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>We are giving the hon. member an umbrella as well! The basis of the policy of the National Party is that we reject the policy based on the idea of a &#x201C;common society&#x201D;, or a one man one vote policy with a common voter&#x2019;s roll. In the &#x2019;fifties those hon. members almost fought until the blood flowed, as the hon. member for Turffontein indicated, against the idea that there should be separate voters&#x2019; lists. In the &#x2019;sixties there was even an hon. member on that side of the House who put his political future at risk if they were not restored to the common voter&#x2019;s roll. Now they are accepting him.</p>

<p>They kick up a fuss here about race classification. How do they want to compile a Coloured voters&#x2019; list without race classification? They cannot. In other words, all that is being said here is mere pious talk. I have said that we do not accept a &#x201C;common society&#x201D;, and for the simple reason that it gives rise to intolerable tensions. Those people who want the Coloureds back in Parliament with the Whites, are people who want to cause renewed tension between Whites and Coloureds. We want to say to those people: Stop it, for the Whites feel themselves threatened by it, and the Coloureds will not benefit from it. Through such a situation you are not only creating tensions, but an intense power struggle.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. P. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member does not want to believe me now, he can ask an authority on politics such as Prof. A. H. Murray, who will tell him that in a multi-racial set-up matters in the parliamentary dispensation are not simply determined by ordinary parties, but that those parties organize on a racial basis. For what other purpose are hon. members on the opposite side exerting themselves but that the Coloureds should be given a say, not as individuals, but as a group? If they are then to receive that say as a group, and the White wish to maintain their say as a group, surely it leads to a confrontation, to an intense power struggle, and ultimately to chaotic conditions in which each group will eventually lose its ethnic right to self-determination. That is what the National Party is guarding against. For that reason we are advocating this policy of separate development, and for that reason we have created for the Coloureds an opportunity to have their own parliament, which is, however, not yet a full-fledged body and does not yet have all the powers in its hands. However, those hon. members do not want to give it a chance. Let us add to this: If people do not want to use an opportunity which they are being afforded as a particular ethnic group, but wish at the same time to use my opportunity and my political machinery, and wanted to come in under my political blanket, and I say to them that they cannot do so, do those hon. members now want to tell me that such people therefore have the right to hate me? Must I, if I do not want to receive a person in my home, but say I want to build him a house of his own, be hated by that person for that reason? But that is what hon. members on that side are instigating, crisis thinking, alarmist thinking, which this side of the House rejects. We say to our Government that it should proceed with the necessary expedition, but with the necessary wisdom, to do for these people as we are doing. Surely we can tell those hon. members what we are doing for these people in practical politics, with what we are doing in the spheres of education and training. We can mention all these things to them, but this is practical politics. This is the upliftment work. This is sense and the content of citizenship. Sir, I thank you. I just wanted to make this point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should imagine that one of the most over <span class="col_5869-5870" refersTo="page_0625"/>worked words we have had from the other side of the House during this debate, and perhaps during the session, has been this word &#x201C;veelvolkigheid&#x201D; which is supposed to denote the character of South Africa. It seems that whenever one wants to discriminate against someone, one attributes his main characteristics or personality to the fact that he is a member of a &#x201C;volk&#x201D;. Perhaps the hon. member over there will argue that there is an &#x201C;Afrikanervolk&#x201D;. But who would think of separating the Afrikanervolk politically from the &#x201C;Engelse volk&#x201D; or the non-Afrikaner Whites in South Africa? It is an irrational idea. Sir, there was a time under Dani&#x00EB;l Malan and others when there was no thought of separating the &#x201C;Kleurlingvolk&#x201D; from the Whites.</p>

<p>*There was a &#x201C;Kleurlingvolk&#x201D; in the same sense as there was an &#x201C;Afrikanervolk&#x201D;, but there was no thought in those days of dealing with it separately on the constitutional level.</p>

<p>&#x2020;One tends to find this word used whenever it suits the political arguments of the hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>I want to devote one or two minutes to respond to some comments made by the hon. member for Rissik. He said &#x201C;daar was geen waarborge vir die voortbestaan van die Blankes nie&#x201D;. This was in pursuance of a letter written on behalf of the Progressive Party. Sir, I want to ask him whether he has a guarantee for the future of any group in South Africa, a guarantee in absolute terms. Did Paul Kruger have a guarantee for the continued existence of the South African Republic? Did anybody have a guarantee for the Huguenots when they came here? Did anybody have guarantees for the Voortrekkers? No, Sir, there is no such thing in constitutional terms as absolute guarantees, especially in the circumstances of South Africa. Of course there are risks, and one has to minimize the dangers. One has to build up the areas of security, but to use absolute phrases like guarantees is to bluff the public of South Africa. Sir, we believe that we can create an element of security and we can minimize risks, but the ultimate guarantee is the quality and the calibre of the individual South African. If this hon. member is afraid for his future, then he must look at himself; he should look at his own qualities and his own personality and his own ability to triumph in adversity.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked: What about identity? I want to ask him whether he needs the Immorality Act to protect his identity. And if he does not need it for himself, what right has he got to say to other White people that they need it but he does not? Is he so extra special? Is the hon. member so special that he can dictate to others what they need to preserve their identity? Of course the question of individual or group identity is a factor in any society, and not only in South Africa, but there is no need for forced separation, to enforce group identity by constitutional means. If you want to protect the identity of people in the religious sense, then you protect the freedom of religion, and you say that you cannot persecute a religion. But as long as there is freedom for people to be what they want to be, surely you are protecting their identity. As long as the law prevents one from discriminating against individuals, it is up to the individual of any group to protect his identity. One does not protect the identity of people by driving them into separate constitutional groups, by denying opportunities to other people. One protects the identity of people by giving them each an equal opportunity to develop.</p>

<p>We can protect the identity of the Afrikaans language by seeing to it that Afrikaans is not discriminated against. We can protect people&#x2019;s religion by <span class="col_5871-5872" refersTo="page_0626"/>seeing that that religion is not discriminated against. We can protect the economic rights of people by seeing to it that the economic rights are not subject to discriminatory laws. However, one does not protect people by driving them into separate kraals and treating them differently and separately in a society which they all share. The essential characteristic of the protection of identity is therefore to have a Bill of Rights, an entrenchment in the Constitution which will prevent groups in the society from being discriminated against. Once one has removed the threat of discrimination, it is up to the group and the individual to establish its required identity.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said: &#x201C;Stemreg is maar net vir rykes en geleerdes.&#x201D; What absolute nonsense, coming from a member of a political party which will not give a real vote in a sovereign parliament to the Coloured people.

<p>If this Government introduces free compulsory education to the Std. 8 level for Coloured people, when we take over in five or ten years&#x2019; time all Coloured people will have the franchise. What is the problem? It is up to this hon. member. If he really wants to see an acceleration of that process, as we do, he must see that there is free, compulsory education for the Coloured people in South Africa.</p>

<p>There is a strange view among hon. members there that one can turn off political rights as one can turn off a tap. Political power, however, is not vested solely in the franchise. The vote in this House is, of course, an important factor, but the lessons of history show that political power is not expressed only in terms of votes. It is expressed in the total numbers of people, in the level of education, in the ability of people to organize, in their moral strength, in their international support and in their economic power. The fact is that the Black people and the Coloured people are growing in real political power in South Africa. The question is not whether they are going to get more political power. The question is merely how they are going to express it. Are we going to allow them to express it with us in the democratic institutions which have been built up in South Africa or are we going to tell the Coloured people that they are untouchables: &#x201C;Julie is &#x2019;n vreemde volk.&#x201D; Are we going to tell them that they do not belong here? Are we going to force them into the confrontation situation into which they are being pushed as the result of the policy and the treatment of the Coloured Representative Council? No, we say that if there is to be political development in South Africa, then for <span class="col_5873-5874" refersTo="page_0627"/>heaven&#x2019;s sake face up to the realities of growing Coloured power in South Africa. Let us see that that Coloured power is expressed in the democratic institutions and law-making bodies of South Africa. The ultimate guarantee, if the hon. gentleman on the other side wants it, will not be found in creating separate Coloured &#x201C;tuislande&#x201D; as he may wish, or even in creating &#x201C;oorkoepelende liggame&#x201D;. It will be found in obtaining the friendship of the Coloured people by saying: &#x201C;Come into this Parliament with us. Share in this Parliament on an equal basis with us.&#x201D; This is the best guarantee that we in this House can give to both the Coloured people and the White people of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the &#x201C;growing power&#x201D; standpoint of the previous speaker and the standpoint of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition have again been clearly illustrated today. Hotels, restaurants, theatres and bioscopes must be thrown open and the Immorality Act must be done away with, all this in terms of an egalitarian process of integration accommodated under the umbrella of a federal policy. That is the alternative. What non-White group in this country has expressed its approval of this federal policy? Whatever policy any party may have, there is a very important aspect underlying any policy, namely that of attitudes. That is why I want to be more positive this afternoon and talk about this important basis of attitudes. Who, today, could dispute the fact that the future of South Africa is also the future of the White and the Coloured? Who could dispute the fact that the road ahead will have to be walked by White and Brown together? We shall have to face the problems of the future in close co-operation with each other. Is this not the reason for this Government displaying a spectacular initiative in appointing the Theron Commission, on which Coloureds are also represented, to investigate this very future with its problems? If, then, we have to walk the road ahead together, and if that road ahead is the same for White and Brown, then it goes without saying that neither colour group, whether White or Brown, can afford not to have a mutual understanding of each other&#x2019;s thoughts and actions. Then one is not blinded by concepts. Then one seeks a realistic solution and one tests one&#x2019;s solution against the needs of both Brown and White. One ensures that both groups are satisfied, as far as possible. One ensures that in this process one avoids blatant discrimination, based on colour, with the exclusive aim of injuring. At the same time one takes into account those who seek friction, agitation and confrontation in this process. One attempts to bring about something positive and constructive for each, and for both on a mutual basis. I speak as one of many thousands whose task and calling it is to apply our minds to South Africa&#x2019;s future and the peace and security of White and Brown in this country. There must always be a spirit of co-operation, mutual assistance and absolute dedication to their native soil. In this process I shall not surrender those things which are my own. In this process&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;the Coloureds would not, simply because we were seeking a formula to co-operate, surrender the things that are theirs either. After all, White and Brown people certainly have a special pride in being members of their particular colour group. They are proud of their own identity and its maintenance. They are proud to recognize persons in other colour groups in their own right. They appreciate those persons&#x2019; right to survive. Is it not in this spirit that in recent years this Government has done more than ever before to uplift the Coloured, educate him, give him power and promote his interests? There has been the establishment of an independent Government department, the establishment of employment opportunities for thousands in Government departments and semi-Government departments. There have been educational opportunities for more than half a million people. They have their own university with their own rector, an imaginative scheme for the uplifting of the Coloured in the social sphere and for the establishment of accommodation. Above all, there is a Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, a milestone along the parallel road of self-realization. Could the White people ever express greater confidence in their Brown South African fellow-countrymen <span class="col_5875-5876" refersTo="page_0628"/>than through these and other exceptional steps, testifying to magnanimity, taken by the Government? There is regular and direct liaison with the person with the highest authority in this House, the Prime Minister personally. There are Coloured observers as representatives of South Africa in the highest assembly in the world. There is the prospect of Coloureds in foreign representative posts to project the image of South Africa. Steps in this regard may not be abused. In this spirit, therefore, it is necessary for many changes and adjustments to take place in the outlook, attitude, and understanding of Brown towards White, but also, of White towards Brown.</p>

<p>Can one imagine anything more objectionable and unpatriotic in the relations between White and Brown in this country than when certain respected, responsible Brown bodies breathe a spirit of anti&#x002D;nationalism, a spirit of anti-patriotism and a spirit of anti-everything that is White? There are also student representative groups with a gospel of pro-Black/anti-White/anti-South Africa/anti-all countries that want to establish trade relations with South Africa and also anti those countries who want to provide South Africa with weapons for the protection of all colour groups in this country. We also have on our hands a Coloured political party that is constantly engaged in blatant political agitation and in making demands which cannot be acceded to owing to our tradition. They make confrontation their premise and aim instead of positive, constructive action among and for the sake of their own people. In this regard, too, there will have to be a change in attitude on the part of the Brown man.</p>

<p>Against this background it is of the utmost importance that Brown should look after Brown, should in a dynamic way, see to the productive uplifting of the approximately 60% lesser privileged in their own ranks. It is also of the utmost importance for a Coloured to regard it as a challenge, and at the same time, as a great privilege, to serve his own people in the technical, professional, spiritual, administrative and all other spheres. It is also of the utmost importance for the approach of the Brown man at all times to be one of sincere loyalty. He must live for South Africa and also be prepared to die for South Africa if necessary. There will have to be a change in attitude on the part of some of our Brown leaders in this respect too.</p>

<p>Against this background it is also of the utmost importance for the White, in his understanding of the Brown man, to realize yet again that on his shoulders, too, rests a task which involves heavy responsibilities. It is a task in accordance with which the White person, without giving up his principles, but in an attitude of good faith, correctly evaluates the place of the Coloureds as a people. This is a task in accordance with which Whites will have to be prepared to make financial sacrifices and adjustments in order to meet extremely important and essential socioeconomic needs and not to do this in a spirit of subsidization, but in a spirit of upliftment and promotion of productivity and also in a spirit of prevention of social deterioration. This is a task in accordance with which the White person will have to give his wholehearted support and assistance to the Government in respect of the responsible duty gradually to transfer increasing executive powers over their own people to the Coloureds in terms of the policy of the Government, but with the retention at all times of the right of self-determination of the White nation and of each national group in this country. In this regard, too, there will have to be a change in attitude on the part of some Whites in South Africa. To conclude, in this spirit it is all-important that the point of departure of White towards Brown and <i>vice versa</i> must and will at all times be positive. It is of the utmost importance that White and Brown should be prepared to think unselfishly, magnanimously, yes, to think big about our common future. It is extremely important, in this challenging process, for White and Brown to stress the retention of the respective White and Brown group awareness as it is clearly spelt out under Nationalist policy. There must be the greatest pride in the nationhood of each and there must be appreciation of the right of each to continued existence and peaceful co-existence. All this should not be displayed in a spirit of disparagement and contempt, but in a large spirit, in a spirit <span class="col_5877-5878" refersTo="page_0629"/>of conservation of identity and in a spirit of &#x201C;ons vir jou, Suid-Afrika&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the way in which hon. members on the other side of the House refer to the problem we are discussing here this afternoon, often creates the impression that they revel in the fact that Brown politicians have sought a confrontation and have insisted on being represented in this House. They want to make a big fuss about that, as if their policy made provision for direct representation in this Parliament. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout can try and hedge and evade the matter with many words if he likes, but their policy does not make provision for the Brown people to be represented in this House either. The problem is far too complicated to be dealt with merely by discussing ultimate political goals. There are so many obvious social-economic matters that deserve immediate attention, and in the few minutes at my disposal I should like to touch on a few of those aspects today.</p>

<p>Prof. Erica Theron, the chairman of the commission of investigation into Coloured affairs, said in a speech reported in <i>Die Burger</i> of 31 May 1974 that we were too quick to talk about the Coloured problem and that there was also a White problem. She went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The White problem consists, in the first place, of ignorance. So few Whites know anything about the people who work for them every day.</block>

<p>She then goes on to plead for greater compassion and understanding for the Brown people and their problems. In this regard I should like to make a few remarks this afternoon about a matter for which, in my opinion, we do not always have adequate understanding and compassion, namely the problem of poverty among the Coloured or Brown people. Poverty has little to do with income, or rather, with a lack of income. Research has indicated that poverty can develop into a culture, into a subculture and into a specific style of life, so that it would be correct to speak of a culture of poverty, a culture or sub-culture within which aberrant behaviour such as alcoholism, slovenliness, coarse language, work-shyness, etc., could develop until they formed part of that structure, part of that culture. It is a culture of poverty in which, as American scientists describe it, poverty becomes more of a state of mind and in which it would be correct to refer to &#x201C;pockets of poverty&#x201D;. What is most important about this problem is that there is not enough understanding of the fact that this culture of poverty perpetuates and maintains itself, that it propagates itself and that in fact it holds captive those people who are part of that culture. This culture of poverty forms an attitude to life and a pattern of life that cannot be changed simply by attempting to cure the symptoms alone. In this connection alone, the unsympathetic and often moralistic way in which people are so quick to refer to the lower strata of the Brown population displays a grave lack of understanding of the social impediments which this culture of poverty brings in its wake and the social retardation arising from it. It is a total oversimplification of a very complex problem to maintain that if there were only sufficient education or employment opportunities, or if housing were to be provided, the Brown people in that category would simply have to put out their hand and hey presto! the problem would be solved overnight. It may be reasonably easy to take the man out of the slum and transfer him to a better neighbourhood. It may be reasonably easy, figuratively speaking, to take a man out of his poverty, but to take the slum and the poverty out of the man is a far more difficult matter. We should guard against passing judgment on and condemning, with no further ado, people who are embedded in this culture, in terms of our bourgeois standards. We shall have to display greater understanding and greater compassion for people who are trapped in this social retardation and this social sub-culture, a sub-culture that perpetuates itself. This is a retardation that is not characterized only by a shortage of food or clothing or housing, but which is also characterized by psychological and personal dispositions, characteristics or natures.</p>

<p><span class="col_5879-5880" refersTo="page_0630"/>It is an attitude to life that perpetuates and propagates itself, even though many of the apparent causes, e.g. a lack of income or a lack of housing, are eliminated. It is an attitude to life giving rise to conduct which, according to our standards, would be condemned as abnormal, aberrant and even as misconduct. It is an attitude to life in which such conduct would even be upheld by that sub-culture and by the bearers of that sub-culture, as normal and obvious. It is against this background that we must display a sympathetic understanding of the high crime rate, the high rate of alcoholism, the large number of assaults and so on. There is a milieu-lag, a milieu-handicap that is not easily eliminated merely by providing the necessary facilities and opportunities.</p>

<p>Yes, it will not be eliminated by the franchise. This is not merely a little political problem that can be solved simply by deciding that they should have representation here and hey, presto! the problem is solved! It is in this regard that Prof. Erica Theron talks about a self-satisfaction, a self-satisfaction which I also discern among hon. members on the other side of the House, as if they have the answers, yes, all the answers on that side of the House. In reality they are unable to make any constructive contribution to this debate and to the solution of the problems being debated in the House. Prof. Erica Theron spoke about a self-satisfaction among the Whites which she went on to describe as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a self-satisfaction expressed in the attitude that the Coloureds must fend for themselves in their separate residential areas on the edges of our towns and cities; a self-satisfaction that is also displayed by many so-called liberals who strongly oppose apartheid.</block>

<p>In dealing with Brown poverty, therefore, there should not only be a programme of provision; in other words, provision should not only be made for supplying the deficiencies, but there should also be a remedial programme. It would have to be a remedial programme in terms of which the psychological and social causes underlying this culture of poverty would have to be looked at sympathetically. For example, it would be necessary to give specialized attention to these cases in education. There are both internal and external factors causing and perpetuating this poverty. The internal factors are related to a lack of moral norms, overcrowding, with a lack of discipline, with drunkenness and so on. The external factors relate to a social and a political situation. The bearers of the culture of poverty see their situation as the unjust treatment handed out to them by the privileged class&#x2014;in South Africa, the Whites. This is simply unrelated to the facts in South Africa, but if time permitted, I could also point out to hon. members that it is a phenomenon in other countries that the people who are trapped in poverty and the people who are bearers of the culture of poverty, always blame the privileged class for the situation they find themselves in. This side of the House and the National Party have a deep understanding of the fact that the Brown people may see their situation in South Africa as being socially handicapped. Through its policy, however, the National Party wants to eliminate these impediments or supposed impediments and also to meet the future together with the Brown population in a meaningful and orderly way and in a spirit of co-operation in terms of which the just treatment, politically and socially, would be handed out to the Brown people, which would contribute towards the security and prosperity of the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate on this Bill was adjourned on Thursday, I was advancing the argument that when human rights and freedoms and government systems were being tested and considered, such an investigation was not complete if it started and ended with the Westminster model of democracy only. At the present juncture especially it is necessary to investigate this concept as it is applied on the continent of Africa as well. We know that in the process of the attainment of independence in Africa, every effort was made to sell Western democracy in these African countries. Countries such as Nigeria and Ghana were held up as fine examples of how Western democracy could be transplanted on Africa. Yet Ghana officially became a one-party state in 1964, and in Nigeria a military dictatorship took over the reins of government in 1966.</p>

<p>Today there are 17 civil one-party states in Africa and 18 military dictatorships. It is clear, therefore, that the classic model of democracy, with its attendant concept <span class="col_5883-5884" refersTo="page_0632"/>of the rule of law, has beaten a retreat in the vast majority of African states. Virtually without exception the African leaders are saying that the multi-party system and the existence of a political opposition are alien to the African tradition. They are also saying that they have to have political mobility in order to tackle questions of development without having to be tied down by the cumbersome procedure of having to refer back to the electorate time and again. In these states the head of state often has unlimited authority on account of his being the leader of the only political party. In Guinea, for instance, the president and his party control not only political life, but also the economic, cultural, social and all the other spheres of life. In the other hand, however, it is also interesting to look at a country such as Kenya. Kenya, too, is a one-party state, and candidates standing for the National Assembly have to be members of that one single party. They are screened in advance by the party leadership. A lively election campaign nevertheless took place there a few weeks ago, and the results of that election were interesting. Approximately half of the members of the National Assembly lost their seats, including four ministers and nine assistant ministers. This, indeed, is democracy &#x00E0;<i> la</i> Africa.</p>

<p>When the Opposition express their opposition to this Bill in this House, mainly on the grounds that it would violate human rights and freedoms, I want to ask them not to back away from the circumstances, including the factual position on the continent of Africa. Do the hon. members of the Progressive Party realize that their little party would not be tolerated in those African states? Do the hon. members of the United Party realize that when they level the reproach at us that this legislation will incur for South Africa the criticism of the United Nations, the most vehement criticism will come from these very African countries, these African countries in which the rule of law concept virtually does not exist? South Africa has a democratic form of government and subscribes to the concept of the rule of law. Its legal system and judiciary are held in high esteem by world legal bodies. The South African Government sets store by to the basic human values&#x2014;freedom and justice for all. Throughout the world, however, there is overwhelming evidence of the existence of subversive organizations seeking to over throw governments by force. When a government, therefore, supplements its traditional legal rules and methods with extraordinary measures in order to prevent and eliminate subversion, this does not imply a departure from the rule of law, but rather a reinforcement of the concept. The alternative is chaos and anarchy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the implementation of the National Party Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development, the time is ripe now for these powers, under the circumstances as defined in the Bill, to be put at the disposal of the homeland governments. These powers will be no strange phenomenon. Bantu law has traditionally been vested in the headman and the chief, and, in conjunction with the tribal council, they have made far-reaching decisions on the freedoms of their subjects. Sir, the United Party&#x2019;s objection to the transfer of these powers to the homeland governments reminds me of their earlier reproaches that this Government was not in earnest about granting independence to the Bantu peoples of South Africa, but now that the policy of separate development is being applied and implemented step by step, now they are crying to high heaven that this is too dangerous and should not take place. Sir, the measures being held in prospect by this Bill are a logical step forward and I gladly support it.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Eshowe has taken us on a very interesting tour through Black Africa. Amongst other things, he has pointed out that Western democracy does not suit the Black African countries and that many of them have become one-party States, or that they started off as one-party States and have remained one-party States. Sir, I cannot help wondering whether in fact the hon. member for Eshowe approves of that form of political organization, because he is here today supporting a measure which can surely only place a powerful instrument in the hands of the homeland Governments in South Africa to become one-party States, in other words, the power to abolish Opposition parties in the different homelands of South Africa. Yet the hon. member is apparently supporting such a measure. He must surely realize that there <span class="col_5885-5886" refersTo="page_0633"/>is a very considerable difference between the Black States of the rest of Africa and the homelands in South Africa in that those homelands are part and parcel of a modern industrial State, which few other Black States in Africa in fact are, and also, of course, that many millions of Africans living in the homelands have had considerable experience of living and working in a White industrial community and understand and appreciate the benefits of Western democracy. I do not believe for one moment that there is a close analogy between the Africans living in South Africa and the Africans living in the rest of Black African. In this connection, Sir, we must not forget that the hon. the Minister consider every African living in Soweto or Langa or Guguletu to be a homeland citizen. I do not consider that those people can be compared in any way with the peoples of the rest of Black Africa, many of whom have had very little experience of living in a modern industrial economy and have little experience of Western democracy in practice.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to take up one point with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, the chief spokesman on this Bill, for the United Party who has announced that his party will oppose this Bill. He said that in 1960 the United Party had supported a similar measure, or rather a measure giving similar powers to this Government, when it supported the Unlawful Organizations Act. He explained that the United Party had done so because the country was in a declared state of emergency.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>The situation was similar to a state of emergency.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But it was not declared to be a state of emergency? I think that it was, after Sharpeville. Any way, we will not argue about that because I am strengthening the hon. member&#x2019;s case in fact; I am not weakening it. By the way, the hon. member also said, somewhat darkly, that the United Party had supported this measure, &#x201C;unlike other members in this House&#x201D;. He was, of course, referring to the then Progressive Party M.P.s who opposed that measure in 1960. Sir, I want to point out to the hon. member that one of the good reasons for our opposing that measure, apart from the fact that we do not believe in these banning powers&#x2014;we do not think that that is the way to deal with the situation&#x2014;was the fact that the Unlawful Organizations Act was not passed as an emergency measure which was going to disappear as soon as the emergency had passed. The Unlawful Organizations Act became a permanent part of our legislation, and that too was another very good reason why we opposed the Bill at that time. [Interjection.] I am not very interested in that past history; I am only pleased that the United Party is in fact opposing the Bill that we are debating today. I find it another sign of braver and more enlightened thinking on the part of the United Party, and I think that this is to be welcomed. There was a time, after all, in the not too distant past when such opposition to a Bill of this nature may not have been forthcoming. Sir, the hon. member for Sandton made a vehement speech here the other night about the fact that the United Party has unerringly adhered to the rule of law. That hon. member is new in this House; if I had the time and the opportunity I could give him a very interesting list of legislation which goes contrary to the rule of law and which the United Party did not oppose.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir. The hon. the Minister gave us very little information on the two principal clauses of this Bill when he introduced this measure last week. I refer to clauses 1 and 10. He spent a couple of minutes only on these <span class="col_5887-5888" refersTo="page_0634"/>far-reaching powers to ban organizations, to banish persons and to inhibit the freedom of speech and of publication, which powers he is proposing to give initially to the Transkeian Assembly and to extend to the other homeland Governments in due course. This is what the hon. the Minister said on clauses 1 and 10 when he introduced the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek het versoeke van sekere tuislandregerings ontvang dat hulle in staat gestel moet word om, waar nodig, op te tree teen organisasies wat gevaar inhou vir openbare veiligheid, openbare vrede, orde en goeie administrasie.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is met al die tuislandregerings oorleg gepleeg oor nie net sekere klousules nie, maar oor die hele wetsontwerp.</block>

<p>Sir, that is what he told us during the Second Reading debate. Of course, the second quotation brings us immediately to the dilemma with which we are often faced in dealing with this hon. Minister who tells us that he has consulted all the African leaders, and that dilemma is this: What in fact does consultation mean if the views of the people with whom he consults are never really taken into consideration thereafter? That is really the dilemma with which we are faced. I have here a series of cuttings which express the views of most of the homeland leaders on these proposed powers. Chief Gatsha Buthelezi said that the Zulu Government had not requested powers to ban people and that presumably these powers would only be used by those Governments which requested them. He said that the Minister had created the impression that all homeland leaders had asked for these powers to ban. &#x201C;We do not want this power&#x201D;, said Chief Gatsha Buthelezi. Chief Cedric Phatudi of Lebowa said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We did not ask for them. We have no need of them in Lebowa.</block>

<p>Then there is Prof. Hudson Ntsanwisi of Gazankulu who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We did not ask for those powers. I do not think we shall have need of them. There is no subversion in Gazankulu.</block>

<p>And then there is Chief Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We did not ask for them, but the Bill was sent to my Cabinet for comment. We had no option but to let it go through, but I think it should be discussed extensively by all the homeland leaders.</block>

<p>Sir, that is what they have said. I do not know what Chief Mphephu of the Venda Government thinks about this Bill, and I do not know what Chief Wessels Mota of the Basotho Qwaqwa Government thinks of the Bill. Chief Matanzima of the Transkei adopted an attitude which I can only describe as somewhat ambiguous. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We did not ask for banning powers. We only asked for the same security powers as the Republican Government has.</block>

<p>Well, I dare say he does not apparently realize that the security powers that the Government has in the Republic certainly include powers to ban. However, as I say, his attitude is somewhat ambiguous because it is perfectly true that Mr. George Matanzima, the Minister of Justice in the Transkei, last November introduced a motion in the Transkeian Assembly which asked for the Transkeian Government to consider the advisability of requesting the Republican Government to amend the Transkei Constitution Act, No. 48 of 1963, appropriately at its earliest convenience to enable the Transkeian Legislative Assembly to pass legislation for the maintenance of law and order and the combating of subversion. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister was perhaps referring to that when he gave the impression that he had got the concurrence, as he said, of the homeland leaders. Now, that motion was debated in November in the Transkeian Assembly&#x2014;I have a copy of the Hansard here&#x2014;and it was passed without being voted against. However, Mr. Knowledge Guzana, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Transkei Assembly, made it very clear that he and his party were against the motion. He actually said that what ought to be discussed was the introduction of a Bill of Rights which would protect the rights of all individuals against the powers of the State. He went on to say&#x2014;and I believe this is probably the best argument against this Bill, an argument which, as I say, the hon. member for Eshowe seems to have ignored in his discussion in regard to a <span class="col_5889-5890" refersTo="page_0635"/>one-party State&#x2014;that there was the danger that political parties in power confuse their existence as political parties with the State, with the result that the State is now the political party in power and any law which is passed seeking to protect the party in power rather than to protect the State should of course be looked at very carefully. He also said that disorder may well be confused with genuine political opposition and vice versa. And how true that is, Sir, that any political opposition might be construed as subversion and action is taken by the party in power in order to preserve its exclusive powers. The one homelands leader who unequivocally supported this piece of legislation was Chief Sebe, the Chief Minister of the Ciskei. He said that the proposals embodied in this Bill were &#x201C;precautionary powers needed by every developing nation in the world&#x201D;. That was the only unequivocal support for the proposals which we are considering today. The reason for Chief Sebe&#x2019;s attitude became a little clearer to me last week when I heard of the banning, or rather the banishment, under the Bantu Administration Act of 1927, by the State President&#x2014;in future, of course, these powers will be exercised by the Minister&#x2014;presumably at the request of the Ciskeian Government, of a prominent member of the opposition Ciskei National Party. He is an executive member of that party, an attorney by the name of Mr. Mtshizana. This man, a prominent attorney, has been removed from Mdantsane where he practised law. He has been bundled off to the district of Herschel where, apparently, he is now going to stay for a number of years. I have had communications with the hon. the Minister about this man. I very much hope that in the course of his reply to this debate he will give us some reason for acceding to the request of the Ciskei Government. Of course, these powers are now going to be handed over to the Ciskei Government so that they may banish or ban or restrict members of the opposition party at will, although the hon. the Minister in terms of the Bill must approve of the powers which are utilized under clause 1 or clause 10 of the Bill.</p>

<p>I may say that Chief Matanzima, who is supposed to have supported, at any rate partially, the proposals in this Bill, has already announced that he is shocked at the banning and deportation of this man, and has refused to co-operate with the Ciskei Government in this case. There is of course a good reason for the Ciskeian Government&#x2019;s support of this Bill. When you want to ban members of opposition parties, this is a very useful power to have. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister is going to tell us that the Ciskeian Government has strongly supported him in this regard. But I have to emphasize again that it is only the Ciskeian Government which has supported these proposals. The Transkeian Assembly has equivocally supported them, but not one of the other homeland leaders has supported this measure. On the contrary, they are strongly opposed to it.</p>

<p>I want to know why, since the hon. the Minister has given us no reasons whatever, he thinks fit to impose what I believe is one of the worst manifestations of the rule of this Government on the Bantustans. I refer to the exercise of vast arbitrary powers. Why does he think it necessary to do this? Instead, he should be giving them the best of Western civilization. That is what he should be giving to the Transkeian and other assemblies. One of the hallmarks of Western civilization is <i>habeas corpus,</i> which is really the fundamental protection of the individual against the might of the State. That is what he is taking away, by giving these powers to the Government, first of the Transkei, and subsequently to the Governments of the other homelands. I must point out that the Transkei already has vast powers in the form of Proclamation 400. Under this proclamation dozens of people have been punished without trial since its inception in 1960. The powers given under Proclamation 400 which, I may say, was meant to be an emergency regulation and which has been operating for nearly 15 years, include banishment, banning and restrictions of all kinds. Under the proclamation all meetings are unlawful unless they are authorized by the Bantu Commissioner, with the exception, of course, of church services, funerals, meetings of statutory bodies and <i>bona fide</i> sports organizations. There are powers to prohibit entry into any area and there are powers to prohibit departure from any area. The section which deals with subversive statements is very widely defined indeed. Any chief, I might mention, authorized by the Minister, can order any African to move with members of his household, his livestock and movable property from a place within the area of jurisdiction of such chief to any other place specified by such chief within such area either permanently or for a specified period. He can order the demolition of any hut or <span class="col_5891-5892" refersTo="page_0636"/>dwelling owned by such African without incurring any liability for compensation. He can impose fines of up to R100 or four head of large stock or 20 head of small stock or up to three months&#x2019; imprisonment. All these are powers already applied in the Transkei in terms of Proclamation 400. The hon. the Minister may prohibit anyone from entering into, remaining in or departing from the Transkei. We must realize that these powers are being used. According to a reply which I received from the hon. the Minister during this session, 27 people are at present affected by Proclamation 400 as a result of action of chiefs. Because of police action, 30 people are at present in detention, some of them for a considerable time in solitary confinement, in terms of the same proclamation. There we have these powers. I must mention that there is another arbitrary power which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been withdrawn. That is the power which is exercised in a very limited area in KwaZulu in terms of Proclamation 103 of 1973. This proclamation is in force in the area of Msinga in which some lawless characters were apparently living at the time, but the powers given by this proclamation have in fact not been used.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has given us no good reason for introducing this Bill. I believe it is a Bill which gives vast arbitrary powers to the homeland Governments and it is the sort of measure, as I said originally, which is very likely to lead to the formation of one-party States in these homelands. I do not think that that is the sort of thing which a Western democracy like South Africa ought to be encouraging in the homelands. From time immemorial, unlike others in this House that I could mention, my party, or I on behalf of my party, have been objecting to any legislation which contained provisions that allowed for any form of arbitrary restriction or punishment without success, but I have tried. And so, Sir. I wish to move the strongest objection that I can move in this House on behalf of my party&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as this Bill is concerned, I should like to concentrate on the clauses mentioned, namely clauses I and 10. I do wish to say, however, that I shall try to do so in a spirit of responsibility. I have on various occasions expressed myself against the type of petty politicking one sometimes finds in this House. In this respect I must express my own personal disappointment that we have had another example of it this afternoon.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I should like to deal with what the hon. member for Eshowe said by just pointing out that we have introduced the Westminster model of parliamentary government to the homelands. In other words, it is pointless for us to refer to what has occurred in other parts of Africa, because when we adopted the policy of political emancipation of the Bantu homelands, we adopted the Westminster model. This is also apparent from the fact that we allow political parties there, the fact that we have introduced a common franchise, the fact that we introduced a parliamentary institution and from the whole way in which government in the Bantu homelands is run. If we want to be faithful to the objectives we have set ourselves in regard to the political development of the Bantu homelands, it is entirely irrelevant for us to point out that in other parts of Africa there has been deviation from the Westminster pattern and from the rule of law. We are bound to apply, as far as we are able, those principles which we also accept for ourselves as being the best, in the homelands, too, while they are still subject to our authority. I shall come back to this later in passing. I want to say that there is surely no single person in this House who regards these powers mentioned in clauses 1 and 10 as being normal. It is obvious that the powers for which provision is being made here, are abnormal and are intended to be used only under abnormal circumstances. In other words, this is not a normal part of the legislative process or of the powers one exercises in times of peace. In that respect I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said, namely that when there are special circumstances, such as a state of emergency or something of the sort, in the nature of the matter the State has the right to make use of extraordinary measures. However, when conditions are normal and appear to be in order, then, in terms of our view of our democratic way of life, it is only right and good for us to use the ordinary machinery of the State and its ordinary powers. In other words, in assessing these two clauses, we have to apply certain criteria, namely: is it necessary, is it desirable, and, further, <span class="col_5893-5894" refersTo="page_0637"/>what are the possible repercussions and implications going to be?</p>

<p>I should also like to have dealt with other clauses in the Bill, more specifically clauses 3, 7 and 9, but I fear that that will not be possible today. I do, however, want to say on this occasion that I have serious misgivings, bearing in mind the demands of a workable constitutional model, about the possibility that legislation which may be adopted by legislative institutions in the homelands, may also be made applicable to the citizens living outside those homelands. I want to say in all honesty that in my opinion this will be a constitutional monstrosity that really would not stand the test either of logic, or of reality. Perhaps I shall be able to dwell on this matter at greater length on a later occasion.</p>

<p>It is clear to me that, as the hon. the Minister, too, clearly stated, the provisions of clauses 1 and 10 should be seen against the general background of the Government&#x2019;s policy of transferring powers and authorities to homeland governments. I am not opposed to the devolution of power. In point of fact, it is very clear that the devolution of power to the organs of communities forms a major part of the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy as well. However, the question that occurs to me is: what powers should be transferred, within what framework and at what stage? When a homeland, in accordance with Government policy and the policy of constitutional emancipation, has achieved full sovereign and political independence, such a homeland government would naturally have the power to take all such steps as it may consider advisable to maintain domestic order, security and peace, and such a government would also, as an independent government, have the power to place any such restrictions on the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual as it thinks fit. This is surely quite obvious, but at the same time it seems to me that in that process of emancipation, our objective should be the promotion of a political set-up in which some of the basic principles of our Western way of life and of our democratic form of government will apply. In other words, I do not think that it is our task to be instrumental in the creation of a political set-up in conflict with the basic principles of that democratic way of life, a way of life which all of us in this House subscribe to, even though only in theory. We cannot be instrumental in the creation of a political set-up which conflicts fundamentally with those principles, because then we would not only be unfaithful to the principles I have just stated, as principles which have guided us on the path of the constitutional development of the homelands, but we would also be giving them a heritage we ought not to give them. This, in all humility, is a responsibility we carry in this regard. If they want to do it themselves, it is their affair.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>It is their right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and their right. The day they are independent, it is their task and their right, but as long as they are not independent, the responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in that aera, as well as the introduction of a specific form of government to that area, rests squarely on our shoulders. This is not a responsibility we can delegate or which we can renounce. We should not be a party to doing so either. Consequently it is no argument to state that a homeland government asked for these powers. In fact it transpires that not all the homeland governments made this request, but even though this were the case, it would still be my contention that the mere fact that such a request was made, does not give us the freedom to deviate from the fundamental principles of the political set-up we want to create in the homelands. Surely that is very clear. As indicated earlier, there have also been a number of other requests addressed to us by homeland governments to which, under the then prevailing circumstances, we have considered it inadvisable to accede. The mere fact of the request does not provide sufficient justification. I have already pointed out that we are inclined to regard the dictatorial tendencies&#x2014;I refer again to what the hon. member for Eshowe and others have said&#x2014;that occur in other African states, as something which we can in fact accept as being their choice, although it differs fundamentally from our own principles. We often refer very critically to these things and say that it is evidence not only of the fact that the Black man cannot accept the Westminster system, but also that he himself is unable to govern effectively because he is unable to display the necessary respect for human integrity. In all honesty, we cannot take upon ourselves the responsibility of conferring those powers at a stage at which it is still our <span class="col_5895-5896" refersTo="page_0638"/>task to exercise authority over those areas. In other words, I do not think that we should expose ourselves to the accusation that in emancipating the homelands we have assisted in placing them on that road.</p>

<p>Now we may continue. I do want to repeat what has been said here, namely that it is quite clear from these clauses that in spite of these powers, all the powers possessed by the Government of the Republic continue to exist. In other words, there is no curtailment of those powers. The Suppression of Communism Act, the Affected Organizations Act, the Unlawful Orangizations Act and the Riotous Assemblies Act continue to apply. Now I ask the question: Why is it still necessary to make provision for these powers, parallel to those ones, to be conferred to the homeland governments?</p>

<p>Apart from those powers, there are other extremely comprehensive powers possessed by the State to maintain law and order in the homelands. I refer, <i>inter alia,</i> to section 1 of Act 38 of 1927, in terms of which the State President is the Supreme Chief of all the Bantu in South Africa. As Supreme Chief, the State President has all the powers and authorities vested in him under the Natal Statute Book of Bantu Law. Those authorities include, <i>inter alia,</i> that as Supreme Chief he can detain any Bantu without a warrant for a period of three months. But in addition, in terms of section 24 of the Bantu Administration Act, the State President has the authority to amend the Statute Book of Bantu Law as he sees fit. In other words, the State President, as Supreme Chief of the Bantu, can arrogate to himself all the authorities to be exercised over the Bantu in South Africa as he sees fit.</p>

<p>Equally wide-ranging are the powers vested in the State President under section 25 of the Bantu Administration Act, viz. the well-known power of proclamation. In terms of that power the State President, by way of proclamation in the <i>Gazette,</i> may do anything which this parliament is empowered to do. He can make or amend laws. He can repeal or amend any law of this Parliament applying to the Bantu areas. He can do with them what he likes. The only restriction is that he may not repeal or amend the authorizing provision in section 25 itself. As far as the Bantu areas are concerned, therefore, he has virtually full dictatorial powers, if one wants to put it like that. He is entirely untrammelled in the exercising of his power of proclamation with regard to the Bantu homelands. As we have already seen, he has already exercised those powers on a number of occasions, with the very object of achieving the aims envisaged by these clauses. I refer, for example, to proclamation 67 of 1958, under which the ANC was declared a prohibited organization in areas specified by the Minister. This was before the Unlawful Orangizations Act was adopted. Action was taken at the time against the ANC in areas specified by the Minister in terms of his power of proclamation. As you know, Mr. Speaker, that proclamation was immediately applied in certain areas in the Republic, or the Union, as it then was. Later it became superfluous when the Unlawful Organizations Act was adopted. I refer, too, to Proclamation 268 of 1968, in terms of which a gathering of more than 10 Bantu in a homeland could be prohibited if such a gathering was held without prior approval, unless such a gathering involved only an official, domestic or social purpose. In other words, under this proclamation, a political gathering of more than 10 people cannot take place in those areas without prior approval. The approval of either the Secretary of Bantu Administration and Development, or the Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner or the Bantu Affairs Commissioner concerned, is required, after consultation with the chief or headman of the area. In this regard I also refer to the judgment in the case of the <i>State</i> v. <i>Mkize</i> of 1965, in which these powers were discussed. I refer, too, to proclamation 52 of 1958, as amended by proclamation 138 of 1959 and proclamation 109 of 1960 in which provision is made that for periods of six months each, in areas specified by the Minister, it is an offence, <i>inter alia,</i> for any Bantu who is not an inhabitant of the area where those regulations apply, to be or to live in that area without permission from the Bantu Affairs Commissioner. There is also a further provision that a Bantu inhabitant of such an area may not leave that area without a permit, except for the purpose of attending a court, visiting Government offices or receiving medical treatment. In terms of this proclamation it is also a criminal offence for any person to make any statement, verbally or in writing, which is intended or which is likely to have the effect of subverting the authority of the State or specific officials or which threatens any person with subjection to boycott, violence, loss, other <span class="col_5897-5898" refersTo="page_0639"/>disadvantage or inconvenience if such a person were to act in obedience to the State or to an official of the State. Proclamation 400 of 1960 has already been referred to in this regard. I quote this merely to indicate that all these things may in any event be done under the power of proclamation of the State President. I therefore do not consider it to be necessary now for all these powers to be specially conferred on the homeland governments under these circumstances. There are other powers, too, but I am not going to weary you further with them. I refer you, for example, to section 8 of the Statute Book of Bantu Law and also to section 5(l)(b) of Act 38 of 1927, namely the Bantu Administration Act, which we also quoted here on a previous occasion and which also provides for the removal of Bantu from one area to another. It is in the light of these considerations that I want to say, in all honesty, that in terms of the necessity for this kind of step, I simply fail to understand why we should come up with measures of this kind at this stage, because all possible powers to maintain peace and order effectively in those homelands already exist, without us having to expose ourselves to the accusation that we are placing these homelands on a constitutional road which we cannot reconcile with our consciences and with the framework of the principles of our policy. In fact, these powers under clauses 1 and 10 go much further than those in our existing legislation, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has indicated. In this regard I want to concentrate on clause 10 in particular, merely to prevent my having to refer continually to the two pieces of legislation, viz. the one that applies to the Transkei and the other that applies to the other homelands. But as far as the Transkei is concerned, with reference to clause 1, I do want to put a question. We have been given an indication here that the Transkei will probably be independent by 1976 and that steps are already being taken which will lead to that independence. In the light, therefore, of the powers that already exist and to which I have referred, I want to put this question: Why, at this stage, confer these exceptional powers under clause 1 on the Transkei? Is it in fact true&#x2014;I find it difficult to believe; I do not think it is true&#x2014;that a state of emergency prevails in the Transkei; or is it true that a serious state of emergency is perhaps expected in the Transkei within the next two years and that it is for that reason that these powers are being conferred on the Transkeian Government at this stage? I am not aware of the existence of such a state of emergency or of a threat that such a state of emergency is going to develop. In that sense I find it inconceivable that at this stage, on the eve of the independence of the Transkei, one can confer these powers on the Transkeian Government. Sir, I also want to refer to two differences between clause 10 and clause 1. In clause 1, specific reference is made to the fact that the powers conferred in terms of clause 1 may only be applied in those areas or districts over which the Transkeian Legislative Assembly has jurisdiction, while in clause 10 there is no reference to areas.</p>

<p>Later, in the Committee Stage, I shall move that this matter be rectified.

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this regard I should like to dwell for a moment on what the hon. member for Vereeniging said here, namely that when we oppose these powers, these truly Draconian powers, it testifies to a lack of confidence in the homeland governments.

<p>The fact that they asked for them means nothing. I should prefer to say that conferring these powers on them could be interpreted as an act of no confidence, because we are implying thereby that they are unable to maintain their position by democratic means. This is also particularly clear from the fact that the South African legislation will continue to exist parallel to this. In other words, if this were an act of confidence&#x2014;I do not think it is&#x2014;then we should surely be able to say: &#x201C;Look, we are conferring these powers on those people without retaining our own powers in terms of Bantu citizens in the homelands.&#x201D; Sir, it could also be interpreted as an act of no confidence owing to the provision in subclause (2) of each of these clauses, that these powers may not be exercized without the prior approval of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Sir, when we talk about confidence and lack of confidence, then we can quote various arguments and say that this is evidence of confidence or that that is evidence of no confidence; but that gets us nowhere. It could even be said that these clauses &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>No, let me rather continue. It could even be said that these clauses imply the admission that the policy of separate homeland development has not succeeded, because the philosophic basis of the homeland policy, as is often stated, is the recognition of the diversity of nations, and each of these nations, so it is said, has the opportunity of full political realization of all its aspirations in the various Bantu homelands. In other words, this is a method by which they can be freed of all the frustrations they would supposely be subject to if they were to remain in the rest of South Africa and be subject to the authority of a White Parliament. In other words, those Bantu homelands would, generally stated, be uni-national, and what we are really doing here is saying to the Legislative Assemblies: You may now exercise these powers in regard to members of your own people. This, I just want to repeat, could be implicitly interpreted as being, in fact, a recognition on our part that this Bantu homeland policy has not succeeded. I say that this is not so, but this is the inference that could be drawn from that.</p>

<p>I just want to say, referring to this provision, the prior approval of the Minister, that we shall propose in the Committee Stage that the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; be replaced by the term &#x201C;State President&#x201D; because we feel that in any event, the Minister should not be placed in the position of having these powers. I shall elaborate on this point, because I do not want this Government and the Minister to become involved in the politics, the party-political differences, of the homelands. If he is in the position of having to give prior approval for the exercising of these powers, the situation could arise that he could be accused of interfering in the domestic or internal affairs of the Bantu homelands. [Interjections.] Now, it could be said that in this way unnecessary friction could possibly develop between the Minister and these developed Bantu states. I am not here to protect the Minister, but it seems to me that the Minister should not put himself in a position where he can be accused of these things. Under these circumstances there is a further factor of vital importance. If we want to cause the homeland development there to be acceptable, particularly to the thinking Bantu, and if we want to hold out the development in the homeland to the Bantu beyond its borders as something that corresponds with their own sophisticated way of life and values, then I repeat that we are doing an injustice to the policy itself by conferring these powers on those legislative assemblies at this stage, because I cannot see the Bantu being prepared seriously to acknowledge this development as their own if they know that this could possibly occur there.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I learnt a great deal from it. I learnt from it, amongst other things, that everything the hon. member said was quite correct. But, unfortunately, what he said is not really relevant in a debate such as this one. I shall tell you why not. There are two clauses in respect of which hon. members on the opposite side differ with us. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana stated the old familiar standpoint of the United Party in order to indicate under which circumstances they would be prepared to use or implement powers such as the ones embodied in this legislation. As far as the United Party is concerned, I want to say that we are familiar with that standpoint, but the hon. member and the hon. Senator Crook should go and compare notes on the question of whether we do in fact have a grave state of affairs making it necessary for us to transfer powers of this nature to the homeland governments. Last week the hon. Senator argued quite differently in the Other Place from the way in which the hon. member argued here. According to that hon. Senator the position is grave, and according to this hon. member the position is not grave. This means only one thing, and that is that we on this side of the House, the people outside as well as the Bantu homeland leaders cannot pay any attention to people who come along and state such divergent standpoints in this Parliament. This also means, therefore, that the argument the hon. member advanced here does not hold any water at all. Even in their own ranks it has no substance. This also applies to all the arguments the hon. member for Edenvale advanced.</p>

<p>The big question which hon. members opposite are putting to us, is why we are introducing another law in this regard. The hon. member for Houghton referred to Proclamation No. 400, and the hon. member for Edenvale displayed all his academic knowledge and recited all the proclamations in terms of which action may be taken. That is correct; the State President may do as he pleases in those territories. But the hon. member once again stopped short at a certain stage, without giving any thought to the fact that we in this House have made laws in connection with the constitutions of the respective Bantu homelands. If we want to be honest, not only towards the Bantu as such but also towards the Whites in South Africa, we should come back to this House when we propose any amendment in respect of the powers contained in the constitutions of the various Bantu homelands. That is the only reason why we come back to this House, i.e. to have a debate here on how we are going to effect changes to the constitution of an existing legislative assembly or people or state&#x2014;whatever we want to call it. This is the right we should give the White voter, and this is the right we should also give to the homeland authorities, i.e. that matters of that nature will be debated here. For that reason the argument advanced by the hon. member for Edenvale is absolutely worthless. It was academically correct but politically quite irrelevant.</p>

<p>The second question that was asked was why we were now granting these powers to the Bantu homeland authorities. The hon. member for Houghton expressed misgivings about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s method of consultation. I do not want to revert to the question of whether it is desirable for us to get all the Bantu homeland authorities to request this, but I do want to say that the department has a specific method. All the Bantu homeland governments were consulted. Whether all of them reacted to it is another matter. The fact of the matter is that not one of these Bantu homeland authorities adopted a negative attitude while the official liaison was taking place, i.e. when they were requested to comment on this particular Bill. Everyone adopted a positive attitude, whether actively or passively. Those who participated actively, such as the chief minister of the Ciskei, said so explicitly. The other chief ministers or their legislative authorities preferred not to comment. What is interesting is that certain of the homeland leaders reacted in a way which might probably be interpreted negatively, and this they did long after these matters had been settled by the homeland authorities and after certain people had said certain things. The fact of the matter is that some of these people asked for this step to be taken. The department and the Minister considered this step and after that they prepared legislation. The third step was to submit the legislation to the legislative assemblies in question. Not one of the legislative assemblies adopted a negative attitude towards it.</p>

<p>Let us now tell one another today, in all seriousness, why the step was deemed necessary. I have already pointed out that we are introducing the legislation because it <span class="col_5903-5904" refersTo="page_0642"/>affects the constitutions of various Bantu homeland areas, and because we want to do so through Parliament and do not simply want to make it applicable by proclamation of the State President, or whatever the case may be. I wonder what kind of howling we would have heard if we had used the powers of the State President to transfer this type of measure to the homeland authorities. We must also ask ourselves what we should like to see in the Bantu homeland areas. Not one of the hon. members sitting in this House wants to see a state of chaos in the homeland areas. Not one of us wants to see these governments in the homeland areas not being opposed by a lawful opposition. We are all agreed on that. The argument of a one-party state is not relevant here at all, for the National Party is not a party which can be reconciled with the standpoint of a one-party state. In any event, it is not our fault that we were returned to this House with such a large majority that it seems as if we are a one-party state. It can be ascribed to the weakness of the Opposition. We should like to ensure that the Bantu homeland authorities are not merely afforded the opportunity of getting desperately needed practice under the wary eye under the existing structure of the Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development; we also want them to get practice at being able to identify, to take action and, especially, to take preventative action. If there is something we can really transfer to the Bantu authorities, it is the concept of taking preventive action, since it is always better to take preventive action than to take action after the event. I see the hon. member for Mooi River is smiling. He and I know what we are talking about, but there are other hon. members who do not agree with us. It is absolutely essential that the Bantu homeland authorities, too, be given the right to take preventive action.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>We take preventive action and we are granting them the right to take preventive action, or does the hon. member want to see chaos before they are granted the right to be able to take preventive action? That is why the whole argument advanced by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana falls through, except for the fact that he and the hon. Senator must go and compare notes after what has been said today. If they should do so, the Committee Stage could perhaps be shortened considerable. We must transfer to these people the powers enabling them to take preventive action, and we must afford them the opportunity of getting practice in this process. Neither the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development nor any Minister of any Government department is interested in seeing these powers used for establishing a one-party state in the Bantu homelands, and the hon. members ought to accept it as such. Our concern is purely with one matter, and that is that the powers we want to transfer have to ensure that the homeland governments can continue with their lawful opposition and, at the same time, prevent all kinds of subversive elements being introduced in this process, elements which can create chaos in the homelands, for not one of us is interested in that. For that reason I think that the arguments advanced by the hon. members completely miss the crux of the matter. I think the hon. member for Edenvale, in particular, was very wide of the mark with his argument. We must come back to this one single matter, i.e. the question whether we want to see law and order prevailing in the homelands and whether we want to provide the necessary powers to take preventive action so that it may not be necessary to have to act later on by way of a kind of after thought.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman.

<p>What is more important than this request?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>One thinks, for example, of the requests which came from the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, to which we shall come back later. And of all those requests it is this very request which is so freely being granted by the hon. the Minister and that side of the House. I must honestly say that this is the first time I have seen those hon. members coming forward so freely and saying, &#x201C;We are giving it because they requested it.&#x201D; The real point I am trying to make is that it makes no difference what kind of petty politicking is in progress here; in the final analysis it amounts to the fact that we have a typical case here of mountain fires being extinguished without firebreaks having been cleared. What I actually mean by that is that it is generally accepted in political science, in political philosophy, etc., that the State and its subjects stand in and inverse relationship to each other as regards the proportion which the measure of coercive power applied in that society bears to the voluntary co-operation the State can count on from its subjects. In other words the more coercive powers the State uses in society, the less one is in a position to know whether one can count on the co-operation of the subjects in that particular society. Here we have a typical instance of this. I must congratulate the hon. member for Edenvale on having pointed out the scope of the coercive instruments at the disposal of the State in connection with any action both in and outside the homelands. I can assure hon. members that history will prove that we were right. Long after the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke and I have ceased being important in South Africa, history will prove &#x2026; [Interjections.] Well, we are important enough to be in this House. History will prove that since this Government came into power, we in South Africa have increasingly lost the ability to know what the nature and scope of voluntary co-operation is on the part of subjects of the State, whether in the homelands or in the areas outside the homelands.</p>

<p>Why is this legislation necessary? This is the real question that crosses one&#x2019;s mind. I have not yet received any satisfactory answer to this from that side of the House. Why is it necessary? Is it perhaps because this Government itself is not prepared to accept responsibility for the implementation of this type of legislation in the Transkei? Is that why they are giving it to the Transkei to implement it themselves? Is this perhaps one reason why they are coming forward with this legislation? Is it perhaps because there are disturbances and dissatisfaction in those areas? The hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke referred to preventive action. The best preventive action that can be found in any society is to change the circumstances in the economic, social and educational spheres to such an extent that one can rely on the voluntary co-operation of those people. If the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke is so eager to give these powers to those people when they request them, why are they not equally willing to satisfy these people when, for example, they request more land or more money for educational purposes? Why are they not also prepared to yield when these people ask for more powers to be granted to the urban inhabitants of the homelands? For example, when these people ask for better treatment for the migratory labourers, why is this not granted as readily? It is clear to me that, if this has ever been illustrated by legislation, this type of legislation illustrates the political bankruptcy of the Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of homeland authorities, simply because they see that the policy they have been applying to the homeland authorities and the homeland areas is possibly of such a nature that the people who are in power there cannot count on the voluntary cooperation of all the people who are under their control. This is one of the most important reasons. The hon. the Minister has repeatedly said that the Tswana, the Zulu, the Venda, etc. want to be separate and that each of these peoples wants to preserve its own identity. If this is true, why is it necessary to compel them to do so? Surely they would do so voluntarily? Why is it essential for one to grant them these powers?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>That is precisely my whole point. The hon. member <span class="col_5907-5908" refersTo="page_0644"/>for Vereeniging says that we are merely granting them powers, but my question is why specifically these powers. Why not other powers? Why, for example, are they not granted powers to decide how their budget should be appropriated? Why are they not being granted powers to decide on migratory labour? Why do they not have the power to demand that people in urban areas be granted more rights? Why are these powers not granted to them? In clause 1(2) the bankruptcy of this type of legislation is depicted very clearly. On the one hand they are being granted powers of banning, but on the other hand they are being told that no decision which is taken by them and is in conflict with any decision taken by the central Parliament will carry any authority whatsoever. Here we see the paradox of the Government&#x2019;s policy splendidly depicted. On the one hand they are being told that they may ban, but on the other hand they have to remember that if they take any decision which is in conflict with the wishes of this Parliament, it will be deemed invalid. I now ask the hon. member for Vereeniging whether he would be just as prepared to submit to his caucus or to the hon. the Minister those other requests which are made to him as a member of the governing party, and to request that they be granted? As I have already said, it is very clear to me that nothing illustrates the Bankruptcy of this Government&#x2019;s homeland policy quite as strikingly as does this very type of legislation, and that is why I fully support the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s proposal in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, since I now have to reply to this debate which has, with interruptions, extended over a few days, I think it is a great pity that such a great deal has had to be said in order to achieve so little.</p>

<p>I shall prefer not to deal with the first point raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana since he took it amiss of me, this time, for not having spoken long enough. I try my best to curtail my speeches, precisely because the hon. member has complained so many times before that my speeches are too long. But now he is complaining because my speech was supposedly not long enough. The hon. member had a great deal to say about security matters, in regard to the rule of law, and soon. Fortunately there is no need for me to say a great deal about this matter, because hon. members on this side of the House have already replied adequately to the arguments on the rule of law. However, I think the hon. member will appreciate&#x2014;as a matter of fact, he said so and the hon. member for Edenvale also referred to it a moment ago&#x2014;that in a modern state and in modern times one is sometimes compelled to do certain things in time, and one is even compelled to set aside certain traditional and customary procedures. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana said himself: &#x201C;We recognize that there are times to put these principles aside.&#x201D; It is for contingencies such as these that these provisions are being included in this Bill. The hon. member said, however, that in 1974 there are no reasons for having legislation such as this. I am afraid things are not getting any easier in the world, and the society is not becoming more tranquil either. I am afraid that if any reasons, any reasons for proclamations and measures such as these, existed in our earlier history&#x2014;whether it concerns the White area or the White people, or whether it concerns the Bantu homelands and the Bantu peoples, times have not since become any easier. All the more reason exists to adopt measures such as these. When it comes to security matters such as these, one should not wait until it is too late and then try to prevent something which has already been done from happening. One should prevent it before it happens.</p>

<p>The hon. member complained that the prohibition is too wide and that even political organizations may be prohibited. Other speakers have also referred to this matter, among others the hon. member for Houghton. She complained that it will be possible to prohibit political organizations. Sir, we know&#x2014;and Africa has proved this to us up to now&#x2014;that according to the views of the Bantu peoples and leaders there is very little room for more than one party. For that reason one of the hon. members was quite correct in telling the hon. member for Houghton that in African states they will probably not allow such a small mushroom party as hers is. That would not fit in with their views. We know this; I know it too. I want to make something quite clear, and I say this for the information of our homeland leaders in South Africa in particular. I think it will be an evil, sad day when our Bantu homelands <span class="col_5909-5910" refersTo="page_0645"/>in South Africa suppress and prohibit internal, legal orderly, political opposition.</p>

<p>I am not making it easier. The hon. member did not read the Bill carefully enough. It may be that she and others perhaps think that this Bill makes this possible, but the hon. member should appreciate that there is some indemnity against such abuse.</p>

<p>In the legislation in regard to the constitutional development of the homelands we have up till now established a fairly sound link between what was called here today the Westminster model of democracy&#x2014;I call it the Western democratic system&#x2014;on the one hand and the traditional views of the Bantu peoples and the Bantu in general on the other hand. In our modern times there is a great deal from the extensive constitutional <i>repertoire,</i> if I may call it that, of the Western world the Bantu peoples may use. However, this does not mean that the Bantu may not use some aspects of their own traditions as well. That is why, in our constitutional development, an admixture is taking place between the two traditions, an admixture which has gone very well up to now, although the road has not been without difficulties. This we admit. What is of cardinal importance here, is for the Bantu people gradually to be educated to this&#x2014;and not for them to be forced into this once they have become independent&#x2014;in order to make possible this orderly revolution. For that reason this provisions has been inserted here in order to make these things possible for them. For the sake of this evolutionary method of learning, this auxiliary supervision from outside, it is however being laid down in clause 2 that they are not allowed to undertake any executive action in regard to a series of matters without the prior approval of the Minister.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely, the hon. member has already spoken in great detail; why must she maintain a running conversation from her seat as well? That is why we have specifically provided for this in this provision. I want to make it quite clear here&#x2014;this will prevent a great deal of disappointment&#x2014;that this National Party Government and I, whoever will hold this office of mine, will not allow orderly political parties which may be established in the Bantu homelands to be suppressed&#x2014;whether they are or may become opposition or governing parties. We shall not allow this clause to be used for the suppression of such political parties; this we shall not tolerate. In other words, we did not insert this provision to make it possible for Bantu governments to suppress political parties. The reason for this is that we are trying in many other ways&#x2014;this is not the only way&#x2014;to bring about successfully this admixture, as I called it, this link between the Western and the Bantu traditions. We know that to bring about this in a successful way, it is desirable and essential for them to have an opposition element represented in their legislative bodies and administrations, no matter how troublesome such and opposition may be at times; of that we even have some experience in this House. Now the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has woken up. In fact, I am glad I woke him up, because I see he is enjoying this little joke with me.</p>

<p>In subsection (2) of clause 1 we see quite clearly that the Government of the Republic has not been eliminated on the application of this provision by Bantu governments. There are various reasons for this. One of the reasons I have explained quite fully. I said this was one of the ways in which we are able to withdraw from the Bantu homelands and, at the same time, be able to assist them in establishing an order of which we, as the joint creators, may be as proud as they. In other words, we want them to take from the Western traditions that which is essential and sound. It is also essential for the Government of the Republic to remain in the picture because we have to be able to act in a coordinating manner. As has been said here the parallel say of the Government of the Republic still exists in regard to these matters. A certain body&#x2014;and this has been entrusted to me&#x2014;will have to see to it that a Bantu Government does not take a certain course in respect of a certain Act, or that certain steps will be taken in respect of which the Government of the Republic might want to do just the opposite, or that the one wants to do something while the other one does not want to do it. Provision is therefore being made for the necessary co-ordination to take place by inserting <span class="col_5911-5912" refersTo="page_0646"/>in this subsection (2) the provision in regard to the role the Minister has to play. Then, of course, the simultaneous say is still there. It may perhaps concern security aspects, and up till now the Republic retains its responsibilities while those Bantu areas have not yet become independent. The Government of the Republic will have to act itself when certain security aspects may become involved and when such action is required. For that reason the Government of the Republic cannot forfeit that responsibility as it has already forfeited its simultaneous say in respect of other matters. Our legislation contains many examples of this. However, this is not the case in respect of the specific aspects of this matter.</p>

<p>As far as the provisions contained in clauses 1 and 10 are concerned, I want to point out that there is something many hon. members unfortunately did not take into account or overlooked. The fact remains that the whole of this legislation is purely enabling legislation.</p>

<p>This is merely a right that is being granted. There is no need for them to exercise this right if they are not in favour of it, and those who are in favour of it may exercise this right. It is not a case of a constitutional instrument, an Act, having been made for each one of these separate homelands; there is one for the Transkei and then there is another Act for the other areas in the four provinces and a third one for the areas in South-West Africa, and for that reason this provision is being inserted in the two clauses wherever it is relevant, but this is not an obligation that is being imposed on them; this is an enabling provision. If any homeland government should be opposed to this, there would be no need for it to apply it, and no one is going to penalize or take it amiss of such a homeland government. Other homeland governments who want this, are allowed to apply this and they will have to apply this in such a manner as to comply with the provisions of subsection (2), in other words, subject to the consent of the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members on that side advanced the argument that the Government of the Republic has powers as far as this matter is concerned. The hon. member for Edenvale also dealt at tedious length with this point this afternoon. He said the Government of the Republic had certain powers in this matter, and he quoted a long list of these matters. He said: &#x201C;All those powers exist; why should provision also have to be made for this power?&#x201D; Sir, I am afraid the hon. member overlooked a very cardinal point in regard to this matter. I do not believe he has kept quiet about it deliberately; I think he is an honest man; he would not have kept quiet had he thought of it. I think he merely overlooked it, just as he overlooked another minor point I shall deal with in a moment. Sir the hon. member is well acquainted with Bantu administration matters and with our policy. As a matter of fact, he assisted us initially in devising these things. Only the other day I referred to writings of his I have on my shelves which assisted us in devising this policy. He is therefore quite conversant with this policy. Sir, what is the crux of our policy? It can be spelt out in four letters: S-E-L-F.</p>

<p>Sir, the policy of the United Party, to which that hon. member now belongs, is that the joint Parliament, or the federal council, of all peoples has to enact legislation for all of them, but our policy is that it is the inherent right of a people, that it is the God-given calling of every people, to do its own work. Sir, why should we do this kind of thing for them if they can do it themselves? This concerns the security of their own people, within their own ranks, within their homelands, within their own areas where they have jurisdiction over all kinds of matters ranging from agriculture to education, and in which they probably perform some police functions themselves, in which they administer the law themselves with their own people sitting on the bench, in which they can provide for their own security themselves. This is what is involved.</p>

<p>Sir, why should the Republic of South Africa do these things when they can do it, particularly when it concerns the maintenance of law and order in a community which has to maintain itself? After all, it is so much better if one is able to maintain it oneself. What is the supreme test of civilization? The supreme test of civilization is, after all, that one is able to exercise self-restraint whenever one has to; that one is able to control oneself whenever one has to; that one does not need another person to control one, and this is what this legislation is doing among other things. The hon. member for Christiana&#x2014;I beg your pardon, Sir, I mean the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke; I have Christiana <span class="col_5913-5914" refersTo="page_0647"/>very much on my mind today, and the hon. member knows why.</p>

A State and a Government also have the extremely difficult task of taking steps in matters such as these, and this the hon. member for Umhlatuzana knows, because the other day he referred to the strain, the pressure, of the problems in the modern world, of the &#x201C;great strain of society and the skills of government&#x201D;. Those were the words the hon. member used. This measure affords these people the opportunity to learn these skills of government in an evolutionary manner so that they will also be able to deal with these strains of society.

<p>No, that is wrong. We have all those powers. I dealt with precisely this point a moment ago. We have all those powers through the State President, but they do not have them. They have to be taught to exercise those powers as well. Why should they be denied all these things until independence is granted at a given moment and the then have to exercise, carry out and do all these things of which they have acquired no experience? This measure is an education measure, a measure which introduces them to those responsibilities. As I have said, we are dealing here with matters which are really their concern only.</p>

<p>I do not know why the hon. member for Albany was so spiteful. And yet I think I do know. It was an unconscious psychological reaction which manifested itself, but I leave it at that. However, there was no need for him to act in such a derogatory way against me personally simply because I, just as he, have had no legal training. Mr. Speaker, I think you, with your legal training, would detect far more quickly that the hon. member for Albany has no legal training than would be the case with me. Furthermore, the remark that a Bill such as this has been drawn up by someone such as I, with no legal training, testifies to poor insight on his part. After all, the hon. member ought to know. I know he has had no experience in the drawing up of statutes, nor will he ever gain any. Why not? Because he will always be sitting over there. But what about all the lawyers in our Public Service? Are all of them to be treated with contempt? What about all the lawyers in our Government, here among our members, and what about the lawyers in our Cabinet? After all, I do not simply submit and introduce a Bill such as this to and in this House without our Government knowing about it. A Biff is not prepared in this way. The hon. member used a poor, I beg your pardon, Sir, a stupid argument. The confusion that prevails in the mind of the hon. member as far as these matters are concerned, he himself showed quite clearly through the remarks he made here, for example, that he does not know what the position of clause 1(2) in this Bill is, but I prefer to leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the hon. member for Sandton. I am very sorry that the hon. member for Sandton conducted himself in such cheap fashion in this House the other day. At certain places in his constituency he may create the impression of being very important by acting like a clown but in this House he will merely be laughed at The hon. member asked&#x2014;he only asked one question I need to reply to&#x2014;whether the Bantu Governments which are going to exercise the powers under clauses 1 and 2 would also be able to enact legislation for an extra-territorial purpose, in other words, for people outside their homeland. What the hon. member should do, is to look up the principal Act, the Transkei Constitution Act and the Bantu Homelands Act of 1971. He will then see that this matter is being dealt with there, because what we are doing here is simply to add one matter to their list of powers. In those principal Acts a provision had already been inserted at that time to tell them what to do extraterritorially <span class="col_5915-5916" refersTo="page_0648"/>in respect of their citizens outside, namely that they have to have the prior approval of the State President. Probably the hon. member did not read the principal Acts. He would do well to look them up again.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now come to certain matters raised by the hon. member for Houghton. I have already referred to her arguments in connection with the banning of members of political parties. She also referred to Press statements made by certain Bantu leaders. By now, after so many years in this House, the hon. member for Houghton should know and should be appreciative of the fact that I never make use of or abuse the opportunities in this House to react directly against individual Bantu leaders. If they think it is necessary to do so with regard to me, it is their personal choice. I have my own principles and I have my own methods and I am not going to discuss the reactions of individual Bantu leaders as that hon. member did here today.</p>

<p>The Transkei and Ciskei homelands both very clearly asked for measures of this nature, measures of the type which we have in this Bill. They did not draft the words of the Bill as it stands before us today, but they did ask for this type of measure. Then, after we had drafted the Bill, the draft Bill was sent to all the Bantu Governments concerned, all eight of them. We asked them for their reactions. In the case of the two who asked for it specifically, we received positive replies. In the case of Lebowa, the matter was put before the Cabinet more than once and the Cabinet did not disapprove of it at all. In other words, there was no positive reaction, but definitely also no negative reaction to this measure in their Cabinet. It was a question of &#x201C;we note it&#x201D;. In the case of the Tswana Government it was exactly the same. The draft Bill came before their Cabinet and they adopted the same attitude. In the case of the Venda Government they said they had no comment. In the case of Gazankulu, it was put to the Cabinet and they were quite satisfied with it. They expressed their approval.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not care what that hon. member thinks or dreams. I am telling her what was written to me. In the case of KwaZulu and in the case of Basotho Qwaqwa there were also no reactions forthcoming; they accepted the position as it is. That is the position in regard to these Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>The hon. member also had something to say with regard to arbitrary powers being given to the Bantu homelands. I think, however, that I replied to that point adequately in the introductory part of my reply to this debate. But we must of course remember, and that hon. member must realize, that her party does not want to allow these Bantu homelands such powers as will be given to them in terms of this Bill, or to let them exercise these powers themselves in connection with citizens of their homelands. This hon. member&#x2019;s party, however, would like to bring in here all the Bantu people whom she cannot trust with measures like these, which affect only themselves, to discuss such matters with us in Parliament where they will have the majority and where it will affect the whole of South Africa. That is the sort of logic which one gets from that hon. member and her party. With all due respect, I think that Proclamation 400, which she dealt with at length, and other proclamations in terms of which persons were banned, are not relevant here in the matters we are discussing today.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This legislation was not ready then.</p>

<p>*I have partly replied to the points raised by the hon. member for Edenvale. He made two rather contradictory remarks. He said clauses 1 and 10 were intended for abnormal circumstances and that he could appreciate that one would require powers such as these under abnormal circumstances. Furthermore, he said that we could not allow these powers to exist in a body politic we were creating, because it ran counter to our views. But we are trying to do in our own body politic&#x2014;I am trying to use the same gestures as the hon. member did, because then he will probably be better able to understand me&#x2014;those very things we do not like, but which are essential in the difficult times we come across in our body politic. I really could not appreciate the point made by the hon. member in that respect. To me it sounds quite contradictory.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. member wanted to know why they should be given parallel powers. I think I have already replied to this point when I said that we should not wait until they become independent before just granting them such powers. He wanted to know why the powers the State President and the Minister already have are not adequate. I have already replied to that when I said that the people should be taught to be able gradually to take these steps themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. member also drew my attention to a minor error that crept in when the Bill was being printed. Apparently the word &#x201C;such&#x201D; was omitted from the English text. I am grateful for the suggestion that came from the hon. member. If he wants to put this right, he can do so by moving an amendment in the Committee Stage to the effect that we should insert this word, and this we will then do. The hon. member may well do so, because then he will also be doing something positive.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the point the hon. member overlooked and in respect of which he wants to move an amendment. However, the hon. member should listen to me now.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I would rather be a teacher than a pumpkin. The hon. member said that in his opinion there is some kind of discrepancy in the wording of clauses 1 and 10 in that clause 1, which deals with the Transkei, refers to districts, while this is not the case in clause 10, which deals with the other homelands. On the face of it this seems to be the case, but I do not think the hon. member has read the Transkei Constitution Act carefully enough. I think he read it too superficially. At first I also thought the hon. member had a point, but after I had looked it up, I saw what the answer was. In the Transkei Constitution Act it is laid down that the Transkei Legislative Assembly has jurisdiction in a certain number of &#x201C;Bantu areas&#x201D;. Then a whole series of regional authority areas are mentioned. In other words, the Constitution does not mention which districts these are; it merely says &#x201C;Bantu areas&#x201D;. In the 1971 Act, which deals with the other homelands, the areas in which they have jurisdiction are mentioned. The position is that there are quite a number of White spot towns in the Transkei which are totally different from the other areas. In those towns live Bantu persons to whom these things may possibly be made applicable and who have to be protected by means of measures such as these in those White spot towns, which, strictly speaking, do not fall within the areas of jurisdiction of the Transkei Government. For that reason it is being laid down in this legislation that they are able to do these things in the districts of the towns mentioned. The purpose of this is to define more clearly the area of jurisdiction of the Transkei so that there can be no misunderstanding. It is not necessary for such an area to be defined more closely in clause 10. Apparently the hon. member wants to move an amendment to have this inserted in clause 10. The hon. member was kind enough to let me know about the amendment. I want to tell the hon. member that although such an amendment would not be misplaced, it would be quite unnecessary because, unlike the case of clause 1 regarding the Transkei, it is not essential in the case of clause 10.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, this is the equivalent of the area of jurisdiction over which the legislative assembly is able to exercise its authority?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as I told the hon. member a moment ago. I explained why these words were being inserted in clause 1, i.e. because the position in respect of the Transkei differs from the other homeland areas. I have already told the hon. member that should the words he proposes be inserted in clause 1 in respect of the other areas, it would not be inappropriate but it would be unnecessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>You mean clause 10.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, pardon me; it is just the other way round. Clause 1 applies to the Transkei. In other words, it is really unnecessary to insert those words in respect of the other homelands in clause 10, which amends the 1971 Act. As the hon. member apparently knows, the area of the various Bantu homelands are duly defined in the proclamation. I therefore do not think there is any need for the hon. member to move that amendment of his, although he can move the amendment concerning the word &#x201C;such&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch merely tried to perform here as one would at a school debating society by asking why we are so keen in this case to agree to what is asked for by a homeland government, while in so many other cases we have not agreed. This is the kind of argument one finds in debating societies at school. This is not the kind of debate conducted in this House. If a homeland government asks for something we are able to fit in with our policy and which we can accept as something desirable, we gladly grant its request, as we have done in this case for reasons I have explained fully. To come here and ask why we cannot also agree to the request, for example, that the whole of the Transvaal be handed over to one or other Bantu homeland is a ridiculous thing for the hon. member to do. He said one should take care of the fire-belts. I have already made it clear what value subsection (2) has, in terms of which provision is, in fact, being made for a fire-belt, i.e. that the cooperation of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is required before the homelands will be in a position to take the relevant steps. I think that the whole argument of the hon. member, apart from the fact that, as I have said, it is in the style of a school debating society, is quite idealistic and theoretical.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the importance which this side of the House attaches to this debate is of course demonstrated by the participation in it not only of distinguished leading members of this side of the House who have spoken before me, but also of the national leader of our party and of those of his provincial leaders who sit in this House. The Coloured people have been a dominating topic since this Parliament assembled and it need not be stressed that the issues to be decided are urgent and essential, in the interests of all who seek justice and peace in our land. Our attitude has been clear. Our country and the security of our people come first, and our policies, dear as we hold them, must take second place to our country, because there are bigger issues involved than pure political advantage in South Africa. Not only are the people of South Africa waiting anxiously to see how the social, economic and political future of the Coloured people is to be determined, but the world outside watches with interest as well. The relationship between Coloured and White should, after all, be the easiest race question for us to resolve in South Africa. Historically this relationship is the closest between any two groups. There is common ground, based on language, religion, culture and other factors. If we, the Coloured and the White people, cannot find an accommodation acceptable to both groups, how can South Africa possibly hope to find a solution for relationships between groups which some regard as having far less in common? We have heard repeatedly from the Coloured leaders that they believe that the White people of South Africa have rejected them. If this debate is to produce nothing else, it should produce and provide an answer to this challenge. We do not reject the Coloured people; we wish to show not only our feelings and our sincerity but we hope that action resulting from this debate will demonstrate the contrary. I shall respectfully, as others have done, make certain suggestions in this regard.</p>

<p>I shall now &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; pick up my notes. [Interjections.] If we accept that the Government&#x2019;s policy is to allow all groups in South Africa to exercise sovereignty over their own affairs, the Government must tell us how the Coloured people will do this. It is not enough to talk about local self-government, of more power to the Coloured Representative Council. The question is how will the Coloured people have a say over foreign affairs, over defence, over police, over national roads, over railways, etc.? These are all matters of sovereignty. The Government has five courses open to it. Firstly, it can maintain the <i>status quo,</i> establish a fully elected Coloured Representative Council, with more powers, but give the Coloured people no say in the matters which the CRC cannot handle.</p>

This the Nationalist Party has rejected. Thirdly, they can create a Coloured homeland, an impractical solution rejected by at least the majority of the Nationalist Party, but quite clearly not by all of them.

<p>May I have injury time too, Sir?</p>

<p>If this is to be merely consultative and advisory, it will exercise no sovereignty, and if it has statutory powers binding on Parliament, then it will in fact be in line with federal thinking which the Government has rejected. In the absence, therefore, of the so-called unique, unspecified and unknown solution mentioned by the Minister of Defence, there is only one other answer, and that is the representation of the Coloured people in Parliament. The Coloured people have asked for this, and in the light of Nationalist rejection of any other realistic solution, what moral justification is there for the Government&#x2019;s refusal? Sir, the Prime Minister has indicated that this is not Nationalist policy and that it would be necessary for party congresses to change policy on this point. I do not want to comment on what his predecessor did in giving a policy lead, or on the power which we have the confidence to give to our leader on policy issues. But, Sir, there is a higher policy-making body to turn to, and that body is the people. The issue of the Coloured people, their citizenship and <span class="col_5925-5926" refersTo="page_0653"/>the exercise of sovereignty by them, was not a direct issue in the last election. In any case, Sir, if the unique solution for this issue, which the Nationalists are still looking for, was not known, how could the electorate vote on it, because you cannot vote on what is not known to you. I believe that the White electorate, if called upon crisply to decide this issue, would support the concept of representation for the Coloured people in Parliament. A call is therefore made to the Government to hold a referendum on this issue. The challenge to the Government to hold such a referendum is unanswerable. It is a test of White South Africa&#x2019;s willingness to face the challenge of tomorrow. Sir, are we going to comply with the requirements of the modern world and take this meaningful step to ensure our security? Events are moving fast and courageous action is needed. The Prime Minister has the power today to negotiate with the Coloured people for this representation in Parliament, and he can do it now without a referendum. If he wants to test White opinion, or if he wants the backing of the Whites for such an action, the door is open to him and he can do it.</p>

<p>Sir, it has been quite incorrectly stated that the presence of Coloureds in this House would not be acceptable to the United Party. Sir, U.P. policy requires the Coloured people, like all other groups, to be represented in a federal assembly. It accepts the logical conclusion that such Assembly would have to exercise meaningful sovereign powers, as otherwise the concept would be a fraud and merely disguised &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;. The policy allows for groups to come together, and our leader has said that the United Party will work to bring White and Coloured people closer together. The presence of Coloured people in Parliament would merely mean that they would form part of the regulating body which would transfer power to a federal assembly; there would therefore be no difficulty in implementing United Party policy if we came into power. But, Sir, we are not in power and we have to be realistic; we have to do everything that we can to encourage this Government to take steps in the interests of South Africa to reach an accord with the Coloured people, because South Africa&#x2019;s interests come first and not the petty political interests of any political party, whether it be the Nationalists or whether it be ourselves; South Africa comes first. The suggestion that we should wait for the Theron Commission to report is also without substance. As the Prime Minister has said, policy is not determined by a commission, and a reference to Hansard clearly shows that. Sir, time is running out, and this issue is one which must be decided by the Whites and the Coloured people now; it cannot be left to a commission to make recommendations to us. The commission can deal with the social and economic upliftment of the Coloured people; it can deal with matters of that sort, but the political decisions must be made by the Coloured people and by the White people. Sir, there is a further matter, and that is that the days of paternalism are over. This is no time for small gestures. Citizenship is a term which must not be used in a casual manner; it must be meaningful and we must know what the implications are of giving citizenship to the Coloured people. Sir, it means true equality of opportunity; it means a real effort to remove the disadvantages which history has imposed upon the Coloured people, and that is what the answer must be from this House.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF COLOURED RELATIONS AND REHOBOTH AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, whether hon. members opposite take it amiss of me or not, I am not going to discuss political policy directions. I am here to represent the administration and the running of this department. But you will forgive me, Sir, if I make one remark arising out of the speech that has just been made and about certain others last Friday, too. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, made the remark, <i>inter alia,</i> while arguing why he wanted the Government to do certain things which his party did not see its way clear to doing, and which the Progressive Party actually wanted to do, that the question of political rights was not an election issue during the election. But apparently the hon. member must have gone through the election with his eyes and ears shut tight. I also just want to refer to a statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition the other day which was repeated here this afternoon, namely that it is that party&#x2019;s standpoint that via the federal policy, the Coloureds must be accommodated politically in a federal parliament, a term which, up to a few weeks ago, hon. members opposite did not want to accept as allegedly constituting a federal parliament. But the hon. the Leader of the <span class="col_5927-5928" refersTo="page_0654"/>Opposition went further and said that since this Government was in power, and he advocated a unitary policy, the only solution was that direct representation here be given to the Coloureds. But then the hon. member went on to argue that if the two communities were to grow towards each other, they could eventually be accommodated together politically. In this connection he made this illuminating point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that this is the direction in which we should be working.</block>

<p>&#x2020;Now, if we should be working in that direction, why propagate another policy? Why propagate the federal policy? Why do you not start off immediately with this particular policy?</p>

<p>*The other day, the hon. member for Maitland said that the Coloureds did not know what the Government&#x2019;s standpoint was on their political future. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself made that remark. Now I want to tell hon. members that this is in fact a debate that concerns the administration of the department. He has already had three opportunities during this session to discuss that point with the Prime Minister. But there will be yet another opportunity this afternoon. My hon. Minister will deal with the matter here. But I want to tell this to hon. members. When they reproach us on this side, as the hon. member for Maitland did, of talking to the two million Coloureds and not with them, then I do not think that that is a valid reproach. In contrast, hon. members on this side who took part in the debate spoke very responsibly. But what is more, thanks to the machinery for consultation established over the years in terms of the policy of this side of the House, discussions from the lowest to the highest level are conducted daily between the authorities in question and Coloured leaders and Coloured authorities. In recent months the hon. the Prime Minister, together with the hon. the Minister, has conducted discussions with leaders of the various Coloured political parties and has put his standpoint to them clearly. At other levels, too, discussions take place regularly. If one looks at the past five years, at the way in which the management committees and the advisory committees have grown in numbers, to the extent that today we are almost at the point of establishing the first true Coloured municipalities, then that is surely evolution, surely discussion is taking place in an orderly manner, and surely there is progress.</p>

<p>And not only at those levels, but at other levels too, discussion is taking place, and at all levels there is opportunity for Coloured leaders for consultation, as the hon. the Prime Minister called it recently, with the Whites concerned. I could just mention for the information of hon. members opposite that as regards the composition of advisory committees, advisory councils of technical institutions, of training colleges and of special Coloured schools, the request made by the Executive of the Coloured Persons Representative Council was that the number of Coloured representatives on those specific bodies, which was two in most cases, be increased to three. I can also tell hon. members that this department has already approved the increase, not only to three, but to only one less than half. I can also point out to hon. members that in important commissions, such as the Theron Commission, Coloureds are engaged in consulting with Whites on the future of the Coloured. It has already been approved that a larger number of the members of the Council of the University of the Western Cape will consist of Coloureds. I could spend a lot of time giving the committee examples of this kind so as to point out how progress is being made under the policy of this Government by way of consultation, of dialogue.</p>

<p>In his speech the other day, the hon. member for Malmesbury, in contrast to hon. members on that side who have spoken, evinced a personal, intense interest in this matter. I am aware that the hon. member even acts as chairman of a local labour committee in his constituency and has done outstanding work in this connection. It was in the course of discussions with him in his constituency and with other gentlemen serving on the local labour committee for Coloureds that the idea occurred to me that the time had come when we could take a further step forward in this direction. Hon. members will recall that committees of this kind were introduced some time ago by the then Minister of Coloured Affairs, the present Minister of Defence. At the time, provision was made for a Cabinet committee, an inter-departmental committee and a public committee which could consider the situation over a broad field, and also for local labour committees <span class="col_5929-5930" refersTo="page_0655"/>charged, in particular with activating and motivating the Coloured so that his labour could be turned to best account in order among other things, to replace Bantu labour in the greater Western Cape.</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;That will be the day&#x201D;, but the work of those labour committees has had such success that in the case of the State and local authorities in the Western Cape, as employers, from 1962 when the committee was announced, to 1973, the number of Coloureds in the employ of bodies in the Western Cape increased by 28 764 while the number of Bantu in their employ increased only slightly. It virtually remained constant. From this it is clear&#x002D;as the hon. member for Malmesbury rightly said, that the task entrusted to those committees has been completed and that new tasks await them.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member will be quiet a little, I shall point out to him important progress in this sphere. It is clear that the Coloureds in the Western Cape are today virtually fully employed in posts the conditions of service of which are steadily improving, and that their salary structures are steadily improving. It is therefore time to give attention to the task of the local labour committees and to consider additional spheres of activity to be entered upon by institutions of this kind. Many of the committees have in the meantime ceased to function owing to the completion of their initial task, but what is important, as the hon. member for Malmesbury said, is that in the course of the deliberations of the committees, it became clear that there is a real need for contact with Coloured leaders at a local level in order to discuss problems with the White committees and resolve them locally on a mutual basis.</p>

<p>I can announce today that because the recognition of human dignity is one of the basic principles of the policy of separate development, in order to ensure, as far as possible, the peaceful co-existence of population groups with their own cultural patterns of life, it often occurs, under the pressure of a programme that is over-loaded daily, that there are disturbances at the level of local relations. A large percentage of the country&#x2019;s domestic problems can be ascribed to misunderstandings and friction in the sphere of relations between the local population groups. Bottlenecks that one often comes across at the level of personal contact, in particular, are often fastened upon as being symbolic of the South African situation or pattern of life. For that reason the department has considered it advisable to give these committees a new name and a new task in order to act as public relations committees in local communities with a multitude of tasks. These would not, in the first place, be concerned only with labour, but would be concerned with a wide variety of matters, for example the establishment of better relations between the various groups in that local community, and the advancement of especially that group among the Coloureds that has lagged behind, in other words, how they may be assisted at local level in achieving higher ideals.

<p>Mr. Chairman, what have we had from the Opposition in this important debate on the Coloureds? We have had a spectacle of pessimism and defeatism. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition took the lead with a speech larded with prophecies of doom and dangerous language. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke about crisis upon crisis, about &#x201C;catastrophe&#x201D;, &#x201C;desperation&#x201D;, &#x201C;The position is ugly&#x201D; and &#x201C;threatened violence&#x201D;. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said ugly and dangerous things, but we did not hear a word from him about the wealth of good things which the Government is doing for the Coloureds in this country. Every time the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stands up in the House, he tries to outbid the Progressive Party, and every time the bait he offers is bigger and better. The hon. member for Maitland said that he wonders what a Coloured, if he could attend the whole debate, would think of this.</p>

<p>The United Party has a poor record as far as the Coloureds are concerned. One day they want the Coloureds in this Parliament and the next day they want a federal parliament for the Coloureds. Now they are back to their old policy again. Now they come and tell us that we might as well bring the Coloureds back to this Parliament. What are they going to tell us to do about the Coloured the day after tomorrow? Probably that will only depend on which group in that party wins the marathon in-fighting in the United Party, the Young Turks or the Old Guard. Let us inspect the record of the United Party in regard to the Coloureds in this country. The United Party has fought election after election, court case after court case and they have fought through night sittings in this House to keep the Coloureds on a common voters&#x2019; roll. They did this, as they said at the time, to keep to their so-called word of honour which they had given the Coloureds. Subsequently, however, we had the biggest political somersault in the history of the country. After that bitter struggle, they threw the common voters&#x2019; roll overboard and accepted a separate voters&#x2019; roll for the Coloureds. By doing so they threw their word of honour which they had given the Coloureds, to the political winds. Now the United Party is a party without a word of honour. What right have they to expect the Coloureds to believe them again? What right have they to expect the Coloureds to trust them in this matter? Under United Party rule, the Coloured people was a forgotten population group that was lagging behind. Many lived in slum conditions and were used as voting cattle, but I do not want to go back to that old history. The road of the United Party is scattered with pieces of broken promises to the Coloureds. Under them the Coloureds were, socially and economically, a neglected population group and now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is again retreating towards that untenable situation. Once again he wants us to give the Coloureds inferior representation in this Parliament. He stated this here on Friday. We are not prepared to follow the path that leads to the downfall of both White and Coloured in this country. The National Party is engaged in seeking self-determination for the Coloureds, but progress will not be made as long as the Coloured allows himself to be influenced and as long as some of them believe in a false idea, namely that self-determination will be achieved by way of integration. The intentions of those Whites who propose integration with the Coloured, like my hon. friends of the Progressive Party on that side, are not honest, because they know that they would treat the Coloureds as third-rate integrated people.</p>

<p>They would treat the Coloureds as third-rate people with insufficient merit or money to swim in the Sea Point swimming bath. We want a better dispensation for the Coloureds than that.</p>

<p>As the Senator in charge of the interests of the Coloureds in the Free State, I was concerned with their problems for more than four years. I drove from town to town to view conditions and I addressed the children in classroom after classroom. I sat with their leaders around a table and listened to them and talked with them. What did I find? I found that the conservative, responsible Coloured had a great deal of confidence in this Government and in our Prime Minister. In the hon. Mr. Voster they see a just leader with an honest approach and they believe that he will not leave them in the lurch. They realize that their salvation lies with the Whites. They tell one frankly that they fear the day that White rule in this country founders. More than one of them told me on occasion: &#x201C;You Whites really must not leave us in the lurch.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated that the Coloured is becoming estranged from the Afrikaner. What has my <span class="col_5933-5934" refersTo="page_0657"/>experience been in this regard? The struggle and success of the Afrikaner has made a very deep impression on the mind of the Coloureds in this country. For many of them it has also become an ideal to work themselves up from an inferior position as the Afrikaner did. Nowhere did I hear that the Coloured pinned his hopes on the Opposition. The crisis speech made here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will not make an impression on them. The Coloureds with a sense of gratitude know that this Government has given them a platform on which they can put their case and that the Government has given them the opportunity to establish their own political parties and to have their own Parliament and channels of communication which serve as open doors to discuss the future and to plan the future. They know that their future in this country will depend largely on what the Nationalist Government is going to do for them. They have confidence in the Nationalist Government because they know that the Nationalist Government will create just as good a future for the Coloured as it desires for itself. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not propose, in the short time available to me, to go into the speech of the hon. member for Bloemfontein North in any depth, other than to say that as far as my recollection serves me, he represents a party which can in no wise criticise anybody else in regard to their attitude to the Coloured people. Within my own period in this place I recollect statements by the late Dr. Verwoerd and assurances that the Coloured representation which they had in this House would not be taken away. I recollect commissions or talks in the years 1967 and 1968 when the overwhelming tenor of the evidence was that those people should retain their representation in this House. I believe I am correct in saying that when that representation was finally done away with by the Nationalist Party, it was not even as a result of a reference to or decision by any of the National Party congresses.</p>

<p>What was interesting in the speech of the hon. member for Bloemfontein North is that, in my view, it typifies what has been the worst aspect of this debate, namely a total refusal by hon. members opposite to face up either to the urgency of the times or to what is demanded of a debate of this kind in this House. Where did this debate begin? It began with a speech by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, a speech of greater gravity and dignified authority than I have ever heard him make in this House, on a matter which is on the lips of every serious-minded person in South Africa today, namely that we can no longer go on with a policy and an administration in respect of the Coloured people such as we have at the present time. Indeed, nobody has pointed that out more starkly than the hon. the Minister of Defence. What did he say? He said on a number of occasions that we must seek a unique solution to this problem. What does that mean? I quite agree with the Minister to an extent. This means in respect of my party and the federal policy it stands for that he sees no answer in that regard. I do not agree with him there, but that is what he said. But it means quite equally in respect of the policy of the National Party, namely the policy of apartheid or separate development, that he sees no solution there either. If he did we would not be asked to seek a unique solution.</p>

<p>Let us come back to this debate. We have had from speaker after speaker on the Government benches reference to matters such as education, the number of teachers that are employed in Coloured education, the number of schools that have been built, the advisory committees that have been appointed, the fact that additional Coloured representation is to be placed on the council of the University of the Western Cape and so on. In normal times, these would be matters of importance to be discussed, but in our current situation they are, with respect, totally irrelevant. They are irrelevant, because the debate in the country today is not whether we are building enough schools or whether we are training enough teachers for the Coloured schools. The debate today is the destiny of the Coloured people, and the destiny of the Coloured people is not a matter for commissions of inquiry but for politicians. It is a political question and it is a matter for inquiry, discussion and debate in this House. That is what speakers on this side of the House have endeavoured to do over and over again for the last two days. But this does not constitute a debate, because however good the speeches from this side&#x2014;there have been outstanding speeches on this very subject&#x2014;the ball never gets thrown back because there is a <span class="col_5935-5936" refersTo="page_0658"/>studious refusal by hon. gentlemen opposite to come anywhere near a discussion on the destiny of the Coloured people, that is to say the political question of the day. What is the danger in this? The danger in this is that this House becomes increasingly irrelevant in that one sphere in which it should have supreme relevance. Hon. gentlemen opposite are making this House and this Parliament, in the field of the destiny of the Coloured people, irrelevant.</p>

<p>That is running away from your duty. It is shirking your responsibility. It brings about a greater danger: When once this House becomes irrelevant in an important field of public affairs, as my hon. friend for Maitland put it so graphically, the future of two million people is at stake. When once this House, in their eyes and in the eyes of others outside, allows itself to become irrelevant, other authorities might take its place. Other action might take its place, which will flow from a feeling of despair. As long as we debate it and keep the initiative in these debates here, there can be no feeling of despair outside. But if we allow it to go by default by our refusal to debate these issues, there is a danger that outside there will be a feeling of despair. From despair flows action very often that is afterwards matter to be regretted.</p>

<p>I believe that sums up fairly the total inadequacy of the debate we have had here during the last two days. It sums up that total inadequacy&#x2014;I say it again&#x2014;because of the studied refusal, which must be part of a plan, by hon. gentlemen opposite to debate the destiny of the Coloured people. There is one person who can save this debate from wreck. There is one person who can restore the relevance of this House on a matter which has reached, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said, almost crisis proportions. That is the hon. the Minister. There is one person alone who can save this debate and this House from total irrelevance, and that is the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs. I hope that when he comes in at the conclusion of this debate, he will restore some relevance to the proceedings by debating from the Government benches for the first time the destiny, as he sees it, of the Coloured people in South Africa. As I say, that is the work of politicians, of Ministers and of statesmen; it is not the work of commissions.</p>

<p>I had hoped during these ten minutes to deal with one group of Coloured people who have not so far been dealt with in this debate, and that is those who happen to live in the province which I present, Natal. However, in the few minutes that are left to me, I would like to touch merely on a number of points. Because of this refusal to deal with the political destiny of these people, there is so much greater hardship attendant upon the lives of many Coloured communities in Natal than elsewhere in South Africa. I need only mention the destiny of those who live north of the Tugela, who are still living under the cloud of uncertainty as to whether they are to continue living there or not. These communities live in settled areas, such as Sunnydale. The hon. the Minister knows the area. They are living there in terms of freehold tenure of their properties. They have to live there by permit, because their future is not settled. I refer, for instance, to the Dunn community, whose land at last is apparently to be given to them, having been promised to them since 1934. The hon. the Minister is nodding his head. I am very glad to have seen that. However, I wonder if the hon. the Minister realizes&#x2014;I believe he does&#x2014;that amongst the descendants of the Dunns there are some persons who are now registered as Whites. Are they to be permitted to inherit their land, which is rightfully theirs, simply because they carry a card different from the others in the community in which they are to live?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, having listened to the hon. member, I should like to tell him that I do not want to anticipate <span class="col_5937-5938" refersTo="page_0659"/>the hon. the Minister but there is something that is causing us on this side to wonder what is going on on that side. This is that the hon. member again came along with the point that we should decide on the political future of the Coloured today, something he could have done on three previous occasions this year. We are to react to a proposal coming from his hon. leader, while we do not understand everything it involves. Does it involve the federal policy of the United Party or does it involve something else which he said he would also accept and in the direction of which, he said, we should really be moving? [Interjections.] I should be very pleased if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would tell me which of the two apply to his party and himself. He announces one and he states that he would also accept another one and he added that we should really be moving in that direction.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the matter I was dealing with a short time ago just before my time expired. I want to tell hon. members that favourable attitudes and local human relations are not things one can provide for by means of legislation. They rest on the development of an inner attitude and form part of a process of education and evolution that necessarily demands time and patience. To that I want to add that this demands from both sides a preparedness to co-operate. It does not require that one side only should do every thing. To stimulate this process of education and evolution and place it on a more ordered basis, the intention is to establish committees at certain places in South Africa on which both Whites and Coloureds will serve and which will make it their aim to operate in spheres where friction between the two population groups may develop. The idea is that these committees, by means of regular deliberations, could collectively consider steps to eliminate cases in their midst where relationships were disturbed. The purpose of these White /Brown committees is not to serve as a platform to air grievances but to serve as a means or instrument by means of which mutual relations can be reciprocally promoted. In this field the committees are undoubtedly facing a new, important and major task.</p>

<p>These committees as far as the White representatives are concerned may comprise, for example, a representative of the municipality, divisional council or religious denomination, a headmaster or a member of a farmers&#x2019; association, welfare organization, Chamber of Commerce or Sakekamer. On the Coloured side it would perhaps be the local member of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, a member of the management committee of the local religious denomination, a local Coloured headmaster or inspector of education, a member of a welfare organization or a person doing welfare work and also, where these already exist, a member of a Chamber of Commerce or Sakekamer. These committees will be empowered to co-opt people as they see fit. The committees will be recognized by the State and the members will be ministerially appointed. These committees will operate under the control of the Department of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs. The idea is that these committees will meet quite often, at least four times annually.</p>

<p>I also want to mention the spheres of activity in which these committees will operate. Because the situation varies from town to town or from community to community, the spheres of activity in which the committees should operate cannot be clearly specified at this stage. The following matters could serve as a basis: Labour matters, wage structures, conditions of service, welfare matters, housing problems, education matters, recreational facilities, transport facilities, etc. The committees themselves should determine in which spheres of activity they should operate in local communities. With the agreement of the hon. the Minister of Justice, the magistrates of the various towns will be relied on in this regard to find suitable persons to serve on these committees and also to undertake the launching of these committees. The Department of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs is at present giving attention to aspects of detail and a further announcement relating to this matter will be made as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Sir, I listened attentively to the announcement made by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I do not think anyone could have any objections to this form of liaison. It will perhaps serve the purpose of eliminating <span class="col_5939-5940" refersTo="page_0660"/>mutual misconceptions. The question which arises, of course, is what powers such a committee has. Perhaps I could illustrate this against the background of the governing party&#x2019;s policy in respect of effective participation in political institutions by the Coloured population, and that is the policy of multiple liaison at as many levels as possible. What does this liaison amount to, Sir? In effect this liaison, too, merely amounts to precisely what the hon, the Deputy Minister has said. In other words, it is consultation; it is conducting dialogue with each other; it is an attempt to afford the Coloured population an opportunity, in so far as they are making use of this machinery, of being able to tell the real powers that be what their problems are and then to make requests and hope that something can be done about them. The real point here is effective participation. I have noticed that there is a tendency on that side of the House to draw a distinction, especially in respect of the Coloured population, between political matters on the one hand and socio-economic matters on the other, as though it would be possible for one to say to a population group. &#x201C;Now go ahead and uplift yourselves; improve your socio-economic, social and educational circumstances, but do so without effective participation in political institutions.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What is our policy?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Our policy is very clear; it is not necessary for me to repeat it now; my time is limited. Sir, surely it is very clear that this is not happening anywhere else in the world. If we look at the history of the Afrikaner in South Africa in particular, it is clear that there was a period, especially the period of urbanization and the period of the depression, when the Afrikaner undoubtedly experienced tremendous socio-economic hardships, and when he, as it were, uplifted himself by means of entering into and participating in the available political institutions of this country; the one is as closely bound up with the other as one could wish. Without that effective participation no upliftment or development can take place. Sir, this is strikingly illustrated by the very reaction of all the members of the Coloured population serving on these liaison committees, from the highest down to the lowest levels. Time and again they come back to the Government and say, &#x201C;It is no use; we must have clarity; what is the nature of the effective executive power we have on all these levels of government? If we cannot take decisions which are enforceable to the extent that they will have a real effect in changing our circumstances of life, then we are taking part in a political ritual which fulfils no function in respect of our own upliftment.&#x201D; This is actually the cul-de-sac in which we find ourselves at this stage now that we have in fact established this machinery, and now that everyone is aware of the necessity of the socio-economic upliftment of the Coloured population. I do not think there is any quarrel about that on this side of the House. This side of the House does not resent the Government for building houses and making schools available to the Coloureds; that is not the point at issue; there is unanimity on that, also as far as all other non-White population groups in South Africa are concerned. Sir, the point at issue is this: When will this population group have effective access to political decision-making? Sir, if one does not spell this out, it serves no purpose. This is not what I am saying; this is being said by all the leaders of the Coloured population who are making use of these institutions. They have been telling us this clearly. At the recent meeting of the Federal Party they themselves said that they had reached a stage where they had come to the conclusion that it no longer availed them to speak in terms of the policy of separate development; that they wanted effective participation in the institutions of power of this country, and this, Mr. Chairman, must be replied to; and why is a reply not being given? Sir, I want to suggest a possible reply. One reason why there is no reply to this from the Government side, is that there are real doubts and conflict in their own ranks. Let us not try to conceal it; it is very clear from the pronouncements we have had. That is why I cannot help agreeing with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. Especially in this debate one really gains the impression of irrelevance when listening to the reaction from that side of the House. Why? Once again because all the attention is being absorbed within their own caucus in deciding what course they want to take as far as the Coloureds are concerned. It is very clear. The hon. member for Waterberg is laughing at me. He is one of the problems in that caucus, and he knows it. Just ask the hon. member for Moorreesburg; he knows precisely what it is about. But what does it actually amount <span class="col_5941-5942" refersTo="page_0661"/>to? It means that the Coloured population and the whole of South Africa now have to sit and wait until a few verkrampte members on that side of the House have eventually seen the light and are prepared to make concessions which will strengthen the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s hand so that he may take a particular course. Sir, I just want to sound the warning that we shall find ourselves in a situation where that side of the House is still going to be debating this matter in their own ranks, at which time it will be far too late and they will be overwhelmed by circumstances which have become completely beyond their control. And now I am not speaking lightly, Sir. It is clear to me, through the limited measure of contact I have had with Coloured leaders and the Coloured youth, that there is increasing dissatisfaction, that there is a feeling that they have, as it were, become a political football in National Party quarrels, and that their future has to depend on the outcome of those quarrels. Sir, I want to make an appeal to that side of the House to settle those quarrels as soon as possible and to decide on what course to adopt, for we cannot take part here, year after year, in a Coloured debate in which nothing concrete is said in connection with the political future of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat and his party constitute the second official Opposition, and the fact that we have an official Opposition and another opposition today, as we have had to hear so many times over, is the very consequence of division on that side of the House in connection with this very important matter we are debating today. If the hon. member is waiting for division on this side, or if he wants to suggest that we are playing a waiting game so as to obtain the concurrence of certain people, he is making a very big mistake. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that, when the hon. Cape leader, the hon. the Minister of Defence, spoke about a unique solution at a youth congress, he was most decidedly not thinking of the United Party solution, for that solution has been offered to us in a great variety of forms over the years. [Interjections.] On Friday we had it once again from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that if the Government insists on rejecting the federal idea &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was their old idea, until just recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and maintaining a unitary form of Government, its only solution will be to provide direct representation for the Coloured people in this Parliament.</block>

<p>So, in one breath the hon. member abandons his old policy and says: &#x201C;If you do not agree with it and do not want to accept it, I now offer you a new policy.&#x201D; [Interjections.] It is as someone said one day, &#x201C;Those are my principles, but if you do not like them I have some others.&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville made the statement, &#x201C;We do not reject the Coloured people&#x201D;. Would he be insinuating that the Government or members on this side reject the Coloured population? If that is what he is insinuating, I say it is a very malicious insinuation. If we are seeking the solution to this population issue along the road of parallel development, separate development on the pattern of parallel development, we are definitely not rejecting the Coloured population. On the contrary; I want to tell the hon. member that this in fact pre-supposes, in respect of the Coloured population, a different situation to separate development in respect of the Bantu peoples of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana referred most respectfully to the speech of his hon. leader and the large measure of earnestness and dignity with which it was made here. He came along with the idea that &#x201C;the destiny of the Coloured people is a political question and must be discussed and decided in this House&#x201D;. I think it is only the Leader of the United Party who can announce a new policy from time to time without his consulting his congresses in advance. Where would it get us if the policy statements made here were not backed outside by the population groups concerned. The standpoint and policy of the National Party are that the congresses of the National Party decide on <span class="col_5943-5944" refersTo="page_0662"/>policy and that they give direction in determining policy.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>It was decided beforehand that this would happen, and it was debated and decided at various congresses. [Interjections.] I can tell the hon. member that it was decided at various congresses, and earlier requests of this nature had been addressed to the Government by various congresses too.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana made the complaint and the hon. member for Rondebosch expressed the idea that the hon. the Deputy Minister made certain announcements about progress in this or that direction, but that the political dispensation and situation were in fact of paramount importance. I want to point out, however, that the political situation and the granting of political rights are in fact the difficult and dangerous aspects of this situation, for it is the political situation which can dominate the economic and the social aspects. In applying one&#x2019;s mind to political rights, one therefore has to do so with due regard to the implications thereof. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition proposed direct representation, but the Whites and the Coloureds and even the Coloured leaders would very much like to know what content the proposal of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has. His proposal sounds very nice, but does he want to make room in Parliament for two, six or eight Coloured representatives or does he want to make provision for 20, 40 or 60? Does he accept by means of his proposal a motion which was before the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council that those members should all come and take their places here? This is, after all, a proposal which came from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, but can he not give some content to this fine proposal of his which has to find a response and be taken further? Can he not show that he has the courage of his convictions and at least say whether he is making provision for 20 or 40 Coloured representatives? [Interjections.] The speeches or policy statements of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition are always of this nature. Anything is possible in any direction and one has to ask him to give indications. What is of importance and what this is about, is the following: Will the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council be abolished and will room be made for full political representation of the Coloured population in Parliament if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s policy announcement is implemented? Can the hon. the Leader of the Opposition give us a reply to this now that he has consulted with his hon. Chief Whip? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition still has to lean over to the side of the hon. member for Yeoville; perhaps he has the key idea. I repeat the thought that before this proposal or suggestion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition can be considered seriously, he will have to give us more particulars. He should at least give an indication of how many representatives of the Coloured population group he envisages will have sitting in this Parliament as direct representatives of the Coloured population. [Interjections.] This is a difficult question. The hon. member simply set a cat among the pigeons and it is difficult to get down to details at this stage, for the United Party&#x2019;s policy has always been a broad policy without details.</p>

<p>I want to say that consideration is being given to the political situation and that it will be given further consideration by the National Party from time to time. I want to state, and with that I want to conclude, that there are other matters affecting the Coloured population which are just as important and more dominant than the political situation. Hon. members must not tell us that the Coloureds have no say today. <span class="col_5945-5946" refersTo="page_0663"/>Through the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and the executive they are participating actively in not only political life but also in their own socio-economic upliftment today. I want to tell hon. members today that the housing situation in South Africa in respect of the Coloured population is far more important and far more urgent than the political situation. I want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville that he should take a bus or his car and go and have a look at Klipriviersoog near Johannesburg &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to put a question to the hon. the Minister with a view to a possible reply, for I expect nothing from the hon. member for Yeoville. I doubt whether we in South Africa will ever be able to solve the housing question of our Coloured population without the active and united support of the Coloured population itself. We do not have the manpower and we do not have the capital to do so. For that reason I want to ask the hon. the Minister and the Government to consider establishing a system of national service for Coloureds, a system of national service which, in the first place, should be adjusted to making thousands of young Coloureds available annually, young Coloureds who can help to build houses.

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_relations_and_rehoboth_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED RELATIONS AND REHOBOTH AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the previous discussions which we have had in regard to the Coloureds in South Africa and in regard to relations with the Coloureds, have always followed a stereotyped pattern. They were always dominated by a tendency on both sides to score political points, and the harder the dig and the more vociferous the protest on the opposite side, the greater the jubilation on one&#x2019;s own side. I must say that I was somewhat disappointed that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who occupies a very responsible place in our political community, once again took the lead on Friday in respect of this kind of political speech on the weal and woe of a population group which is not directly represented here. He was followed by other hon. speakers who then became embroiled in a continuous fight, a fight of give and take, of meting out and being on the receiving end. I do not want to adopt a holier-than-thou attitude, for I can also plead guilty to a certain extent to having also, in previous debates, indulged in this type of debating tactic. However, we cannot keep on talking at cross purposes on important matters such as these, each defending his own point of view. Discussions in such a spirit, particularly on our Coloureds, should disappear for the sake of the future of the country. Hon. members must realize in the first place, and this is an actual fact, that whatever happens in the immediate future in respect of the political future of the Coloured community and whatever changes they may be visualizing, these can only come about with the assistance of the Government and with the assistance of National Party supporters. I agree with a columnist who observed a little while ago that this placed a terrifying responsibility <span class="col_5947-5948" refersTo="page_0664"/>on the shoulders of the National Party Government. This is true. There is no doubt about the mandate which this Government received at the last election. Hon. members should not try to gloss over it by saying that it was not an issue, for it was a very clear issue which was thrashed out on every political platform. A policy of separate development was decided on as far as the Coloureds were concerned. This is an actual fact.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<p>But no one knows what it means.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps you do not know, but there are other people who have a better understanding of Coloured politics. It is an actual fact which no honourable Government can suddenly lose sight of and deceive the voters. Other elections may entail other mandates. It was and still is implicit in this policy that it will not remain stagnant, but will be developed to greater clarity and to better acceptance, especially by those people in respect of whom we are carrying out this policy, for without the consent of a significant portion of those people, whether they have been correct or incorrect in their judgment, one will never be able to achieve success with this policy. In addition, the idea that a policy can continue to be negatively enforced regardless of changing circumstances, the demands of the times and a greater understanding of the policy in a time such as this, is not really relevant as far as the Government is concerned, and therefore need not even be debated. We are in agreement on that score. I want to say to the hon. members that this Government is the instrument, and will be the instrument for further and even dynamic changes through orderly adjustments.</p>

<p>It is necessary at the outset quickly to clear the air in regard to a little matter which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised. Apart from his criticism of the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;and I concede that he has the right to criticize it&#x2014;the hon. the Leader in my opinion really displayed a little too much piety on Friday with his offer to the Government to support us provided we had achieved a consensus with the Coloureds when the hon. the Prime Minister and I addressed the Coloured political parties on 5 September of this year. You will recall that I asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition by way of an interjection why he had not informed us of this. I had really meant to ask him why he had not informed us of this in advance. However, he caught my meaning and replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I had a Press statement published in every newspaper in the country the day before &#x2026;</block>

<p>Hon. members should note that he said &#x201C;the day before&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the hon. the Prime Minister was to hold an interview with the Coloured people. What have we had from the Government? &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he proceeded to attack the development of the Government&#x2019;s policy. Why am I furnishing these details? I am doing so for a specific reason. This has a bearing on the attitude which we display when we adopt a pious attitude in regard to the Coloured policy. The first newspaper report which the Prime Minister and I set eyes on which dealt with this offer, appeared the evening after our discussions had been held. It appeared in <i>The Argus</i> of the Afternoon of 5 September. It came to our attention for the first time that evening, and in addition to the attention of the public for the first time. Even the Coloured leaders did not know about it. They, too, found out about it for the first time that evening. The statement &#x201C;the day before&#x201D;, seen in the light of what the hon. the Leader had in mind, namely to make a big issue of his offer, does, as far as I am concerned, call his credibility in question. Perhaps he could explain this matter to us again by way of a newspaper report. The method which he adopted was, to say the least, unworthy of him. One is forced to think that the nature of this statement and its timing was aimed at camouflaging the full reversal of the policy which he had still been describing only a few weeks before as a &#x201C;mistake&#x201D;, so that Whites and Coloureds could see it in retrospect as a noble attempt to prevent a deadlock. If the hon. the Leader had supposedly wanted to be so earnest and sincere, what was wrong in discussing such an important matter with the Prime Minister in advance and informing him of it in advance? I can assure him that it would have been appreciated, for the two of them have come a long way together. But what do we have now? The United Party is prepared to make <span class="col_5949-5950" refersTo="page_0665"/>any policy switch, despite its policy statements to its voters. As a result of a climate of tension which is being generated, together with crisis thinking, he is now prepared to have direct representation for the Coloureds in this Parliament, but this he states in carefully chosen words, which is once again indicative of ambiguity. He stated it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If it is the ultimate wish of both communities to merge their interests to a degree that is agreed upon by both communities, we will arrange to share one legislative assembly.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who is unfortunately not present here, stated the matter in even wider terms by saying that &#x201C;the method of giving the Coloureds a co-say on the highest level could be discussed&#x201D;. He mentioned as an alternative to a confederation; a federation of a unitary system as possibilities. Surely it is correct to say now that the United Party, with all its ifs and examples, is making way even for the policy of the National Party. In fact, they are making way for everyone&#x2019;s policies. All that I am asking them in all sincerity today is that if they really want to give the Coloureds representation here, they must also spell out to those people precisely what this entails, so that they will themselves have clarity in this regard as well. All our people need to be educated, not only the Whites and not only certain Coloureds. The Coloured Labour Party, which at the recent election obtained a majority by a few votes in the CRC, are requesting immediate direct representation, based on a general voters&#x2019; roll without qualifications. Hon. members may analyse the newspaper reports; that is what it amounts to. Hon. members cannot bluff them with any of the qualifications or reservations with which they think they can bluff people in 1974. That party need have no doubt at all about that. But if the United Party decides otherwise and decides first to reach a consensus with the Government and subsequently approach these people, we must receive an honourable indication of this. We will then know where we stand with the United Party. I should now like to leave this matter, for I have said what I wanted to say now, and have got it off my chest.</p>

<p>Since the Opposition has indicated through the hon. the member for Port Elizabeth Central that &#x201C;the stakes are too high and too urgent to try to make political gain out of this issue&#x201D;, I want to request the Opposition to put such objectives, regarded at their face value, into practice. The Government would welcome this; it would be in the interests of the whole of South Africa, of White people as well as Brown people, if our political parties ceased to use Coloured policy for political gain and preferably placed this above politics once and for all, for any party which bears the responsibility of government&#x2014;today it is this party&#x2014;has to deal with difficult, practical situations. I do not have a great deal to say about the responsibilities which I bear, but we are dealing with a factual situation which is not easily reconcilable with the theoretical solutions which we always have to offer in this House. I can assure hon. members of that.</p>

<p>I should like to refer now to contributions made by hon. members to this debate.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Perhaps I should start with the hon. member for Yeoville, who spoke first this afternoon. The hon. member stated that party and policy must take second place to the interests of our country. I cannot agree with him more. That is so. As a statement of fact, I have no fault to find with it. This is precisely not only what this Government has always had in mind, but it is actually what we are doing and the goal we have set ourselves in the future. I want to tell him this: Clich&#x00E9;s, emotions and speeches that might not intend to incite but do nevertheless, are of no use. They do not aid us in coming to conclusions.</p>

<p>Well, in that case, there is ample opportunity for him to correct that. I may be under a misconception in that regard.

It may be serious but it is not necessary to go about making decisions in panic.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. This hon. member always applies himself to the problems which confront him in the area he hails from, and I appreciate that. I have a letter in the post for him about the White Dunn people, and I have already sent out a letter regarding the position of the Dunn properties. I think he will receive it in due course. If there is anything my department can do as a liaison department&#x2014;let us get it clear that we have no legal right or functions as far as these matters are concerned&#x2014;we will be only too glad to assist. I shall attend to all the requests he may make to my department as a liaison department. I can also agree with him when he said that the Coloured people&#x2019;s destiny called for a political decision. That is so. Even that will have to be arrived at in a certain way. There are procedures to be followed. It is not to be arrived at in a haphazard way. We have our procedures as democrats; we have our rules, and so on. But there are many people who are ignorant about the Coloured people or the Coloureds as a society, but who nevertheless so easily come forward with opinions about the solution of a very old problem. My advice to the hon. member for Yeoville also applies to this member to a certain extent.</p>

<p>*Now I should just like to inform the hon. member for Piketberg&#x2014;the hon. member for Bloemfontein North made a very fine contribution, But I do not think he expects me to react to it&#x2014;that the idea of national service for our Coloureds is of course a matter which is not my responsibility. It is, however, an idea which could be taken up with the Minister of Defence. There are many problems with regard to national service for the Coloureds. What we do in fact know, is that there is a large degree of status attached to the corps which have already been established for the Coloureds.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Piketberg, and many other hon. members, adopted a realistic tone during the debate on Friday. In general what I found quite striking&#x2014;apart from the cross-fire&#x2014;was the sympathetic attitude of members with regard to this problem and also their sympathetic attitude to the idea that White people and Brown people should in future walk the road together. I want to associate myself with that. The hon. member for Piketberg emphasized for example how important it is at this stage for us not to anticipate the findings of an important commission such as the Theron Commission, but that the commission should first complete its work. Once again I want to endorse this. It will not avail to aggravate the tense climate to such an extent that the members of that commission are unable to do their work under peaceful conditions. I have good reason to expect, and I can say this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, that long before a year has elapsed I shall be in possession of the findings of this commission. It is not letting the grass grow beneath its feet. The hon. members for Oudtshoorn, Namakwaland, Mossel Bay and Rissik, in my opinion, made constructive contributions. They brought the debate down to earth a little. If we were now to demolish all traces of the policy of separate or parallel development, what would ultimately be left for the Coloureds of what was established for them? The statement made by the hon. member for Durbanville that blatant discrimination solely on the ground of colour should disappear, which creates friction rather than removes it, is a message to our people which only the pathologically afraid still continue to ignore these days. This is something which has been brought home to the understanding of all right-thinking people in this country. But particularly important, too, was the idea expressed by the hon. member for Waterberg, who said that crisis-thinking, this tension with which one runs goes off half-cocked and has attacks of seizure, <span class="col_5953-5954" refersTo="page_0667"/>should not cause a responsible Government to panic. Even under the rapidly changing circumstances it may not allow itself to be taken in tow by this crisis-thinking. All the people who place a premium on orderly change, expect this of such a Government. Therefore, as long as we are there, it is our duty to ensure that that order is maintained and that the extra-parliamentary pressure which is being exerted does not become so extreme that one is forced to make unconstitutional concessions and to do other things.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg West expressed an interesting idea and elaborated on it, namely the question of the poverty culture among our Coloureds. You know, so few people realize that when they have worked out all these political solutions in this House, we still have to deal with their practical situation as well, a practical situation which is exposed when members refer to the practical conditions, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and the hon. members for Malmesbury, Namakwaland and Oudtshoorn did. People forget these problems. You know, this poverty culture and the situation in which these people find themselves, is better understood by the Coloured poet Adam Small than by many Whites. He stated in <i>Rapport</i> of 13 October 1974 to a political audience (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You see my problem. Sixty men, or whatever the number may be, in the actual Parliament is not the ultimate solution to our situation. There still remains our entire socio-economic situation as it exists at present. The real work begins, the real problems, after the papers have been sorted out.</block>

<p>We have been engaged in this work for a long time now, Sir. In the meantime the people are arguing about the papers. The hon. member for Malmesbury made a very interesting speech in regard to the labour committees. The hon. the Deputy Minister replied to him very effectively. The hon. member for Turffontein stated the politics of the past 25 years in its correct perspective. I shall not refer to that again precisely because we feel that we have really dealt with that aspect now. It was highly interesting, and there was also a measure of truth in it, as I stated at the outset. But let us leave it at that for the time being.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. members on the Opposition side. I cannot agree with everything they said, for they made certain negative statements and they would not resist the temptation of getting in digs and trying to say things that hurt. This is probably only natural, but I do not want to commit the same sin and cause unnecessary friction. But hon. members opposite said things which hurt, and they were to an extent negative. But as far as I am concerned, more than one member opposite was sincere and zealous in his efforts to set matters straight in the field of relations without making political expediency part of their conduct. I have already referred to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central. He is a member of the Ther on Commission and he has therefore already acquired a good deal of experience. The hon. member for Newton Park in his speech also expressed ideas concerning the interrelated destinies of Whites and Coloureds. He set them side by side and he discussed the fact that the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council cannot be the ultimate exclusive reply to the requirements of the Coloureds. Well, I want to associate myself with that, although I cannot agree with all the conclusions he drew.</p>

<p>&#x2020;But I do not agree at all with the hon. member for Sea Point that the Coloured Representative Council has ceased to exist. By saying a thing like that, he is perpetuating an idea among many of the Coloured people&#x2014;I will not say among the majority&#x2014;that this institution is useless, but although this body may not suit the policy of one Coloured political party, it is not true. In saying this I think he is breaking down many good things that have been achieved and have been done in the past, particularly in the past few years, and he is perhaps preventing many good things which can still be done or are in fact perhaps being done at the moment, because many developments are being foreseen for the CRC. The CRC can be used in a more meaningful way perhaps, but it need not be the only body by which Coloured political aspirations can be realized. And then after condemning the CRC in the way he did, we are left, according to his party, with a policy of direct representation on the basis of a qualified franchise, including the Bantu, in this institution, an alternative condemned by the vast majority of White people and, although I may not be correct, even by the majority of the Coloured people themselves.</p>

<p><span class="col_5955-5956" refersTo="page_0668"/>*Very well, that is the opinion of that hon. member, but I just want to say that I differ most strongly. The hon. member for Maitland stated that as progress is made with the socio-economic upliftment of the Coloureds, their political demands would keep on increasing. But I have to agree with him, Sir, surely this is true. He was telling the truth and at the same time he was paying the National Party Government a compliment. Surely it is precisely as a result of the fact that their socioeconomic position and their political development has progressed to such an extent, separately and alongside the Whites, that they find themselves in the position today where they can come forward and state that they have reached a stage where they want more, and we are prepared to give more.</p>

<p>Are you prepared to give more?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. This has always been the approach and the policy of the Government, and you know it. You can issue challenges to us on this score. That was precisely why it was a compliment, and I thank the hon. member for that compliment which he paid us. It was very good and honest of him. The unitary structure, the unitary system was condemned by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a few weeks ago as being totally incorrect. He said it was a mistake, it was collapsing, for there could be no safeguards for minority groups in a unitary system. But I want to say this, that in the past the unitary structure also proved that the minority groups, the poorer groups, simply became poorer; the better-off brothers did not look after the interests of their less-well-off kinfolk. One does not see them as a separate group; one does not develop a social conscience which is strong enough. Nor does one have the pressure on certain groups that they should, for the sake of their own future, look after the interests of the other groups. Then how can we be so certain that a unitary structure will be the solution in future when there is still such a great deal to be done in the socio-economic sphere, so much to be done to achieve human dignity, so much to be done to achieve acceptance of the one group by the other?</p>

<p>Sir. I should just like to refer in passing now to fine and positive things which happened, and things which were not frequently mentioned in this debate, things which point to a different situation than the alarmistic conditions which are persistently and deliberately being linked to the events on our borders. If we were preferably to emphasize this situation and attitude and seek less sensation in areas where there is friction and where tension is building, then it could lead to the further encouragement of these people, to more support for them and to the better South Africa which we want to create for the 21st century. South Africa needs all its people. I just want to relate one episode now. Attending the U.N. meeting recently were a Brown man, a Black statesman and an Indian colleague, and they were denigrated in a humiliating fashion as &#x201C;puppets&#x201D; of the Government. They were denigrated in a humiliating fashion on what was for them the first opportunity they had to defend our country on an equal basis. But this Brown man, who was denigrated in a humiliating fashion, did not dissociate himself from South Africa in that climate where it was pleasant for him to associate with those people; he did not dissociate himself from South Africa, and he is not a coward; I know him. Nor did he hold his country to ransom by demanding immediately what he knew South Africa could possibly offer him one day. He does not judge his country by how it may be at present; he judges it on the prospect that there will one day be a place for us all here where we will all be better off. No, when they denigrated him. Mr. Ulster got on his hind legs, and he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was for me a wonderful honour to be insulted as a South African. It is as a South African that I will in future state my case, within South Africa too. I have never felt prouder, even in the midst of the insults, for I had never before been baited as a representative of my country.</block>

<p>Sir, possibly there are things about which this South African feels unhappy in South Africa, but he got his priorities straight. He knew that there were also so many good things in this country that they had to be given the benefit of the doubt when compared with lesser matters which affected him personally. Sir, we have heard here of people who are not prepared to defend this country, but this person associated himself with another South African, <span class="col_5957-5958" refersTo="page_0669"/>a person who also had his grievances&#x2014;sometimes deeper grievances&#x2014;and whom I know very well, who said at a political party meeting (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall as one man defend this country to the death; we shall lay down our lives for South Africa, together with the Whites. We squabble and fight to one side here when there is no crisis; then we squabble about these lesser matters, but the moment the crisis is at hand, then we fight together first and talk about it afterwards.</block>

<p>Sir, we want a prosperous population in this country, as far as the Whites and also the non-Whites are concerned. We want to build up a good country, in which we want to give everyone a chance, and people with an attitude such as these people have, deserve in their aspirations to full self-realization of their own people the support of us all. Sir, it is really a pity that these positive matters receive so little recognition in this debate as well. What the one says, generates a reaction in the other. Sir, I could for example have mentioned a few things to you, which are quite interesting, which have happened to us in recent years. After more than 50 years we have during the past 18 months reached the stage where the Rehoboth Bastard community for example would finally like to co-operate with us now in drawing up a constitution for them with a view to self-government. There again one has the endeavour to retain their own identity. For 51 years we were unable to succeed in obtaining their co-operation, because these people wanted to have nothing to do with the Government, and what I am saying here applies to the Hertzog Government, the Smuts Government, or to whatever party was in power; they wanted to have nothing to do with the Whites.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members referred here to the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council which was supposedly useless and to which we had supposedly given nothing that it had asked for. What is the real position? Out of 89 resolutions adopted by them, the position four months ago was that we had in the case of 30 of those resolutions, either satisfied these people or within the process of satisfying them, even if this was only in part. Subsequently further representations were received from them, which we were able to meet. Recently I held discussions with quite a number of those people who voted for the abolition of the CRC, but they subsequently paid special visits to me in my office because they felt that they were on a level where they were representing their people and where they were able to do something positive for their people. But, Sir, could all of them have representation in this House? When I say this, I am not referring to them derogatorily. They themselves realize this. The picture is therefore not really as terribly black as it is being painted. We have argued for years about the question of non-White diplomats at the U.N., and we have now reached that stage. There is a time for everything. Sir, I also want to mention to you what is happening on the level of local government, where we are dealing with matters which affect the everyday lives of people. What is happening in this sphere, will demonstrate whether our people can co-operate, coexist, grow together and eventually govern the country together alongside one another, each in his own sphere. On the level of local government we find these days that these people are of their volition establishing liaison committees; we are finding this today in the Free State. What this led to was that in a period of three months, where it would otherwise have dragged on for months, accommodation problems and numerous other problems were solved. This could only happen because the people learnt to get together and work together. A delegation consisting of a few Coloureds and a few Whites who served on managing committees, including even the chairman of the municipal association there, came to see me here. In other words, opportunities which were previously not there, have now developed on this level. Sir, we could also have discussed here the fine attitude which exists at the University of the Western Cape today. Problems still exist, but these people are already beginning to develop a pride of their own. Sir, the private sector can also do a great deal for these people. Look what Rembrandt has done at Paarlita Park in Paarl; this is one of the finest housing schemes I have ever seen. We would be able to solve the problems which exist today far more successfully if each of us contributed to creating a climate of co-operation, a climate of adjustment to changing times, a climate in which one abandons unnecessary, hackneyed, traditionally entrenched prejudices, and where one separates the wheat from <span class="col_5959-5960" refersTo="page_0670"/>the Chaff in one&#x2019;s relations with other people. Sir, we would be far better off if, instead of always referring to it being a half-hour to midnight, we should refer instead to it being a half-hour before the dawn, as the Prime Minister recently put it so well.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in conclusion I just want to indicate to you, with reference to what the hon. member for Edenvale said in regard to the future state structure, what the future ideas of the Government are in the development of its policy. I am not going to furnish you with the particulars today, and I shall also tell you why I am not going to do so. The first five years, the experimental five years, of the CRC have now come to an end. Next year a second CRC is being elected in the place of the one which has, according to certain hon. members, ceased to exist. I think the time is now ripe not only to expand the existing CRC further on the basis of the experience gained during the first five years, but also to give shape to a forum for meaningful joint consultation and agreement with the White governmental bodies&#x2014;the highest level&#x2014;to lead eventually to a form of citizenship for the Coloureds, just as full-fledged as far as say over its own people is concerned&#x2014;and there we shall begin to discuss with one another questions such as confederation, consensus and federation, but this is not relevant now&#x2014;as that of the Whites in respect of their own people. The Whites of South Africa will not relinquish the final say in respect of its own people, Sir, but the Whites of South Africa cannot, for all time, demand to have the final say over the weal and woe of the Coloureds. Sir, then there are also spheres of life and fields of work where total administrative separation is not possible or even conceivable. Certain hon. members referred here to the Transport and to Foreign Affairs; there are others as well, but I am mentioning only these two as an example. There are customs and provisions which are obsolete. There are prejudices on both sides which are ripe for deliberate breaking down. Sir, it may be said of me now that I am being one-sided in this respect, but I deplore this kind of report which appeared recently in a newspaper; I know that this journalist wrote it because he is not fond of this Government. In this report there is speculation as to whether we will also have Coloured air-hostesses on our Airways. After all, we cannot always have two Boeings fiying alongside each other. Sir, I deplore it however when people on any level give this kind of reply which I am now going to quote to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A spokesman said &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is always a &#x201C;spokesman&#x201D; who has this kind of thing to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that no consideration has been given to the training of Coloured or Indian cabin crews.</block>

<p>Very well, that is still correct so far. But then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The highest position for a non-White woman at D. F. Malan Airport is to clean the toilets and there is only one Coloured woman.</block>

<p>Is that necessary? However, it is not only the Whites alone who have this kind of thing to say; the Coloureds do so as well. When the U.P. youth movement goes out to educate people, these people who are so eager to educate the Whites should be asked to educate the Coloureds as well, for it is not my intention to quote in this White Parliament the things said by Coloureds which were derogatory to the Whites. I am merely pointing out that we are dealing here with things which will take a long time to eradicate. But now is the time to begin eradicating them, for we have to create the right climate. However, it is also part of our task to break down certain things in the correct and orderly manner without chasing after instant solutions. We must always take reality into account. From my experience of and in my interviews with Coloured leaders, which I am never eager to make known to the public mass media although it always leaks out nevertheless in ways about which one sometimes has one&#x2019;s misgivings, I have found that these people want to be consulted themselves when we want to develop our policy on their behalf or for them. Even if I had another 15 minutes at my disposal, I would not give a detailed elucidation today of what we are contemplating further in regard to the Coloureds. I shall not furnish it here for it will be furnished to them themselves within the next few weeks, and in greater detail than the hon. members have ever heard it before. The Coloureds are entitled to hear this themselves, and we must show them that respect; we have reached that stage. If we <span class="col_5961-5962" refersTo="page_0671"/>wish to give these people greater responsibilities, we must bear in mind that these things are not obtained by means of revolution, nor will they be obtained by means of revolution as long as there are people sitting here who place high premium on order. These things take place by way of increments, even if it takes place rapidly. However, one must have the insight, if one gives them responsibilities, to give these to them in such a way that they will be able, with their capacity and with the experience which they have already acquired, to implement these things so that the giving of responsibilities does not result in a failure. We are going to speak directly to these people, and we shall ask them to put forward suggestions and not only to place the onus on us by expecting us to have to say that we shall do something for them and what it is. There are still aspects in respect of which we feel that the Coloureds cannot fend for themselves. We are dealing with general White opinion, and the Coloureds must come forward with proposals which are aimed at enabling them to fulfil the increased responsibility which they are asking for. This increased responsibility will bring with it a greater say. In particular I am drawing the attention of the hon. member for Rondebosch to what I am saying now. I have sketched the general outline of the principles which are involved here, but until these people have been told what we are contemplating for them and this has been explained to them in greater detail, in black and white, so that everyone can understand it. I am not prepared to participate further in public debates on the future of the Coloured population. I am asking, in all sincerity, that hon. members will respect by attitude in the two or three or four weeks which will elapse in the meantime. It is not the case that many weeks will elapse, for as far as the Government is concerned, the time is now ripe, and the need for action is imminent.</p>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Chairman, may I put two questions to the hon. the Minister? Firstly, is the hon. the Minister unaware of the fact that during the Pinelands by-election earlier this year I made the offer that if the Government introduced direct representation for the Coloureds we shall support it? The second question is in regard to the second statement made by the hon. the Minister. Is he aware of the report which appeared in <i>The Argus</i> on 5 September wherein it is stated:</p>

<block name="quote">The Leader of the Opposition made a dramatic offer to the Government today &#x2026;</block>

<p>And later on in the same article:</p>

<block name="quote">His offer was made on the eve of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s crucial discussions with the Coloured politicians which are due to start at 3 p.m. today.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I ask for the privilege of the half-hour.</p>

<p>I should like to start this debate by taking the opportunity to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his new appointment to this very important post in which capacity he will be appearing under these Votes now for the first time. I should like to leave the hon. the Minister in no doubt whatsoever in regard to the importance with which we regard the portfolio of Economic Affairs. We regard a prosperous, strong and growing South African economy as an absolutely essential prerequisite to solving our political, our social and our racial problems and providing security for our country. The hon. the Minister has a key role to play, a role which I regard as being parallel to that of the hon. the Minister of Finance. We on this side of the House wish him well in this position. We would like him to understand that we regard the interests of South Africa as being paramount; they transcend any party political interest. The hon. the Minister will not find us lacking in support if he takes the right steps to promote the economy, but if he takes the wrong steps and if he tries to bend the economy to fit in with ideological considerations with which we do not agree, he will find that we will be critical and antagonistic and that we will offer very strong opposition.</p>

<p>At the start of this debate I would like to make quite clear what the basic economic beliefs of this side of the House are. We believe that in economic affairs one must keep one&#x2019;s eye on the main target and not let it stray from there. The main target in economic management is to maximize the gross national product and to maximize the productivity and product of the country with the ultimate aim of providing the population with as large a per capita income as possible or to put it in plainer words, with the highest standard of living possible. We believe that this can best be done in the framework of a free, competitive, private enterprise system. In saying this, I believe that our philosophy differs in no way from the philosophy which nominally the Government itself follows. We believe that each of the elements of this framework is important. We believe that maximum freedom to entrepreneurs to make decisions is important. We believe that competitive conditions are very important. We believe that maximum scope for private enterprise as opposed to State enterprise is essential. All of these three legs of the framework hang together. We realize that some of these three tenets may have to be departed from on occasions for special reasons, and usually they are non-economic reasons, for social and security purposes. I think it is essential to realize that when these tenets are departed from, this is usually damaging to the economy to some extent. Therefore we require convincing reasons why non-economic and particularly ideological considerations should at any time override economic considerations.</p>

<p>I propose this evening, after the dinner break, to say something in regard to the first two legs of the framework, i.e. economic freedom and competition, and where in our view Government policies and actions have departed or are in danger of departing from these basic principles. I am going to leave it to other speakers on this side of the House to state our attitude in regard to State enterprise versus private enterprise.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when we broke for dinner, I was saying that I was going to say something this evening in connection with economic freedom, as we believe in it, and competition. As far as economic freedom is concerned, we do not believe that economic freedom should be economic permissiveness. Nor do we believe that it should be <i>laissez faire,</i> such as was practised in the last century. By &#x201C;economic freedom&#x201D; we mean freedom subject to economic disciplines, but subject to the correct economic disciplines, to ensure that the economy is managed in such a way that the interests of the people and of the nation as a whole are cared for. We believe that economic freedom should be subject to the disciplines of sound monetary and fiscal policies to maintain a strong and stable rand, not the type of rand we have at the moment, one that is depreciating <span class="col_5965-5966" refersTo="page_0673"/>at the rate of something like 13% per year. We believe that we should have economic freedom subject to the discipline of selective customs tariffs, aimed at stimulating and encouraging healthy industries. But protection must follow defined and predetermined guidelines and principles. We believe that protection is justified to encourage industries that we need for strategic and security reasons. We believe that it is justified to encourage labour intensive industries that are going to give jobs to our ever growing labour force, provided those industries are reasonably efficient by world standards. We believe that protection is justified to encourage industries which contribute favourably to the balance of payments position, in other words, industries that have a greater potential for exports than they will require themselves in the way of imports.</p>

<p>I think that this whole question of our protection policy requires a complete rethink with a view to making long-term and far-reaching structural changes in the whole economy of South Africa. Experience over recent years has shown us very clearly that the South African economy is at present not structured for growth. If there are two things that have been shown by recent experience, the first is that despite our wealth of natural resources, labour resources and raw materials, as soon as we experience a period of fast growth, we run into inflationary and balance of payments problems, and the second is that, when we have an export boom such as we have had in the past year, so much spending power is generated that we do not get an import boom, but we get an absolute import explosion. Most of the additional imports are required, not for direct consumption at consumer level, but by industry in the form of raw materials and plant. This is not a satisfactory long-term structure for our economy, because it means an economy that is operating on a stop-start basis. Any stop-start basis economy is not good for either confidence, investment or growth.</p>

<p>I believe that the answer as far as protection is concerned, lies in being far more selective in the industries that we protect and far less indiscriminate than we have been in the past few years. I do not think that we should try to become self-sufficient in this country because we are not nearly a sufficiently developed country to become self-sufficient. You have to be highly developed to attain self-sufficiency. We should aim our protection at low import propensity industries and industries that do not make inordinate demands on our supply of skilled labour and our limited supply of capital. In other words, we should aim our protection at industries that use the resources we have. Into these categories fall the metallurgical industries, which include the benefication of minerals and, to a lesser extent, the chemical industries. These are industries which can grow and as they grow they will not require much by way of additional imports; but as they grow they will create considerable additional export potential.</p>

<p>I think I have said enough to indicate that our belief in freedom means freedom subject to discipline and that we do not mean unbridled freedom. We believe in freedom subject to sensible discipline. But by freedom we do mean certain other things, and this is where the Government is failing. By freedom we mean freedom to employ labour irrespective of colour where it is needed and in jobs it is capable of doing; it means freedom to train labour in jobs which it is capable of being trained to do. We mean freedom of choice to locate industries where those industries can be operated most economically and productively. That means choice of location between existing metropolitan industrial complexes, the border areas, the homelands and any other decentralized areas. It means freedom to put capital to the uses where it can be most productive without the distortion of interest rate control which we have at the present time. It means greater freedom of choice of transport methods to convey raw materials and finished goods within the over-all proviso that we believe that our railway transport system must remain viable. It means the freedom to acquire and to use the latest technological methods and this entails giving every encouragement to foreign capital to come into the country whether on a direct investment basis or a partnership basis. It means freedom from unnecessary Government controls and unnecessary red tape such as is experienced at the moment with such controls as import control, price control and the administration of the Companies Act. But above all, freedom means freedom to make reasonable profits and an acceptance of the fact that it is the profit motive that is the vital driving force in the private enterprise system. I want to come back to the question of profits later.</p>

<p><span class="col_5967-5968" refersTo="page_0674"/>I now want to say something in connection with competition, which is the second vital element in the free and competitive private enterprise system. If it is profit that makes people risk their capital and apply their energies in a particular direction, it is competition which keeps them on their toes, keeps them efficient, makes them efficient, protects the public and the consumer from any form of exploitation and gives the consumer the best and the squarest deal. I know that not many people in business like competition. I know that when I was in business, competition was one of the things that I hated. I hated it because it was a stern disciplinarian. It was inclined very often to hurt you and the final sanction that competition could apply was the lethal sanction of putting you out of business.</p>

<p>However, competition is the essential link in the free enterprise system which reconciles the profit motive with the interests of the consumer. We have heard a great deal in recent months about the huge profits that are being made in the private sector. We have heard that profits are growing at an inordinately fast rate. There has been a groundswell of demand that there should be price control to control profits and to control prices. I should like to say most emphatically that we on this side of the House do not regard profits in themselves as being a dirty word. Profits are an essential basis of enterprise, they are essential for initiative and risk-taking, they are the source of saving, they are the source of investment for up-dating plant for modernization and expansion. Without profits the economy simply goes for a loop. The dirty words in the economic sense are exploitation, monopoly, price ring and cartel because they all indicate lack of competition.</p>

<p>I believe that it is in this area of lack of competition in the economy where the Government is not being as active as it could be in keeping prices down. It is not being as active as it could be in ensuring that competitive conditions exist in the economy. The Government has the powers through the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act to prevent price rings and cartel arrangements and to prevent the getting together of suppliers to eliminate competition. It seems to me that it is reluctant to use these powers effectively. Even Assoc which, after all, is an association of businessmen which does not like interference in its activities, has recommended that sharpening the teeth of anti-monopolistic action is one way of fighting inflation effectively.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the main activity of the Government in regard to monopolies and in regard to action under the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act has been to look at retail price maintenance agreements. However, that does not go to the root of the problem. Not only does one have to look at lack of competition at retail level, one also has to look at the lack of competition at producer and supplier level and at all levels between producer and consumer. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that if the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act is not an effective weapon to fight monopolies&#x2014;and I believe that it is a clumsy and slow-moving measure&#x2014;this weapon should be given sharper teeth. If the hon. the Minister decides to take effective action against monopolies he can count on the support of this side of the House in his efforts.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the Government is relying far too much on price control and using it either directly or threatening to use it in order to try to keep prices down. Price control is no substitute for competition. It may put a ceiling on a price, but it only puts that ceiling on temporarily, but whenever you put a ceiling on a price you are putting a floor under the price too; you are preventing the price from going down as much as you are preventing it from going up. Competition is the driving force to efficiency and price control tends to protect suppliers from competition; it is no promoter of efficiency. I believe that price control is something that should be used sparingly and not as generally as the Government appears to be using it, and it should be used only in conditions where goods are actually in short supply and where there is a situation where the consumer can be exploited, or where an actual monopoly exists that cannot be broken, that is to say where there is only one supplier in the market of a particular commodity.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he approves of the way in which the commercial banks get together in the commercial banks register of cooperation, which fixes minimum charges for banking services by way of ledger fees and commission charges. Is this cosy position in the banks conducive to efficiency? Does the Minister think so?</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister whether, with a view to a Board of Trade investigation, he has examined whether price rings exist or whether there are tacit price fixing arrangements in the packaging industry, in the tea and coffee industry, in the confectionary industry, in the biscuit industry; whether these things exist amongst flour millers; whether they exist amongst the producers of small meat products such as bacon and sausages; whether they exist amongst chicken producers; whether they exist amongst hardware merchants. Mr. Chairman, I have mentioned a few instances where either cartel arrangements are known to exist or where there is good circumstantial evidence that they may exist. Where they do exist, they exist for one reason only and that is to eliminate competition, and you can rest assured that if they are effective in eliminating competition, the chances are that they axe doing so at the expense of the consumer. I would like to say to the Minister that the public must know whether these practices are in the public interest. The Government has a heavy responsibility in this regard, and I say that there is little evidence that it is playing the part that it should be playing in promoting competitive conditions.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to say to the Minister that if the right steps are taken to encourage freedom of decision amongst entrepreneurs, unhampered by unnecessary restriction but subject to disciplines, some of which I have mentioned, and if there is sound competition in our economy, then I say to the Minister that we will have gone a long way towards laying the foundations for sound growth and prosperity in our economy and we will have taken some of the correct decisions to fight inflation.</p>

<p>As usual, one enjoys listening to the hon. member for Constantia, for what he says normally has a great deal of substance. It is not always so easy to follow the hon. member since one cannot hear what exactly he is saying. If I heard what he said correctly, the hon. the Minister can, as has always been the case in the past, derive sound advice from it. [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. member had half an hour and I have only ten minutes, and in order to shield him these chaps around me are creating such a din that I cannot proceed. Sir, if these hon. gentlemen would give me a chance, I should just like, in the few minutes at my disposal, to touch cursorily on what the hon. member said here, and then I want to say a few things of a general nature.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;and I have been sitting here for a number of years&#x2014;is a worthy successor to a former hon. member for Constantia, a person whom the late Mr. Blaar Coetzee described as &#x201C;sad-faced Sid&#x201D;. I am referring to Mr. Sidney Waterson. He was succeeded by a very pleasant hon. member, the hon. member for Park town, so pleasant in fact that he later earned the name of &#x201C;Sunny Sonny&#x201D;. Now this hon. member in turn wants to proceed in heavy-hearted vein. What has he just said here that is new? He accuses the Government and this hon. the Minister of having a &#x201C;stop-start&#x201D; government.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member, and I shall return to <span class="col_5971-5972" refersTo="page_0676"/>it in a moment, that this is a hackneyed story, this &#x201C;stop-start&#x201D; story. The fact of the matter simply is that this National Government started under various Ministers in 1948 and they have not yet stopped. It seems to me these hon. members simply cannot understand these things very well, so I want to elaborate on them to some extent.</p>

<p>The first point the hon. member made is that he said&#x2014;and this the hon. member did in conjunction with his colleagues, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens and the hon. member for Von Brandis&#x2014;that we should never try to become self-supporting in South Africa. I ask you, S is this new? It is the same old story of their great leader, Gen. Smuts, who said we should never start anything in this country. We can quote his words in this House in 1926, 1927 and 1928, for example, at the time that Iscor was established when he said we were absolutely wrong, foolish and crazy. And yet, it was proved to them that they were wrong. I shall come to the establishment of Sasol in a moment. [Interjections.] Do you see, Sir, it hurts when I hit them. I could just point to an example here and there. Just take the establishment of Sasol. I was here when Mr. Waterson almost burst into tears about the foolishness the National Party was displaying in wanting to establish something in South Africa which existed nowhere else in the world. [Interjections.] The National Party said it would cost R18 million, but it ultimately cost R48 million. Today, however, it is the only industry of that magnitude in the whole world which produces that particular product. We are in fact setting an example to the whole world. However, the hon. member states that we should not be self-supporting. Do you know what they are doing? They are once again paving the way for something else. The Government said that we would establish a sophisticated motor industry in South Africa. We did so, but the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens wants to have a fit about it because those vehicles will be more expensive than they would have been if we had not been self-supporting. I concede as much, but I believe that the Government will not make a <i>volte-face.</i> We shall make ourselves as self-supporting as is humanly possible with or without the help of the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>Do you know what the hon. member is pleading for? To me he sounds like one of those great Frenchmen, Rousseau for example, who spoke about liberty and fraternity, for he too is pleading for liberty. He is pleading for liberty in respect of labour. [Interjections.]</p>

Really, may I just point out to the hon. member that the Federated Chamber of Industries has told us that the Physical Planning Act does not bother them at all? They said that there had indeed been a measure of uncertainty when the Act was being applied initially, but there was none at present.</p>

<p>Well, I am still giving credit where credit is due. The hon. member is pleading for labour freedom, but I want to point out to him that the Federated Chamber of Industries is perfectly satisfied. The hon. member also pleaded for freedom of transport. Oh, there are quite a number of other freedoms I would have been very pleased to have, but one should, after all, be practical too, and one should make sure whether something is feasible. Under this Government&#x2019;s labour and transport policies which I shall come to in a moment&#x2014;no, I think I should come to them at once. The hon. member is pleading for all these freedoms, but if they were to be granted, the situation might possibly border on licence. The hon. member suggested that we in South Africa had nothing but problems as a result of the lack of these freedoms, but in this regard I want to call the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to witness. Last year the hon. the Leader of the Opposition held Japan <span class="col_5973-5974" refersTo="page_0677"/>up as an example. He pointed out the growth rate of Japan and he also praised the growth rate achieved in England in spite of difficult circumstances. The hon. member can go and have a look at his Hansard in order to see to the growth rates of which countries he referred. As far as South Africa was concerned, he said that South Africa&#x2019;s growth rate had dropped to below the target growth rate. He said that South Africa, on account of the Government&#x2019;s policy, would be on the verge of collapse, and that we would no longer be able to make the grade. Tonight, in the year 1974, we find that the growth rate of Japan has dropped to virtually nil, while South Africa&#x2019;s growth rate stands at 7,1, possibly a bit higher, possibly a bit lower. The growth rate of South Africa, however, under a Government which allegedly causes a lack of freedom and allegedly follows a &#x201C;stop-start&#x201D; policy, is the highest in the Western world. This is what we achieved whereas the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said last year that we did not stand a chance.</p>

<p>I am very pleased that I can agree with the hon. member for Constantia on one matter. The hon. member said may it never come to pass in our country that the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D; becomes a swear-word. I want to associate myself with every word he said in that regard and want to add that the concept of &#x201C;profit&#x201D; is an important one in any capitalistic-orientated system. It is the National Party Government which sees to it that every well-managed company in South Africa has a decent profit margin. What is most important is that the profit margin will be determined by the very aspect of competition. In our dispensation sound management is the very thing which will ensure that those who render service to the particular company will derive all the best benefits, not only benefits in respect of salaries but also fringe benefits.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to identify myself with the comments made by the hon. member for Constantia in congratulating the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs who is appearing here for the first time as the Minister responsible for this Vote which is most probably the most important vote the House will have to deal with this session. Against that background the contribution by the hon. member for Smithfield was indeed pusillanimous. It must be realized that what we are confronted with today is an economic situation facing not only South Africa but the entire Western and civilized world, a situation which calls for the utmost circumspection and conservatism in analysing the problems which lie before us. The hon. member for Constantia has dealt briefly with the factors of freedom and competition in the economy while I want to concentrate on the role of private enterprise in relation to the State corporations. I think it will be realized today that we in South Africa have indeed a dual economy. We have the economy of the Whites whom we may regard as the &#x201C;haves&#x201D; and the economy of the Blacks whom by and large we may regard as the &#x201C;have nots&#x201D;. We are facing a period where change must be rapid. When we reailze that economic disaster is threatening the whole of the American economy, the whole of the European Economic Community and the whole of Japan, we realize that we have very few options open to us. The one option we have open to us is maximize growth within this country of ours. We on this side of the House have always accepted the maxim that one of the Government&#x2019;s responsibilities is to ensure a climate which allows private enterprise the maximum opportunity to thrive and to provide a good living not only for our European population but for all South Africans. The high rate of inflation which we are currently experiencing can largely be laid at the feet of the Government, particularly as a result of its policy of heavy spending investment in order to bring about high growth. We realize that there are no options open to us. We can either have a high growth and high inflation or a low growth and high inflation. We believe that if we use the private enterprise system correctly we can maintain high growth and high inflation. The danger is that the growth rate which we achieved last year, a growth rate of some 7%&#x2014;for which we must give credit largely to the fortuitous increase in the gold price&#x2014;may not be maintained this year and we may be facing a growth rate which will be in the vicinity of 4%. No one will deny that at this moment a deterrent to economic growth is economic uncertainty in the mind of the private business entrepreneur. I think that both the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and the hon. the Minister Of Finance tend to see red when we talk about creeping State socialism being detrimental <span class="col_5975-5976" refersTo="page_0678"/>to our economy. However, this is not a viewpoint expressed only by this side of the House. In fact, just recently, on 15 May, according to <i>The Cape Times,</i> the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut expressed its intention to investigate State encroachment on the preserves of private enterprise. This decision was reached after they were told by Dr. W. J. de Villiers of General Mining that creeping socialism in South Africa was sapping the strength of the private sector. Dr. De Villiers blamed the Government policy of excessive interference in the private sector for the present depressed spirit of entrepreneurial enterprise in South Africa. He also blamed the authorities for allowing public corporations to play an increasingly indirect role at all levels of the economy. I do not want to blame the State for all these defects but it is apparent that the proliferation of State corporations is having an effect in withdrawing from private enterprise those already scarce factors of production, namely entrepreneurial skills, capital and labour. The enterprises to which I refer particularly are Iscor, Sasol, Foscor, the Fishing Development Corporation, the XDC, the IDC and the Bantu Investment Corporation. Rightly or wrongly a strong feeling exists that the connection of these enterprises with the Government makes it impossible or at least hazardous for private enterprise to compete with these agencies in most fields of their undertakings. This type of depression amongst private business men should not be dismissed lightly. These State corporations must be seen as corporations which are clothed with the power of Government while possessing the flexibility and initiative of a private business. One of these facts that concerns the taxpayer, the electorate and private enterprise particularly, is the fact that these corporations do not account for their financial operations directly to Parliament but that their accounts of finance are examined annually by commercial auditors.</p>

<p>To illustrate my point I want to refer briefly to Iscor. I want to say that we do not criticize these corporations for the work they are doing in the economy; we criticize certain aspects of these corporations which are belabouring the economy. In the case of Iscor it is known not only that they are an agent of the Government but that they compete with private enterprise. For instance, they are an agent in the exporting of steel, and other private steel exporters have to make available to Iscor information which can be damning to them as private enterprises.</p>

<p>Then there are further shackles to private enterprise. I refer to the various Government controls which are recognized as being infinite. We have, for example, the controls exercised by sales taxes, we have price controls, import controls, profit controls, rent controls, influx controls, job reservation, control of road transportation and controls aimed at the decentralization of industries. Against these controls, we believe that if only the Government would accept the challenge of giving private enterprise free rein as is done in all countries of the world with successful economies, then, like them, we would find that our economy would bring about an enormous increase in the wealth of our country and the maximum increase in our gross domestic product.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens raised a matter about which the United Party is very concerned, i.e. State corporations. I really do not know why they are opposed to State corporations. All they have said up to now is that the State corporations are not directly accountable to Parliament for their activities. However, they have always been satisfied with the work that is being done. They join us in praising that work. It is only because their forefathers were opposed to those institutions that they are still objecting to them.</p>

<p>The very subject I want to deal with tonight, is the possible establishment of another State corporation. If we make an analysis of the most important raw materials required for one of the most important facets of our lives, i.e. housing, we find that we require the following: steel, timber, bricks and cement. As far as I am concerned, however, the most important of these is bricks. That is why I should like to appeal forthwith to the Minister for an inquiry to be instituted into the possibility of organizing the brick industry, too, as a State corporation. I should like to advance my reasons for saying this. In reply to a question put by the hon. member for Sea Point, who asked what the estimated shortage of housing was for each race group in each province at the beginning of 1974, the Minister of Community Development replied on 16 August that the total shortage came to 6 100 houses for Whites, 62 400 houses for Coloureds and 26 600 <span class="col_5977-5978" refersTo="page_0679"/>houses for the Indian community. If we view the matter in the light of the population growth in this country, we are confronted with the tremendous problem, which has already been mentioned here, i.e. that in the last 30 years of this century as many houses will have to be built as have been built from Jan van Riebeeck&#x2019;s time up to 1970. Let us examine our brick requirements more closely. We know that approximately 40 000 bricks are required for a decent three-bedroomed house, plus a further 4 000 or 5 000 face bricks. If we calculate this at the present cost, we cannot do otherwise but regard this as a matter of national importance. For only the first six months of this year building plans amounting to R433,5 million were approved in the 18 largest urban areas, consisting of R210,5 million for houses, R253 million for flats and R 104,5 million for non-residential purposes. This amount is in respect of the 18 largest municipal areas only. If we view this against the background of our development, the question arises whether we shall ever be able to provide enough building material, especially as far as the brick industry is concerned. There are certain brick-makers who are duly able to supply the demand. Now I also want to emphasize from an economic point of view, of which I know very little &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; that one often comes across cases, as I have done, of a private individual wishing to build a house approaching some building contractor or other who might perhaps tell him, &#x201C;Fine, my friend. I shall build your house for R18 000 but you will have to wait six months before you can get bricks.&#x201D; Certain brick-makers say, &#x201C;Very well, produce your cash, and then I shall be able to deliver your bricks in three months&#x2019; time.&#x201D; These are the problems which in fact arise in practice. The reason why I am asking the hon. the Minister to inquire into this industry, is that the major brick-makers establish themselves at a certain place and then make deliveries within a certain radius. But in the course of time, as the industry develops, delivery takes place beyond that radius so that the transport costs of bricks become tremendously high. I want to conclude with the thought that irrespective of what kind of unconventional building methods are available, bricks will remain one of the basic components of housing, now and in the future. I consider the brick to be as important to the building industry as mother&#x2019;s milk is to the infant.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to respond to the argument advanced by the hon. member for Brentwood, because I should like to express a few thoughts on what I consider to be a very important factor in the fight against inflation, namely the part played by the manager. The fact is that the problem of inflation does not enjoy priority as a subject of discussion in financial circles only, but very definitely in political circles as well, because the political implications of the process in which we are involved at the moment are so far-reaching that every responsible politician must take cognizance of them. So many millions of words have been spoken and written and so many international conferences have been held on the subject that I believe that all possible causes of inflation must now be known to everyone. However, because these factors occur in different combinations in different places in the world, the problem is that one cannot apply a uniform remedy. The problem is cost inflation, which is tied to the tremendous increase in the cost of raw materials on the one hand and the tremendous increase in the prices, which in on the other. Together these result in a tremendous increase in the prices, which in turn leads to wage demands. In this way, of course, the vicious circle is continued. This process is known to us all. When we examine the problem of cost inflation more closely, however, we are faced with the cost involved in processing them and the cost of distributing the final article. But throughout these three processes we may identify the invisible hand of man, of the worker. The worker is involved in the exploitation of the raw materials, in the processing, because he has to handle the machinery and other capital goods, and in the distribution process. In addition, the worker is involved in the supporting services which lie behind the whole process from production to distribution, i.e. in planning, research, management, accounting and all the other administrative functions with which we are all thoroughly acquainted.</p>

<p>There are certain factors over which the producer has no control, for example, the cost of his raw materials. That is a basic expense. In addition, he has very little control <span class="col_5979-5980" refersTo="page_0680"/>over the cost of his capital goods with which he has to exploit these raw materials. However, if we think of the contribution made by man throughout the whole process, surely it is logical to conclude that, in spite of the large-scale mechanization and automation of our times, man still occupies a crucial position, and that man&#x2019;s productivity, as well as the present imbalance between his production and his remuneration, is one of the chief causes of the tremendous problem we have to contend with at the present moment.</p>

<p>If one looks about one and talks to the man in the street, one comes to the shocking conclusion that most people have long since lost their fear of inflation. With the inflation problem, where much was made at first of the need for the individual to work harder and to save, matters are now taking the same turn as in our fuel conservation effort. At the beginning, everyone showed a great sense of patriotism. People drove slowly and flickered their lights at one another, but today people are driving at high speeds again and a major law enforcement programme has to be applied in order to enforce these conservation measures. People have no personal motivation any more. The same applies to the problem of inflation. Every individual likes to think that the appeal to work harder and to save is really aimed at someone other than himself. The same tendency has been experienced by those of our hon. colleagues who used to be clergymen and who delivered fine sermons, just to discover one day that everyone who had been listening to them had found the sermon wonderfully applicable to his neighbour, instead of applying it to himself. While individuals are waiting for one another to do something in this regard, smaller undertakings are engaged in a struggle for survival in which they often try to pocket as much as possible themselves. The small countries are waiting for the great powers to take action. The underdeveloped countries are blaming the capitalist system. Great powers are caught between the tremendous momentum of their permissive financial policy, which they are now unable to keep in check, and the unrealistic wage demands made by the trade unions which are already demanding compensation for the future production of their workers. This basically means that any worker, within or outside this House, who knows that he is receiving more than he actually deserves, is discounting the future. Such a person is actually feeding on the whole economic system like a parasite. He is not playing his own part, but he is in fact feeding on production which is to be supplied by himself or by someone else in the future.</p>

<p>If we ask ourselves by whom the contribution should be made, we must come to the frightening conclusion that while we are all waiting for something to happen, there is no magic formula which will resolve the matter overnight. There is no law nor any fiscal measure that can be adopted by this House. The fight against inflation will be won or lost in the practical field, where the fight against inflation can be fought in respect of things such as production and the remuneration of the individual. It is time for us to realize that unless every individual starts contributing to a solution himself, there is no hope of success. As I have indicated, there is a feeling of apathy and a lack of interest in getting involved in this fight. For that reason I want to make a plea tonight to those who do not produce themselves, but who produce through others, to declare war on this public enemy number one. I am referring to every individual who occupies any kind of supervisory position, every person who supervises people; in other words, I am appealing, on the whole, to management. I believe that the manager is the only person who can see to it that the balance between an individual&#x2019;s earnings and his production is restored. You know, in every job, no matter how simple, there is an element of measurable productivity and production. In some jobs this is hidden. In some cases it can only find expression by means of a joint effort. I want to emphasize, therefore, that in every job there is an element of measurability. If that manager&#x2014;everyone has become a professional manager these days&#x2014;is prepared to put the shoulder to the wheel and to re-acquaint himself thoroughly with the work that is being done in his factory, in his office, in the Public Service, or anywhere else&#x2014;I am not referring only to the production of a commodity, but to services in every possible field where one could find a manager&#x2014;and to renew his knowledge of every job under his control, in order that he may ascertain whether the individual who is filling it is earning his money or not, we would stand a chance of success. No one, no law, can do this for <span class="col_5981-5982" refersTo="page_0681"/>him. The manager must take it upon himself. Management has to take up that challenge. I am convinced that they will realize that if the manager in industry or in the Public Service or anywhere else does not participate in this fight, the parasitic effect of the inflation problem will eventually damage the whole economy to such an extent that the managers themselves will suffer. I have said that the individual is waiting for the State to do something about the high prices. Let us ask the Press, the mass media, to shift the focus from the high prices for a moment and to draw the attention of the workers to the problem of the relationship between productivity and earnings. Everyone is complaining about profits these days. Surely one should look at profitability and not at absolute profits. If a company increases its profits, it may mean that it has invested more capital, and in that case surely it is justified. One cannot rant and rave about profits if those profits are merely the fair reward of the entrepreneur who has invested his money in the undertaking.</p>

<p>Sir, the manager knows his people; he knows his job; he knows every individual who works under him. One would express the hope that our managers would qualify themselves properly for performing their management functions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one final thought: Are our universities, which are turning out great numbers of M.B.A.s, not perhaps training people for much higher positions than the ones they will occupy immediately after having obtained the degree? One cannot appoint a person who has just obtained his M.B.A. to a top management position, but one can appoint him on an intermediate management level. Is there not perhaps a great need for a business administration school for the training of staff on the intermediate management level, i.e. for young graduates to undergo this training upon completion of their university education, and then to enter the business, rather than just for an M.B.A., the holders of which may only be able to occupy a top position in five or ten years&#x2019; time? If the young man has taken this course, he will know how to evaluate jobs and how to design methods for measuring production, and he will know that if he, the manager, does not fight inflation, there is no one in the whole economic set-up who will be able to do so for him, and that he will have to accept joint responsibility for the economic disaster which must inevitably result if the present process continues.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>May I say to the hon. member for Florida that I listened to his speech with some degree of interest, particularly as I regard him as one of the few aspirant capitalists in the ranks of the Nationalist Party. He certainly put forward a case for the approach of capitalism to some of the problems of South Africa today. I am not sure that I agree with everything he said. I do agree with most of what he said on the question of productivity. I agree with what he said in respect of the conservation of our natural resources, but I should like to give the hon. member just one word of warning: Some of the things that he said might well cause him to get into trouble with some of the trade unions in South Africa that might not quite like his approach. Sir, while I am complimentary to the hon. member for Florida, I have some difficulty with the hon. member for Brentwood, because if anybody rendered a disservice to the cause of private enterprise in South Africa this evening and to the economy of South Africa and to private investment in South Africa, it is the hon. member for Brentwood, who dropped a brick here this evening. Sir, there is an old saying: &#x201C;Shoemaker, stick to your last.&#x201D; The suggestion that the Government should interfere in the manufacture of bricks in South Africa is an irresponsible one, based only upon a lack of knowledge and a lack of understanding of the problems, because the problem here is not that you cannot solve the housing shortage only because you have not got enough raw material. Moreover, Sir, it must be borne in mind that bricks are not the only things which are needed today to put up buildings; far from it. One of the main problems is the problem of finding the finance to put up buildings, particularly at this particular time. The reason why many people are without housing altogether today is that there is an inability to provide the necessary finance for the erection of housing. To talk irresponsibly and without any knowledge of the facts about nationalizing the brick industry and about Government interference in the brick industry is, I think, calculated to do harm, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will put this thing to rest and that he will do so quickly.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to associate myself with other hon. members who have conveyed <span class="col_5983-5984" refersTo="page_0682"/>their good wishes to the Minister, particularly because he is entering this particular portfolio at an extremely difficult time for the economy of South Africa. I believe that the hon. the Minister, together with the hon. the Minister of Finance, will have a tremendous responsibility in the next year or two. Sir, whereas we may criticize the hon. the Minister, we will at the same time try to help him because we believe that all of us have a duty to see that the economy of South Africa prospers. We wish the hon. the Minister well in his new job. In that vein I would like to try to deal with some of the fears that there are for the economy of South Africa, and I want to say immediately that I am an optimist in respect of the economy and the future of South Africa because I believe that provided we take the correct steps there is little doubt that in fact South Africa can prosper. Perhaps the best way of dealing with this matter is to try to draw a comparison between the depression circumstances which started in 1929 and went into the &#x2019;thirties and the situation as it exists today, and compare the two situations in order to make an assessment.</p>

<p>Firstly I think we have to accept that there are very real problems in the world, problems for which we ourselves cannot find the solutions in South Africa and for which the world powers themselves cannot find the solutions. Perhaps if we can take the visit of the hon. the Minister of Finance to the IMF and the World Bank as examples, they had no difficulty in ensuring that on purely racial grounds and illogical grounds we are wrongly excluded from our rightful place in making a contribution towards the decision-making processes in so far as they affect finance. But whereas they have no difficulty with that, they have the greatest difficulty in really applying their minds to the problems that have to be solved, and the problem that the world faces is that individual countries cannot solve their own economic problems in isolation without the world solving its problems, and the world cannot solve its problems until the individual countries apply a degree of discipline to themselves and seek in fact to get out of the morasse in which they find themselves.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is that it is very difficult to create a situation in South Africa in which we are not affected by world problems. Perhaps here the example of the problems of the 1930s can be taken, in that the depression started in the United States in 1929 and affected practically the whole of the developed Western world at that stage, and we in South Africa being a trading nation, and being a nation which is essentially dependent on dealing with the outside world in many respects, cannot be completely immune from what happens in the world as a whole.</p>

<p>The third point I want to make is that we in South Africa in addition have particular problems which perhaps aggravate the situation for us, and I will deal with some of those in detail in a moment, and deal with the manner in which I think those problems should be dealt with. But on the other hand, while we have particular and peculiar problems in South Africa, we also have fundamental advantages over other nations, particularly in regard to the wealth of our people, the natural resources that we have, the tremendous reservoirs of unskilled manpower simply waiting to be trained, and in fact, the tremendous internal market that is available to us, if in fact we increase the purchasing power of all our people. And these are very real advantages, of which gold is only one.</p>

<p>Then I want to say, fifthly, that I believe that with the correct policies that can be applied, with the correct use of our resources, we can plan to insulate ourselves to a high degree against adverse world economic influences on our country, and this I think is one of the major tasks of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The sixth point I want to make is that confidence, even though it is something which you cannot measure, something which is not tangible, is a major factor in economics, and confidence is a major factor in dealing with the future of South Africa. It is our duty not only as a Government but as an Opposition to seek to contribute towards the confidence of people in our country, both in the sense that there is a political future here and that there is an investment future, because investments cannot be taken in isolation, away from politics. This is a fact of life, and I believe it is our duty as South Africans to seek to encourage the highest degree of confidence in our country, in the stability of our country and in the future of our country.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal, if I may, with a number of direct comparisons between the 1930s and today. In the 1930s we had a dramatic drop in stock and share prices. We had it in 1929 and in 1930, first in <span class="col_5985-5986" refersTo="page_0683"/>America and then all over the world. What is significant is that we have again had dramatic drops in share and stock prices all over the world, and if I take figures only over the past year, in the United States there has been a drop in share prices, according to the Dow Jones index, of 32,6% over the last year. In the United Kingdom there was a drop, according to the <i>Financial Times</i> industrial index, of 56,4%, and in South Africa, to use the index of the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> the 100 index, the drop has been 39,5%. These are real drops and they are important drops because they have consequences for an economy.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>They are for the year immediately passed. I have taken my figures from, I think, 12 October a year back. In so far as the effect of the drop of prices is concerned, this does not only take money out of the pocket of the ordinary individual; it affects the buying power of people who have these assets, it affects their ability to develop, it affects the spending power of the middle classes, an important factor in spending power, and above all it affects the ability of companies to raise more equity capital and more risk capital for urgently needed development in South Africa. One of the factors I would ask the hon. the Minister to deal with tonight and to deal with for the sake of the entrepreneur in South Africa is the point of view of certain Government officials that a 15% return pre-tax is an adequate return on investments in this inflationary age. It gives you a return of less than 10% after the payment of tax. It is unrealistic and does not encourage investment, because if one looks at the Price/Earnings ratio which exists in respect of South African shares&#x2014;again I go to the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> index&#x2014;one sees that the Price/Earnings ratio is down to 4,2%.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. BOTMA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member will excuse me if I do not react to his speech. Actually I expected the fishing industry to be a subject of discussion again, but clearly, so many fish are now being caught among their own ranks and so many nets are being spread that the prophets of doom we had formerly have apparently themselves been ensnared in these nets. It will be remembered how, in the years 1971 and 1972, disaster was predicted for the fishing industry of South Africa and South-West Africa. Wise prophets of doom predicted the general collapse of the industry. They predicted that certain towns would become ghost towns. I have in mind, for example, Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, a theory which found many eager ears and even willing spokesmen. I have in mind charges that were made at the time, even against an hon. Deputy Minister, charges which amounted to his having supposedly furnished the House with false figures. The 1974 season is already past and the catches have proved once again that the confidence in the recuperation of the resources was not exaggerated. As in the past, the Government and the industry chose to be guided by the Department of Industries and the Sea Fisheries Division and also by practical experience and facts. The mentioned bodies deserve thanks and appreciation for the enormous task they have performed. Their confidence and hard work has indeed been rewarded. However, I want to warn that we have not yet reached the end of the road. We should still be continually on our guard against over-exploitation. The events of the years 1970 to 1972 must never repeat themselves. It is estimated that the total resources, before the entry onto the scene of the factory ships, was about 6 million tons. In 1971-&#x2019;72 it was only about 2,1 million, but in 1974 it was already estimated at 3,2 million tons. The resources are therefore showing signs of recovery and a tendency towards steady growth. The so-called split quota, i.e. the division between pilchards and other fish such as anchovies, is still in force and we know that the industry as such would very much like to have the split quota abolished. I fear, however, that this cannot be done arbitrarily. It will only be possible to abolish it if the Sea Fisheries Division, in consultation with the industry, finds an acceptable formula. If the abolition of the split quota were to lead to a further increase in the catch of pilchards, it definitely could not be considered.</p>

<p>We are grateful to be able to say that the industry is already displaying a growing understanding of the value of our pilchards; thus, in the 1974 season, 10 million cartons of fish were canned as against 7,4 million cartons the previous season. I want to make a plea for further research in this regard, so that this valuable product can be utilized to the absolute maximum. I fear that there is not yet 100% utilization of this product, and that even as far <span class="col_5987-5988" refersTo="page_0684"/>as our existing factories are concerned, there is room for improvement. Although the previous restrictions were lifted, and all factories may, in fact, can fish and construct fish canning plant now, we still have certain factories processing pilchards, too, into fish-meal. Indeed, the question could be asked whether it is not time for the canning of fish to be made compulsory. Can we afford to convert this valuable commodity into fish meal?</p>

<p>To illustrate the growth of catches of pelagic fish, I should like to furnish the following figures. The total catch for the year 1972, which was our poorest year, was 968 293 metric tons. In 1973 it was 1 171 817 metric tons and this year, 1974, during the past season, it was 1 235 808 metric tons. Calculated in terms of money, the catch of the 1973 season came to R170 million, while the money value of the catch in the 1974 season was R195 million.</p>

<p>I wish to point out to hon. members that tomato <i>pur&#x00E9;e</i> is extremely scarce and that the industry has to import virtually 60% of its requirements from overseas countries. I think that our farmers would do well to take note of this.</p>

<p>During the 1973 season, the last season for which we have statistics in regard to trawler catches, apart from the pelagic fish, 1 000 000 tons of trawl-fish were caught along our West Coast, viz., the West Coast of the Republic as well as the coast of South-West Africa. Ninety per cent of this fish was caught by foreign powers, i.e. only 10% was caught by South African interests. This is disturbing. I want to plead for a major joint effort to be made by the industry, the Department of Industries and the Sea Fisheries Division, to ensure that the resources of our own coast are better utilized. I want to plead for an intensive market research programme because this is an urgent necessity.</p>

<p>I believe that the authorities and their subjects realize the value of our fishing industry. In South-West Africa alone, for example, about 8 000 Ovambos are directly or indirectly employed in our fishing industry. Apart from this there are about 1 000 fishermen or seamen of whom half are Whites and half Coloureds. A large number of boats are involved. We in Walvis Bay and in South-West Africa are concerned about the shutting down of the local branch of the Sea Fisheries Division. Various reasons for this have been advanced, but I do not want to argue about the reasons now. However, the question arises whether the conservation of the resources should be subordinated to any other consideration. We could also argue that this constitutes a violation of the agreement concluded at the time of readjustment from 1 April 1969. I want us to consider certain investments in Walvis Bay. If we consider the investments of Fisheries Development Corporation at Walvis Bay, we find that the cost of the works already completed amounts to R5&#x00BC; million. The cost of works at present under construction amounts to R3&#x00BC; million. The replacement value of our fishing fleet alone amounts to R30 million and the replacement value of the factory plant amounts to a further R40 million. I also want to ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider a recommendation by the Commission of Inquiry into the Fishing Industry, a recommendation which briefly amounts, briefly, to the establishment of a fisheries board, in the first place, and secondly, that the Sea Fisheries Division be divided into two parts, namely research and control of resources. This matter has been raised here before and for that reason I shall not repeat it. However, I am convinced that the acceptance of the recommendations, as they stand or in an amended form, would strengthen the position of the Director of Sea Fisheries and that it would enable him and his department to achieve still better results. I should also like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he is yet in a position to tell us anything more in regard to the Caracas conference. I read in a pamphlet distributed by the American department that the American ambassador who led that delegation, Ambassador Stephenson, made specific mention of the fact that America suggested a fisheries zone, an economic zone, or an exploitation zone, as regards the sea bed, of 200 miles, subject to certain conditions, and that he was optimistic that they would succeed in having those conditions accepted.

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down, has talked about a subject that I honestly feel I am unable to comment on but I am sure the hon. the Minister will deal with it in his own fashion. I would like to raise another subject that has been touched upon by an hon. gentleman to my right. The hon. the Minister is responsible in some way, though not in the normal sense of that word, for the activities of the public corporations, viz. Iscor, Sasol, the IDC, <span class="col_5989-5990" refersTo="page_0685"/>Escom and Foscor. They are public corporations in the sense that they use or are financed by money paid to the Government by the taxpayers of this country. However, in another sense they are certainly not public in that, unlike other public corporations with shareholders, they are not required to justify the expenditure of that money nor their subsequent performance. They are certainly not public corporations in terms of normal objective economic criteria or disciplines to which other people are subjected. The hon. the Minister said in reply to a question on Tuesday, 8 October, that, so far as Iscor is concerned, that corporation is responsible to him in so far as policy is concerned. That is fine as far as it goes but I would like to come back at a later stage to what that means in practice. Let us be clear about the size of the figures that are involved in this grey area. These five public corporations spent in the five years to 1973, the latest for which I have all the figures, the following amounts to the nearest million: In 1969 R243 million, in 1970 R371 million, in 1971 R314 million, in 1972 R365 million and in 1973 R560 million which gives a total over those five years, as the hon. the Minister will know, of no less than R1 852 million. Nor is that the end of it. As the hon. the Minister himself has told us, Iscor is now going to spend the sum of no less than R3 238 million over the period until 1984. Escom in its latest annual report says that its total estimated capital expenditure for the years 1974 to 1977 inclusive is R915 million. Nobody is going to deny that in the main these public corporations have made a significant contribution to the economic development of this country but these are huge figures and yet there is confusion as to who is responsible for them. It is interesting when they are seen in context. The Minister of Finance, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s colleague, in reply to a question on Tuesday, 8 October, stated that the total amount of income tax paid by all South Africans in the year 1973 amounted to R678 million, let us say R700 million. That means that these public corporations in the last five years have spent 2&#x00BD; times the total income tax bill of this country, and they are now going to spend 8&#x00BD; times that figure, taking into consideration the last five years as well. I think it is time the confusion about the responsibility for these corporations was cleared up. The taxpayers, and indeed, all the people of South Africa, will want to know, to see, and be assured that their money is being spent as efficiently as possible. It is therefore not much comfort when the hon. the Minister makes statements in the Senate such as this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Iscor then decided they would have to get in and buy certain land because they had to make a judgment&#x2014;were they in the future going to be involved in big scale development there? The Government had not given any all-clear at all; it had not come before the Government.</block>

<p>Presumably it comes before the Government for decision. Surely, Sir, the hon. the Minister may or may not agree, but I think any reasonable man should realize that that is a question of policy. Then again the hon. the Minister said in this House and in the Other Place: &#x201C;Iscor is a fully autonomous organization operating on business lines&#x201D;. It cannot be the case; because through no fault of Iscor&#x2019;s, it has to try and produce the entire range of steel products, not made by others, and in addition, the price of its products is controlled. In those circumstances, normal economic or profit criteria do not apply. The Minister himself admitted on Friday, 6 September, that it was impossible to give a financial picture of how Iscor was going to spend R3 200 million. No other business would get away without the discipline of formulating, however difficult the task, their best estimate of how matters would turn out. Surely, that is a matter of policy.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to argue tonight against the domestic policies under which Iscor has to operate. I suspect its management has already done that, and sooner or later the Government will not be able to ignore the forces of the market which will catch up. It has already caught up to the extent of R130 million which has had to be paid out of the taxpayers&#x2019; money, to increase Iscor&#x2019;s capital base. But when we come to Iscor&#x2019;s activities in relation to the outside world, its export contract, the position is different, since the constraints placed upon Iscor&#x2019;s business within our country do not apply in this sphere. It is imperative&#x2014;I hope the hon. the Minister will agree&#x2014;that Iscor should operate in this sphere under the same objective criteria as private enterprise. I have been doing some calculations in regard to the export of 17 million tons of ore per annum at Saldanha. If we assume that the mining cost is R1 per ton, which on the basis of comparable <span class="col_5991-5992" refersTo="page_0686"/>figures, is probably very much on the low side. We assume that the transportation costs are similar to those for the Port Elizabeth line, viz. six cents per ton mile, or R3-20 from Sishen to Saldanha. We assume that another 66 cents per ton must be added for working costs at the harbour. That amounts to a total of R4-80 per ton. Then we see that the price, to give an acceptable return after tax to be received from the purchaser, which we do not of course know, will have to be very high; because it will have to provide a sufficient margin and over and above that to pay the interest on and to service the loan capital of R480 million, or indeed R350 million, if we take off the R130 million of capital which is coming from the taxpayers&#x2019; money. If we assume that such loans have to be repaid over 20 years, the cost of servicing&#x2014;that is, both interest payment and repayment of capital&#x2014;will amount to something in excess of R2 per ton, and probably nearer R2-50, depending on the rate of interest.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to return to the fact that this Minister stated that on all matters of policy, Iscor was accountable to him in the conduct of its affairs. The Minister himself has said that the branch lines of the Sishen-Saldanha railway line will go to the S.A. Railways. Sir, it must be a matter of policy, and indeed, an obligation upon the Minister, in order to avoid duplication and unnecessary expenditure of the public&#x2019;s money, that Iscor should ensure that the line be fully compatible and inter-changeable in every facet with those operated by the S.A. Railways. But when we asked the Minister he replied that this was an unwarranted interference in the operation of Iscor. May I remind the hon. the Minister that he himself has said that this is a public corporation using public money. I would like to end by simply pointing out what the hon. the Minister refused to reply to. He refused to give the answer in regard to the voltage of the system on the line, to confirm that the system would be the same as that being operated by the Railways, that the supply voltage would be the same as operated by the Railways, and he refused to give the cost and the level of additional power required over and above that already available, and therefore it was impossible to work out what the unit cost for the four trains per day on that line would be. To put it mildly, Mr. Chairman, it does not give one confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member&#x2019;s speech has confirmed my suspicion. The hon. member flew in this morning, did he not? During the flight, therefore, he studied the speech he had fetched from there. I knew he was going to make a speech such as this one tonight. I wanted to make a great speech myself this evening, but I shall not do so. I should rather reply to that hon. member. The hon. member has occupied himself in the course of this session by asking questions about Iscor and Saldanha. I think he asked the hon. the Minister nine questions in this regard. He assailed the Minister with questions. Why? Why? Where does the hon. member&#x2019;s interest lie?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North, who has just spoken, is the crown prince of Anglo-American. There has never been a political party in this House which has had so many lobbyists for one multi-national organization as that party has. Then that hon. member dares to ask questions here which make one suspect that all is not well meant. This hon. member granted an interview to the <i>Sunday Express</i> on 6 October. His remarks were reported in this newspaper as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is reasonable to assume that the scheme was impracticable in a normal business sense. Iscor has strayed into the business world and my feeling is that it should proceed on recognized business lines.</block>

<p>What feeling is the hon. member referring to? I have a feeling too quite often. It seems to me that the hon. member has had a feeling here on the eve of spring. [Interjections.] Iscor has a proud record of business and success behind it. Still suspicion <span class="col_5993-5994" refersTo="page_0687"/>is now being thrown on this organization by an hon. member who says that &#x201C;Iscor has strayed into the business world and my feeling is that it should proceed along recognized business lines&#x201D;.

<block name="quote">Mr. Waddell&#x2019;s fears are based mainly on several disturbing problems which have recently arisen at Saldanha Bay.</block>

<p>The reasons he advances are that the sand is allegedly not fine enough for the work, that the ocean floor is difficult to prepare and that Iscor has to enter into a military contract. Then the hon. member says&#x2014;</p>

<p>I say here this evening that Iscor is a national possession; Iscor is our proud national possession; Iscor has a proud record as a successful business enterprise; Iscor is an example of the maintenance of labour peace and the regulation of labour relations within that mightly organization. This interview which was conducted with this hon. member by this newspaperman is meant for foreign consumption.

<p>He is a man who is a director of Highveld Steel; he is the chairman of the powerful LTA construction company; he is a director of Anglo-American. Therefore he should count his words in this House. I censure the hon. member severely for acting in this manner. The hon. member was speaking on behalf of a super multi-national structure in our economy, a structure which has only benefited by everything which has been done by this party, because of powerful influence in this country. He spoke in the manner of an economic strategist who controls the highlands of our economy in South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, his rise in the financial and managerial structure of that super multi-national giant in the Republic of South Africa has been rapid indeed. He became a member of Parliament and at the same time he became a lobbyist for a super organization. However, we and many others doubt that he will ever succeed as a real effective lobbyist for big money. He makes too many blunders. Only a person who was na&#x00EF;ve or arrogant or both, would have asked so many stupid, unwarranted questions in connection with the activities of Iscor. And if the insufferable audacity of that hon. member was not enough, he granted the interview to which I have referred. That hon. member seems to me to be blissfully unaware that Iscor has a proud <span class="col_5995-5996" refersTo="page_0688"/>record of success. He is apparently totally unaware that the same attitude he is adopting now was exposed previously when Iscor was established by this party. What did we hear at that time? We were told that it would be a white elephant; it was a waste of money; we did not command the knowledge. We were asked: What would happen to poor Britain? What would happy to our defence? Who would protect us? If one reads the debates on Iscor at that time, one finds exactly the same attitude running through it like a golden thread. It has been these capitally powerful multi-national organizations which have derived all the benefit from the actions taken by this Government over the years.</p>

<p>No, I have no time to answer questions. The hon. member must be careful about what he says because the outside world is listening attentively to what is said here, particularly in regard to Iscor. The hon. member must not preach company before country. I want to plead with him tonight not to preach company before country. I may also put this question to myself: Will the hon. member ever be able to conform to these norms? I would say that the answer appears to be no. He cannot be considered either as a real South African yet or as purely multi-national. He is something in between&#x2014;a breed on his own. He has a particular super-giant, multi-national, Anglo-American, crown prince, director citizenship. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying this: I have here a book entitled <i>The Multinationals.</i> If the hon. member would read this book, he will realize what I mean. [Interjections.] You have not read it yet; I was the first one to take it out.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is customary to refer to something said by the previous speaker. Sir, I want to say just one word as a very young Member of Parliament to a very old Member of Parliament, and that is that I believe that it is not in good taste to refer to a man&#x2019;s employment or his background or his job when he puts a case on its merits in this House. The hon. member himself might perhaps look into his own conscience and work out whether there is anything that anybody could ever say about him if he were to speak in this House and make the same sort of attack. I think hon. members of the Progressive Party are well able to look after themselves, if they need looking after, but I certainly do not want to be associated with attacks of a personality nature when the merits of a case are being discussed here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to go back to matters which are of more importance at the present moment. I want to deal with the comparison between the situation in South Africa at present and the situation which existed in the 1930s. I was dealing with the question of share prices. The point I would like to make is the following: Why should you invest money in a new enterprise when the spectre hangs over you of being able to make a profit of 15% before tax when you can invest on the Stock Exchange in companies that appear to be perfectly sound and that have an historical earnings pattern of 20% or 25% after tax? It is illogical. Sir, to place oneself in that position and to have that spectre hanging over one. The situation in respect of corporations <span class="col_5997-5998" refersTo="page_0689"/>at the present moment is that high interest rates discourage investment. The companies themselves have to plough back more capital in view of the shortage of money that they can borrow. This in turn affects their ability to pay dividends; this again brings down the share price and affects the company&#x2019;s ability to raise new capital, and therefore one has very little new capital of an equity of venture nature being raised in these times. I think one of the matters to which the hon. the Minister should pay attention is the question of giving encouragement to the raising of new equity and risk capital in order to encourage growth in South Africa. Here, Sir, I want to echo, if I may, the words which the hon. member for Constantia used in respect of profits. I want to say here that exploitation is a crime, but the making of profits is not a sin, and it is important that we encourage the concept that profits are necessary in order to expand South Africa&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make in the comparison between those days and today is the question of the high interest rates. It is quite clear, if we compare the interest rates in the 1930s with the situation today, that far too much short-term money is being invested as opposed to medium-term and long-term money. The fact that there is too little medium and long-term money being invested makes it very clear that people do not have the right degree of confidence that is required, and this is a problem which exists. The use of short-term money in the 1930s. as the hon. the Minister should know, was one of the causes of the collapse of economies and of businesses in Europe and in America at the time. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he, together with the Minister of Finance, should endeavour to make more short-term money available in order to reduce the rates on short-term money so that in fact the relatively speaking medium and long-term rates will go up and you will then have a far more satisfactory position in South Africa.</p>

<p>There is a further matter in respect of borrowing and interest rates to which I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. There is a great deal of agitation today that we should have more foreign borrowings. But foreign borrowings, if they are in the short term&#x2014;and we are encouraging, I believe, too much short-term borrowing overseas are dangerous. I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to what happened in Germany in 1928 and what developed in Austria and Germany in 1930 where the dependence on foreign loans, when eventually they were withdrawn, caused a complete economic collapse which started with the collapse in Austria of the Viennese credit bank and had dire consequences. I believe that when we borrow overseas we must borrow longterm and not short-term.</p>

<p>There is another matter in respect of interest rates which needs attention, and that is the disparity between the level for borrowing and the facilities for credit granting, where the gap has now narrowed to the extent that it has now become a problem for many people and a very real problem. The hon. the Minister may have seen what was said by the Motor Distributors&#x2019; Association only the other day. They made it clear that you could not sell motor-cars if in fact you could not have this kind of credit available. Whereas it may be desirable to restrict a certain amount of credit, the industry requires it to produce because it can only exist that way and it can only provide employment that way. If it cannot sell motor-cars that industry will be in dire straits. It is not only in the motor-car industry that this is happening. We have not yet had, after having raised the point again and again, an answer to the problem as to how television is going to be financed in South Africa, where the money is going to come from and at what rates it is going to become available. The dramatic fact which appears to be hitting people in South Africa is that television sets are going to become so expensive, the financing of them is going to become so expensive, that the very people who should have television, the lonely and the aged, are the ones who will not be able to afford television in South Africa. [Interjections.] Apparently the Cabinet will have television sets and that will solve all the problems.</p>

<p>I also want to deal with this liquidity squeeze and I again want to draw a comparison here between ourselves and what happened between 1929 and 1930 in Europe. Bankruptcies of major businesses are a danger to any community because they have a snowballing effect. I believe that where businesses are no good, where they should not exist for economic reasons, there is no reason to ensure their survival. Where in fact businesses only go under <span class="col_5999-6000" refersTo="page_0690"/>because of a liquidity squeeze or because of a shortage of money when in fact they are sound businesses, that is something which our country certainly cannot allow to take place. I believe that what should happen, with respect, is that there should be a greater endeavour to make money available for productive requirements of South Africa, perhaps away from consumer spending, but that you cannot allow a liquidity squeeze which is in fact so tight that it strangles businesses which should not be strangled.</p>

<p>The fourth point which is also a comparison which can be made, is the drop in property prices. We had this in the 1930 and we now have had it in other parts of the world&#x2014;perhaps the United Kingdom is the best example&#x2014;where eventually certain property has no price at all; you just cannot sell it because you cannot get a price for it. Now there is an endeavour, particularly in one province, at a time when, in fact, you can already not really have a ready market for stands because the property market has gone down, to knock the property market further. I believe that this is an unhealthy and unsatisfactory state of affairs. It is true that one should channel funds to the greatest degree possible to productive enterprises, but we cannot knock the building industry. Here again we had statements over the weekend that many builders are facing very serious financial problems. We cannot afford, in the present state of our economy, to have this going on.</p>

<p>We come to bankruptcies generally. If you look at the 1930s you see there were bank failures; there were matters which caused a collapse of the whole financial structure. We have recently had signs of this in Europe with bank failures in various countries. I want to say that we in South Africa are fortunate that, in fact, our banking structure is sound and that our banking structure is well controlled. However, it does appear that despite that, what we need in South Africa is a feeling of security on the part of the small man. Here for one thing, active steps must be taken to root out the grey market in money which is in fact causing people to lose money and is taking money away from the sectors in which it should operate. The existence of a grey market in money in South Africa will I believe constitute a danger to the economy if it is left uncontrolled and if adequate steps are not taken to deal with it.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is always pleasant to listen to the hon. member for Yeoville. He does not always say the correct things, but what he says he says in such a way that one feels that he is waging a struggle with himself, that he has not yet talked out the matter with himself and that he wants to convince us even before he has convinced himself. I can honestly say that I do not want to say anything more to the hon. member for Johannesburg North than what the hon. member for Carletonville said to him. I think what the hon. member for Carletonville said is quite correct, i.e. that when one finds oneself in certain situations, one should be careful in one&#x2019;s view of other matters. One should always be careful, as he said, to notice certain interests and then to be influenced by those interests so that one may pass judgment on other matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville referred to the decline in land prices. If there is someone who has dealt South Africa a blow or has prejudiced our economy, it is the hon. member for Yeoville. I believe the hon. member had done so unconsciously because he believes that legislation being adopted in the Transvaal at the moment could cause certain problems.</p>

<p>Fortunately I have friends in Pretoria and in Cape Town&#x2014;everywhere. Not for a single moment do I doubt that land is still the basis. The shortage of housing can only cause the price of land to rise, and a temporary break in financing is not going to bring about a <span class="col_6001-6002" refersTo="page_0691"/>drop in the price of land. This is just a period of stabilization, and we in this House should not fan these things and proceed from the assumption that we are going to have a downward trend. We are not going to have it&#x2014;at any rate, not in land. If one takes the trend over the years since 1939, one will see that the mortgages taken on land were usually between 60% and 70%. The money the buyer put into it was, therefore, usually 30%, if he had a mortgage of 60%. Even in the worst times he will only lose 10%, but because land has increased in value so rapidly, one cannot lose out on it. Nobody throws his mortgage away, and nobody throws his cash in. For that reason one only has a variation of 10% and usually an increase of 30% or more. It really is not the correct thing to talk about a downward trend in this House.</p>

<p>But I want to say a few things about inflation. A state of inflation is a far more serious situation than we usually want to suggest, because it very easily affects the social structure. Man as a social being has learnt over the years, from the French Revolution up to the present, that when the social structure is overthrown, the effects are felt on the financial level as well. At the time of the French revolution these problems culminated in a revolution. The major and most important aspect which we should consider is that selling out is not a solution in a time of inflation. I want to remind hon. members that the French experienced the greatest period of inflation of all times in 1790. The extensive inflation round about the years 1790 resulted in the Government&#x2019;s foreign exchange being depleted and, as a result, in their resorting to the most fantastic auction that has ever been held, an auction of the contents of the Palace of Versailles. They sold out instead of working. They liquidated in a time of inflation. In a time of inflation one should work, live, create, and even the circulation of money should be harnessed in such a way that it brings about renewal. But one should be harnessed in such a way that it brings about renewal. But one should not sell out. One should not take fright and one should not become afraid of one&#x2019;s economy, because inflation is really the depression of a businessman. It gives him a chance to breathe, and, if it is applied correctly, it creates greater advantages.</p>

<p>If the hon. member had the ingenuity of Dr. Diederichs, he would understand what I am talking about. The major requirement is that one should not give way to it. We in the Western world can never have a depression again. We may not and will not have it again. There is enough intelligence in world business circles never to allow a depression to take place again. There is in fact a danger that overheating of the economy and slackness on the part of workers, as is to be found in England, can create a situation where the social structure changes to such on extent that there is a change to communism, or to socialism of such a nature that there is no difference between the communistic view and the socialistic view. China is an example of this. In China it was given out that there was no upward trend in prices. This is splendid, not so?, if one looks at it superficially. However, there was no increase in wages either. There the jobless poor live on the farms and live from the land. Is there anyone of us who wants this situation here? In our community we simply cannot allow this. It is for this reason that one has to listen attentively to the financial experts. One of them is a man by the name of John Maynard Keynes. He said a small dose of inflation prevented unemployment.</p>

<p>Can you imagine 15% unemployment? I want to tell the hon. member that we are not talking about bank rates now. I am only talking about unemployment. According to Keynes, the fact of the matter is that one can prevent unemployment by means of a small dose. The financial institutions should co-operate with the governments of the Western world to prevent unemployment in a world where unemployment is one&#x2019;s greatest danger.

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have listened with particular attention to the chief spokesman of the United Party on economic affairs, the hon. member for Constantia. As a junior member of this House I should like to learn from this wise man. However, I have to tell him that I am very disappointed. What we heard was a very fine discourse on well-known economic laws. That information can be found in any text-book of university students. We received nothing new or practical which we could apply to our real structures. On the one hand the hon. member advocates the movement of the free economy, away from State interference, therefore, but at the same time he asks for vigilance against the formation of monopolies, of cartels, of price rings, etc. The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens was especially critical of public corporations, structures which have played a very important role in the development of our economy. When the economy of our country was in the initial stages of its development, there was actually no free capital available and therefore it was necessary for these bodies to be created. Iscor was one of the corporations that came into being in circumstances such as these. Therefore I have to say that that hon. member really did not make a positive contribution.</p>

<p>&#x2026; keeps taking us back to the days of 1920 to 1930 and giving us comparative figures. I want to tell him that he cannot compare the situation in 1930 with the conditions in 1974. The whole economic structure has changed in the meantime. The concept of enshrinement is being applied quite differently to our stock exchange. These pessimistic opinions that are being expressed and these negative tendencies in economies are causing a certain speculative transaction on the exchange which we call &#x201C;bearing the market&#x201D;. The &#x201C;bears&#x201D; are those people who derive benefit from this pessimism.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to point out just one interesting fact. Recently it was ascertained by way of a random test among a few thousand pupils up to the matric age group what their weekly expenditure amounted to. It was found that the average expenditure per child between the ages of six and 18 was 50 cents a week. In the course of a year this represents an amount of approximately R24,5 million. This is a significant factor in the spending pattern of our economy, in the sense that this is a population group&#x2014;only White children were involved in this&#x2014;which has made no real contribution to productivity. These children are dependents. They grow up with a spending psychosis. They grow up in an atmosphere of spending money. As opposed to this, it was recently established in Canada by way of an inquiry that there are 16 000 different professions or jobs available for school-leavers at the moment. That large number of professions is still increasing daily. This shows us the availability of labour for those pupils. Furthermore I want to point out to hon. members that the faculties, intelligence and potential of development of 50% of any ordinary group of people are below normal, and 50% above normal.</p>

<p>This House is perhaps a major exception to general rule.</p>

<p>These indications are of great importance to us; because the time when it was possible in the business world for a messenger to advance to the position of manager, is past long ago. The young business people enter the junior or senior managerial level at a very early age, something which was also referred to by one of the previous speakers. This places a very heavy responsibility, firstly, on the shoulders of those responsible for education and, secondly on our business leaders and entrepreneurs. We have to instruct, train and educate these people in the present climate of an overheated, economy, <span class="col_6005-6006" refersTo="page_0693"/>where spending is the order of the day. However, we have to guide them towards a more profound realization of their particular place in the economy. As far as education is concerned, we have to teach them that character and the other supporting personality attributes remain valid. As far as businessmen are concerned, I want to point out that it is the task of the entrepreneurs to point out to the younger person that ample opportunities await him within this framework of the changing economy. That entrepreneur should make it clear to him what the economy may expect of him. He should guide him in respect of his participation in a full labour market; he should inspire him to fulfil his task to the full and to the best of his ability. He should first learn the simple lesson that he should first earn before he can spend. In Pretoria it was determined that the young workers there are living six months ahead on a credit-spending pattern. In other words, if they should decide to stop buying on credit today, they would only have paid all their debts in six months&#x2019; time. Our youth will have to be taught and guided by business entrepreneurs to manage their affairs correctly. I should like to quote what one of our prominent business leaders had to say on the subject &#x201C;The Place and the Space of the Business Leader in the Modern Economy&#x201D; (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He should be an idealist, a fighter, a builder in this country. He is looking for new opportunities over and above security and protection. He does not want to become a captive citizen who falls asleep because little Father State is looking after him. His aim is to take calculated risks, to dream and to build, to fail if needs be, but always to get up again and try again. He prefers the challenge of life to a secure existence without adventure. He does not sell his freedom for a fixed income on which he can always count. It is his right to think and act for himself, to assist personally in creating his future and that of his country, to delight in what he achieves and to look the world squarely in the face and to say, &#x201C;This is what I have done for this country.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat described himself in all honesty and modesty as not operating in the same economic field as the hon. member for Constantia. Well, Sir I think it is best left at that.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a subject which, although not political, is of the greatest importance perhaps to all the electorate of South Africa this evening. I refer specifically to the public accountability of State corporations to Parliament. I would use the background and the figures given to this House this evening by the hon. member for Johannesburg North when he indicated that we were dealing in terms of thousands of millions of rand which well being made available by Parliament to public corporations of a nature that are in the main private enterprise. I am not concerned with the merits of whether Iscor, Foskor or the IDC are good or bad. We have accepted that they are carrying out an operation which is essentially necessary for our economy. What I am concerned about is the accountability of their financial results to Parliament. I feel that Parliament as such should be given the greatest possible responsibility in relation to the accounts of these organizations. It is well known that the Select Committee on Public Accounts has been defined as the watchdog of Parliament and that at no time in history has Parliament itself been able to evade its responsibility as the ultimate controller of the purse in the eyes of the public. When we realize the increasing measures that are being taken year by year by Parliament to bring about greater strictures on the financial operations of private enterprise&#x2014;I refer to the Companies Act, the Insurance Act and other restricting Acts&#x2014;then I believe that the time has come when we should debate across the floor of the House the greater responsibility of these State corporations in their accounting to Parliament. It has been said on occasions that it is impossible to expect the managing director of a corporation such as Iscor, Foskor or Armscor to come to the Bar of Parliament and give account of its financial transactions, but I submit that this is completely illogical. After all, the Prime Minister himself spends some two days each year accounting to Parliament for his portfolio. The hon. the Minister of Finance and all other Ministers are prepared, in debates such as the one that is taking place now, to account in detail under pressure from members of the Opposition, their responsibility in the handling of public funds. Equally, when we see the glossy annual accounts which are produced each year by <span class="col_6007-6008" refersTo="page_0694"/>such organizations as Iscor and Foscor, the XDC, the IDC and the Bantu Investment Corporation, we know that we are dealing here with thousands of millions of rand. I believe it is only right that we should review this non-accountability of these private corporations and make them accountable if not to Parliament then certainly to the Select Committee on Public Accounts. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs can be entirely happy about the fact that, when questioned by a member of the Opposition on whether the XDC, the BIC or the IDC has shown great losses or great profits, he is able to shrug off responsibility and merely indicate that while these corporations are Government corporations brought to being by Parliament, because they have been given private status it is not incumbent upon him to account them to Parliament. This is a matter which affects the dignity of Parliament as such. In the past years we have had speaker after speaker on this side of the House appealing to Parliament to realize that the responsibility which it has to the electorate in this regard is such that it can no longer be avoided. I therefore make the plea that Parliament, realizing that it is the institution ultimately responsible for the spending of public money, should accept this responsibility. We realize the tremendously dire consequences our economy is facing. When we say this, we are not being pessimists, but we would be unrealistic if we did not admit that we were moving into difficult economic times that have been highlighted by hon. members on this side of the House. When the man in the street sees in his newspaper that R30 million is being spent on this State corporation and R300 million on that State corporation, he should be able to rely on his member of Parliament, whether he represents a Nationalist-held constituency, a Progressive-held constituency or a U.P.-held constituency, to indicate that Parliament itself is satisfied not merely that the annual reports are put on the desks of members of Parliament&#x2014;where they are largely ignored&#x2014;but that the Ministerial portfolios, and specifically the portfolio of the Minister of Economic Affairs who is finally responsible for these State-promoted corporations, have been brought under review and agreed to. Therefore, I submit that it is in the interests of the electorate and in the interess of more responsible accounting that we should get away from the concept that State-promoted corporations are responsible only to themselves. It must be realized that the Government in almost every instance is a shareholder and usually the only shareholder in these corporations. Just as a chairman of any corporation is held accountable by his shareholders, so I believe the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs should be held accountable for the finances, the profits or losses of private State corporations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow up on the arguments advanced by the hon. member who has just sat down, but I should like to discuss certain aspects of our economy. Because of the way in which the South African population is composed, and because of the large percentage of non-Whites who are not very highly developed, we simply cannot afford to allow large-scale unemployment. Because the rate of population increase among the non-Whites is relatively high, South Africa must from the nature of the case maintain a higher growth rate than the countries of Europe, for example, could afford to do. For that reason I consider it to be essential in these times of economic uncertainty for planning to be undertaken and preparations to be made on Government level, in order that we may meet all possible circumstances and in order that we may be able to supply more work in the field of semi-skilled labour in times of economic uncertainty. In Europe, the tendency is for greater unemployment to result in the labour intensive undertakings and for more job opportunities to arise in the technical and capital intensive undertakings. South Africa, however, with its tremendous reserves of semi-skilled or unskilled workers, should ensure that growth is maintained in South Africa, in the future as well, in the event of a worldwide growth stagnation. For this reason I want to express my appreciation for the announcement made by the Prime Minister recently to the effect that it will also be possible to invest White capital in the Bantu homelands in order to make jobs available there. This is obviously being done with the co-operation and the consent of the leaders of the Bantu homeland areas. It is creating a completely new development pattern in the industrial sector in South Africa and it is creating a need for planning to be undertaken in a direction to which the same urgency did not attach in the past. The economy of South <span class="col_6009-6010" refersTo="page_0695"/>Africa is of such a nature, in view of the threat of possible sanctions in respect of strategic goods from overseas, that South Africa must endeavour, on the one hand, to develop an independent and self-sufficient economy and industry. On the other hand, it is desirable for our economy to be developed in such a way as to enable us to promote greater co-operation with our neighbouring states, for by means of this economic co-operation we shall at the same time make our neighbouring states realize that they stand to gain by co-operation with South Africa and that a political struggle against South Africa would hold few advantages for the growth of those states.</p>

<p>I believe that one of the factors in South Africa&#x2019;s favour is the progress that South Africa has made in the petro-chemical industry. South Africa is the world&#x2019;s leader in the field of oil from coal. South Africa tackled this process by means of a State undertaking and has developed it into the largest of its kind in the world. South Africa has even been able to advise the United States in this respect. I quote from a report of the South African Coal and Gas Corporation, Limited (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is increasing interest in the United States of America in the production of gas from coal, which is of course one of the main steps in the Sasol process. Sasol has already been appointed by the E1 Pasco Natural Gas Company of Texas as consultant for the planning, design, construction and putting into operation of the first large-scale facilities in the United States for deriving gas from coal.</block>

<p>But particularly at the present moment, now that oil is being used as a weapon for political purposes by the Arab States, depending on circumstances, I consider it to be essential for South Africa to take the next step in the expansion of the petrochemical industry as soon as possible. This should not be done for the sake of fuel only, although that is also a consideration. In view of the fact that South Africa has tremendous coal reserves, good as well as inferior quality coal, and since it is in fact desirable for the inferior quality coal to be used for the oil from coal process, we are able to make tremendous progress in this field. For this reason I want to appeal to the Government to give serious consideration to taking the next step in the development of our petro-chemical industry in the near future. This would create additional jobs, not only on the coal-mine level, but also on the level of technical skilled work connected with the industrialized process. Then there are all the byproducts, which would provide jobs for a large number of people. I am thinking in particular of the highly essential products of fertilizer in the form of nitrogen, which is one of the important factors in the agricultural industry. In addition, extremely important plastics are being developed today as an ancillary industry to the petro-chemical industry. Furthermore, the increase in the price of oil has caused tremendous cost increases in the plastics industry. Consequently it could only be to the advantage of South Africa if we were to take the next step in the development of our petrochemical industry in the near future. South Africa has developed into an economic giant over the past few years and we must continue to use the economic strength of South Africa to stabilize our political independence in Southern Africa and at the same time to gain the friendship of our neighbouring states by making them realize that co-operation with South Africa would be to our mutual advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Klip River has made quite a sensible speech, and I must say this is the only sensible speech I have heard him make in this House. It seems to me that the United Party in Natal has had quite a good influence on that hon. member, and that may be the reason for the sensible speech he made tonight. I associate myself with the other hon. members who have welcomed the hon. the Minister to his new office. I have the feeling that before the hon. the Minister has had the chance to acquaint himself properly with this post, he will be moved to another post in the course of next year. If this were to happen, it would be unproductive as far as the economy is concerned, for what is the use of the Minister&#x2019;s trying to acquaint himself with this post and then being moved to another one? (Interjections.] The hon. the Minister should realize by this time that in dealing with our side he is dealing with a very responsible Opposition. The problem, of course, is that such an attitude deserves mutual trust, but now we have the hon. the Minister telling us that we should repose unbounded trust in him, <span class="col_6011-6012" refersTo="page_0696"/>while his attitude is that neither the electorate nor the Opposition in this House is to be trusted to the extent to which he wants us to trust him. If the hon. the Minister speaks of Iscor or Saldanha and we ask him questions, he is, as we say in English, a reluctant bride. I cannot understand why the hon. the Minister is unable to tell us, for example, with which overseas undertaking he is negotiating for the construction of the semi-processing plant at Saldanha. Why cannot the hon. the Minister tell us what the construction of that plant would cost, if it is in fact built?</p>

<p>An hon. member wants to know what I want to do with it. If he listens to my speech he will find out.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to make it clear that I feel the hon. the Minister is in duty bound to answer questions in relation to both Iscor and Saldanha. I feel that he is in duty bound to tell us what the cost will be of the semis plant. We must consider his failure to furnish such replies in a most serious light.</p>
