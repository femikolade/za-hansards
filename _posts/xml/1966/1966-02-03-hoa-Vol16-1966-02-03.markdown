<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of Government expenditure after 1 April 1966 until such time as it will be possible to pass the Main Appropriation Act for the financial year 1966-7. As the Budget will not be introduced before the second Parliamentary Session of 1966, financial provision has to be made for a much longer period than usual, that is to say, for approximately seven months. The amounts being requested are R710,000,000 on Revenue Account, R16,000,000 on Bantu Education Account, and R249,000,000 on Loan Account, a total of R975,000,000 or approximately 51 per cent more than 7/12ths of the total appropriation for 1965-6. However, I want to point out to hon. members that Government expenditure shows considerable fluctuations from month to month and that this figure cannot simply be used for making deductions as regards the possible total expenditure for the financial year 1966-7. As is customary the amounts being requested in this Bill may only be spent on services which have already been approved.</p>

<p>As the Budget speech will only be delivered by the Minister of Finance during the second Session, I deem it desirable to avail myself of this opportunity to make a brief statement to the House on the state of our economy and of the treasury.</p>

<p>With certain exceptions, which I shall mention at a later stage, and despite certain problems which called for a great deal of attention from the authorities, the year 1965 was a good one for the South African economy. The provision of employment was at a consistently higher level than in 1964, and the same applies to the volume of industrial production, the value of mineral production, and the value of retail sales. Unemployment remained at a low level. The indications are, therefore, that the real national product has shown a satisfactory increase as compared with the already high figure for 1964.</p>

<p>The main exception to this picture of prosperity is of course agriculture, which has suffered severely as a result of drought over large areas. The Government and the entire country are grateful and glad that large areas have recently had some relief. I hope that relief will also come to those areas which have had no rain as yet and that further good rains will fall in those areas which need it. Even under the best of circumstances, however, the <span class="col_595-596" refersTo="page_0308"/>consequences of the drought will still be felt for a long time in our country, and the Government will continue giving assistance to severely stricken areas.</p>

<p>The most important economic problem with which we had to contend during the past months was the problem of inflation. The economic revival was so powerful and the increase in the total monetary demand for goods and services was so marked that the expansion of domestic production could not take place on a corresponding scale, particularly as a result of certain labour and other bottlenecks.</p>

<p>The main reason for this excessive increase in the monetary demand was, according to provisional estimates, a further considerable increase in gross fixed capital expenditure, in both the private and public sectors. Capital expenditure by the South African Railways and Harbours showed a particularly marked increase. Investment in supplies increased considerably over the year as a whole, as did the current expenditure of public bodies, but private consumption, after showing a marked increase in 1963 and 1964, showed a comparatively small increase in 1965.</p>

<p>Consequently the main factor in the inflation problem of 1965 was the fact that our economy wanted to develop at too fast a rate; in other words, it suffered from &#x201C;growing pains&#x201D;. The result was that gross domestic expenditure showed a considerable excess over gross national production&#x2014;an excess which was reflected in a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, by the middle of 1965 the balance of payments was causing concern. During the second quarter imports, after the elimination of the seasonal influence, reached an annual level of nearly R2,000,000,000&#x2014;a level which could obviously not be maintained for a long period. As a result of certain measures which I shall mention at a later stage, the rate of our imports decreased during the third and particularly during the fourth quarter, so that total imports over the year amounted to approximately R1,800,000,000. Even this figure is approximately 13 per cent higher than the figure for 1964 but this increase is at any rate considerably lower than the increases of 24 per cent and 23 per cent in 1963 and 1964, respectively.</p>

<p>The drought had a very adverse effect on our agricultural produce exports in 1965, but the decrease in these exports was more than compensated for by an increase in the export of manufactured goods. Our gold production showed a relatively small increase. It is perhaps not always realized that the value of our gold production has more than doubled since 1955, which has, of course, made an extremely valuable contribution to our balance of payments, but it would appear that increases of such magnitude can no longer be expected.</p>

<p>These and other factors resulted in the balance of payments showing a large deficit on current account in 1965. However, this deficit coincided with a considerable inflow of both public and private capital. Incidentally, the year 1965 was the first since 1958 in which the South African private sector obtained a nett inflow of capital from abroad. It would appear that the major portion of the private capital inflow during the year consisted of short-term movements, including trade credits. There was nevertheless an encouraging inflow of private long-term capital&#x2014;probably to an amount of more than R50,000,000. The nett result was that the total gold and foreign exchange reserves held by the Reserve Bank, the commercial banks and the Government decreased by only R45,000,000 over the year as a whole.</p>

<p>Here I want to mention one other facet of the inflationary tendencies, namely the price level. The consumers&#x2019; price index rose by approximately 2.9 per cent between December 1964 and December 1965 which may be regarded as moderate under the circumstances. Wholesale prices increased by only 1.4 per cent during the first 11 months of 1965.</p>

<p>Hon. members will remember that the authorities took various measures during the previous session of Parliament in order to combat the inflationary tendencies. The most important measures were the increase of the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s discount rate to 5 per cent, the increase of its interest rate pattern for Government stock, and the imposition of additional liquidity requirements on commercial banks.</p>

<p>These measures undoubtedly had an important effect on the economy, but for various reasons they were somewhat slow in taking effect, and particularly in view of the constantly deteriorating balance of payments position, the Government decided during the third quarter to take certain further steps. My colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, imposed more stringent restrictions on the importation of capital goods and raw materials as well as consumer goods. The Government itself took steps to reduce Government expenditure, particularly on capital works, and obtained the co-operation of the Provincial Administrators in curbing the expenditure of their Administrations. Discussions were also held with the larger municipalities and public corporations and they were requested to curtail their expenditure. In order to finance its own essential capital expenditure in a non-inflationary way, the Government issued a long-term loan at the high rate of interest of 6 per cent on 15 October 1965 and appealed to financial institutions and private bodies and persons to support the loan. The rate of interest on savings deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and on National Savings Certificates was also increased. Finally, and in order to restrict the expansion of bank credit&#x2014;which played such an important part in the development of inflationary conditions&#x2014;the Reserve Bank requested all monetary banking institutions in October 1965 to ensure that the total amount of their discounts, loans and advances to the private sector, excluding the Land Bank, on 31 March 1966 would not exceed the total in respect of these items as at 31 March 1965. Certain <span class="col_597-598" refersTo="page_0309"/>guiding principles to be followed by the banks in complying with this request were also laid down.</p>

<p>It would appear that these measures have achieved their object and have had the necessary effect on the economy. Thus the gross national product and private consumption, according to provisional indications, did not increase considerably during the second half of the year 1965. Gross domestic expenditure, particularly private fixed capital expenditure and investments in supplies, the advances and discounts of commercial banks, and certain other economic pointers such as retail sales, sales of new motor vehicles, building plans approved and transactions involving fixed property even showed a decrease. In other words, the excessive growth rate of the economy has been reduced to a level which it is hoped can be maintained without endangering the equilibrium of the economy.</p>

<p>The measures which the authorities had to take in order to achieve this object have undoubtedly caused some temporary inconvenience or even hardship in certain cases, but fortunately they were not drastic enough to put a stop to our economic growth and thereby cause more prolonged inconvenience and hardship. That is the price we have to pay if we want to retain private enterprise as the basis of our economy, because no such economy can hope to escape cyclical fluctuations, and then the Government must take corrective measures.</p>

<p>In this case we had to deal with an extremely difficult problem&#x2014;a potentially dangerous inflationary situation, coupled with a serious situation in agriculture as a result of the drought&#x2014;but I think we have succeeded in combating the danger of inflation without causing any serious disruption to the national economy. To-day we can feel more at ease in this regard than we could six months ago.</p>

<p>It is of course desirable that these measures should be relaxed as soon as the danger is over. For various reasons I am of the opinion, however, that the time for doing so will have to be chosen very carefully. It is true that the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s foreign reserves, after they had decreased by no less than R150,000,000 during the first nine months of 1965 to R32,000,000, subsequently increased to R383.3 million at the end of the year, and to R415.8 million last Monday. As I have said, at least part of this encouraging improvement was due to short-term capital movements&#x2014;something we cannot necessarily rely on for the future. Furthermore, the full effect of the drought will still be felt for several months&#x2014;both in respect of decreased exports of agricultural produce and in respect of the importation of certain foodstuffs such as maize, wheat and butter. Even in our domestic economy there are signs that inflationary conditions have not been checked altogether; there is still full employment of labour and other production factors, while the ration of money and quasi-money to the gross national product still remains a high one. The effect of the recent salary increases in the public sector, which may gradually increase the demand for consumer goods, must also be taken into account. However, the danger is much less now than it would have been a year or even six months ago.</p>

<p>There are two factors, however, which act in our favour. The first is that personal savings, which decreased sharply in 1964, have begun to increase appreciably; total domestic savings increased by 13 per cent according to provisional estimates, as compared with 4 per cent in 1964. That in itself will facilitate the necessary adjustment in our economy to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>The second factor is that the very reason for the inflationary conditions of the past year was a too rapid rate of capital investment, in other words, the expansion of our production capacity for the future. This increased capacity is now coming into operation, and provided we can continue keeping price increases within reasonable limits, it can form the basis of renewed growth in our economy, both in the field of exports and in the field of production for domestic consumption.</p>

<p>Although it would therefore not be advisable to relax the restrictive measures at this stage, I am nevertheless optimistic about our economic future. I think we can claim to have combated our inflation and balance of payments problems of the past year with a much greater measure of success than many other countries. With a stable Government in power, conditions are favourable for a period of consolidation and of stable growth and increasing prosperity for all sectors of our national economy.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to discuss the fiscal position for the financial year 1965-6.</p>

<p>On Revenue Account, despite additional provision for increased salaries, I anticipate expenditure to be approximately R30,000,000 less than the amount of R1,130,000,000 originally provided, mainly on account of a considerable saving which is anticipated on the Defence Vote. Revenue is anticipated to amount to R1,145,000,000&#x2014;R18,000,000 in excess of the original estimate.</p>

<p>Income tax on persons, import duties and excise duties on beer and spirits were largely responsible for this increase, but we also received a windfall from the Mint as a result of the change-over to the new nickel coins. Consequently I anticipate that we shall end the year with a surplus of R45,000,000 on Revenue Account.</p>

<p>On Loan Account the position is less favourable. Perhaps that will give the Opposition greater joy. In spite of determined efforts by Government departments to cut their expenditure as part of the Government&#x2019;s anti-inflationary measures, expenditure will probably be only <span class="col_599-600" refersTo="page_0310"/>R8,000,000 less than the amount of R461,000,000 that was voted. The financing of the Loan Account also caused us difficulties. Although we expected that the Public Debt Commissioners would invest an amount of R135,000,000, their nett investments will probably be considerably less as a result of the withdrawal of certain funds. The amount of new money invested in Government loans will also probably be less than the R70,000,000 we budgeted for, in spite of the fact that the present rates of interest are the highest ever in our history and in spite of a special appeal made to insurance companies and pension funds to invest in these loans. These institutions can of course still invest in the loan to be issued on 15 February and I hope that many of them will avail themselves of that opportunity. I think I should just add that if they do so, it will redound to their credit. The term of the loan has been extended to 25 years for the very purpose of meeting the requirements of long-term insurance companies and pension funds.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it became clear to me that it would be desirable&#x2014;also from the point of view of the balance of payments&#x2014; to seek additional foreign loan capital. Because of their own balance of payments position, it is at present not easy to obtain loans (other than export credits) in the United States of America or Britain, and consequently I paid a quick visit to France and Germany in August and September in order to study the capital markets in those countries. As a result of that visit the following loans have been negotiated:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) A loan of 50,000,000 French francs (approximately R7.3 million) at 6 per cent from a group of French and Belgian banks under the leadership of the Credit Commercial de France. An amount of 20,000,000 francs is repayable over one year and the remainder of 30,000,000 francs over two years. The loan has been given to the Reserve Bank, which in turn has made a similar loan to the Government.</li>

<li>(2) A loan equivalent to R7.1 million in dollars, French francs and Netherlands guilders from a group of French, Belgian and Netherlands banks under the leadership of the Banque de Paris. The loan is for two years and the rate of interest is 6 per cent.</li>

<li>(3) A loan of 10,000,000 European units of account&#x2014;approximately R7.2 million&#x2014; from the Credit Bank, Luxembourg, through the agency of the Credit Commercial de France, at 6 per cent for two years. The &#x201C;European units of account&#x201D; give the borrower as well as the creditor a choice of European currencies in which payment may be demanded.</li>

<li>(4) A revolving credit of DM 40,000,000 (R7.1 million) from a group of German banks under the leadership of the Deutsche Bank, at 6 per cent plus a commitment fee of | per cent for two years. This loan replaces an existing revolving credit which the Government obtained from the same consortium two years ago.</li>

<li>(5) A loan of $10,090,000 (R7.1 million)from the Banca Commerciale Italiana, in Milan, for one year at a rate of interest of 6 per cent.</li>

</ol>

<p>One of the purposes of my visit was to investigate the possibility of a long-term public issue in Europe. Such an issue has to be carefully prepared and offered at the right moment. The condition of the capital market in Europe is not too favourable at present, partly because of the considerable number of loans which American corporations are issuing there, often with conversion rights. The fact that the Electricity Supply Commission negotiated a public loan of DM50,000.000 (approximately R9,000,000) in Germany in October 1965 has also made it advisable for the Government rather to wait a while. We are keeping in touch with financial institutions in Europe, however, and we are ready to enter the market when the time is ripe.</p>

<p>Apart from the loans which were arranged during my visit overseas, we recently obtained an export credit to the value of $4.6 million (R3.3 million) in connection with the purchase of diesel locomotives arranged by the Railways. The credit was granted by a group of American banks under the leadership of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, and is for six years at 5&#x215E; per cent per annum.</p>

<p>Without all these loans we would definitely have found it difficult to finance our Loan Account for the current financial year. Even with the aid of these loans we shall end the financial year with a possible deficit of approximately R50,000,000 on Loan Account, which, however, can easily be met from the surplus on Revenue Account, or from other sources. I just want to add that these figures of the Treasury are, of course, tentative figures to some extent. It is still a long time to the end of the financial year, but that is what the position will be according to the particulars we have at the moment.</p>

<p>It would not be proper to say anything about the Budget for 1966-7 at this stage; that has to stand over until the next session of Parliament. Until the new tax legislation is passed then, the current rates of taxation will of course remain in force, including the special surcharge on income-tax and the loan levy.</p>

<p>In this year of the fifth anniversary of the Republic it is perhaps appropriate to look back on the progress South Africa has made in the economic sphere during that short period.</p>

<p>During the past five years the South African national economy has shown phenomenal <span class="col_601-602" refersTo="page_0311"/>vitality in all spheres. In this connection the national economy has not only experienced a remarkable boom which has benefited all population groups, but has also displayed the vigour of a rapidly developing country.</p>

<p>The economic pointers present one with an impressive picture of the economic boom during the past five years, and therefore I want to present you with the following picture in the light of a few of the most important pointers. The first and most important is the real rate of growth in our gross national product. During the past five years it increased consecutively as follows: in 1961 by 4 per cent, in 1962 by 7 per cent, in 1963 by 71 per cent, in 1964 by 6½ per cent. That gives an average annual rate of growth of 6¼ per cent after provision has been made for price increases. That is a truly remarkable achievement, all the more so when it is borne in mind that this rate of growth is of the highest as compared with that in the major industrialized countries.</p>

<p>A striking feature of the economic growth over the past five years is the dominant role played by industry. During this period the contribution of industry to the gross domestic product increased from approximately R1,051,000,000, or 23.3 per cent, in 1959-60 to more than R1,800,000,000 or nearly 30 per cent. The physical volume of industrial production increased by approximately 55.5 per cent from 1959-60 to 1964-5.</p>

<p>Similarly the value of mining production increased from R864,000,000 in 1961 to R1,042,000,000 in 1964&#x2014;an increase of 20 per cent. In spite of setbacks on account of drought conditions, agricultural production was maintained fairly well during the past two seasons. During the period 1960-1 to 1964-5 the physical volume of agricultural production increased by approximately 8 per cent. The forestry and fishing industries also experienced a boom period during the past five years.</p>

<p>Increased opportunities for employment went hand in hand with the rapid rate of economic growth. Thus opportunities for employment increased by 34 per cent in private industry, and by 77 per cent in private construction during the relevant period.</p>

<p>One can quote further figures in respect of various economic pointers to illustrate the spectacular economic growth experienced over the past five years, in spite of the fact that we had a balance of payments crisis in 1961, when prophets of doom predicted that it would be the end of practically everything. Thus, for example, retail sales increased by 21.6 per cent; property transactions by 80.6 per cent; building plans approved by 48.4 per cent and Railway revenue by 44.0 per cent.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the foreign sector plays such an important part in the country&#x2019;s economic development and structure, it is also interesting to note the marked increase in the country&#x2019;s foreign trade. Thus imports, for example, increased from R1,127,000,000 in 1960 to approximately R1,800,000,000 in 1965 &#x2014;an increase of approximately 60 per cent.</p>

<p>Exports, on the other hand, lagged behind somewhat, mainly as a result of the effect drought conditions had on the production and export of agricultural products. The relative decrease in the export of agricultural products was, however, partially compensated for by an increase in the export of industrial products, particularly in 1965.</p>

<p>Although the period of prosperity experienced during the past five years was not without its bottle-necks and growing pains, the various economic pointers mentioned above nevertheless bear testimony to the remarkable economic prosperity which South Africa has experienced and is still experiencing. South Africa can easily cause the phenomenal progress it has made to be lost or to be frittered away if it allows its economy to become overstrained, in other words, if its rate of growth exceeds that justified by its capital and manpower resources or the equilibrium of its balance of payments. Then it would be sacrificing stability to a passion for growth; then it would ensure that its boom period would be of short duration, with a long aftermath of misery. But with a stable though dynamic Government that boom period can be extended, although it may entail some temporary inconvenience, and South Africa can look forward to even greater achievements during the next five years.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>We have discussed this Bill at every stage and certain important matters have become clear, and in the light of <span class="col_603-604" refersTo="page_0312"/>these it is necessary that the Opposition, which is speaking on behalf of the people of South Africa in this case, should state very clearly the attitude it adopts in regard to this Bill as it has come to us through the Committee Stage. One thing that has become clear&#x2014;clear on the authority of the Chairman of Committees&#x2014;is that the principle of this Bill is to create a monopoly and that the fight which the Government side put up for several hours was concerned with protecting the interests of 11 privileged companies&#x2014;that was the real principle of this Bill and the Opposition is not game for something of that nature.</p>

<p>The other matter which has become clear is that while it is clearly provided in Clause 6 that Parliament wants to leave this matter to the discretion of the State President&#x2014;that is the intention of this Bill&#x2014;it is also clear that, owing to the fact that he feels morally obliged to adhere to an agreement with 11 companies, the Minister has curtailed that discretion beforehand. Not only has he curtailed his own discretion, but it also appeared that, where in terms of Clause 6 he has to advise the State President, he has further limited his discretion in that he left it to the 11 companies to grant him the concession that he may advise the State President in different terms than those of the existing agreement.</p>

<p>The third point which I want to make in brief is this; the Minister asks us to support this Bill and to allow it to go through at the Third Reading in order to help him, because he supposedly finds himself under a moral obligation; but the Minister also has another moral obligation; during the discussion he referred to that on several occasions. The other moral obligation the Minister has, is the undertaking which he gave to us in this House and to the people during the discussions last year, when he said that companies which had conducted themselves well in regard to third-party insurance, would be allowed to join the consortium; in other words, that under this Bill he would in terms of Clause 6 advise the State President that he should also allow those companies which had acted correctly in regard to third-party insurance to become parties to the agreement in terms of Clause 6. Now we hear that that is not the case. The Minister has to obtain the permission of the existing consortium before he can cause that moral obligation to be met. We now find that there is a moral conflict which the Minister has not solved with this legislation. On the one hand he maintains that he is morally obliged to abide by an existing agreement; on the other hand, we maintain with great emphasis and with just as much right that the Minister has committed himself to a public undertaking which he has given to this House, to the people, to the insurance industry, to motorists and to the public who may put in claims in terms of the Act, that he would afford companies which had acted correctly in the past an opportunity of joining this consortium. The Minister&#x2019;s point of view is that no company acted correctly in regard to third-party insurance. If that is so, one cannot understand how 11 companies can be privileged in that way; then it becomes totally obscure, because the Minister clearly revealed that he felt that even the members of the consortium, of the 11 privileged companies, had not necessarily acted correctly in regard to third-party insurance. The major question which remained unanswered throughout the discussions is this; on which basis are those companies chosen in terms of Clauses 6 and 7? The hon. the Minister maintains that he has in fact replied to that, but he has not. His reply was that his Department had chosen the companies and that he did not even know which companies they were. That was his reply and he wants us to be satisfied with that. He wants us to content ourselves with that reply. The question was pertinently put to the Minister; we asked him to restrict himself to one company only. We received no reply, except that he is hiding behind the Department. The responsible Minister is hiding behind his Department. If there is one matter on which we are agreed in this Parliament, apart from political disagreements, it is that we are opposed to monopolies by certain sections of the private sector to the exclusion of other sections, which can be injurious to the public, which can restrict services to the public. That is one matter which is common cause between the parties. During other stages of the Bill we tried to prevent this by requesting that if there had to be a monopoly, it had to be restricted to the State, and even that we were refused. Even at this stage I am appealing to the hon. the Minister not to commit himself to something to which he and his Government and his Party and the Party on this side of the House and the people of South Africa are opposed on sound principles, and that is creating a monopoly to benefit a group of people at the expense of other concerns which are engaged in the same business, and ultimately at the expense of public interests. Mr. Speaker, there are many matters which have not been cleared up during the discussions. Up to the present, for instance, there has been no clarity as to what the future policy is going to be in regard to premiums for third-party insurance. We have asked this question very courteously, but we could not get any satisfactory replies, and therefore we on this side of the House feel obliged to oppose this Bill once more, because we refuse to be a party to the creation of a privileged monopoly to certain favoured concerns in South Africa, and for that reason we have no choice but to ask that this House should once again divide on this matter.</p>

<p>I am getting up m order to support the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) in this matter. I want to start where he left off, where, with this legislation we are now granting the hon. the Minister the right to create a monopoly, with the aid of this House, with the consent of this House, a monopoly of a certain number of companies in South Africa. It seems to me that we are <span class="col_605-606" refersTo="page_0313"/>dealing to-day with a principle about which this House and the hon. the Minister may perhaps have regrets in years to come, and I should like to plead with him that he should once more consider the matter very carefully, and that he should tell us to-day, once and for all, whether he is prepared to see something of this nature happening in South Africa. In our attempts at helping the hon. the Minister we even went as far as offering him this choice: rather than creating such a monopoly, with everything it may entail, we are prepared to say that a State corporation should be created to control the matter. We are not in favour of that, but if a choice has to be made between a State corporation exercising control over a matter of such extreme importance, and a monopoly of a few companies which can reap their profits on the basis of a fixed percentage while other companies are excluded, then we are prepared to choose the lesser of the two evils. That is how we tried to help the hon. the Minister, but he would not oblige.</p>

<p>I find it peculiar that this matter which affects hundreds of thousands of people and in regard to which an important decision was taken yesterday, in regard to which an important principle was accepted yesterday, was not at all reported in the Nationalist Press this morning. I scrutinized their items dealing with the debates in Parliament; nothing was said about this matter, and it seems to me that in this case, too, there is a measure of &#x201C;embarrassment&#x201D;&#x2014;if I may use that word. It is clear to me that somewhere somebody finds himself in an embarrassing position, and on account of that we come back to the hon. the Minister again. The hon. the Minister was so kind as to consent to it that the agreement made in terms of this Bill would be made known to the public so that they might see for themselves the nature of the agreement into which he had entered with this monopolistic concern, but I should like the hon. the Minister to consider the fact that when he has made this agreement known, he would still find himself faced with the position that it would be too late to try to correct that which has been bungled or with which we do not agree. On account of that I am making a final appeal to the hon. the Minister to reconsider his point of view. We are dealing with a serious principle. If he is not prepared to listen we shall have to follow the lead which the hon. member for Yeoville has given.</p>

<p>You are on the wrong Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, 1 was about to say that that same hon. Minister has quite a different image when it comes to third party motor vehicle insurance. Now that I have been permitted to give the Minister this left-handed compliment, I must proceed to criticize him very severely on behalf of the public of South Africa, and not just the Opposition here. I must criticize him on behalf of all the motorists involved, and on behalf of those who, through no fault of their own, are the have-nots in the insurance industry, for the action which he proposes to take when this Bill becomes law. Mr. Speaker, we have canvassed this matter reasonably well, and yet there are many things which can be said against the Bill&#x2014;which remain to be said. Among them, for example, is the fact that certain companies have, for better or for worse, developed their business by relying on a certain portfolio of insurance&#x2014;a certain type of income&#x2014;which may be a considerable source of income, and have established their premises, their staff and their organization in the expectation that, other things being equal, they will be permitted to continue, under a system of free enterprise, to pursue that part as well as any other part of their business. They are now in the position where they have to think very seriously about how they are going to reorganize themselves. At a time when expert or even skilled labour is not easy to come by, they have to do this. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he is creating unnecessary difficulties by placing a large number of employers who, in each case, have a substantial complement of employees, in the position where they have to start considering whether they should dispense with the services of one or more of the members of their staff. A man who has been trained in the insurance field or any other field usually prefers to continue to work and earn his livelihood within that field. Therefore, Sir, if Company A. which is one of the 59 have-nots, has to dispense with the services of a man it has employed for many years in its third-party department&#x2014;and in some insurance companies you will find that it is quite a big department, with a large number of employees in it&#x2014;the odd thing about it is that that individual cannot go to another company readily, because there are only 11 companies left in the field which can avail themselves of his services. There are no longer 70 or 80 companies that can use his experience and perhaps his integrity, in their business&#x2014; for example, as an assessor or an appraiser of damage. That person&#x2019;s field of employment has shrunk to the group of 11 companies. I think that the hon. the Minister should have given some regard to that aspect of the matter before he placed some of these companies in a position of great advantage, while placing the remaining companies in a position of very serious disadvantage.</p>

<p><span class="col_607-608" refersTo="page_0314"/>Another aspect of the matter is that, regardless of what the hon. the Minister has said, or may say, he cannot even pretend to give the public the assurance that it will be as convenient, let alone more convenient, to obtain these tokens which are required under the law, at the time when they are required by the individual motorist. Mr. Speaker, some of us have seen what happens then. We have seen it happening under normal conditions. Others have seen it under the abnormal conditions of last year. But even under normal conditions, when the time came for the motoring public as a whole to take out their third-party insurance, there was considerable pressure on those companies, regardless of the fact that Parity had collared 42 per cent of the turnover. Under normal circumstances there is great pressure on the companies, which have to make available not only the services of their staffs, but also the tokens at the appropriate time. All the motorist has to do is to look for a company that will insure him. The convenience of the public&#x2014;I believe the hon. the Minister does study it when it comes to one of his portfolios, namely that of Railways&#x2014;seems to have been completely disregarded in the case of this portfolio, under which this Bill will be applied. With great respect to the hon. the Minister, nobody can pretend that these 11 companies, no matter how rapidly they intend or hope to expand, in the acquisition and training of new staff, will be able to make available these facilities as and when they are required. The fact is that, regardless of how enterprising any one or more of these 11 companies may be, they cannot overnight or even in one year take the place of the 70 or 80 companies that were trading in this field. They cannot. A company has been included in this group which, up to the end of December, was responsible for the insurance of not more than 129 motor vehicles out of a total of 1,700,000 motor vehicles in South Africa. The hon. the Minister has talked of the convenience of the public. He referred in very derogatory&#x2014;and, perhaps, justified&#x2014;terms to what happened in the case of those companies which, when the Parity collapse took place, were to be found only in virtually inaccessible places like the fifth floor of some building where one could not get to them in time. Having regard to that, does the hon. the Minister seriously want to tell the House that a company which up till now&#x2014;or up till the end of December&#x2014;has had no more manpower, know-how and facilities than to deal with 129 clients? &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Then, Sir, I merely want to complete this point by saying that 1 doubt whether the hon. the Minister expects the House to believe that a company which up to now has dealt with 129 clients can now take any substantial part of 1,700,000 clients overnight. The argument in regard to the convenience of the public falls rather flat, I think, when you consider what the Minister has actually done.</p>

<p>We have dealt to some extent with the comments that have been made in the Press on the subject of third-party insurance in South Africa. There were comments which were justified in many cases, and perhaps not justified in some. When a public opinion-maker like a responsible journal calls the whole thing &#x201C;a farce from beginning to end&#x201D;, I think the hon. the Minister and this House should pay some attention to the situation that is being created. It is perfectly clear that no one&#x2014;not even the Minister&#x2014;emerged with any credit at all from the Parity collapse. It is perfectly clear that the hon. the Minister reacted to it very strongly. He was certainly very displeased with what had been done or what had not been done by his Department or by other departments, either to prevent that collapse from taking place, or to clean up the mess that was left as a result. Whereas there may be some validity in the Minister&#x2019;s belief that to some extent the insurance industry itself has blotted its copy book by the actions of certain individual companies, he has not been heard to tell the House in his second-reading speech that he believes the industry as a whole was not prepared to carry out its obligations, whether it was financially embarrassing to do so or not, in terms of the Motor Vehicle Assurance Act. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, one is still entitled, I think, at this late stage to urge the Minister to consider the fact that he must deal with the position as a whole rather than to look at one segment of it and say: I am satisfied with this little piece of it, or I am not satisfied, and I am going to make my decisions in accordance with the appearance of this segment. The whole being greater than the part, or segment, <span class="col_609-610" refersTo="page_0315"/>the whole industry is affected by this type of legislation. The whole insurance industry may be beneficially or adversely affected as the case may be, but the point is that the whole industry is entitled as of right to full consideration from the hon. the Minister. It emerges very clearly that whatever his action was after the Parity debacle, after that sorry episode, the Minister did not apply his mind to remedies which would embrace the available manpower, resources and co-operation of the insurance industry as a whole. I should like to urge on the Minister, even now, the necessity for considering whether, by accepting the point of view which has been put forward by the Opposition, he can see his way clear to pin-point those particular companies about which, according to what he said during the second-reading debate, he has evidence as to their desire to obstruct and their failure to co-operate, and say: I will not give these companies an opportunity&#x2014;but I will give all the others an equal opportunity of sharing the burden, if it is a burden, or the privilege, if it is a privilege, of carrying third-party insurance in South Africa. I would like him to think again, before the third reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>This stage of the debate in this House and the Committee Stage, have, I think, been distinguished by the absence of contributions of any substance by anyone who should know something about this question from the other side of the House. As the hon. member for Maitland has already pointed out, looking through the <i>Burger,</i> a Nationalist Party organ, this morning, I could see no report of yesterday&#x2019;s debate at all. And I am not surprised. If I were running a Nationalist Party organ, this is a matter about which I would be very embarrassed. And Sir, the embarrassment is reflected in those benches. I am referring particularly to the Select Committee members on that side of the House; they are standing in the lobby. Not one of them took part in the debate. I must say that in respect of one of them there might be something to be said because he is now a Deputy Minister and perhaps it is not customary for Deputy Ministers in other departments to take part in debates which are conducted by other Ministers. Be that as it may, Sir, no one else has taken part. And I vouchsafe, Sir, every single one of them is opposed to this Bill. That is the only conclusion one can come to. One wonders therefore why the hon. the Minister has pressed this Bill. One wonders what pressure has been on the hon. the Minister in all these circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I have allowed the hon. member to make his point, but now he must return to the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister is persisting with a Bill, the principle of which is to create a monopoly of II companies. That is the Minister&#x2019;s concern. That is why he is pushing this through. We on this side of the House are concerned with the motorists and the general public. Having regard to that, how can the hon. the Minister justify pressing this Bill through at this stage at all? The hon. the Minister must surely have regard to what the commissioner said in the Parity inquiry. I should like the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, to indicate just what his views are on the findings, the views and the animadversions of Mr. Justice Marais who was the commissioner of that inquiry. There is one thing that is quite clear, and that is that as sure as God made little apples this Bill is going to result in higher premiums, because the hon. the Minister arranged with these companies that they would pay out of the 75 per cent all the claims and legal expenses.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the premiums must go up. They must go up because the 11 companies cannot provide the machinery and the personnel for the settlement of claims. I am not talking about persons getting their insurance&#x2014; I am talking about the settlement of claims. I hope that the hon. the Minister, having regard to his present attitude, is going to ensure that on the dead-line when these disks for third-party insurance have to be procured in terms of the Act, some arrangement is going to be made for this. Or does the hon. the Minister have in mind that he is going to proclaim a sort of period of amnesty&#x2014;a period of truce during which motorists can run about the roads without disks, but nevertheless be covered? Because what has happened hitherto is that these 80-odd companies have always sent out reminders to their clients. If I were one of the excluded companies, I most certainly would not make available to a company in the consortium a list of all my clients. The result is that persons are not going to receive reminders from their insurance companies as they normally do and that a number of people on the last day are going to find themselves without any cover and they are going to have to find a company which can give them that cover. This is going to be limited to 11 companies whereas 80 did it before.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister has had regard to this aspect because this is one of the things that is going to result unless the hon. the Minister does in fact broaden the scope of this consortium. He is entitled to do so. The Bill states that the State President may allow any other company to enter the consortium. The hon. the Minister is going to advise the State President. But what is so peculiar about this Bill is that in one clause we in effect validate an illegal agreement the hon. the Minister has entered into with a number of companies, and in the next part of that clause we give to the State President a discretion to allow other companies into the consortium. Now the hon. the Minister says he is morally bound by the agreement but the agreement, as I understand it, states that no one is allowed into the consortium except with the unanimous approval of all the other members of the consortium. At this stage I want to ask <span class="col_611-612" refersTo="page_0316"/>the hon. the Minister to reconsider the reason he has given us over the past few days as to why he is pressing on with this Bill, namely that he is morally bound by the agreement. Mr. Speaker, if he is not morally bound by that part, then he is not morally bound by anything at all. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will in this agreement put in some clause which will ensure that the settlement of claims by the consortium companies, by the persons with whom the agreement is made, is going to be done on a proper business-like basis. In other words, when the hon. the Minister implements this Bill, is he going to ensure that there will be some means of checking up on the settlement of claims by these consortium companies by his Department. I think this is very important and if the hon. the Minister can devise such a scheme, he should put it into effect. He must write this into the agreement and he must have a penalty clause in the agreement to the effect that if any company does in fact settle claims other than on the proper basis or on a higher basis than should perhaps be done, he should have the power to exclude that company from the consortium.</p>

<p>The other aspect which arises is the question of morality. In April of last year the hon. the Minister justified the contents of this Bill on the basis that there were all these motorists formerly insured with Parity and who were now going to new companies, and the companies were not playing the game. They were putting obstacles in the way of persons wanting to obtain third-party insurance because they did not want to provide third-party insurance because they did not like the sort of risk that Parity had carried before. So the hon. the Minister said that he was going to make an arrangement with certain companies to do this business exclusively because the other companies were not playing the game. Motorists could not obtain their insurance which they were compelled by law to do. Then yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister made the most remarkable statement that has been made throughout the whole debate on this matter. He was pressed to name those companies which had been excluded and which had not played the game. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply was that as far as he was concerned all insurance companies had not played the game&#x2014;all of them, including the companies in the consortium. As I said to the hon. the Minister at that time and before, I have documentary evidence here that one of the big companies which has been included in the consortium, was not playing the game.</p>

<p>I will show this document to the hon. the Minister if he wants to see it. If the hon. the Minister is going to renegotiate an agreement and put it on any sort of moral basis, and if he is influenced by any moral basis, then he should see it and I will show it to him. I am not going to name the company here but the document is here if the Minister wishes to see it. So on the basis that in fact all the companies did not play the game and were obstructing certain persons from obtaining insurance under the Act, how does the hon. the Minister justify the choosing of those 11 companies. The Minister says that as far as he is concerned&#x2014;and he is responsible, as he agreed &#x2014;none of the companies played the game, and then he says that he left it to someone else to choose the 11 companies in the consortium. Whatever morality there was in this agreement when the Minister announced it in April of last year, has now disappeared completely with that statement by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has had schemes with the unanimous approval of both sides of this House put before him previously&#x2014;schemes which he could implement here. You will remember, Sir, that the Select Committee on this matter in 1964 produced a Bill which was read in this House. The Bill provided for a pool, which in effect provided for the same scheme as this Bill, whereby all companies which were registered would be able to share in this pool. All the premium-income would go into the pool, just as is going to happen with the consortium, and that would therefore be protected. Now why can the hon. the Minister not implement that and include in it, if he must, all the conditions that he wants&#x2014;the conditions which he is going to make applicable to the consortium. Is there any reason why the hon. the Minister cannot do that? I do not think that there is but perhaps the Minister can indicate why he has to resort to this step when with the unanimous approval of everyone in this House, he had a foolproof scheme presented to him but which was not accepted by his Department. The hon. the Minister has abandoned his responsibilities. He has abandoned them because in effect he is saying to these companies: &#x201C;You carry on this business exclusively. You need only use 75 per cent of your premium-income to settle claims and for the legal expenses in connection therewith. The 25 per cent that remains you may keep and if you cannot come out on that then do not worry; I will put up the premium&#x2014; the public will pay for it, you will not carry any risks so do not worry.&#x201D; That is not what the hon. the Minister was entrusted to do. He was entrusted to keep control of the situation using the normal channels of commerce and insurance&#x2014;the best, the cheapest, the most efficient method for the benefit of the public. The hon. the Minister has abandoned that system and he is going to be responsible for it, his Government is going to be responsible for it, every member on that side of the House is going to be responsible for it because when the moment came to express their views here, they were lacking. There is without any doubt a number of them who are opposed to this measure, not only on principle but on the basis that it cannot work in the future. When the premiums go up, the hon. the Minister will be responsible and hon. members on that side will be responsible.</p>

<p>No, I am not ashamed. Those hon. members ought to be ashamed of themselves for adopting that attitude. That is typical of the United Party&#x2014;they are never consistent in regard to any matter. That is the reason for their sitting there and becoming fewer at every election. It is simply for that reason that the people of South Africa do not trust them. They never know when they are going to be consistent in regard to a particular point of view&#x2014;and that is particularly true of the hon. member for Yeoville. Last year when all these difficulties started, they were most concerned about them. They admitted that the companies had to a considerable extent placed obstacles in the way of motorists who wanted insurance. They were most concerned about that. They saw all the newspaper reports, they saw the telegrams which were received, and they themselves received telegrams and telephone calls; then they were most concerned about the matter; then they expected the Minister to do something drastic. The hon. member for Yeoville said this:</p>

<block name="quote">It is stated in the Press reports that conditional selling of third-party insurance is being suggested; that companies refuse to give motorists third-party insurance unless they take out a comprehensive policy at the same time, and that the motorist is required first to obtain some form of road-worthy certificate. There is unrest and uncertainty in the minds of the public.</block>

<p>At that stage the hon. member wanted to know whether I was going to make a statement in regard to the matter. That was exactly what I did. The hon. member continued and according to Col. 4679 of the Hansard of 23 April 1965, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I readily agree that it is natural for the Minister to act and that he must act drastically in order to prevent a chaotic position from developing in regard to third-party insurance.</block>

<p>I want hon. members to listen now. As I said yesterday, this hon. member is never able to adopt a firm attitude. He is slippery and always sees to it that he leaves a back-door open so that when one corners him on one point, he slips out with the aid of another.</p>

<p>Surely there is more than one company. What I suggest here is that last year hon. members on the opposite side approved by implication of the action I took. That was when they saw that chaos would develop. They themselves asked the Minister to take drastic action. I informed the House at that stage that I was entering into an agreement with a small group of companies. They agreed to that by implication. But, as I have said, once again this hon. member has, as usual, left open to himself a back-door through which he can escape. That is what he has once more tried to do now. It is simply impossible to corner him on a particular point of view.</p>

<p>He is as slippery as an eel. It is simply impossible to get a grip on him. Allow me now to refer to a remark made by the hon. member for Durban North (Mr. M. L. Mitchell.) That member was most concerned about the fact that members on this side of the House were not participating in this debate, and from that he deduced that members on this side of the House did not support this measure. That is, of course, a totally wrong deduction. Every measure introduced in this House is submitted to our caucus, and every member will confirm that everybody who objects to a measure has and is given every opportunity of raising that objection. They will also be able to confirm that when this measure was served before the caucus, nobody rose in order to object to it. Those are the facts, facts than can be confirmed by all hon. members on this side of the House. The hon. member also said that there was no report in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> on the debate on this matter which was discussed in this House yesterday. That is possible. In this regard, however, I should like to point out a major difference between this and that side of the House. As regards the opposite side of the House, we know that they always wait for the British newspapers to give them guidance before they adopt an attitude in regard to a matter. That is not the case with this side of the House. That is the difference. Over the years it has been proved time and again that they are always waiting for guidance on the part of newspapers, especially that of <i>The Sunday Times,</i> before they adopt an attitude. The moment they have been given that guidance, they adopt an attitude. This side does not do that. On the contrary. This side gives guidance to the newspapers.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that the eleven companies which constitute the consortium, dictate to you?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is talking nonsense. I was the one who summoned them together. [Interjections.] Have you ever heard such silliness, Mr. Speaker? I took the initiative to summon these companies together; now it is being said that they instruct me. Surely that is a nonsensical remark. And hon. members know that it is a nonsensical remark. Then there is also the question of the discretion of the State President. Hon. members are alleging now that the Minister has curtailed this discretion of the State President beforehand. That they say owing to the fact that the Minister is under a moral obligation to the 11 companies. But I have already dealt with this point. The discretion of the State President is not curtailed in any way. It is constitutional practice that I, as the Minister, should advise the State President. I said that I was morally committed to these 11 companies. That is so. I am morally committed to this extent, namely that I gave the undertaking that I would see to it that these 11 companies would again be admitted to the consortium. That is quite correct. But I have also repeatedly said in this debate that the possibility was by no means ruled out that other companies could also become parties to the consortium.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have also said that it was a possibility that this provision could be removed after discussions with the companies in question. You see, Mr. Speaker, that I try to act honestly and decently, and I try to keep my word, in contrast with hon. members on the opposite side of the House. When I <span class="col_617-618" refersTo="page_0319"/>give my word, I keep it, and seeing that I have given my word to these 11 companies, companies which operated under the most extremely difficult circumstances, it is my intention to redeem that pledge. At the same time I want to say that I am quite convinced that it will be possible to take this right of veto out of their hands. That will probably be done so that the State President may have the exclusive right of veto as far as the addition of more companies to the consortium is concerned. But it is my intention to keep my word that these eleven companies will form part of the consortium. There should be no doubt in that regard. The hon. member also asked on what basis the eleven companies were selected originally. This point, too, I have covered repeatedly in my replies to the debate. I have said that I have instructed my Department to summon together companies whose boards of directors are here in South Africa, because there was no time for companies to consult overseas boards of directors. That was necessary so that an immediate ruling might be given. Within a day or so six companies were summoned together.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I know of at least one South African company which you omitted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There are three such companies, but there are other reasons for the fact that they have not been invited, reasons I do not want to mention here in public. The six companies summoned together were willing to include another five companies in their ranks. After a conference they suggested the names of these five companies. The hon. member also said that there was one thing about which Parliament was agreed, and that was that a monopoly which could be injurious to the public and would curtail services to the public, would not meet with the approval of Parliament. In this regard I agree with him. As far as a monopoly of that nature is concerned, all of us in this House are agreed that we cannot tolerate that. But now I suggest that this monopoly is a different sort of monopoly, which is indeed in the interests of the public, and which is decidedly not to its disadvantage. I suggest that this monopoly is going to bring more benefits to the motorists than third-party has ever done in the past. I have already advanced my reasons for this statement. For instance, there cannot be another repetition of the Parity debacle. I have also pointed out that if I had originally yielded to the demands of companies for a 20 per cent increase in the premium tariff, motorists would already, over a period of two years, have had to pay 40 per cent more in premiums. In the first instance, under the new set-up motorists will therefore already be spared this. Now we find that there are still hon. members on the opposite side, the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel), for instance, who maintain that these eleven companies will not be able to manage all third-party insurance. But does the hon. member realize that Parity alone undertook more than 40 per cent of this type of insurance in South Africa? If one company could do that, there is no reason for 11 companies not being able to undertake all insurance. Furthermore, the hon. member for Durban North alleged that I have not yet said anything about what the future policy in regard to the premium tariff would be. He alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that &#x201C;as sure as God made little apples, premiums will increase&#x201D;. But as far back as last year I said that the possibility of an increase of the premium tariff would not be ruled out. According to Col. 4704 of the Hansard of 23 April 1965, I said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member wanted to know whether, if the companies which agreed to undertake all the insurance, suffered a loss,, they will be compensated. I have given the companies the assurance that if the necessary statistics are placed before the premium committee to prove that they are running insurance at a loss and that increase of premium is recommended, I will accept that recommendation.</block>

<p>Therefore I said last year that the possibility of an increase of the premium tariff would not be ruled out. Why does that hon. member now repeat that question? In addition to that I repeated that statement in the course of the present debate. What the hon. member forgets, is that if I had complied last year with the request of the premium committee to increase the premium tariff by 20 per cent, motorists would already have paid 20 per cent more in premiums. Under the new scheme motorists pay the same premium both this, year and next year. Is such an agreement not to their advantage?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not necessarily. In view of the fact that the money, which will be collected in premiums in the future and which will be invested, will mean a few million rands extra revenue to the Fund, I am convinced that it will not happen. On account of that it may well be maintained that motorists will have greater protection against an increase of the premium tariff, than has been the position up to now.</p>

<p>No, the hon. member is referring to something else. But allow me to remind the hon. member that if he should look at the evidence submitted to the Select Committee, he would see that the companies did not want to have any dealings with the pool idea. They intimated that they would refuse to co-operate.</p>

<p>The hon. member should read the evidence again. The hon. member also inquired of me whether my Department would exercise any form of check as regards claims. Let me inform him that there will be a special claims inspectorate to check this aspect of the matter. If it is necessary such a provision will be included in the agreement. The hon. member may rest assured that seeing that we are dealing with a smaller number of companies, the control which my Department will be able to exercise, will be much more effective. Any company which does not strictly maintain payments with regard to the settlement of claims will most certainly no longer remain a member of the consortium. The whole purpose of the scheme is to protect and benefit motorists.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to repeat again that in my opinion this measure is in the interests of the country. It is true that it is not in the interests of certain companies, but I maintain that it is decidedly in the interests of the country and motorists in particular.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>It is pleasing to find, Mr. Speaker, that for once it is possible to approve the action taken by the Minister of Transport. It is also pleasing to note that the Department of Transport has brought up to date its mechanical work and that it appreciates a less obvious aspect of its activities namely the maintenance of the health of its personnel. This is an equally important aspect. For years the Railway Sick Fund has looked after the health of the staff. The Administration has other problems, a problem not of ill-health so much as of maintaining good health, especially the health of its most specialized servants. The Department of Railways and Harbours is in more than one aspect unique. Some of the work is so specialized that the Department has perforce to train its own key men, because generally speaking it is impossible to recruit such highly specialized men on the labour market.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What clause are you referring to?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from><span class="col_621-622" refersTo="page_0321"/>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The clause in terms of which the retiring age of pilots is increased. The Department has perforce to recruit men of this type from universities and technological colleges. In any event, men for these specialized positions must have had a basic training in that particular kind of work for which they are required. Thus you will find that although a man has had a basic scientific training that does not necessarily fit in for work on the Railways in that sphere on account of the fact that the particular scientific work on the Railways is of a highly specialized nature. Generally the work of the Railways is to move vehicles from one place to another, whether it be by land, by sea or by air and in each case the control of the vehicle is in the hands of a single man. One man is the final arbiter as to whether a vehicle will move or remain stationary. To see that they are moved, that is the job of the Railways. For this the services of key-men are required. Take away those men who are at present responsible for the moving of the vehicles and you grind the entire transport system of the country to a halt, much more than the application of oil sanctions ever could. Since the time when mechanical transport came into use we have come to rely to ever-increasing degree on the services of these individuals. It is they, whether pilots, captains, train drivers, etc., who really run the Railways. All else is subservient to them. Until recently it was considered that age was sufficient reason for retirement. In so far as this is concerned, I wish to congratulate the hon. the Minister on having made some progress at least. What is more, in order to be absolutely certain the age limit was determined at a much lower age than was necessary. Now, the way age is arrived at is by counting birthdays. This science has proved to be one of the most unreliable of all suggested methods. The sooner this is therefore completely abandoned, the better. A man&#x2019;s age is not equal to the number of his birthdays but is determined by the state of vital organs. Slowly but surely the medical profession has found the means of measuring the age of these organs. After having arrived at a true estimate of their real value, it is decided whether they are in fact in good working order. Let me refer to the engine driver. It was considered that he should be retired at a certain age because of his vision. That is how the date of the retirement of certain men is arrived at on the Railways. And, Sir, I want to point out that this first step, or really the second step of raising the retiring age of pilots is a move in the right direction. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to go further and try to devise a different method of determining the retiring age of all railway employees. Some of the Minister&#x2019;s porters, for instance, stagger on their feet although they are only 50 years old, while others could easily carry on until 70. Yet they are all discharged compulsorily at a certain age.</p>

<p>I should like to say something about the question of a man&#x2019;s vision, which is of particular importance as far as the engine driver is concerned. By means of scientific tests it can now be determined with a high degree of accuracy how good a man&#x2019;s sight is. The tests indicate how far he can see with accuracy and whether he has a good judgment of distance. Furthermore tests can reveal a man&#x2019;s muscle-nerve reaction and his ability to act correctly when under stress, to act as he has been taught, to act as his judgment tells him, and not to panic. All these characteristics can be gauged with great accuracy. What is more, a man&#x2019;s reactions in the future can be predetermined by means of these tests. The results of the tests can be a warning of a man&#x2019;s deterioration in some direction or other.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we must abandon completely the idea that when a man should retire can be determined by his years. That idea is wrong. Certain men come to light with their best performance after numbers of years. It is time&#x2014; (and it would be a good example)&#x2014;that this, the largest industry in the country should discontinue turning out old people and thus cause them to eke out a miserable, lonely and useless old age while they are capable and willing of giving many years of productive work by being retained in the service. It should be productive employment for men who do not work productively are parasites upon those who do. The old men who work are men who produce something. What do savings do, Sir? Savings buy only the work of the worker who is actually working. That is all that can be bought. Too many pensions will absorb all production. We must have more work and fewer pensions.</p>

<p>I trust the thought which has been revealed by the hon. the Minister in this Bill will go further and apply to a wider field. Let all men&#x2019;s working capacity be judged by their output and not by the number of their birthdays.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What the hon. member has just said is very interesting. But it did not really have much to do with this Bill because the Bill deals exclusively with the retiring age of pilots, and this measure has been introduced at their request. The hon. member pleaded for the abolition of age as the criterion of retirement. Well, as a medical man he knows that one cannot accept the state of health of a person as the norm, differing as it does from individual to individual. One might find one man being quite healthy at the age of 60 whilst another is almost finished at the age of 50.</p>

<from>HON. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point he was making.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the reason why we have a definite age limit, as we also have in the case of pilots. They are subjected at half-yearly intervals to very stringent medical tests. If the examination reveals that anything is wrong with the pilot, for instance a slowing down of <span class="col_623-624" refersTo="page_0322"/>his reaction&#x2014;which is the greatest danger&#x2014; then he hx2as to retire.</p>

<p>The present position is that workers on the Railways retire at a certain age. Now, the problem here is that when a man enters the service of the Administration a contract is entered into with him, and that contract forms the basis of his employment. In other words, if the contract stipulates his retirement at the age of 60 or 63 years with a pension, that course must be followed. The only way in which the retiring age can be increased is by obtaining the concurrence and the support of these people. Because, Sir, it would be wrong morally, after having entered into a contract with a man, to increase the retiring age against his wishes. Some years ago I increased the retiring age to 63.</p>

<p>I had to make it optional for those already in the service before that particular Act was promulgated. Of course, those who entered the service after that date, have to continue until the age of 63 years. I know that life expectancy is much higher now than it was 10 or 20 years ago, and I think that a man of 60 or 63 is quite fit enough &#x2014;in most occupations, at any rate&#x2014;to continue his work.</p>

<p>Yes, he is most useful because of his wealth of experience. Sometimes these men are valuable, and one cannot really afford to lose their services. As I said, the raising of the age limit can only be done with the support of the staff. What is more, Mr. Speaker, the raising of the retiring age limit from 60 to 63 in some groups and 55 to 58 in others some years ago has not really appealed to most of the staff. Only a small percentage choose to remain on in the service of those who have the option. Most of them prefer to retire at the earlier age. I repeat that I agree with the hon. member when he says that today many people can work to a riper age than they could in the past, and it is really a pity that the value of these servants&#x2019; services should be lost.</p>

<p>During the Committee Stage of this Bill an amendment which I sought to move was ruled out of order because certain employees affected by this legislation are in the employ of the Government. At this stage of the Bill we can only ask the hon. the Minister to indicate whether he is prepared to take the necessary steps to implement what I believe to be the wishes of the vast majority of workers who fall under this legislation, namely the celebration of Republic Day each year as a paid public holiday.</p>

<p>The Minister has the necessary machinery at his disposal.

I think the machinery at the disposal of the hon. the Minister is well known. He can either make use of the offices of the employers&#x2019; associations or he can refer the matter to the employees&#x2019; associations. But whether he does something about my suggestion or not, I have no doubt pressure is going to build up over the years before Republic Day is proclaimed a paid public holiday each year also for those workers at present excluded from this privilege.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, I think it would be a good thing for the Minister to indicate&#x2014;as he did during the second reading stage&#x2014;that his thoughts are in that direction. Unfortunately he gave no indication whether he contemplates converting his thoughts into positive action. That is why I am asking the hon. the Minister now at this third reading stage whether he is prepared to take the necessary action for having consultations with those interests affected by this measure which might result in an agreed Bill going through this House.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member knows that all the employers&#x2019; associations have been canvassed on this issue, and they are opposed to making Republic Day an annual paid holiday for all workers. Of course, the employees&#x2019; associations are in favour of the proposal. What further consultation can there be? All I can say is this: If pressure does come in the future, well, I will <span class="col_625-626" refersTo="page_0323"/>consider the matter, I will take everything having a bearing on the matter into consideration, and I will see what can be done.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Both during the second reading and in the course of the Committee Stage of this measure hon. members on this side of the House very clearly recorded their opposition to Clause 3. This side even moved an amendment, but seeing that the hon. the Minister assured us that he would put the matter to rights on a later occasion, we withdrew that amendment.</p>

<p>As the Bill reads at present, the hon. the Minister is relieved entirely of his obligation to determine a formula in course of time. In other words, if this measure is approved it will mean that the Minister will be able to issue temporary permits for many years to come. That will entail that consumers of water will have to wait very long before they will know what quantity of water they will be allocated permanently. But even as the original Act, as amended in 1961, reads at present, the position is an unsound one. At present the hon. Minister&#x2019;s hands are tied so that he can do nothing to supply water. And that is something we on this side of the House do not want either. To-day I received a telegram from people in an area which has suffered terribly under the drought and which, owing to recent beneficent rains in that district, once again has rivers in full flow. As the Act reads at present, these people will perhaps not be able to avail themselves of temporary permits. For that reason, Sir, this side of the House is eager to help the Minister in this respect. Accordingly we are prepared to support this third reading, provided that the hon. the Minister repeats his intention of moving the necessary amendments in the Other Place. In other words, the intention of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;as he suggested at the Committee Stage&#x2014;not to allow the period in which he has to determine the formula, to be extended over a great many years, but to determine it within the period of three years. If the hon. the Minister could give us that assurance again, we shall support him at this third reading stage.</p>

<p>When this 1950 Act defining Communism was passed, there was a discussion here as to what the word meant.

Then we mentioned that all the different objects of the Nationalist Party were included in the objects of Communism. And they are not excluded by this definition which the Minister read yesterday. The definition says Communism is &#x201C;the doctrine of Marxian socialism&#x201D;. What is it? Is it for the maintenance of a monarchy? Of course it is not.

<p>Our objection to the Bill is, Sir, that the definition is so wide that it can cover a multitude of crimes. We do not look upon this measure as being only a Sobukwe Bill, as legislation just to detain Sobukwe. The Minister chooses to call it the Sobukwe clause. We have pointed out before, Sir, that the hon. the Minister must find other means by which to detain Sobukwe and not keep this law on our Statute Book. He is asking for authority to extend the provision for another year. He himself accepts that the relevant section should only be temporary. The hon. the Minister said Sobukwe may be released next year. Therefore, Sir, it would appear the position is not as critical as the Minister would suggest. Under the circumstances this side of the House will again vote against this Bill.</p>

<p>This clause says that the Act shall apply in respect of civil judgments given in the Republic and in any country or territory outside the Republic which the State President has for the purposes of this Act designated by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i> We welcome this Bill and the clause, but I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether it has been possible already to make reciprocal arrangements with various countries and, if so, with which countries. One knows, of course, that in regard, for example, to the authentication of documents there are large numbers of countries where we recognize the actions of the authorities there. I was wondering whether any progress had been made in this regard.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Would the Minister explain why the presumption contained in sub-section (1) is there at all? It provides that a judgment shall be deemed to be final notwithstanding that an appeal against such judgment is pending in a court of the proclaimed country concerned or that the time prescribed by the law of such country for appealing against such judgment has not expired. By the latter sentence I presume is meant the time for the noting of the appeal. This is very peculiar, to say the very least, but we here provide in this Bill for the reciprocal enforcement of civil judgments, and we have a presumption that a judgment of a foreign country to be enforced in this country is final. In other words, you can execute against that judgment when in fact there is an appeal pending against it. In other words, this seems to be the very negation of every principle that we have in our law, namely that you may not execute a civil judgment until such time as either the appeal has been disposed of, if it is pending, or the time for noting it has expired. I hope the Minister can explain this rather strange position.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I explained that during the second reading. It might have escaped the hon. member&#x2019;s attention, but the same procedure followed in these courts may also be followed by our own courts. That is the type of section one finds in British law, and for the reason I advanced, one finds it in all the other laws.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that the fact that they have it in the British law does not suggest itself to me as being a good reason why we should have it in our law. Only British bias would suggest that because they have it we should have it too, and I am not so biased that I want to see such a provision here. Frankly, this offends me. Appeals very often take a very long time. But you can get, in effect, a judgment and bring it to South Africa and before the appeal is decided you can execute it here. If this were a South African judgment you could not execute on that judgment. I do not like this at all and I wonder whether the Minister can indicate to us whether it is really necessary to have such a provision in our law.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Just before we adjourned, the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) chased up a hare which unfortunately spoilt a good afternoon for me and which once again illustrated the point that hon. members should not simply rise to speak after having glanced at the Bill without have done their homework. I assume that the hon. member now knows what the reply is to his questions, and that he does not really want an explanation from me any more. The truth of the matter is-&#x2014;as the hon. member now understands, I presume&#x2014;that an appeal need not necessarily stop execution. The person who wants the execution to proceed, has to apply to the court for the necessary order, and the reason for that is not far to seek. That is because the person who has a judgment, is subject to that judgment, and the fact that an appeal can be made does not alter the position in any way, because, if it were different, such a person can quite easily dispose of the goods on which execution can be levied. That is the full reply. If the hon. member advanced the argument that we have now altered the entire basis of our law to suit other people, I would say that it is not the case, because that is in fact the basis of our law. I tried to bring that home to the hon. member by means of an interjection, but unfortunately we could not understand each other. But that is the full reply to the question.</p>

<p>Yes, but as I said this morning. the Minister is losing his grip. He is not following things too well. The point the hon. member made was this. In terms of this Bill now, a judgment shall be deemed to be final notwithstanding that appeal against that judgment is pending in the court of the proclaimed country concerned.

<p>But the Bill says it shall be final notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending. What I want to know is this. If we have a judgment in this country on which we want to execute abroad and an appeal is noted and execution is stayed, will the execution in Britain, for instance, also be stayed? We merely want an assurance from the Minister on that, that these words do not mean what we read them to mean, namely that it is final despite the fact that an appeal has been noted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Surely it is very clear. A person obtains a judgment in Britain, for example, and he wants to enforce that judgment in South Africa. He may have execution in respect of that judgment in South Africa, notwithstanding the fact that the person against whom he obtained the judgment in Britain has noted an appeal against the judgment in Britain. If the debtor who is then subject to the jurisdiction of the South African court does not want execution to proceed, and if he thinks the execution should be stayed, he may apply in the usual manner to this court and state reasons why execution should not be proceeded with. If good reasons are advanced by him, this court will grant him the relief he seeks against security being furnished or on any other condition, as the court usually does. This will be done notwithstanding this wording, because this is also the wording of our own law.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister said before lunch that the reason why he had this provision was because this was also the provision in the law of Britain and other places. <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_0328"/>Nowhere else, as far as I know, does this provision appear in our law. The Minister says you can apply for a stay of execution. Of course you can, but the basis on which you ask for a stay of execution of a judgment is that there is an appeal pending; in other words, that the decision is not yet final. But here he provides that in law the judgment is deemed to be final, notwithstanding that there is an appeal. In other words, whereas in our law one could rely upon the fact that an appeal is pending and say that this is not a final judgment, and therefore you want to stay the execution, this provision seems to provide that in law that decision subject to an appeal is deemed to be a final judgment; and if you have a final judgment, how can you stay the execution?</p>

<p>When we adjourned yesterday I was pointing out that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech lacked cohesion. But he is not to blame for that; it is in the nature of this debate and the Minister is entitled to touch upon various matters which in his opinion this House and the nation should know about. One cannot blame him for the fact that at this stage of the year 1966 he was mainly concerned about making a propagandist speech. It is quite legitimate and it is quite understandable. We know the hon. the Minister. Only a very thin administrative skin has been pulled over the hide of the politician, and for that reason we do not blame him. I think that under similar circumstances many other members of this House would have done the same &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, but if it does not meet with your approval, Sir, I shall gladly use another.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am making the point that one has to make a very precise and clear analysis of the Minister&#x2019;s speech in order to ascertain what he has told us and what he has not told us, and that is rather significant. In doing so one learns certain things and I think it is necessary that we from our side should bring what one does learn from a careful analysis of the Minister&#x2019;s speech to the attention of the nation. As an indication of what our line of thought is, I should like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the second reading of the Railways and Harbours Part Appropriation Bill unless and until the Minister gives an assurance that the Government will eliminate the anomalies and injustices which over a long period have been detrimentally affecting the users as well as the employees of the Railways&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It appears from the Minister&#x2019;s speech and from Railway publications which we all have at our disposal, that things went fairly well with the South African Railways up to and including September, because, as the Minister said, there were large quantities of imported goods which had to be transported at high tariffs, and that kept the revenue of the Railways at a high figure. The Railways are, of course, very dependent upon goods, especially imported goods, which have to be transported at high tariffs. If one makes an analysis of the figures, one finds that 17 per cent of the goods transported at higher tariffs was responsible for 51 per cent of the Railways&#x2019; revenue, while 83 per cent of the goods transported at <span class="col_637-638" refersTo="page_0329"/>lower tariffs only yielded 49 per cent of the Railways&#x2019; revenue. That was the position up to September, but since September, certain interesting changes, to which the Minister has only referred in passing, have come to the fore. Since September the Railways have begun to feel what the economic consequences of the economic maladministration for which the Government was responsible, would be for South Africa and the Railways. I only want to give a brief summary and I want to remind you of the fact that the Government, according to the Minister of Finance, has made plans for a period of tremendous economic revival in South Africa. They anticipated a boom and planned a boom, but they did not plan well, because they failed to take certain things into account. The fact that we have a shortage of manpower in South Africa as a result of their policy and negligence, was not taken into account. Secondly, they failed to take into account that when the private sector is encouraged to expand rapidly by means of private undertakings, the Government should curtail its activities temporarily and allow private undertakings free scope. But this Government became intoxicated by the boom and spent wildly there was an unprecedented increase in Government expenditure, and they actually competed with the private sector. We shall be able to say more about this, and it would also be more appropriate, when the financial measures introduced by the Minister of Finance are discussed. Those two factors were the main reasons why the boom could not be maintained, and a weak Government had to act against the nation of South Africa, as Mr. Wilson is acting against the Rhodesian nation; it had to institute economic sanctions against its own nation to curtail the boom; to slow down the prosperity of the country to a certain extent, and, as the hon. the Minister said in his speech during a brief moment of insight, the consequences of this policy of curtailment were felt more rapidly by the Railways than any other sector of the economy, and by the end of November last year we were beginning to see what was happening. For instance, we found that last year the Railways could run at a profit of R12,800,000 during the first eight months of the financial year, but by the end of November 1965 that profit had decreased to a mere R1,759,250, a disastrous decrease in many respects. It is interesting to note that Railways expenditure amounted to R413,341,000, during those eight months, approximately R40,000 more than during the corresponding period of the previous year. Expenditure increased by R38,500,000; but revenue increased by only R27,500,000. There was a deficit of R10,000,000 as compared with the previous year, and the surplus which amounted to R12,800,000 in November the year before last, was a mere R1,760,000. Last October the deficit on the Railways exceeded R3,000,000; in November the deficit was R3,500,000. I want to concede straight away that an important reason for that was the increases granted to the staff as from 1 October with retrospective effect. But, Mr. Speaker, the full effect of those increases is still to be felt, and the Agues at my disposal&#x2014;the latest I could find were in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 14 January&#x2014; show for instance that it has not yet been indicated what the effect will be of the payment to the staff of approximately R12,000,000 in vacation bonuses. Consequently one has to conclude that the Railways are heading for a period in which they will be hard pressed financially. The hon. the Minister did not tell us much about this; he merely stated in passing that he could not predict what the position would be when Parliament assembled in August after the election.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is quite correct; the Minister cannot predict what the position will be at the end of March. We shall have to consider that for the first time in August after the election. I am very grateful to the Minister because that makes my point very clear. But he did say that if there should be a deficit, it would be supplemented from the Rates Equalization Fund. In other words, he confirmed what he told businessmen in Durban, namely that there would be no increase in tariffs. But it is interesting that the Minister cannot give us an indication of what the position will be in March. It is possible for the hon. the Minister of Finance to announce that he anticipates a surplus of R45,000,000 at the end of the financial year, and the Minister of Finance has a much more difficult task than the Minister of Railways because he is dealing with several Departments. He also has to deal with many uncertain factors. The Minister of Railways is dealing with something which, in terms of our Constitution, has to be run as a business undertaking, and consequently it is much easier to predict what the position is going to be. We only know that the Rates Equalization Fund is going to be used so that the Minister may keep his promise that there will be no increase in tariffs. But the Rates Equalization Fund is not inexhaustible, of course. At the moment there is a tidy sum of R55,113,000 in the Rates Equalization Fund, but for what period is the Minister going to continue using that money and for what period will he be able to keep that up? However, he anticipates a change in the situation; because it is very clear from the indications we have had that this Government will have to take further steps to curtail prosperity in South Africa; because South Africa finds itself in the unfortunate position that it has a Government with a policy which cannot afford prosperity. If one is afraid to use one&#x2019;s manpower, if in a time of economic revival one recklessly competes with one&#x2019;s private sector as regards expenditure and imports, then one cannot afford to have prosperity, and we have had warnings that these sanctions will have to bite deeper into the South African nation. The penalty the nation has to pay for an unsuitable and inefficient Government will <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_0330"/>become greater. There are many little points in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech which do not make one feel cheerful. There is, for instance, his concern about the passenger services in respect of which there is still an adverse ratio between revenue and expenditure; there is his concern about road transport services in respect of which we sympathize with him to some extent as we know that the drought has greatly added to the difficulties of that section. There is his reference in two or three places, and the reference on nearly every second page of the General Manager&#x2019;s Report, to the shortage of staff in South Africa, and there is no indication that the Government has the real answer to the problem of a shortage of staff in South Africa. In the case of artisans the Minister has succeeded in convincing artisans to consent to non-Whites being employed in certain jobs. We do not hold that against him; we suggested that that was what he should do, and he said he could not do so; but we told him to keep on trying and he finally listened to us as befits a Minister and succeeded in doing so. That is the only thing that has been done up to now. The shortage of staff continues; it is becoming more acute; it is becoming more serious and the hardships endured by the staff are increasing. There is no doubt whatsoever that as far as the Railways staff, and the Public Service staff in general is concerned, South Africa has fallen behind other civilized countries, as is also evident from public announcements made by the hon. the Minister and senior members of his staff. Recently no fewer than three missions were sent abroad to recruit staff for the South African Railways, and the one was as great a failure as the other. They were total failures. But that does not only happen in the Railways &#x2014;recently, and I mention this in passing to bear out my argument&#x2014;the Transvaal Provincial Council also sent a mission overseas to recruit staff for certain specialized jobs. That mission too returned without having accomplished anything; it was a complete failure and the reasons for its failure were announced. The most important reason was that although it migh appear on paper that the salaries paid in South Africa are better than those paid in Britain and on the Continent, the workers are intelligent enough to take into account other benefits to workers in civilized countries, benefits which workers in South Africa do not receive. South Africa is probably the only civilized country in which those benefits are not provided. If the high taxes paid by workers abroad are set off against the benefits they receive in the form of pensions without the means test, free medical services and all the other assets of a welfare state, then it becomes clear that for the first time the workers in South Africa have fallen behind the workers in Europe. Until recently we could boast that people coming from abroad to South Africa were better off than people in England or people in Holland or people in Germany, but under this Government the workers of South Africa have fallen behind. We are sending one mission after the other overseas to look for recruits in order to boost our manpower, and on their return they have to say: &#x201C;We are sorry; we have failed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has corrected me, but he has helped himself from the frying pan into the fire. I was saying that the missions were failures and now the hon. the Minister has told me in what respects they were failures. They were unable to find suitable people. That is what I am saying as well. The people they found were unsuitable; they were the poorer types of Europe. The people they were able to recruit were not the type of person we wanted. What kind of mission is the Minister sending which makes such bad selections? The trouble is that there are too many people to-day who believe the Government&#x2019;s stories that everything is going well with the ordinary man in South Africa. They do not realize that the South African worker has fallen behind the workers of other countries because of Government policy. If the Minister sends missions overseas which cost us thousands of rands, then surely they have to bring something back, but what do they bring back? Only failures. That is what the hon. the Minister is saying now. I am very grateful; I hope that he will continue helping me in this way!</p>

<p>We are grateful for the improvement in the position of the railwaymen in South Africa, but we want these improvements to be seen in the proper perspective. They should have been granted an increase a long time ago. We on this side of the House have time and again drawn attention to that, and time and again the Minister has said &#x201C;no&#x201D;: time and again he has had excuses. In March 1965 he told a deputation of artisans that he could not grant them an increase on account of the drought.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The drought then became worse, and they were then granted an increase because an election was in the offing. In the month of July he told salaried staff that the financial position of the Railways did not permit of an increase, but the election was then in the offing and the financial position of the Railways was no longer a consideration. In the month of May he told train staff that an increase was simply impossible&#x2014; he would not even mention reasons&#x2014;but now he has done the impossible. Mr. Speaker, if I were an employee of the State or the Railways, I would pray for an election to be held every year, because it is only in election years that people are granted relief. The point I want to stress is the following: the Railway workers have only received what they should have had a long time ago; it was only a belated effort to remove an injustice which were created over several years. The failure of these missions to recruit workers abroad for the Railways is proof of the injustice done to the South African worker over the years as a result of the policy of the Government in power to-day.</p>

<p>But we should not think that there are no injustices under which many of the Railway employees have to labour. I can mention many, and I am going to mention several. I should like to draw the attention of this House to what is happening to an extremely important group of workers in the South African Railways to-day, namely the shunters, keymen, men about whom the Minister is very concerned because there is an acute shortage of shunters. The shunters get one day of rest a month. They work from 12 to 14 hours a day. Recently I stood on a mine dump overlooking Angelo station on the East Rand and I saw how the boys worked. I shall not be surprised if they have to run from 10 to 12 miles a day, because that station as well as other stations I visited on the East Rand was so overcrowded with trucks, there was such a congestion of traffic, that they could only do the shunting work by contravening the regulations; in other words, by doing what they call &#x201C;fly shunting&#x201D;. Those boys ran about for hours on end. How they keep it up I do not know. [Laughter.] The hon. member on the opposite side is laughing; he obviously does not have any Railway people in his constituency; that is why he can afford to remain indifferent and to rejoice in the misfortunes of underprivileged people.</p>

<p>The work of these shunters is so difficult that the hon. the Minister in his wisdom paid them a special allowance&#x2014;they call it a danger allowance&#x2014;to encourage them to come to work, because if they stayed away from work they did not receive that allowance. That allowance was 50 cents a day. If a shunter worked 26 days he received R13 for that month. That allowance has been taken away. The shunters received an increase, I think, of R20 per month, but that allowance has been taken away. If one takes into account other expenses related to the increased wage, they are left with a net monthly increase of only R5, or R6. Is that fair? Is that fair to men doing the most difficult work on the South African Railways? But that is not all. I have a letter here drawing my attention to the fact that approximately 26,000 men on the Railways, men who do hard work for the Railways&#x2014;shunters, foremen and others, falling under what the correspondent calls &#x201C;the employees&#x2019; grade&#x201D;&#x2014; were each deprived of R60 under the new salary increases, based on the fact that other employees whose wages are calculated on a yearly basis received an immediate total increase of approximately R23, whereas these people whose wages are calculated on a monthly basis received an increase of only R15 per month. Only R10 of this increase is being paid to them at the moment, and they have to wait a year for their next R5. Why this discrimination against the under-privileged, against those who are in a weaker position on the staff? But that is not all. I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the large group of former Railway workers who are suffering an injustice, the pensioners. There are thousands of men to-day who have given a lifetime of service to the Railways, a good lifetime of service, and who have paid with money of higher value for their pensions, who are being adversely affected to-day under the policy of the hon. the Minister. In the past we on this side of the House have pleaded time and again with the Minister to be more accommodating in respect of that special allowance of R35 per month, and once more, Mr. Speaker, we have achieved success, but unfortunately our success has been spoiled by the wrong application of a fine principle by the hon. the Minister and his Management. The reason for that is the fact that if Railways pensioners work for the State the means test no longer applies, and they retain their R35 even if their income exceeds R150 per month, but if they work for private undertakings they are still being penalized by the application of the means test. I can understand why the Minister has done that. He wants to draw those people into the public services, but can he get up and state in all honesty that everybody, if they were still suitable for work, applying for work on the Railways and in the Public Service, would be employed? If he cannot give that guarantee, then I say it is extremely unfair discrimination against the Railways pensioners. Do you know, Sir, just before I came down from Johannesburg, two elderly gentlemen visited me. Both were special grade engine drivers. One of them retired in 1960 after a period of service of 36 years and his pension was R64. If one adds the R35, it amounts to R99. The other gentleman retired in 1961, after a period of service of 36f years, and his pension was R71 per month. Add the R35 to that and it amounts to R106. At the moment&#x2014;and I am glad that I can say this&#x2014;the position of all pensioners has improved to such an extent that an ordinary railway worker, if he had qualified for the maximum pension, receives a pension of R92 <span class="col_643-644" refersTo="page_0332"/>per month. But it is fair that people who have done more responsible work for a lifetime, people who have bought their pensions with money of higher value, should now be placed on the same level as people who have done less responsible work and who have bought their pensions with money of lesser value? They are not to blame for the fact that the value of money is decreasing. Of course, it is the policy of this Government to maintain a state of creeping inflation. It is as a result of Government policy that there is a decrease of slightly less than 2 per cent in the value of our money each year. Why should people who have paid for a pension with money of good value, be penalized to-day in contradistinction to people doing less responsible work, who buy their pensions with money of lesser value? These pensioners, under the new dispensation announced by the Minister, are going to receive an increase of R4 per month if they are married, and in increase of R2 if they are single.</p>

<p>There are many other injustices I want to mention. There is the inexplicable way in which discipline is exercised on the Railways. One can write volumes about that. Take for instance the case of alcoholics. It seems to be the Government&#x2019;s policy that if a man drinks too much and becomes a problem, he has to resign on half his pension. But recently a case was brought to my attention of a station master with more than 20 years&#x2019; service. One of the members of his staff had made a mistake &#x2026; and that man was dismissed. I feel like taking this case to the Minister and asking him to make further investigations, because something is wrong here.</p>

<p>There are instances where people refused to be transferred when the Railways had had to transfer them, and where the Minister could have applied Section 13 of the 1960 Act, but did not do so. It is possible for me to continue in this vein, but I do not want to take up the time of this House much longer. The point I want to make is that there are obviously no definite standards according to which discipline is being exercised in the Railways. I wish&#x2014;and my wish will probably come true&#x2014;that the Minister would soon become an ordinary citizen of the State once more and that he would have an opportunity of talking to the ordinary people in the Railway service. He would then learn how people were seething about something they considered to be an injustice, namely that no clear standards have been laid down for exercising discipline. Mr. Speaker, I have mentioned instances of people having been severely penalized for trifles, but recently&#x2014;and it is possible that certain hon. members will recall this case immediately&#x2014;a senior clerk in the tourist service who dealt with overseas tours was caught appropriating large sums of Railway money for his own purposes. He was allowed to resign without any other punishment. How is one to understand that? Where is the principle, where is the norm, where are the standards?</p>

<p>I am convinced that the Minister cannot be aware of the amount of overtime railwaymen are being forced to work under present circumstances on account of the shortage of manpower, for which this Government is directly responsible. I want to tell the Minister about two men I have spoken to myself. Their case is a typical one; I have spoken to many people. I have seen them waiting in their locomotives at the bottle-necks on the East Rand for 12 hours, eight hours, nine hours, 13 hours. They did not move. There are these bottlenecks. This is a specific case. They told me about a period they, a driver and a foreman, had experienced together, a period of 102 hours, and in those 102 hours they went from Germiston to Kroonstad, and then to Klerksdorp only, and that in a matter of 102 hours.</p>

<p>102 hours on end?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Will the Minister please be patient? During that period of 102 hours they had a rest-break of six hours between journeys, six hours! For the rest they took turns in resting in the locomotive. They were paid for 96 hours out of the 102 hours they spent in the locomotive, but in actual fact they were travelling for only 37 hours out of those 102 hours. Is there anybody who would look objectively at something like that and who would say that it was proof of good organization? Something is definitely wrong. It is possible to employ such men to better effect. If trains have to remain stationary for hours on end, it is possible to take those men off the train, use them for other work and give them more time at home. But to expect people to be confined for 96 hours on end in the cabin of a locomotive! They admit this because they pay the men for that period, whereas the men were actually engaged on the work they were employed to do for only 37 hours. Is that efficiency? Is that the way to get a happy staff in the South African Railway service? I could continue in this vein.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, under this Minister a myth of efficiency has originated, but it is only a myth. The difficulties of the South African Railways arise as a result of the bottle-necks which exist. The reason why one cannot always obtain coal when it is cold in Johannesburg is the existence of these bottle-necks. Last year the Minister was very fortunate that we did not have a cold winter. Heaven alone knows what would have happened if we did have a severe winter. The difficulty is that our trains are not running. I can confirm this from personal observation. That day when I stood on the mine dump at Angelo there were 300 trucks at the station and five moved during the half-hour I stood there. Recently I asked a friend of mine to look at the notes on the trucks at a few stations and he told me that he had noticed two things. At Content, <span class="col_645-646" refersTo="page_0333"/>near Kimberley, there were no fewer than 14 trucks loaded with factory coal which had been standing at Content for ten days. They did not move, they were stationary. At Paauwpan there were no less than 35 empty trucks which had been standing there for a month, empty, and the nearby manganese mines at Postmasburg could not load manganese ore because no trucks were available. Is that efficiency? I read in the General Manager&#x2019;s Report that the South African Railways has 123,260 good vehicles at its disposal. Last year 5,492 new trucks were put into service, and if one takes into account the number which were withdrawn from service, the increase is 4,614. I read that a further 10,000 trucks have been ordered. But what happens to the trucks? The Economic Bureau of Stellenbosch and Iscor informed us, arising from an argument they had that on an average the trucks on the South African Railways moved less than three miles a day. If there was any private undertaking with a performance like this, the administrative head of that undertaking would be discharged immediately&#x2014; something I ask the nation to do on 30 March as regards this Minister. In the General Manager&#x2019;s Report I read that the average time taken by a truck to return to its point of departure is 8.69 days, a slight improvement on last year&#x2019;s time. But we are not informed what distances were covered. It is an important point that the trucks travel for an average of 8.69 days but they cover less than three miles a day. Sir, if I drove my car like that its battery would continually be flat. And that is the difficulty with the Railways. Its battery is flat. These are points derived from the Minister&#x2019;s speech where he was furnishing information about the past year and the coming year. The rest of his speech consisted of propaganda. He mentioned everything the Railways have done and achieved from 1948 up to the present date. But if one analyses that, what does it amount to? It is a tale of the Railways&#x2019; efforts from 1948 to 1965, to keep pace with the development of South Africa, and we all know that we have a wonderful country. But with what measure of success did they keep up with this development? If one examines the figures, not in a vacuum but against the background of the growth of South Africa, to what extent have they succeeded? They landed us in transport crises time and again, and a very worthy Minister, Mr. Paul Sauer, had to be made the scapegoat of their own inefficiency and shortsightedness. One winter after the other the Railways were unable to do the work it had to do, and they could not supply the nation&#x2019;s demands. The Minister now has to do on a permanent basis something which we suggested as a temporary measure in the time of Mr. Sauer. Coal now has to be transported to the Witwatersrand in private vehicles, in lorries. To prove to you how inefficient that is, Sir. do you know that three trains per day which were kept moving&#x2014;not stationary&#x2014;could provide all the coal requirements of the entire Witwatersrand? If one assumes that there are 2,000 tons of coal on a train, it means that 600 ten ton lorries, extremely large lorries, are needed to do this work and the Witwatersrand is congested with traffic. The Railways have failed as regards one of the first requirements which may be put to them, namely to be able to provide in the essential needs of our population.</p>

<p>I grant the hon. the Minister better prospects than those he has and has always had as a Minister of Railways in a Cabinet as inefficient and inadequate as the Cabinet we have in South Africa to-day, the Cabinet of a Government which in reality, as I have said, cannot afford to see a prosperous South Africa, because when South Africa becomes really prosperous it has to apply brakes, it has to apply sanctions against the nation. We can only hope that one of two things will happen. The first is that the Minister will be allowed and will influence the Cabinet to govern South Africa better, because the Railways can never do better than they are allowed to do by the Government. And secondly the Minister may just as well give up in good grace and give another Government, which will be able to govern South Africa better, a chance to govern it as the most promising and best country in the Western world deserves to be governed.</p>

<p>No, he has tried dramatically to make the best of a very poor case. He tried dramatically, excitedly and with much gesticulation and wildly exaggerated statements to persuade himself and his friends that he was right. Why did the hon. member become so dramatic? We know that it is the election that is haunting him. We know that the hon. member can be a very good propagandist when the election is haunting him, especially now when the United Party has to go and fight an election, an election not to fight for the government of South Africa, but to fight for its own salvation and survival. It is then when one finds the hon. member for Yeoville with his back to the wall, and that is why he put up such a fight and why he came with wildly exaggerated statements to try to convince himself. Mr. Speaker, I feel wonderfully satisfied when the hon. member becomes so extremely dramatic, because then I know the hon. member does not feel sure of his case; then I know the hon. member is pleading a very poor case, and I also know that the National Party and the hon. the Minister of Transport are still following the right course.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a speech here which was a propagandistic <span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_0334"/>speech from beginning to end, while he himself saw fit to accuse the hon. the Minister of making a speech here yesterday, the major part of which, he said, was a propagandistic speech. Apparently the hon. member and his Party find it difficult to learn. Last year during the debate on the Railway Budget we also found ourselves before an election, before the provincial elections. I think it was precisely two weeks before the provincial elections of 24 March when the hon. members did their utmost, as they have done to-day, to fish for the favour of the railway workers by telling them of the hardships and injustices suffered by the Railway staff and of the discontent which prevailed amongst them. What was the reply they got from the railway workers? What did they gain by fishing for the vote of the railwayman? The railwaymen gave a clear reply on 24 March last year. The railwaymen told the United Party: We reject you and your cheap wooing of the vote of the railwayman. We have confidence in Minister Schoeman and he will do us justice in his own time. The United Party got such a hiding in that election that it has not recovered from it yet, and it still does not know what happened to it on 24 March last year. You know, the United Party makes one think of the doctor who could not find out what was wrong with his patient. Every time after he had examined the patient he consulted his medical book. He had done so three or four times before he asked the patient: &#x201C;Tell me, did you have this disease before?&#x201D; The reply was: &#x201C;Yes, doctor, I did have this disease before.&#x201D; The doctor was greatly relieved to hear that and said to his patient: &#x201C;I shall tell you what is wrong with you&#x2014;you have the same disease you had before.&#x201D; It is the same with the United Party. They suffer from a disease at every election. They know that, but they cannot determine what that disease is. They only know that they are paralysed by the disease at each election.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s speech consisted of two parts. The first part of the speech was propaganda, making up to the railwayman, and in the second part he complained of the rapid development which was taking place in our country and as a result of which bottle-necks were developing on the Railways. What a nice testimonial for the hon. member for Yeoville to give the Government! It is a testimonial to the effect that the bottle-necks are continually developing on the Railways as a result of the economic prosperity the Government has brought about in the country. He complains of the rapid expansion, and I say it is a fine testimonial for the Government.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his speech the hon. member said that those things the hon. the Minister did not mention were, in fact, very important. However, the same applies to the hon. member for Yeoville. I should like to remind the House of what the hon. member has been saying here for the past two years, matters which, although very important to him, he did not even mention to-day. We heard nothing to-day of the spectacular Hex River tunnel plan of the United Party which seized the imagination of the public during the years in which they were in office. We heard nothing about the hon. member&#x2019;s favourite example: the building of a railway line between Commondale and Candover; we heard nothing about the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion that a railway line should be built between Modderrivier and Koffiefontein. The hon. member did not refer to the oil pipeline at all. He could at least have expressed his gratitude for that, because only last year the hon. member said that the oil pipeline would not be completed before two winters had passed, whilst the oil pipeline was completed by October.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the National Party had repeatedly landed the Railways in a transport crisis, but apparently that crisis existed only in the imagination of the hon. member for Yeoville. Do you still remember the forecasts made by the United Party and its Press during 1964 that a transport crisis would develop during the winter months of 1965? Do you remember that the Leader of the Opposition requested the Minister of Railways in November 1964 to have a commission of enquiry appointed immediately in order to prevent a transport crisis from developing during the winter months of 1965? The hon. member for Yeoville, who is noted for his inborn talent to exaggerate things, even went so far as to say that his Leader had not gone far enough, and that the transport crisis would occur before the winter months. Why did the hon. member not say anything to-day about the transport crisis he predicted last year and which did not eventuate? Those are important things the hon. member did not mention.</p>

<p>The hon. member devoted a substantial part of his speech to the injustices done to and the discontent prevailing amongst the staff. Mr. Speaker, I want to say to you that never before on the Railways has there been such a good relationship between the Administration and the Minister on the one hand and the Railway staff on the other hand than there is at present. As a result of that the wheels of the Railways can be kept going under the most difficult circumstances. Labour relations on the Railways are healthy; labour unrest is being prevented; the negotiation machinery on the Railways was greatly responsible for the good relationship that exists; this negotiation machinery was to a large extent established, improved and expanded by the present hon. the Minister, until it has become an efficient institution through which the Administration and the staff can meet each other&#x2014;the staff to make known to the Administration their requests and their demands, but at the same time, also, to learn of the problems of the Administration; to learn of what is demanded <span class="col_649-650" refersTo="page_0335"/>from the Railways and what the abilities, financially or otherwise, of the Railways are. In this way a basis is formed on which the staff and the Railways can best serve the country. Nobody, not even the hon. member for Yeoville, can dare deny the great part played by the present Minister in establishing this conciliation machinery in the Railway service. The manner in which the staff has served and devoted their energies to the Railways is one of the facts nobody can deny, despite all those things that have been said by the hon. member about the so-called injustices done to and the alleged discontent and hardship amongst the staff. During the past years a high standard was demanded from the Railways, and it was primarily the staff who had to meet those demands. How did the staff react to the demands that were made of them? The staff met those demands in a magnificent way, for which they deserve the highest praise and appreciation of the country as a whole. I am convinced that it required from them the greatest effort and efficiency, so much so that while passengers&#x2019; journeys and the total tonnage conveyed during the period 1962/65 increased by 29 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, the staff increased by only 3.9 per cent. That is an achievement on the part of the staff. A discontented and aggrieved staff could not have achieved this.</p>

<p>In 1959 the hon. member for Yeoville quite rightly said the following in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die doeltreffendheid van die gewone personeel hang af van die doeltreffendheid van die bestuur, en die personeel sal altyd die diens en reaksie lewer wat verwag kan word van die gehalte van bestuur wat oor hulle geplaas is.</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that the following is happening on the S.A. Railways to-day: the staff reacts and serves in this manner as a result of the fine quality of the management placed in charge of them. This effort and dedication on the part of the staff did not pass by unnoticed, but has been liberally rewarded by the Minister. As the hon. the Minister indicated in his speech, not less than R190,000,000 was spent during the past eighteen years under National rule in improving the salaries and wages of the Railway workers. Over the period of eighteen years it is an average increase of R10,500,000 per year. This average increase in salaries and wages per year is more than that ever granted the staff in one wage improvement by the United Party during its term of office. During the last nine years of United Party rule it amounted to an average improvement of only R2,000,000 per year against R10,500,000 per year under National rule. What does these wage improvements totalling R190,000,000 mean to the railway workers? They do not only mean that the Railway workers got R190,000,000 in money. One must remember that these wage improvements are repeated each year. The wage improvement of R14.7 million granted in 1948, the first year of our term of office, was not granted for the year 1948-9 only; it has subsequently been repeated 17 times. If calculated on that basis it means that all the salary and wage improvements as far as the South African Railways&#x2019; staff is concerned, has meant more than R1,600,000,000 to the railway workers since 1948. I want to refer to the recent increases of R35,500,000, which is perhaps the largest amount granted the South African Railways&#x2019; staff on any single occasion. The other day we had complaints in the debate on the Additional Appropriation against the salary increase granted the Railway Commissioners. I want to mention to you what the percentage increases in basic wages were in various grades: railway workers, 29 per cent, shunters, 20 per cent &#x2026;</p>

I am sorry the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) is not here to-day, because the hon. member recently developed the habit of issuing challenges left, right and centre. He challenged me to mention one single case of a post held in the Railways who received an increase larger than that of the Railway Commissioners.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I am talking about the one increase now. What does the hon. member know about the two increases? There the ignorance of the United Party is revealed once more. I am glad the hon. member for Durban Point reminds me of the fact that the Railway Commissioners received two increases. They say that two increases were granted against the one increase granted Railway staff. Surely that is not true. When the Railway Commissioners received an increase two years ago, the Railway staff had received rationalization of their wage structure barely a year before that. Why do hon. members not mention that? I want to tell the hon. <span class="col_651-652" refersTo="page_0336"/>member for Turffontein that he should be more careful in his challenges in this House. As far as the improvement in salaries and wages is concerned I should like to point out that the concessions made to the staff did not end there. Take housing. Do you know that since 1948 not less than R154,000,000 has been spent on housing for the staff in respect of the three different housing schemes (the house ownership scheme, the departmental housing scheme and the scheme in terms of which a grant of 10 per cent is made administered by the railways. Take pensions. The hon. member for Yeoville complained about the pensions, but during the past eighteen years more than R50,000,000 was spent on relief granted the railway pensioners. I want to mention how pensions improved in respect of a few grades, merely to show what active contributions were made to improve the Railway worker&#x2019;s pension. The annuity of a Railway worker&#x2014;I am talking of the two years 1948 and 1965&#x2014;increased from R167 to R607, and his lump sum payment increased from R818 to R2,088; in the case of a shunter the increase was from R293 to R833, and from R1,434 to R2.867, respectively; clerk, grade I: from R452 to R1,160 and from R2,213 to R3,990 respectively; firemen: from R208 to R729 and from R1,167 to R2,811; driver: from R324 to R1,O55 and from R1,817 to R4,068; artisan: from R751 to R1,098 and from R1,870 to R3,777. In no other period of eighteen years in the past has so much been done for the railway worker than was done by this Government during the past eighteen years. Look at the record of the South African Railways during this Government&#x2019;s term of office. Over a period of eighteen years R1,800,000,000 was paid out to the staff and R1,545,000,000 was spent on capital development for the purpose of modernizing and expanding our Railways. Our Railway system was expanded to such an extent that it was able to keep abreast of the astonishing and most revolutionary economic development this country has ever seen, while the Railways itself played an important part in our industrial expansion. Railway funds have been increased to constitute a healthy financial basis for the Railways to-day. For example, the tariff reserve fund amounts to R55,000,000 at present, the renewals fund amounts to R111,000,000, while the betterment fund amounts to R11,000,000.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these tremendous achievements and this vast sum spent on the development of the Railways and the great concessions made to the railway worker, the tariff structure of the Railways remains to be such that it provides the cheapest transport in the world. Where in the whole world does one still find a railway system such as that of the South African Railways.</p>

<p>Let us ask ourselves what the position would have been were the United Party in power during the past eighteen years. Through the years we became accustomed to the fact that the United Party advocated a particular railway policy here. According to that policy one may quite easily determine what the position would have been had the Railways been under the management of the United Party Government during the past eighteen years. Year after year the United Party pleaded for more exemption to be made to private conveyors, which would have meant that more and more high tariff traffic would have been lost, coupled with a substantial decrease in railway revenue. That was one of the legs of their policy. Furthermore, they continuously alleged that those people using the Railways were over-taxed. In doing so, they continuously pleaded for a reduction in the tariffs. Last year the hon. member for Yeoville pleaded for a surplus carrying capacity for the Railways. The railway system should be developed so that it could have a surplus carrying capital at all times in order to cope with peak traffic at any time. What would have been the total result of that? That would have necessitated an increased capital investment in the Railways with an attendant higher interest burden which would have had to be met from current revenue. In summary: The main issues as far as Railway policy was concerned, advocated by the United Party during the past few years and which indicated what course would have been followed by them had they been in power, firstly, a surplus carrying capacity for the Railways which would have resulted in a loss of revenue, and, secondly, a reduction in the Railway tariffs, which would have had the same effect. The third issue was that more exemptions should have been granted private road transport, through which railway revenue would have been seriously affected. However, at the same time they pleaded for the wages and salaries of the staff to be increased. What would have been the result of all that? Under United Party rule the Railways would have been the &#x201C;jolliest&#x201D; railways any country has known. But to that I should add that it would also have been the most bankrupt railway in the world.</p>

<p>I can understand, of course, that the hon. member for Yeoville is feeling very dissatisfied and unhappy about the fact that the Government has increased the salaries and wages of the railway worker on the eve of the election, because by that they are robbed of a weapon they could have used against the Government at the election as they did in 1961. At that time the hon. the Minister said that he would increase the salary of the railway worer after the election. To what extent did the United Party sow suspicion then? The hon. Leader of the Opposition need not look at me; he was leading the way in sowing suspicion. During the election campaign at Aliwal North he challenged the Prime Minister to state that the wages and salaries of the railway worker would not be reduced after the election. Not only their Leader, but all of them tried to buy the vote of the railway worker by sowing suspicion against the promise of the Minister of Transport during that election. Was there any truth in the suspicion they sowed? There was no reduction in salaries <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_0337"/>and wages after the election of 1961. On the contrary, the salaries and wages have been improved on more than one occasion since that year. Therefore, I can understand the United Party being angry and annoyed to-day, because we anticipated them in this, thus robbing them of an important weapon for the election. The hon. member for Yeoville now says that the increases were granted too late. He said the increases should have been granted earlier. But if these increases had been granted earlier, if the increases had, for example, been granted at the beginning of the year, they would not have meant so much to the railway worker, and I shall tell you why. The economic activities of our country reached too high a level at that time, and any increase in salaries and wages would have been absorbed by, <i>inter alia,</i> stronger competition on the labour market, easier credit facilities, increased prices and an even further increase in prices. At the time the increase in salaries and wages was granted, the rate of development was already slower as a result of the brakes applied so wisely by the Government, brakes which were gradually beginning to have their effects on all sectors of our economic life.</p>

<p>I believe, Mr. Speaker, that just as the railway worker did not take any notice of the cheap wooing of his vote in the past, he will agree with the rest of the nation on 30 March that the United Party has once more to be rejected.</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>There is not much to reply to in the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down. It only contains a few points which I cannot allow to pass unnoticed. [Interjections.] One of those points is the one of which the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has only just reminded me. You know, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member for Cradock is always bubbling over. When the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) was speaking about the satisfaction it gave him to listen to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), the following words bubbled from the mouth of the hon. member for Cradock, &#x201C;My teeth are aching.&#x201D; I can well believe that the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville not only gave the hon. member for Cradock a toothache, but that it did the same to the hon. the Minister and to all hon. members on the opposite side. The silliest point made by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) was when he referred to the granting of increased salaries and wages to the railwaymen on the eve of the election. He stated that these increases would have been to no avail at an earlier stage, because our economy was supposedly at too high a level at that time. Any increase would therefore have been wasted. But I say that it was at that very time, when our economy had reached its peak, that the railwayman had the least money. He had to go through that period of higher economic development with less money, as a matter of fact, with less money than any other section of our population with the possible exception of post office workers and public servants. What kind of argument is that? Some time ago I read in one of the newspapers that the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) would be considered for a deputy ministership. Well, I can only say that if the hon. member does not make better speeches than he made here this afternoon, the hon. the Prime Minister will have to think twice before appointing him to such a post. This afternoon the hon. member asked here with tears in his eyes where in the world a better railway system than that of the South African Railways was to be found. If he had asked where better railwaymen were to be found, I could still have agreed with him. I have said in this House on previous occasions, and I repeat to-day, that our railwaymen are amongst the best and most faithful workers under the sun. There can be no doubt about that. But to ask where in the world a better railway system is to be found! Is my memory playing tricks on me when I recall the hon. the Minister saying a few days ago that he had spent R18,000 on sending a mission to Japan to ascertain to what extent the Japanese railways were superior to those of our country? Is my memory playing tricks on me when I recall the Minister saying that more than 50 of the recommendations submitted by that mission had already been accepted? And that, I ask you, Sir, when our system is supposed to be the best in the world. And on top of that, a country like Japan! The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) toys with figures, but figures can prove anything; one can do with them what one likes. He spoke about the millions of rands which had been paid to the railwaymen in the form of salaries and wages since 1948. I hate asking the hon. member what his personal income was during that period, but it is, of course, quite a different story if I ask him how much of that income he still has left to-day. He also mentioned the wonderful achievements of the staff. He referred to the large tonnage of traffic handled by them, and that, Sir, in spite of the percentage increase in their salaries and wages.</p>

<p>The hon, member said that it demanded great dedication and exertion on the part of the staff to handle this tonnage of traffic. But does he only realize that now? Why does he realize only now that the railwaymen exert themselves to do their duty, and do their duty in a dedicated way? He said that the United Party alleged that <span class="col_655-656" refersTo="page_0338"/>grievances and dissatisfaction existed among the railwaymen. He denied that and said that they were working under the most difficult conditions. Well, it is true that they are working under the most difficult conditions, but at the same time he maintains that they are satisfied and are grateful for everything they have received. If that is so, why do I recall that a group of railwaymen proposed a motion of no-confidence in the Minister at Koedoespoort a few months ago?</p>

<p>May I remind the hon. the Minister that I am no relation of his. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) referred to the speech made by the hon. member for Yeoville as being a propagandist speech. He said that it was a speech that was solely intended to &#x201C;play up to&#x201D; (op te speel na) the railwaymen. I do not know what that means, Mr. Speaker, because I do not understand Afrikaans of that kind. I take it that what he meant by that was what he subsequently accused the United Party of in his speech, namely that they were wooing the vote of the railwaymen. He also wanted us to thank the Minister for the oil pipeline. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, we have to say thank you for the oil pipeline! That is something for which we pleaded with the Minister for many years. But just as this Government is too late in everything it does, it was too late with this oil pipeline as well. However, I think I have devoted enough time to the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East). I shall therefore take no further notice of him.</p>

<p>As regards the increase in the salaries and wages of railwaymen, I want to suggest that any thanks for that is due to this side of the House. We have been pleading for an increase for years, and year after year we have provided proof of the fact that the railwaymen needed an increase. We have raised the grievances of railwaymen in this House year after year. Now, on the eve of the election, the hon. the Minister has thought it safe to grant the railwaymen an increase. Now he is beginning to get afraid. But what he has given the railwaymen is too little and, what is more, it has come three years too late. This increase should have been granted three years ago. He already owed it to the railwayman three years ago. Money has decreased in value to such an extent and times have become so much harder that this increase in wages has come three years too late.</p>

<p>All the hon. member can do is to live in the past; consequently I shall leave him there. Not even a year ago the Prime Minister said that people were not worse off but only desired more. I wrote down word for word what he said. I understood him to say that people were not worse off, but only desired more. Was that not a scandalous thing to say? In other words, people were only being greedy; they were just wanting more. Those were his words, not mine. Talk about increases on the eve of an election! Now they are granting this increase to railwaymen in order to win the election, because they are granting this increase while at the same time saying that South Africa finds itself in a difficult position. We are faced with a major drought and difficult circumstances are prevailing. They nevertheless see their way clear to do this now. When they had the large surpluses in the past, no increases were granted. It is not so long ago that lhe hon. the Minister said that if salaries and wages were to be increased, railway tariffs would have to be increased as well. Does the hon. the Minister forget that? In the speech he made here he kept very quiet on that point. Only last year the hon. the Minister and other members on his side tried hard to ridicule our arguments. The hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit) who is not present in the House at the moment, tried to do so again this afternoon. He laughed very heartily this afternoon when we mentioned the difficulties which the railwaymen had to face.</p>

<p>The hon. member speaks too soon. I have the debates of 1965 in front of me. Then it was not the hon. member who was the first speaker, but the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. J. W. van Staden). On that occasion he said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Both the Minister and the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) said that the railwaymen are voting Nationalist. They maintain that the railwaymen support this Government. But if that is the case, is this not a greater shame? Is their shame not so much greater because they have over the years neglected their supporters to such an extent that this side of the House had to take up the cudgels for them? Is that the contempt the hon. the Minister and members on his side display for their own supporters? Have they achieved such eminence and become so rich that they can now look down upon their own voters, on people who, as they maintain, vote for them? Of course, I am not saying that it is true, but if it is true that the railwaymen support the Government, then the same of that side of the House is so much the greater. The fact of the matter is that they have neglected their own people. This Government has neglected the railwayman in the same way as it has neglected the farmer of South Africa. What kind of Government is this then? What kind of Minister is this who boasts of the loyalty of the railwayman, and at the same time does not want to grant him his fair share in the prosperity of the country? He is not getting his fair share of the planned prosperity of which the hon. member for Malmesbury spoke. The hon. member for Malmesbury spoke about &#x201C;planned&#x201D; prosperity. In his turn the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) said that it would have meant nothing to the railwayman if he had received this increase last year. He then said that our economic development was at too high a level. Any increase for the railwayman would consequently have evaporated and disappeared. On the one hand, therefore, an hon. member speaks about planned prosperity, and on the other, another hon. member says that it would not help the railwayman in the least to share in that prosperity.</p>

<p>Yes, but I can also tell the hon. member what happened five or six years ago. The circumstances which prevailed then as far as the railwaymen are concerned are still prevailing to-day, and that in spite of this Government which says how faithful the railwaymen are. [Interjections.] An hon. member behind me here tells me that the railwaymen will not vote for me. Allow me once and for all to make it very clear to hon. members opposite that I am not after the railwaymen&#x2019;s vote. What I am after is to get better working conditions and better salaries for them. What I am after is to see to it that their wives and children can live a decent life and take their place in a worthy manner as loyal and good Afrikaners. What I am after is to build up an Afrikaans nation of which my people and I can be proud. Just look at the number of members opposite who are taking an interest in this debate. Where are they? I take much more interest in the railwaymen. In 1962 I spoke about the working conditions of the railway workers, <i>inter alia,</i> at Danskraal. I pointed out that tremendous demands were being made there on the railwaymen&#x2019;s powers of endurance. I pointed out that it was difficult to obtain leave because there was no relief staff available. I said that conductors had to remain on duty for long hours owing to the shortage of staff. Shunters had to work impossibly long hours. I also pointed out that it was essential for them to earn overtime as their basic wages were inadequate. Well, every word I said on that occasion still applies today. It applies to the driver as well, even if he is on the highest grade.</p>

<p>I said that in 1962, 1958 and 1954. I pointed out what a disgrace it was to see under what working conditions these people had to work. I spoke about the dirty shacks in which these people had to eat and sleep, shacks full of ratholes and teeming with cockroaches, shacks which were too hot in summer and too cold in winter. I said that at the welding depot the workers had to work in the open air. According to the Hansard report the hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) then told me that I did not know what I was talking about, as the depot which I was talking about had been completed long ago. But that was not the case, and it is still not the case to-day. Despite the fact that a new depot was provided for on the Estimates for the past three years, it has still not been built.</p>

<p>I said that there was still no flash-butt welding depot, despite the fact that it had been provided for on the Estimates in three successive years. I have all the Estimates in which this item appears, and it has still not been completed. Mr. Speaker, but what is the position there? These people have to work and eat under difficult circumstances. The office of the senior works foreman and roster compiler is situated between two other large buildings. It is impossibly hot in that building. The workshop has no ventilation. There is no eating-place or restrooms. The people are expected to eat amongst the oil and rubbish. I want to tell you, Sir, that no doctor would ever approve that building. The public washrooms at Danskraal are dirty and have rough floors. The best of those buildings have already been standing for a period of 17 years, and have never been painted during that time. All the workers and even the Bantu can go and fetch warm water there if they need it. The building is sprayed out once a week. This is one of the buildings for which I pleaded and which was placed on the Estimates and built during my time. The place has now been crowded with lockers. There is no electric kettle, neither is there any table. There is one hot water installation which is so dirty that you do not even want to look at the thing. The electric hotplate is in a terrible condition. The windows are dirty and the largest collection of rubble imaginable is lying <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0340"/>on top of the cupboards. As much as 115 drivers alone have to make use of these facilities. Altogether there are 150 workers who have to make use of two toilet rooms. There is no table to eat off. Neither is there any couch. All that there is is a few benches. I want to tell the hon. the Minister here that he should come with me to satisfy himself that I am telling the truth. If he himself does not want to come then he should send one of his senior officials. There are no power plugs in the restrooms. The building in which the oil is stored is built of wood and corrugated iron. On the day I paid a visit to the place, the temperature was 95 degrees in the shade. I have already said that the toilet rooms are in a miserable state.</p>

<p>They are something which is necessary. The worst of all is that the washing-places of the Bantu are right next to one of these buildings and under the same roof. One hundred and eighty Bantu have to wash themselves there in two old paraffin tins. There are only three taps and the Bantu stand all over the place. There is no caretaker either. The place would at least be in a better condition if there were a caretaker. There is a new and better building for the shunters. But here again there are only three toilets. Mr. Speaker, why is it that this hon. Minister and his Department are not subject to the regulations of industrial legislation? Why is it that this Minister can do what he pleases with his workers? Why is nothing done to improve these conditions? But the biggest joke of all, Mr. Speaker, is the flash-butt welding depot, where the people have to work in the open air. As long ago as five years it was said that I was behind the times and that the flash-butt welding depot had been completed. The day I arrived there, I was taken to the person in charge. He showed me the beautiful green parks and the canna flowers. He showed me how the rails had been stacked up in a neat pattern. But when I asked him where the workers were, he told me that they were working a little lower down somewhere. I then said that I wanted to go and see where they worked, but he insisted that it was not possible for me to get there. However, Mr. Speaker, I played a clever trick on him. I clambered over all the rails and went to have a look and found that the people were working in the boiling hot sun. The money which had been spent, had been spent on useless things, that is to say, on lawns and so on, while the men who in my opinion are some of the most loyal in the whole of the world, those people who through their loyalty have always kept these Railways in operation, and who have done us all a service, have to work in circumstances which are too bad for me to mention here. There are many other things which I can discuss. One of the matters I want to discuss is in connection with the housing of the railway workers. This is no new thing. The Minister knows all about it. I have already spoken to him about Pretoriusdorp and Ladysmith on several occasions. He is aware of the fact that I have mentioned to him that these people are living in impossible conditions. His reply has always been that Pretoriusdorp does not belong to the Railways. I have been to the General Manager already in this connection and he sent three men to investigate the conditions at Pretoriusdorp. Pretoriusdorp belongs to the town council of Ladysmith. It is a condemned area. The houses there have been condemned. But this Minister and his Administration rent them from the town council of Ladysmith so that the buildings cannot be demolished, because if that were done nearly 100 families would be homeless. In these circumstances the town council of Ladysmith can do nothing whatsoever about the matter. The worst of the matter is that the Minister rents those houses. If one looks at the beautiful annual report of the General Manager, one finds on the first page the beautiful Paul Kruger Building, the Railway Head Office in Johannesburg, in all its colourful splendour with one storey upon the other reaching up towards the sky. When I saw that I could not help thinking back to the conditions in which the people at Danskraal and Pretoriusdorp have to live. What really struck me when I read through that report was not so much the things which were mentioned in it, but the things which were not mentioned. If one were to read through this report, one would think, as the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) thought when he read through it, that all was well in the Railways. It is only when one investigates the matter personally that one finds all the things that are going wrong with the Railways. I hope the day will soon come when we will be able to rectify all these matters.</p>

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>Before I reply to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) and the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) I first want to concur with the hon. member for Bleomfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) in regard to the distasteful remarks made by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) and the irresponsibility of the Opposition in voting against the item in connection with the salaries of Railway Commissioners. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) has already disposed of those misrepresentations that the Commissioners had supposedly received two increases while the staff had only received one increase. This allegation, is, of course, devoid of all truth. The hon. member has already dealt with these increases on a percentage basis. He also pointed out that at the time of Union in 1910 Railway council members received much higher salaries than the Chairman of the Public Service Commission and Heads of Departments. I now want to explain briefly to the House what the true state of affairs is in regard to the salaries of Railway Commissioners. The hon. member has already sketched the position as it existed in 1910. In 1947-8 when this self-same United Party was in office, the <span class="col_661-662" refersTo="page_0341"/>Railway Commissioners received a salary of R4,800. The Chairman of the Public Service Commission received a basic salary of R4,600. In other words, Railway Commissioners received R200 more than the Chairman of the Public Service Commission. Heads of Departments, on the other hand, received R4,200. Railway Commissioners therefore received R600 more than Head of Departments. What is the actual position to-day? The position today is that the Chairman of the Public Service Commission receives a salary of R9,600; the Heads of Departments, R9,000; the Senior Board Member or Commissioner, R8,100; and the two junior members of the Board R7,700. But I want to go further, Mr. Speaker. I want to point out to the House that the two Deputy-General Managers of the South African Railways also receive even higher salaries than the Railway Board members, namely R9,600. Four senior officials receive R8,100, while one senior official receives R7,800. I have the names of these officials at hand. I want to put it very appositely and clearly that I have no objection to these people receiving these salaries. I am thoroughly aware of the fact that they hold very responsible positions, do very responsible work and that they also have the ability to do that work. I want to emphasize, however, that the work done by the Railways Board is work of a very important nature. Apart from the fact that it is the highest body, in conjunction with the Minister, to whom Railway servants can appeal, it is also the body which has to make a thorough study of all new extensions, the building of new railway lines and of all new developments, in which regard they have then to advise the Minister. I think the Minister agrees with me in this regard. Then I also want to mention a further important aspect, namely that Railway policy is not determined by the Administration, but by the Minister and his Railways Board. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I really feel that if I have to criticize these Estimates in any way, then what I want to do is appeal to the Minister of Railways here this afternoon to rectify this matter. I am sorry that the hon. member for Turffontein is not here, as he could then have had the opportunity of performing one honourable deed, i.e. begging the pardon of the Chairman of the Railways Board in particular, who is a trained economist. He possesses a doctor&#x2019;s degree in economics. His appointment is no political appointment. I really think that the Opposition owes him a apology too, for in my opinion they acted irresponsibly. Where they are now pleading for an increase in the salaries of Railway officials, they ought at the same time to plead that the salaries of the Railways Board be adjusted proportionately. One realizes, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. members were really directing their attack at the two political appointments, namely those of Messrs, du Plessis and de Villiers. While we are talking about political appointments, I must definitely point out that in the time of the United Party all three appointments to the Railways Board were political appointments. There was, for example, Mr. Bates, who was an ex-M.P.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Bates was appointed by the Hertzog Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>But it was done during the United Party period of office. There was also Senator Eichmann and Mr. Johan Fourie, who is to-day Secretary of the United Party in the Free State. At that time he had been defeated in an election. Apart from the fact that these are political appointments&#x2014;let that be the case &#x2014;I still at least take it that a responsible Minister would not appoint incompetent people to those posts. In the same way I take it that in the future if the Opposition were to come into power again, they would also appoint responsible people to those positions. I am, therefore, making an appeal to the Minister to revise this little matter and set it to rights.</p>

<p>I also want to say a few words in connection with the speech made by the hon. member for Yeoville. He reproached the Minister repeatedly about the shortage of staff. He reproached him and he tried to make the Minister look ridiculous on account of the abortive recruitment campaign overseas. This he accordingly regards as being one of the reasons why the Railways will not be able to function effectively enough in the future.</p>

<p>Now I want, particularly in view of the coming election, to know from the hon. member for Yeoville and the Opposition how they intend coping with the Railway staff shortage. I would be very glad if they would tell me that. However, I do know how they intend solving the problem. They are going to solve it in terms of their labour policy, namely the rate for the job, or equal pay for equal work. They are against job reservation and this I shall go and tell the Railway people at Bethlehem, where a candidate is standing against me. Approximately 1,000 Railway servants are employed in Bethlehem. I shall tell them that the danger which would confront them if the United Party were to come into power would be the abolishing of job reservation. If a Bantu, therefore, is capable of becoming an engine driver on a locomotive, he may, according to the policy of the United Party &#x2026;</p>

As opposed to that, Mr. Speaker, what is the policy of the Opposition?

The result would be that if the United Party should one day come into office they would cram the Railways with Whites, Bantu and Coloureds. Ultimately there would be nothing to prevent the Section Manager being a non-White. Even the General Manager could be a non-White. It follows that a further outcome of the multiracial Federal Parliament policy of the United Party is that a non-White may ultimately become Prime Minister or State President.

<p>Very well, then you or one of the other hon. members can come and tell me that I am wrong in due course.</p>

<p>I now want to return to a few other statements by the hon. member for Yeoville in which regard I am of the opinion that the member should feel properly ashamed of himself. If we take into consideration the fact that the South African Railways is the largest single industry in the Southern Hemisphere, and one which employs over 100,000 White officials and more than 100,000 non-White servants, surely he cannot come along here and criticize isolated cases? He reminds me of a Std. VI schoolboy. Quite at random an incident is selected where 35 trucks stood at Poupan for a considerable length of time. He did not even have the decency to make a thorough investigation of the reason for that. But the tremendous overall services rendered by the South African Railways, that he does not appreciate. The whole country appreciates it but not the Opposition. Actually the Opposition is annoyed, for they would rather have seen that these Railways of ours came to grief. Unfortunately for them, the Railways are a great success. The United Party is annoyed because it knows that it will not obtain the votes of the public outside this House. Mr. Speaker, even one of the most hostile English-language newspapers has praised these Railways and expressed its appreciation. It gives me great pleasure to read what this newspaper has to say about the South African Railways and about the present Minister of this Department. I shall read the following to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When it comes to party conferences, Nationalists tend to pay homage to their leaders at the drop of a hat. But on Tuesday night they could hardly be faulted for their tribute to Mr. Ben Schoeman, who was elected Chairman of the Rand Nationalist Party Conference for the 26th time. In the somewhat ruthless context of South African politics, this is certainly a remarkable record, and we congratulate Mr. Schoeman on his long, unbroken spell of leadership on the Witwatersrand. We have always had a soft spot for Mr. Schoeman. largely because, in politics, he is what is called a clean fighter and also for the remarkable work he has done as Minister of Transport. In Parliament his opponents no doubt find legitimate grounds for criticism but, broadly speaking, they will also concede that he has carried his portfolio with distinction.</block>

<p>I leave you to guess what newspaper made these comments on the hon. the Minister. I know you will not be able to guess. It is the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 28 November 1965.</p>

<p>No, it is not always correct. On the contrary, it is always wrong, except in this case where it cannot do otherwise when dealing with the honest Minister of Railways.</p>

<p><span class="col_665-666" refersTo="page_0343"/>Mr. Speaker, I come now to the hon. member for Drakensberg. I would really like, for a moment, to say my farewells to her. I certainly think we shall miss her sorely if she does not return next year. One shall certainly miss her dramatic behaviour in this House&#x2014; in this instance I do not want to say hysterical behaviour. She can sometimes become oh! so moved, just like the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman). I listened very attentively to her description of Danskraal. I do not in any way want to allege that what the hon. member was stating in that regard was untrue. Yet I want to emphasize here that, as I know the South African Railways, with its intensive planning, those conditions will not continue indefinitely. The measures taken there are merely of a temporary nature. Rome was not built in a day. The hon. member mentioned major improvements which have been made. She spoke about the beautiful lawns and the beautiful way in which the rails were stacked. I will not be told, therefore, that the position as it exists at present will continue. I can only take it that these are only provisional measures. And I think the Minister would agree with me in this connection. That is as I know the Minister. The hon. member painted a terrible picture here of the housing conditions of certain Railway people in Ladysmith. Something else I cannot entirely accept is that when houses have been condemned by a health officer, anyone else would have the right to live in those houses. This ought to apply to the Railways as well. However, let us accept that those are the circumstances prevailing there for the time being. Now I want to take the hon. member for Drakensberg back a little to 1948 when the United Party was still in office. I do not know whether the hon. member is aware of the fact that the United Party of those days treated Railway servants as inferior Whites. They were regarded as an isolated group and were not accepted as a part of the population. They were a section on their own&#x2014;label them the &#x201C;untouchables&#x201D; if you like. I will take the hon. member to Bethlehem where a Railway camp is still standing to-day where the United Party&#x2019;s Railway servants, the same dear people whom the hon. member for Drakensberg loves so much to-day, were so shamefully treated. To-day, if you were to go to a church and a church council was in sitting, you would not tell me that one of the church council members was a Railway servant.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>But at the time the circumstances were such that those people lived below the usual standards. I want to tell the United Party that they will wake up with a shock in this election. I challenge the hon. member for Yeoville to come and support the candidate standing against me in Bethlehem. There are thousands of railwaymen there. The hon. member for Drakensberg can also come. We shall give her a hearty welcome and give her a good hearing, and we shall not be insulting to her either. We shall be much politer to her than she usually is to us. She may as well come along and see whether she can achieve anything with the election. Sir, I feel sorry for the poor candidate standing against me there, not because I am such a capable person, but simply because the National Party has, during the years it has been in office, done what was best for every section of the population and because the people realize that there is only one Government which can do this for them and that is the Nationalist Government.</p>

<p>But before my time is up I would like to bring two little matters to the attention of the Minister. In the first place I want to thank the Minister, the Administration and the staff here this afternoon, on behalf of the farmers in the drought-stricken areas, very sincerely for the wonderful way in which the farmers who had to move with large herds of cattle were assisted. I am almost unable to describe the services which they rendered, how block-trains were arranged, how they even had to off-load the farmers&#x2019; cattle at night, and how they did everything in their power to make the necessary trucks available and how they gave preference to these drought-stricken areas. I also want to point out that enormous quantities of fodder were transported to the dry regions from Bethlehem, and when the Administration heard that the farmers needed trucks in order to send fodder to those regions, they were immediately given preference. I wish to express my thanks and my appreciation to the Minister, the Administration and the staff for their sympathy.</p>

<p>The second matter is in regard to the oil pipeline from Durban to Johannesburg. In the first place this afternoon I want to express my thanks and appreciation to the MacAlpine Company which had the contract to lay that pipeline. They had to dig a ditch up to five feet deep and they had to take it over lands and across fences. But I want to testify that even though we as farmers did not see eye to eye with them at the outset, as they were in a great hurry because the Minister was pressing them, we subsequently got to know them much better; and when it came to settling accounts, where they had gone beyond their right of way and further than fifty feet inside the farmers&#x2019; mealie lands, they compensated the farmers fully and without argument. They merely took the hard cash out of their pockets and said: This is the compensation money for the number of bags of mealies which were spoiled.</p>

<p>I would also like to express my appreciation to the Minister and the Administration for the exceptionally sympathetic way in which they supported us as farmers in regard to the activities of MacAlpine; for the officials who were made available to us to survey the ground which was outside the right of way, and to see to it that nothing went wrong there and that fences and temporary gates were put up in the lands. I would also like to <span class="col_667-668" refersTo="page_0344"/>express my thanks and appreciation to the Minister and the Administration for the way in which they treated the farmers in regard to the alienation of the land and the quantity of grain which was destroyed, and for the wonderful way in which the farmers were compensated. Even in the case where land was alienated, the Administration allowed the farmers to continue ploughing and sowing on that land, even though the land belonged to the Railways. I know of a farmer who felt that he was losing one-third of the value of his land and who then claimed one-third of the value, and who, to his great astonishment received the reply that the Administration was paying out the full agricultural and animal husbandry value of the land. Once more, many thanks.</p>

<p>I want to thank the Minister and the Administration for the wonderful way in which they have, over the past year, administered the South African Railways to the benefit of South Africa. I want to wish them strength and fortitude for the difficult task which lies ahead.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) made it clear quite early on in his speech that we are standing on the eve of an election. On one or two occasions&#x2014;I do not want to interpret him incorrectly&#x2014;he told this side of the House bitterly that we should feel ashamed of ourselves over certain matters. I am a back-bencher, and the hon. member is a front-bencher, and it does not befit me to say the same thing to him. But I must say that, in the light of what I heard this afternoon from that hon. member about the actions he is contemplating for the election, he, as a front-bencher, has shocked me.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) must please busy himself with Bantu affairs. He knows nothing about railways. I want to return to the hon. member for Bethlehem. What has he come along here and told us? He challenges us and says: I am going to the public of South Africa and I am going to tell them the United Party advocates a policy whereby a Bantu can be promoted to train driver. [Interjections.] Sir, but this is a challenge over an untruth. I do not want to be guilty of unparliamentary language, but the hon. member must at least know that what he was conveying is not the policy of the United Party. What is the policy? The policy is simply this, and I shall reiterate it in a few sentences, that no position previously held by a White person will be filled by a non-White person unless the trade union, which has control over that position, has agreed to it. And the trade unions are controlled by Whites. We made this clear last year, and I am doing so again. We have heard of dirty elections. If this is a foretaste of what is to come, then I must say it is the dirtiest form of the old negrophile politics (kafferboetie-politiek) which I have heard for a long time, and that from a front-bencher of the Nationalist Party. In passing I just want to say that I was a little astonished to see what scant interest hon. members opposite displayed in the affairs of the railway people.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotze) that I noticed there were not any more members present when speeches were being made on their side. If one considers that one is dealing with a quarter of a million Whites only, it is surprising that there are not more members opposite taking an interest in the debates. The South African Railways to-day is the largest single employer in the country, and that is a fact of which the Railways ought to be proud, and I take it that they are proud of that fact. However, that is also a fact which places a large measure of responsibility upon the shoulders of the Railways, and not only in regard to its own officials&#x2014;there is also the responsibility of behaving towards its own officials in such a way that it will serve as an example for the other employers in South Africa as well. I say that this organization must set an example in respect of working conditions, not only for its own people, but also for other employers, in respect of working conditions, salaries and pensions.</p>

<p>I wonder what the position of the railway workers is to-day? Under what conditions are they living? Hon. members opposite would like to intimate that the position is so good that whatever we say cannot be true. I want to be honest. If I have to reply to the question of what the position of the workers on the railways is, I cannot fall back on my own knowledge, as I am not a railwayman. I have to fall back on information which I can acquire from the railwayman himself. When evaluating that information, I must bear in mind that we are here dealing with an organization which employs more than 100,000 Whites, and it is obvious, therefore, that some of the complaints will be unfounded. But nobody is going to convince me that all the complaints we hear are quite unfounded., I really believe that a great many of the complaints which reach us are well founded and ought to be properly investigated. I believe, further, that a great many of the complaints reaching us to-day can be traced back to what I term a basic fault in the approach of the Railways Administration to the staff matters of the Railways. I want to give a few examples.</p>

<p>In the first place I believe that the Railways&#x2019; approach to the whole question of overtime&#x2014; and I shall return in a moment to the policy of the United Party&#x2014;is a mistaken one. It is a known fact that we have always had overtime in South Africa. What is more, it is an ever-present phenomenon. You will never be <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0345"/>able to eliminate the phenomenon of overtime entirely. But what I find disturbing in the Railways is that overtime is increasing. It indicates a growing tendency over the years which can be in the interests neither of the Railways nor of the railway workers. Not only does too much overtime make for inefficiency, but it certainly interferes with family fife, and I believe that these are both things which the Railways should eliminate from the lives of their staff. I believe that if you take overtime too far it can even cause loss of life. One often wonders, looking at the figures, to what extent the accidents taking place on the railways should be traced back to overtime. Too much overtime leads to fatigue, and I want to read what is said in the General Manager&#x2019;s report for 1965. The picture is given very clearly here. On page 25, under the heading &#x201C;Staff Casualties&#x201D;, it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fifteen members of the staff were killed and 21 injured in train accidents during the year, compared with five and seven, respectively, in the previous year. Accidents incidental to railway operation caused 115 deaths and 277 cases of injury to railway staff, as against 83 and 146, respectively, during the previous year.</block>

<p>If we had to reduce this sentence to the cold reality, it really means that there was an accident on the railways each day of the year in which some person was injured or killed. It seems to me that it happens every day of the year that a person is injured or killed, and I cannot help wondering to what extent you can trace it back to overtime and the resulting physical and mental fatigue.</p>

<p>I can give another example. I have here a report where the very question of tiredness is put very appositely. Here we were dealing with the case of a man who, after being on duty for 18 hours, met with an accident. The case came up before the court, and the court investigated the matter. They could not establish what the reason had been, but the question of fatigue after 18 hours&#x2019; duty, from 4 o&#x2019;clock in the morning to 8 o&#x2019;clock at night, counted very heavily in the case. I want to read what was said in this court case&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Evidence was brought before the Court that the deceased had allegedly been tired that day, but there is not sufficient evidence before the Court from which one could conclude that this tiredness would have affected him to the extent of causing the accident. Possibly one can come to the conclusion that, as a result of tiredness, he was unable to fasten the coupling properly.</block>

<p>The coupling came loose and, as a result, the man had an accident and was killed. The cold reality is that someone is killed or injured almost every day of the year. Now we are left with the case of an old lady who has to be satisfied with a meagre pension, but the Railways shrug their shoulders and say: It is not our fault.</p>

<p>What was the nature of the accident?</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>He was one of those people who put up electric wires. He fell off the ladder and broke his neck. One can continue in this vein. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Cradock may say I am exaggerating when I speak of the dead, but it befits him ill to do so. If that old mother had to be sitting here this afternoon and heard what hon. members have said, she would have been very shocked. This is a serious matter.</p>

<p>But to come back to the case I want to put. Why do we have overtime in South Africa? There are two basic considerations. People work overtime because they are either so loyal to the Railways that they want to do it, or otherwise they do it because they need the money. Their basic wage is so low that nobody could make a decent living from it. I have no doubts as to the loyalty of the railwaymen. We know that if it had not been for that loyalty the wheels of the Railways would have ground to a halt long ago, particularly when one considers the matter in the light of the manpower shortage. That loyalty is laudable. But what is not so laudable is the fact that these people have to work overtime because their basic wage is not enough to give them a decent living. It is tragic that something like this can happen in South Africa. For thousands it is essential that they work overtime, whether they are mentally or physically capable of doing it or not. The man&#x2019;s destitute circumstances simply compel him to work overtime as he simply cannot keep the pot boiling on his basic salary. If overtime has to be worked in times of abnormal pressure, one can understand it. But something which I think is unforgivable in the Railways&#x2019; labour pattern is the fact that overtime has become an integral part of that pattern. I think it is monstrous, it is something which should be rectified at all costs; if not in full measure&#x2014;one would never be able to do that&#x2014;then at least to as great an extent as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister might tell me: It is easy to say that overtime must be eliminated, but how are you going to do that? There is a tremendous shortage of workers. The Minister has been talking about that for years and he says his visits overseas were of no avail in getting hold of people. These are good questions, but I want to tell the hon. Minister that the railwayman in South Africa cannot go on like this. The time will come when he must break, and that will be at the expense of the Railways. His loyalty is being tested too far. Nobody can keep it up for the duration. On the Railways, more or less the same number of people are transporting a growing tonnage, and I wonder how long this can go on. The Minister might ask me what I suggest. There are a few things we can do to rectify the matter. The first thing I beg to recommend to the Minister is that he should pay the railwaymen a salary sufficient to guarantee them a decent living.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from><span class="col_671-672" refersTo="page_0346"/>*An <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What would be sufficient?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks what would be sufficient. He should rather ask the Minister. Ask the railwayman himself. He is very fair and he will tell you. And if you have done that, and you have offered a satisfactory basic salary, so that it is no longer a requirement to have to work overtime, then you must see to it that his cost of living is adjusted periodically as it rises. We have heard here of the R35 million. The hon. member for Bloemfontein-East (Mr. Van Rensburg) says: We did not want it last year; the inflationary tendencies would have swallowed it all up; the prosperity was so great that we could not pay the railwaymen, who needed the increase badly, any more; we had to hold him back. But now the Railways come along and give people R35 million, and we shall have the same inflationary tendency. We shall simply find that the great increase in salaries will in course of time be swallowed up by the rise in the cost of living. 1 say no, give the railwaymen a basic salary on which he can live in the first place, and in the second, supplement that basic salary from time to time as the cost of living rises. And when this has all been done, I would say: Unless the railwayman in South Africa works overtime and works a lot of overtime at that, the Railways cannot remain in operation; we cannot get the people. I would then say to the Minister: Once you have paid the railwayman sufficient, so that it is not essential for him to work overtime, consult his trade union so that in the course of time, slowly and surely, and with the consent of every trade union involved in the matter, Coloureds may be brought in below the Whites and the Whites raised up so that the Railways can remain in operation, so that the Whites can earn a decent wage and so that the Railways can proceed to operate on a sound labour basis.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not want to replace them. This is another misrepresentation. I am saying that I think it is desirable and I believe that if you deal fairly with the railwayman, and do not stampede him with negrophile politics, he will be sensible enough to accept this step. And let me tell the hon. member for Heilbron that it is no new thing. I remember the Minister saying in this House last year that, provided that trade unions consented, even a Coloured would be able to become a shunter. It has been recorded in Hansard. This is also the United Party&#x2019;s approach. It is not a negrophile policy which we are advocating, it is a sound policy. It is of no use the Minister coming to this House year after year and telling us: I must complain in your ears; things are not going too well as we have a shortage of labour. We know he cannot get the labour in the White sector. We do not want to endanger the White man&#x2019;s position, we are coming forward with suggestions to improve his position. But if you talk about the Coloured in South Africa you are pounced upon as if by a flock of vultures and. particularly before an election, every drop of propaganda value is squeezed out of it, even if that approach is of profound importance to South Africa. No, I say the Railway&#x2019;s approach to this matter is in my humble opinion faulty. We must approach the matter in another way.</p>

<p>In the second place, I believe that the Railway&#x2019;s approach to pensions is wrong. The Railway pensioner is entitled to his pension. It is his money. If the Railways state that that may receive a temporary allowance, it is nothing else but a supplementary cost of living allowance. The pensioner is entitled to it. My opinion is that even though that man did some other kind of work, even though he got as much as a thousand rand a year, the Railways, as his former employer, do not have the right to withold a penny from him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, would that hon. member keep quiet. I begrudge the hon. member a little more sense and responsibility.</p>

<p>The shortage of White labour is an evil in South Africa; it is a world-wide phenomenon, and if we could retain the services of our pensioners, no matter what form their services took, then we must do it at all costs, and I want to ask the hon. Minister this afternoon not to go and restrict pensioners, with their cost-of-living allowance, to service in the Railways only. If the people have the ability, be magnaminous; as the largest employer in South Africa the Minister can afford to do so. Let these people work in a wider field where they can serve South Africa. I think that is what ought to be done.</p>

<p>But our motion deals with two points; the one concerns the staff and the other the consumer. I want to return to something which, in my opinion, is an anomaly as far as the consumer of South Africa is concerned. The pipeline was mentioned here this afternoon. I regarded it as a wonderful project. It is a project for which the Nationalist Party cannot claim all the plaudits; they know they cannot. I am glad the project has been established for the South African consumer. When the pipeline was being built from View Flow, Durban, to Johannesbug, I said to myself this is a wonderful thing; it is progress; it is modernization; now the people up country are going to get cheaper petrol. But what I unfortunately did not remember is that the hon. Minister had said a few years ago: &#x201C;I am going to build a pipeline but you must not think that I am going to give you cheaper petrol.&#x201D; What are the facts in regard to the transportation of oil in South Africa? Last year the hon. Minister gave us the transportation costs of a gallon of petrol as being 1.536c. The Railways charges me 7c per gallon if I transport petrol. This gives the Railways a profit of just on 600 <span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0347"/>per cent on a gallon. I think that at one stage a figure of R12,000,000 per year was mentioned; that is the profit which is being made. I think it is a good profit, and I think the hon. Minister should give us a little return on that profit by means of reduction of the tariff for the transportation of petrol through the pipeline.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister says that it would not help my voters. He might be correct. Should I only be concerned for my voters in Maitland? 1 am going to retain my seat in any case but I am concerned for South Africa; I am concerned for the hon. Minister&#x2019;s voters. What is the position? I have just said that the petrol transportation costs are 1.536c per gallon. The hon. Minister says his estimated costs for the transportation of petrol through the pipeline is not even as much as 1c; it is .92c per gallon. But the hon. Minister now tells us that he does not want to transport the petrol for us at a cheaper rate. He says he cannot afford to lose that tariff. I say that this is a mistaken and slanted approach to the matter. I believe it is an anomaly as far as the consumer is concerned. I believe the people up country ought to reap the benefit of the saving on the transportation of petrol as fuel is to-day one of the fundamental economic factors. If you can deliver it for less then you are benefiting the entire economy, and that which benefits the Transvaal might perhaps flow over into the Cape.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would like to put another few matters to the Minister, all dealing with commissions. A year or two ago we had the Schumann Commission and this matter was touched upon last year. As hon. members know, the Schumann Commission went into the question of tariffs, etc. It was an investigation which dealt with fundamental matters in the railway system. Last year the hon. Minister told us that the matter was still receiving attention. I think the Report of the General Manager of the Railways also stated that the matter was still receiving attention, and I am quite sorry that the hon. Minister did not tell us in his speech what has become of this report; that the hon. Minister did not tell us what his policy approach to the report was and that the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) did not tell us this either. I think he is on the way to a position which should enable him to come by the information. Then there is another commission which has also been appointed, the Marais Commission. I know it deals with transport but the Railways have a substantial interest in this matter. I would like to know from the hon. Minister what progress has been made with this matter?</p>

<p>I should like to try to reply to a matter to which the hon member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) devoted a considerable amount of time, and that is in connection with accidents on the Railways. The hon. member ascribed the increase in the number of accidents to overtime work done by railway employees and, so I deduce, to the tiredness and exhaustion of railway workers. I should like to refer the hon. member and hon. members who listened with such close attention to that part of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument, to page 25 of the Annual Report of the General Manager for 1964-5. Sir, a graph is supplied here and the following words appear above the graph: &#x201C;The incidence of train accidents, (collisions and derailments) in relation to the train mileage run each year since 1949-50 is shown in the following graph&#x201D;. If the hon. member opens that report at page 25, he will see that although the accidents have increased in numbers, they have decreased when the train mileage is taken into consideration. [Interjections.] It is of no use for the hon. member to try to interrupt me, because his argument is completely fallacious. In that graph it is shown that the largest number of train accidents occurred in the year 1955-6 and again in 1958-9, when there was no mention of so much overtime work and of such a severe (as they have put it) shortage of labourers. But that has always been the argument of the United Party; it is the same argument advanced by them in connection with the blackening of our cities. They maintain that the number of Bantu in the cities has increased, without taking into consideration the relative increase of Bantu to White workers.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to a speech made by the General Manager at Koedoespoort, when he handed out the awards of the National Occupational Safety Association. <i>Inter alia,</i> he said the following, and I quote from the <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0348"/>July 1956 number of the <i>Suid-Afrikaanse Spoorwegnuus:</i></p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Die Spoorwegadministrasie is ook positief ingestel op die voorkoming van ongelukke en groot welslae is reeds behaal.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then he also said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Net in die werktuigkundige Departement het die ongelukssyfer van 72.5 per 1,000 Blanke werkers in 1953 na 6.5 in die afgelope jaar gedaal.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In general that is in fact reflected by that graph. That argument by the hon. member has, therefore, certainly cut no ice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But you are comparing train mileage with lives.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Those are train accidents as such. I should like to refer the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) who made us a promise yesterday. The hon. member promised us that we would enjoy an uninteresting debate on the part of the Opposition. In a few cases the debate was in fact amusing, particularly when we were listening to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), but if promises had to be carried out the way hon. members have been carrying out that one, then we may very well assume that the promise they give the voters so subtly, will fall just as flat as the promise of an interesting debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member and other hon. members have been harping <i>ad nauseam</i> on the old line of a man power shortage in the Railways for which, as they put it, the Government is directly responsible and then the hon. member tried to poke fun at the three delegations or missions abroad. He did not even know what it was all about. Sir. hon. members should realize that in a country where there is a boom, there will always be manpower shortages. That does not apply only to South Africa. It is to the credit of South Africa that we have this boom. But it applies to Western Europe also. It does not apply to the Africa States, because they do not have such a boom.</p>

<p>Because of that workers of the right calibre could not be attracted in Western Europe. On the other hand, however, I prefer seeing a manpower shortage rather than the unemployment conditions which obtained when the United Party was in power.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg spoke about the railwaymen and repeated certain words which the hon. member for Bloemfontein East supposedly used in connection with courting the vote of the railwaymen, but I can assure her that she did not warm the heart of a single railwayman with her speech here this afternoon. In the course of her speech she also said that this increase of R35,000,000 in salaries for the staff was something which was being done immediately before the election. Hon. members on that side of the House should be aware of the fact that the hon. the Minister, as long ago as the first half of last year, promised the Railway&#x2019;s Staff Associations that he would have discussions with them in October in connection with the requests for salary increases, and as we know the hon. the Minister, he kept his promises, and those discussions with the Railways Staff Associations were held. May I tell the hon. members that at that stage there was as yet no certainty that an election would in fact be held in the first half of the year; it could just as well have been held a year later than that date. Therefore this argument by the hon. member and other hon. members on that side cuts no ice at all.</p>

<p>If one surveys the activities of the Railways objectively, one is forced to consider certain relevant questions. The first question is undoubtedly: Have the South African Railways during the past financial year succeeded in keeping abreast with the economic develops ment in the Republic, and in meeting the transport demands made on it by the expansion of our national economy. The second question which occurs to one is the following: Were the South African Railways prepared to meet this development with their programme of forward planning? The third question will undoubtedly be whether the Railways Administration has succeeded in creating and maintaining a sound and harmonious relationship between employer and employee. In other words, does the South African Railways in general command the services of happy and contented railway officials? I want to submit that anybody who tries to reply scientifically and objectively to these three questions, will in each case give a positive reply without any reservations.</p>

<p>In connection with the first question I want to say that under the extensive industrial development and the consistent economic boom in the Republic, which obtained continuously on many fronts, severe demands were made on the Railways as the general transport body. This colossal and unequalled development would not have been possible if the Railways, as general conveyor and the major conveyor in South Africa, had not provided the necessary and essential transport facilities. The Railways were set a challenge, and despite the so-called manpower shortage, and despite the fact that some of the materials were hard to come by, and despite the fact that delivery of the essential equipment was delayed notably, the South African Railways succeeded most successfully in meeting their obligations and in keeping abreast consistently with the rapid economic development of the country, but what is more: The Railways succeeded in exceeding all previous traffic records. I should like to impose upon you a few examples. For the first time in the history of the South African Railways the total tonnage transported by the South African Railways in one financial year, exceeded the 100,000,000 mark; that is, it reached the 104,500,000 notch, which is 5.23 per cent higher than that of the previous year. We have <span class="col_677-678" refersTo="page_0349"/>already heard that passenger journeys increased by 10.97 per cent, a wonderful achievement. We also know that the working results of the harbours in the Republic show that 3,750,000 tons more freight were handled, which represents an increase of 14.08 per cent compared with the previous financial year&#x2014;also an exceptionally fine achievement. The passenger journeys in respect of the Road Transport Service, operated by the South African Railways, also showed an increase of 5.2 per cent. But to me the most magnificent achievement was in connection with the flights of the South African Airways, which showed an increase of 35.7 per cent compared with that of the previous financial year.</p>

<p>The reply to the second question, namely, whether the Railways Administration consistently planned ahead, is also decidedly positive. Transport services are indispensable, and are absolutely essential for a growing economy, and the South African Railways planned ahead consistently in order to equip its transport services for the great task it had to fulfil. Mr. Speaker, the United Party has so frequently in the past brought the charge that the Railways Administration did not have the necessary vision, the necessary initiative, and that the Railways Administration hesitated or neglected to plan ahead. These charges are fabrications and are devoid of all truth. In fact, they are utter nonsense. The United Party and other persons, as also other bodies, who bring such allegations and charges, frequently shut their eyes, often deliberately, to the real state of affairs. The Railways Administration has always tried to plan ahead judiciously and steadily on the basis of a certain programme, and here I want to mention examples once more. The pipeline has repeatedly been referred to in connection with the transport of petroleum products, which in terms of planning should only have commenced after 1971. In view of the fact that transport increased at such a tremendous rate, however, the Railways Administration decided to set about it immediately, and that pipeline has now been completed. It was a magnificent achievement to complete it within 14 months, and in addition to supply the pump stations and the equipment involved, for example communication equipment. I want to mention another example. Approximately eight years ago a larger harbour at Durban was planned in order to be able to cope with the huge freights and the increasing transport, but at a very early stage it was already realized that even that improvement and that extension would not be adequate, because Durban was such a popular harbour, and because of that more advanced planning and foresight were brought into play and Richards Bay was chosen for development as a harbour in order to relieve the pressure on the Durban harbour. Mr. Speaker, that is an example of forward planning. In the speech made by the hon. the Minister we heard about the doubling, the trebling and the quadrupling of sections. In this connection I am thinking, for example, of the section from Newcastle to Durban, which will meet an urgent demand.</p>

<p>I do not want to give other examples, but dozens such examples can be furnished. I shall also just mention in passing the three sections approved during this Session when the Railway Construction Bill was passed. It should be realized that the construction of the various sections and the planning cannot always be implemented exactly as it should be done, primarily because there is a staff shortage and because there is often a shortage in capital funds. Where such works cannot be completed in time, it is often alleged erroneously that that is due to lack of vision, lack of energy and lack of planning on the part of the Administration.</p>

<p>In reply to the third question, that with regard to the relationship between employer and employee, it can be stated without any doubt that the Railways are thoroughly aware of the value of sound relationships between employer and employee. The Minister and the Railways Management are very much aware of the fact that negotiations form the key to success and contentment, and that is what the Minister and the Management have been prepared to do in the past. In view of this sound relationship between employer and employee in the Railways, the leaders of the various associations have always been prepared to negotiate with the Minister and the Management through the official channels, particularly where salary increases were involved. In general these associations also came forward with reasonable claims, and these reasonable and justified claims have been and are always sympathetically considered by the Minister, and have mostly been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, as has now happened again in the case of the request for salary increases. I want to give a further example to demonstrate the sound relationship between employer and employee in the Railways. It is striking&#x2014;and I know what I am talking about&#x2014;that there are many cases where employees resign from the employment of the Railways in order to find another or better livelihood, but return after a few weeks or a few months and ask to have their previous positions back, and are then prepared to start from the bottom. They usually state that their new employer was not as fair or as considerate as the Railways Administration, and they actually plead to be taken back into the Railways employment. Such persons return to the Railways because that Service offered them contentment in their work and benefits, because they had peace of mind and had the assurance that their future was safe-guarded as far as security in their work and in other matters was concerned.</p>

<p>As an ex-educationist I should like to refer briefly to a scheme in connection with the training of personnel. We know that as a result of the staff shortage special efforts are being made&#x2014;and that has also become an important task of the Railways&#x2014;to attract workers and also suitable young people to the South African Railways. We have already heard that the Railways are making intensive endeavours not only to attract more candidates, but also better candidates. In particular, we <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0350"/>know of the notable and praiseworthy efforts to recruit matriculants. I should like to refer with appreciation to the praiseworthy and attractive bursary schemes for engineers and other technical personnel, bursaries which are made available to promising young men. It is also pleasing to see on page 76 of the General Manager&#x2019;s Report that considerably more bursaries for training of engineers were awarded for the past academic year than in 1964, i.e., 115 in 1965 compared with 83 in 1964.</p>

<p>I should like to plead that, more such bursaries be made available by this large organization, and in doing so, I want to repeat the plea I have made before, namely, that graduated engineers should be attracted by larger commencing salaries and also larger maximum salaries.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the B.Com. bursary scheme, which is a great success, but I want to refer in particular to the bursary scheme for part-time students, which is a magnificent success, a scheme which also encourages people who are already in the Service to avail themselves of it, and which consequently contributes to the status of the Railways through such people improving their qualifications.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to the other unique scheme, namely the training scheme for engineering-assistants who can attend four year post matric sandwich courses at technical colleges, a scheme which is also meeting with great success. Finally, I want to make the observation that the persons to whom I have referred here, are all required to have matric as a basis for further studies, because the Railways have many employees who do not have matric, and we are very grateful that these people are also being given the opportunity to improve their qualifications.</p>

<p>We know about the good work being done by the 75 instructors at the Railway College at Esselen Park. As hon. members may know, a variety of courses for Railways officials are offered here, courses which are aimed at improving their abilities and their qualifications in order that they may achieve promotion in the Railways service. We are very grateful for this scheme and we know that many officials avail themselves of it.</p>

<p>Then there are temporary classes and day courses which are given and which deal with human relations. It is of course most important that our railways officials, particularly those of them who deal with the public, should follow such courses. In consequence we find that the public is very grateful for the treatment received from railways officials with whom they come into contact. Travellers are delighted with the friendliness and courtesy with which they are treated. Every now and again the <i>South African Railway News</i> publishes letters addressed to the Management, in which certain railways officials are praised for their attitude and behaviour towards the public. I do not think it is necessary for me to read these letters, but I just want to mention that the hon. members on this side are grateful for the praiseworthy behaviour of the staff.</p>

<p>So often the Railways Administration is criticized. But I wonder whether hon. members who do that, and also other concerns which find faults with the Administration, realize that by expressing such criticism they are by implication also criticizing the railway worker. Last year we had a good example of this type of criticism. That was when part of the Press and certain chambers of commerce and industries, and als other United Party, criticized the Administration and made sinister forecasts to the effect that the transport services were on the point of collapsing. They said the Administration&#x2019;s inability to render the necessary services would impede the Republic&#x2019;s economic development. But frequently certain industrialists and businessmen were expressing this type of criticism merely to cover up their own bad planning. We are thinking in particular of the so called coal shortage of last year. Sir, this-side of the House appreciates the services rendered by the Administration. I should like to repeat what the hon. the Minister said on a certain occasion. He said that we were in fact able to build wagons and locomotives and to start new works in order to increase the carrying capacity; that is, the facilities could be augmented. But, the Minister also said, we could not manufacture the required manpower. And man, after all, remains the axis upon which everything revolves. Unfortunately there is no magic talisman with which to solve the labour problem experienced by the Railways.</p>

<p>I represent a constituency in which many railway workers live. And the new constituency I hope to represent in the new assembly&#x2014;Koedoespoort&#x2014;also contains many railway employees. In fact, the number of railway voters constitutes a larger portion of the total number of voters than was the case in my previous constituency. Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that the railwaymen appreciate the good work done by the Administration and the allocations made by the hon. the Minister and the Administration. I am therefore convinced that the railwaymen in all those constituencies will once again send the Nationalist candidates to this House. I want to go even further. I notice that the United Party has not yet appointed a candidate in Koedoespoort. Well, I challenge them to put up a candidate of their own in this constituency. I am convinced that the result of the election will show once again that the railwayman firmly supports the Government and the Nationalist Party.</p>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) complained that he has not found the debate interesting so far. Well, I am not surprised that he has not found criticism of the Government&#x2019;s Railway policy to be interesting. What is more, I doubt very much whether his contribution to the debate will be found interesting by people outside, particularly by railwaymen. And the same goes for previous speakers on that side of the House who did so much trumpet blowing. I <span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0351"/>think people are getting tired of all this trumpet blowing and would rather like to hear something more specific, particularly as regards the Railway workers themselves. In fact, I think Shakespeare was right here when he said: &#x201C;Methinks he doth protest too much.&#x201D; We have been having just a bit too much protesting about the wonderful Railways policy in South Africa. But what is interesting to every railway worker in South Africa is his own future. And the future of our railwaymen is also linked up with the economy of the country as a whole. In this regard I think in particular of something referred to by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) when he alluded to the temporary allowances of retired railway workers. I should like to enlarge on what the hon. member has had to say to show how widespread is the effect of deductions from the allowances paid to retired railway workers. In fact, it has a nation-wide effect on the economy of the country, apart from other unfavourable aspects.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as was said by a previous speaker, these retired railwaymen have given a lifetime of conscientious service to the Railways and to South Africa. And when they, after retiring, earn a little extra money to supplement their meagre pensions, the amount of their extra income is deducted from the allowance paid to them by the Railways. In this regard I want to quote a specific instance that has been brought to my notice. I considered bringing it to the attention of the hon. the Minister privately, but because of its widespread implications I felt it to be a matter that should be ventilated in the House. The case I wish to refer to concerns a retired railway engineer and the difficulties he is experiencing at East London. Up to about a year ago another engineer was engaged in doing ship surveying work, which is an essential work because it ensures that ships are kept moving and as such it is very essential for the smooth running of the harbour of East London. Because of advancing years he retired from his work and the work he had been doing was entrusted by the world-wide shipping firm concerned to the retired railway engineer referred to earlier in my speech. He was to perform his duties in the form of part-time work. As I said. Sir, his work is very essential for the smooth running of the harbour services of East London, but it is not quite sufficient to justify the employment of a full-time man. This retired man is doing very essential work. If I may just quote an example: Ships arriving in the harbour to take away, for instance, fruit, must be surveyed before they are allowed to ship the fruit, to ensure that everything is in working order. If a ship brought fruit from Durban, it would have been surveyed in that port and the necessary clearance would be in order. But if it turns around at East London for the purpose of shipping fruit there, it must be surveyed in that harbour. That is the nature of the work being done by this retired man.</p>

<p>Now. he receives a temporary allowance from the Railways. But it often happens that his earnings from the part-time work equal the amount of the allowance, and in the result, because of the corresponding deduction from the allowance, he has done a month&#x2019;s work, albeit part-time, for nothing! In one case he quoted he had actually earned R4 after deductions from his allowance. He had only R4 in hand with which to cover all his travelling and other expenses. It goes without saying his part-time work is not a profitable proposition for him. Because of this anomaly, he has. decided to resign from the work, and the firm employing him has asked me to take this matter up because his resignation will cause serious dislocation to the working of the Railways. Had the gentleman been working for the Railways, he would have received his full temporary allowance. But because he is not employed by the Administration and, notwithstanding the fact that his work is essential for the smooth running of the harbour, he has to forfeit the temporary allowance. And because of this unsatisfactory position he has, as I said, resigned, which will cause a certain amount of disruption in the harbour routine.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my view the attitude of the Railways is definitely a dog in the manger one. Had the man been working for the Railways he would not have forfeited any portion of the allowance.</p>

<p>Many men who retire from the Railways wish to earn something extra. It goes without saying that it is good for them. It is occupationally beneficial for them. What is more, it is not only to their benefit that they should be able to continue working after retirement, it is also good for the country. Yet here we have the Railways introducing regulations which, in effect, prevent these men from undertaking such work, to their own detriment and that of the country. Many men retire from the Railways because, in some cases, they have grown tired of the work, or because they have developed some handicap. Take, for instance, the case of a clerk who has developed arthritis in his hands or writer&#x2019;s cramp, thus preventing him from continuing with that kind of work. He may not be able to continue doing full-time work, but is quite capable of undertaking part-time work somewhere else. Now, people in such circumstances would have been an asset to the country economically had they been able or had they seen their way clear to do such part-time work. For they would have been productively filling posts, and making others available for the work of the Railways. We thus have a situation where everything works around in circles. The Railways would benefit because people would be employed in other occupations, even though not by the Railways. In some cases men. who have been doing indoor work all their lives, might want to take up farming for the sake of their health. They might want to farm with pigs or poultry or pineapples. They would like to take up any form out outdoor farming work. But they are in effect debarred from doing so because they would lose their temporary allowance, or so much of the allowance that it would not be worth their while to do so.</p>

<p><span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0352"/>Now, Mr. Speaker, I feel this to be a case which the hon. the Minister might very well take up and reconsider. Because the policy of the Railways in this regard is not only creating the impression that the Administration is showing very little gratitude to the railwayman for his conscientious work for the country all his life when it virtually debars him from earning a little extra in retirement, but it is also hampering the work of the Railways and the economy of the country. I sincerely hope the hon. the Minister will give this matter further careful consideration to see whether it is not in the interests of the Railways and of the country that the difficulties raised by me should be overcome.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) (Mr. Field) restricted himself to the temporary allowance paid to ex-railwaymen. I want to draw his attention to the fact that, as a result of the new concession which the hon. the Minister has made, namely that ex-railwaymen who return to the Administration&#x2019;s service do not lose the temporary allowance, there have been other employers in many cases who as it were have been forced to pay higher salaries to ex-railwaymen to prevent their returning to the Railway service. Therefore, although not everybody receives the benefit of the temporary allowance, the partial concession which the hon. the Minister has made has had the effect that persons working for private employers have also benefited.</p>

<p>In the course of his speech the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) made the utterly unreasonable and unfounded allegation that in so far as the maintenance of discipline is concerned, there is no standard by which discipline can be applied. I say that is an utterly unreasonable and unfair charge, because the maintenance of discipline in the Administration is fully covered by existing legislation, and we have a modern and fair system of applying discipline. In the first instance, an inquiry is instituted by the disciplinary officer at which the accused is properly defended by a legal representative. In many cases naturally there is a right of appeal to the higher authorities. How well this system works is apparent from the latest report of the General Manager, in which it is stated that of the 644 appeals referred to the Disciplinary Appeal Board only 85 were upheld. These 85 successful appeals will help to maintain a good standard, and even to bring about an improvement in the standard in the future. 1 therefore regard the charge made by the hon. member as totally unfounded.</p>

<p>From the report of the General Manager for the past financial year, it is quite apparent that the General Manager and his staff have once again performed an outstanding task. I want to quote a few figures now. If one compares the figures for goods traffic and passenger journeys for the financial year 1946-7 with those for the year 1964-5, one finds that goods traffic increased by 112.22 per cent and passenger journeys by 67.65 per cent. Over the same period the increase in staff was only 26.72 per cent. We are grateful to the General Manager and his personnel for having done their work so outstandingly well.</p>

<p>But the Government has also shown its gratitude towards these officials in a tangible way. For the period 1961-2 to 1965-6 the hon. the Minister and his Department granted salary and wage increases of an average of R18,723,000 per year. Since 1948 a total of R107,000,000 has been spent on housing for the staff under the three housing schemes. The <i>per capita</i> income of White staff has increased by 240 per cent since 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also want to make a few observations about farming matters. I notice in the latest report of the General Manager that transport of stock accounted for 6,331 trainloads. A high percentage of this was drought stock. As a representative of an emergency grazing area, 1 want to thank the Administration for the excellent service they have rendered in this regard. I want to say thank you, not only for the transport of drought stock, but also for the transport of feed to relieve the situation in my constituency.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say it was only slaughter stock. All this stock included drought stock. On the farming front I also want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that, because of this oppressive and paralysing drought, agriculture will have to go through a period of rehabilitation and recovery for quite a number of years. I know the hon. the Minister is a sympathetic Minister in this regard as well, and I therefore want to appeal to him to be very co-operative in regard to tariff determinations for farmers during these years of recovery. We know that tariffs for farming products and requirements have a distinct and important effect on the farmer&#x2019;s cost structure.</p>

<p>I also want to make a few observations about the oil pipelines which was completed in October 1965. This pipeline traverses about 450 miles and eight pumping stations have been erected. And where this beautiful piece of work has been completed in virtually only a year&#x2014; and for this I want to thank and praise the contractors concerned and the Administration &#x2014;it is understandable that there were also small irritations. I am thinking, for example, of the injudicious cutting of wires, the incorrect reconstruction of contour banks, etc. However, these small irritations were quickly removed by both the Administration and the contractors. In particular I want to praise the Administration&#x2019;s &#x201C;trouble-shooter&#x201D; who was sent to iron out the difficulties. He restored peace between the farmers and the contractors in an admirable way, and saw to it that the farmers were fairly treated.</p>

<p><span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0353"/>In regard to this pipeline, I want to raise a matter which, to my knowledge, has not yet been raised in this House. I refer, namely, to the expropriation machinery of the Railways. In the past the Administration generally took over the complete title to the expropriated land, or else it acquired full rights to the use of the land concerned. Now, for the first time, we have had to do with an expropriation where only a servitude over the land was obtained, and the owner consequently retained a large portion of the right of use. Mr. Speaker, I want to make an earnest appeal that the system followed by ESCOM and the Department of Water Affairs should also be applied by the Railways. This means that the farmer who enters into a servitude agreement can see at one glance what his rights and obligations are. In this case the expropriations were made in such a way that the farmer knew that a certain portion of his land would be subject to a servitude, but apart from that, he knew very little about his rights and obligations as regards the servitude. The common law and the statute law doubtless make provision for all these cases, but the farmer, who is as it were a layman in this field, can hardly be expected to know all about the finer points and details. Therefore, Sir, I want to repeat that, in my opinion. it is desirable that in these cases the farmer should be furnished with a complete servitude agreement, as is the practice in the case of servitudes negotiated by ESCOM and the Department of Water Affairs.</p>

<p>When one takes into account that in a country like America even orange juice and coal are transported by pipeline, it can be accepted that conveyance by means of pipelines has a great future in South Africa as well. I therefore appeal to the hon. the Minister to adapt the expropriation machinery so as to keep pace with new developments.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I also represent a big Railway constituency, and I can assure my friends on that side of the House that the railwaymen in my constituency are satisfied with the hon. the Minister. They are proud of him. He is someone who has risen from their own ranks to the highest position in the Railways. They are satisfied with the treatment they receive. If they are called upon to vote in this election, every single one of them will vote for the National Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unlike the hon. member who has just sat down, I cannot claim to have many railwaymen as voters in my constituency. Nevertheless, I have done some observation and there are a few small matters I want to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, small things that struck me as a traveller on our railways and airways.</p>

<p>Before I come to that, however, I want to refer to one particular point in the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down. When the hon. member for Yeoville dealt with the subject of discipline in his speech, he said that he had noticed a great disparity in sentences for more or less the same transgressions, and that he objected to that. The hon. member for Kroonstad has tried to indicate how few appeals succeed. Of course, that does not prove that there is no disparity in sentences; consequently, the allegation by the hon. member for Yeoville has not been refuted.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with a few matters regarding the Airways. Let me say at once that it has always been a pleasure to me to travel on our Airways, locally as well as abroad. The minor points of criticism I want to bring up here should therefore be seen against that background. To begin with, I want to say that I sincerely hope that we will be more successful in future as regards the nature of our buildings at airports.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>That is actually a matter that falls under the Department of Transport, and not under the South African Railways.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it may be that in doing so I will not be satisfying your requirements on this point; I want to mention one or two things in passing. To me the buildings at the Jan Smuts Airport are uninspiring, but I am pleased to be able to say that there has been some improvement as regards the J. B. M. Hertzog Airport at Bloemfontein. I can only express the hope that this improvement will be carried through to other airports as well, particularly the one under construction at East London. In general, I think. I would be justified in saying that there is too much evidence of Railway thinking to be seen in many of our buildings. If we consider what the modern age demands of us in this regard, we will realize that we can do better. And here and there is in fact evidence that we are fully aware of that. I doubt, however, whether there is adequate forward planning as regards the sites set aside for the erection of buildings. Of course, we all appreciate that there had to be a humble beginning. The number of air passengers has increased tremendously, with the result that larger buildings have to be supplied. Now, one should like to see that such essential extensions planned in advance, but in most cases it seems not to have been the case, and apparently those in charge have not made provision for the expansion which actually occurred. I think I can say that that applies to Jan Smuts and to other airports such as D. F. Malan. Here the building was also done according to a railway pattern. If one thinks of possible extensions, one wonders where any new buildings would come, and whether they would fit in with the existing ones. It is common practice among factory owners, when they build a factory, to buy a large site for the purpose, so that there will always be enough space for subsequent extensions. As regards our airports, I fear that is not the case. I should like to recommend to those in charge that they go and look at the Trans-World Airline building in New York. The facilities there are of such a nature that one can board aeroplanes without <span class="col_687-688" refersTo="page_0354"/>touching the ground. Something of that nature is very necessary, particularly here in Cape Town where we sometimes have such strong winds.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>A double-storey building is required for that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I can imagine that that would be required. If that is not possible here, the idea may be adapted to another pattern. That is something which is of great importance to passengers, particularly to the lady passengers. In general, the important point I want to emphasize here is the necessity for keeping abreast with the most recent developments as regards the nature of buildings at airports.</p>

<p>While I am talking about the Airways, there is another small matter I should like to suggest, something which is perhaps not practicable, but which would nevertheless, if it could be supplied, be a very good thing. I am referring to the use of languages in our overseas service. In travelling abroad, one is struck by the fact that in some air services, particularly on the Continent, three or even four languages are spoken. We here in South Africa use only our two official languages. I can appreciate that the addition of a third language would make matters more difficult for our air hostesses, but it should nevertheless be possible to introduce another of the more popular languages, such as French or German. I think it should be possible to train our hostesses so that they would at least be able to read French or German from a prepared note. Passengers will appreciate that, even if the pronunciation of the foreign language is not very good. Where I encountered that on foreign services, it has always struck me as a very friendly gesture. While I am talking about languages, I should like to emphasize the desirability of seeing to it that those people who do broadcasting at our airports, have a sound and exemplary pronunciation of the two official languages&#x2014;English and Afrikaans. The voice is often quite good, but the accent is bad. That applies to the use of both languages, and I am sure a little assistance will effect a great improvement in this respect.</p>

<p>A while ago I spoke of buildings. In this regard I should like to ask whether it is perhaps not too late yet to prevent the Cape Town harbour surroundings from becoming too unattractive. This is supposed to be the &#x201C;Fairest Cape in all the World&#x201D;, and the Railways Administration occupies a special position in this area, namely that adjoining the harbour. In bygone days the bay was beautiful, but I can also appreciate the fact that it necessarily had to be affected by the demands of our time. But surely it is unnecessary for all railway buildings and works to have an unattractive appearance. At the Port Elizabeth and East London harbours the Railways Administration managed to provide the necessary services without spoiling the surroundings of the harbour in any way. I therefore want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to see whether it is not possible to do something about the matter. I appreciate that a railway line and a loco are not two of the most attractive things there are, although some think a loco is very attractive, and they are painted. But in my opinion the buildings and the planning in general leave much to be desired. I trust it will be possible for the authorities concerned to devote a moment of thought to that matter.</p>

<p>With reference to the passenger services on our trains, the hon. the Minister said that the catering service was not receiving the necessary support. Allow me to say in this regard that the Railways Administration has rendered very good service in this respect for many years. There was a time when they served a relatively cheap meal about which nobody could complain. Of course, one can appreciate that as the cost of living rises, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain such a meal at the same price. We can therefore appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s problem. Nevertheless, I think that even under the present circumstances more should be done as regards the nature of the meals. One often still finds the same meal there to-day, but with the difference that very little of it is served. In view of the size of the catering department, I ask myself whether the Railways Administration commands the services of the necessary expert advisers on this matter. Even a small restaurant or hotel usually has the services of persons who have gained a great deal of experience of this aspect. Of course, I appreciate that it is also essential to have somebody there who has a good knowledge of administration. Nevertheless, it is generally felt that where such large-scale buying is done, it should be possible to serve a very good meal at a reasonable price. If something can be done to improve the service in this respect, I am sure the Minister will find that the travelling public will make more use of the Railways&#x2019; catering service. The question also occurs to me whether this aspect of the matter received enough attention in the past.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that I have been travelling on our Railways from my childhood days, and if I look at things as I find them to-day, I have to acknowledge that the Minister has succeeded in imbuing a greater spirit of friendliness in our Railways personnel, something which is definitely to the credit of the Administration. I can only trust that this standard will be maintained in future.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) on the constructive speech he has just made here. He made a few constructive suggestions for improvements, suggestions which deserve further consideration. At the end of his speech he mentioned the spirit of friendliness towards the travelling public which is shown by the railway worker. I am very pleased about that remark and I can confirm that that is indeed the case. He also referred to the necessity for advance planning as regards expansion at airports. I was in Windhoek recently and there I found that new <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0355"/>administration buildings were already under construction, buildings which will be among the most attractive ones in our country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) is not in the House at the moment, and I regret that, because this afternoon he found a tremendous deal to criticize about the amount of overtime railway workers have to do. Now, I should like the hon. member for Maitland to step on to a public platform and declare that he is in favour of the total abolition of overtime work. I have thousands of railway workers in my constituency, and I come into contact with them every day. During the past fifteen years I have come to know the railwaymen very thoroughly. In general the railwayman is easy to deal with if one knows how to handle him. If one went and made a speech such as that made here this afternoon by the hon. member for Yeoville, then I fear one would not gain the goodwill of the railwaymen. He tried his best to catch a few votes this afternoon, but I am quite sure he did not succeed in doing so. He held it against the Minister that he had given private transport contractors the right to transport coal in Johannesburg, and in that regard he complained about the traffic congestion in the streets of Johannesburg. But I submit that the lorries transporting that coal will not make much difference. Is the hon. member aware of the fact that the number of motor cars in our country has increased tremendously? And, incidentally, the cars would not be there unless there were money to buy them with. In other words, the position of the worker has improved to such an extent that he can now afford a motor vehicle. In fact, under the Nationalist Government the number of motor cars in our country has increased by 200 per cent. If one considers that the number of motor cars has increased by 200 per cent, then surely it is not surprising to find traffic congestion in the streets of Johannesburg. That is obvious. But the question I want to put, is what difference would a few lorries make to this state of affairs?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also spoke of a transport crisis. Now I ask myself, when did the hon. member see a transport crisis in our country? We have recently experienced one of the most severe droughts we have ever had in this country. Hundreds and thousands of sheep and cattle had to be transported to other grazing. Great demands were made on the Railways Administration because they had to see to it that this stock was transported. Now let the hon. member get up and tell us whether he knows of a single case where a farmer applied for a truck to transport his stock and could not get it. Hundreds of thousands of cattle and sheep have to be transported to the Johannesburg-complex every day to be slaughtered in order to meet the demand for meat. The hon. member has just mentioned one isolated case where a farmer had to wait fourteen days before he could get a truck to transport his slaughter stock.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member may have been chairman of the Wool Board, but as far as this matter is concerned, he is completely ignorant. He says many things without knowing what he is talking about, just as he has done many other things without knowing what he was doing. I want to deny the hon. member&#x2019;s allegation most emphatically. I deny that it takes fourteen days, even from Middelburg, the place where he lives, until slaughter stock arrives in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Last year during the winter season we had some of the most biting cold this country has ever experienced. The snow lay feet and even yards deep and the whole country shivered from cold. The South African Railways had to transport coal in order to meet people&#x2019;s requirements. Here, too, tremendous demands were made on the Railways, but these were also met most creditably. I am not saying a person could order a whole truck of coal on a certain day and expect it the following day, but I do not know of a single person who needed coal and who was not satisfied. It is therefore my privilege to congratulate the hon. the Minister, the General Manager and his staff on the great task they have carried out so successfully.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I will. I have no intention of not answering it, as you would. I have come to know my voters, and I presume the hon. member who has put the question to me has also come to know his. A voter sometimes seeks the aid of his M.P. on many matters, and I have always assisted them. But there is another matter I want to touch on. 1 am surprised that the United Party has not reacted to the admission the hon. Minister made yesterday, namely that he is expecting a deficit. As a rule we find that if the Minister shows a surplus, he is accused of not paying his employees enough, and when he shows a deficit, of paying them too much. With a view to the coming election, however, they are now afraid of saying anything of that nature. In their time deficits were their stock-in-trade, of course. In fact, they could never show a surplus. This Minister has seen to it that an equalization fund was established in order to cover any deficit. That will make it unnecessary to increase rates in order to meet such a deficit. Why is there going to be a deficit this <span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0356"/>year? Has there been a decrease in the amount of goods to be transported? Or has the number of passengers decreased? As regards the wool clip, it was 10 per cent to 15 per cent less than the previous year. Wool is an item which is transported at a high rate, and consequently the South African Railways had to lose a considerable deal of income in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The transport rate is much too high.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not talking about that now. Then there was the drought which prevented many farmers from marketing their stock. The Railways therefore had a lower income in this regard as well. In addition, the quantity of export maize decreased tremendously. What I have now mentioned, are a few of the factors which contributed towards the deficit expected by the Minister. But another item which contributed to a large extent towards this deficit, is providing houses. Of course, the United Party never even thought of providing houses to the Railway workers in their time. When this Government took over in 1948 the position as regards houses for railwaymen was critical. The hon. member for Maitland can take that from me. Many of the workers had to live in corrugated iron shanties. But go and see what they are living in to-day.</p>

<p>I do not know, but I wish I could rent a house at the rental the railwayman pays for his house. Because of our flourishing economy, building costs have increased tremendously over the past number of years. The cost of building materials and of labour has increased to such an extent that the revenue of the Railways has to show the effects of that.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with our growing economy, I want to refer to the fact that the hon. member for Maitland alleged this afternoon that there was not adequate planning in this respect. But let us compare the capital investments in their time with those in our time. In 1948 the total capital investment was R508,000,000, compared with R1,890,000,000 in 1965; in other words, an increase of R1,382,000,000. And what was the revenue from these capital investments? In 1948 it was R165.000,000 compared with R587,000,000 in 1965.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned I had just made a statement about the capital investment of the South African Railways, in connection with forward planning. I said that in 1948 approximately R508,000,000 had been invested in capital investments, compared with R1,890,000,000 in 1965. That means that in the number of years since the Nationalist Party came into power, there has been an increase of R1,382,000,000. The revenue from those investments showed a corresponding increase; for example, in 1948 the revenue was R165,000,000 and in 1965 it was R587,000,000. In other words, there has been an increase of 350%. That is indeed an achievement to be proud of. I am now going to give you the income and investment capital ratio over a much shorter period. From 1961 to 1965 this ratio increased from 27 &#x00BD;% to 32 &#x00BC;%. Through further planning the railway lines were electrified as a result of the fact that there are certain areas where it may be difficult to get adequate supplies of coal at certain times. As an example. I want to mention a huge undertaking of this nature between Cape Town and Beaufort West, and further construction between Beaufort West and De Aar which is being planned. That is, a distance of just over 500 miles. Further planning&#x2014;unfortunately the hon. member for Yeoville who said that we had done no planning is not here now&#x2014;has been undertaken over distances of hundreds miles, where the railway lines were doubled in order to expedite transport. More new lines have also been constructed.</p>

<p>The most extensive planning was carried out, however, when there was the possibility of delay in transporting petrol from Durban to Johannesburg. A pipeline was laid to eliminate that obstacle once and for all. It did not cost nothing; it was done at the exceptionally high cost of R20,000,000. Other expansions which were also carried out as a result of planning&#x2014;because we had a growing economy&#x2014;were in connection with passenger coaches. In view of the growing economy it was considered that the passenger transport on the South African Railways would increase very rapidly. The General Manager has stated that the hon. the Minister was justified in assuming that. The number of passenger coaches has increased by nearly 2.000 since 1948. The number of goods wagons has increased tremendously. In 1948 there were only 66.700 goods wagons, compared with 121,725 in 1965. In that respect there has therefore also been an increase of almost 100%. As regards planning, therefore, this Government and in particular the Minister did indeed look ahead, and did what was expected of them. As the number of goods wagons increased, the goods transport also increased. In 1948, 53,000.000 tons of goods were transported, and 104,000,000 tons in 1965. That is another increase of almost 100%. The number of persons making use of the Railways has increased correspondingly. In 1948 the number was 244,000,000 and in 1965 it was 425,000,000. In this connection there was also an increase of just over 90%. As regards the harbours, the amount of traffic has increased to a similar extent. Since the Airways are not under discussion now, I shall not refer to them.</p>

<p><span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0357"/>The hon. member for Yeoville launched a tremendous attack on the wages of railway officials. We know what their wages were&#x2014;we know that very well. We know only too well what the wages of railway officials were when the United Party was shifted from the Government benches. In 1948, 98,065 officials were employed by the Railways&#x2014;I am speaking of White officials&#x2014;and they earned R89,000,000; that is, an average of R910 per person.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me just make my point, then the hon. member will have nothing more to say about what they bought then and what they can buy now. In 1964 there was a White establishment of 114,789 and they were earning R233,000,000, compared with R89.000.000 in 1948. and compared with an average income of R2,029 per person&#x2014;an increase of 122 per cent. Now I come to my reply to the observation made by the hon. member for Drakensberg&#x2014;no wonder she is not standing again&#x2014;namely, what they have to pay for the things they buy? I do not know what the hon. member means by &#x201C;thing&#x201D;, I presume the hon. member means what they have to pay for their food or clothing, and how the cost of living has risen since 1948. [Interjections.] I want to tell the hon. member, the two of us can sing at the same time, but we cannot speak at the same time. The salaries of the staff have increased by 122 per cent, and the cost of living has increased by only 65 &#x00BD; per cent. Now you can see what they have to pay. The hon. member for Yeoville said the Minister had recently announced an increase, and he asked why the increase had been announced so late. But. Mr. Speaker, I want to have it placed on record that quite a while ago the United Party already started making propaganda among the railway workers and the public servants, that wages had been frozen and that there would be no increases. When the Prime Minister visited De Aar, I mentioned that to him, namely that that was then the propaganda against the Nationalist Party, and particularly against the Railways Department, that the wages of the railway workers and those of the public servants had been frozen. His reaction was immediate: there was nothing of the kind. Wages had never been frozen. He also stated publicly at De Aar that as soon as the State had completed the investigation, the increases would be announced, and that has now been done. Apart from this increase, from which each person will receive R229 per year, the railway&#x2019;s staff have now been offered an increase of R35,000,000.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>They include that. I want to deal with an observation made here this evening. During dinner-time I thought about the observation made by the hon. member for Yeoville. He asked: by how much have the rents been increased in the meantime? The Department of Railways has not raised the rents one cent. I want that to be placed on record. There have been increases as a result of increases in municipal rates, Because of that the rents were increased. That was not a result of an increase by the Railways Department, however, but as a result of rates, which may have been a quarter-penny or a half-penny or a penny in the pound, and which were increased to. say 1 &#x00BC;d. That is why the rents were raised in respect of certain houses. That was not as a result of the Government&#x2019;s policy. The Railways personnel are grateful for that. Apart from the R35,000,000 I have mentioned, an improvement in staff salaries to the amount of R155.000,000 has been made since 1948. If we add to that the R35,000,000, we have an improvement of R190,000,000. I just want to state that Railway workers are very grateful for that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members have also made the observation, as regards the housing conditions of the railwaymen, that they are being neglected shamefully, In this regard I want to mention three points. The first point is that there are various schemes under which railway workers are assisted. Of course, the hon. members will never publicize that from a platform. There is a departmental housing scheme, a house ownership scheme and a scheme which is supported by the building societies and under which the State contributes 10 per cent and the balance is borrowed from the building societies. Under these three schemes the Department has spent R107,000,000 on housing since 1948. I therefore maintain that the condition of housing for the employees of the South African Railways has improved by more than 200 per cent, compared with what it used to be. At present there is a housing scheme in operation at Noupoort, for example. A considerable number of houses are being built there. I am sure the same applies to Burgersdorp. There are probably other places also where houses are being built. I cannot tell off-hand.</p>

<p>Where are the unoccupied houses? There are unoccupied houses in small towns like Noupoort and Hanover, but it is not necessary to have them occupied. There are no longer stations. There are merely ordinary wayside stations. Why do people have to live in those houses? People do not want to be isolated there. It is difficult to have their children transported to school, and there are no social facilities, and I fully agree that those houses should be unoccupied. Why should people live there in isolation?</p>

<p><span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0358"/>Now I just want to make a request to the Minister. In the Railways, as everywhere, there is the human factor. Here and there contraventions occur. A railwayman may not commit a contravention. That is also correct. If he contravened, the confidence of the public may be lost. The penalties imposed on railway workers are therefore fairly strict. Now I want to ask the Minister: if a person has served his punishment, if he was fined, suspended, or whatever his punishment was, and he applies again for work on the South African Railways, I ask that he be given another chance.

Venter) and, coupled with them, similar figures quoted earlier by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. Van Rensburg). He should have known better. He is the Chairman of the Select Committee on Railways. He should at least have known what he was talking about. When one comes to study these impressive figures&#x2014;and they sound impressive as given by these two hon. members&#x2014; and you analyse the real value of them, they are completely valueless. Unless those figures take into account the depreciation in the value of money during the period they have quoted &#x2014;in the early days the pound was worth 20 shillings, and is now worth about nine shillings &#x2014;and the increase in labour costs, the cost of material, the rocketing cost of living, and the large increase in the number of Railway personnel, these figures are valueless. Unless those figures are reduced to accurate percentages, they are just meaningless in making comparisons. They may be very good figures for use on a public platform at a meeting where people do not have the background to be able to judge them, but to put them over here in an attempt to convince people in this House that this is something to the credit of the Government, in fact really belittles what the Government has done. It does so because those hon. members are trying to put a false face on to what steps the Government has actually taken to effect improvements. I think it is just as well that we explode that fallacy right at the beginning.</p>

<p>In the last session of Parliament, and in a number of previous sessions, the Opposition has time and time again called for realistic improvements in the wages, the general working conditions and the salary scales of Railway employees. You will find the pages of Hansard studded with such requests. You will also find the pages of Hansard equally studded with the at times fairly scornful replies of the hon. the Minister in rejecting any such proposals; rejecting them until he himself and his colleagues found it convenient to give effect to them. We pleaded for a wage and salary scale sufficient to enable the officials and their families to live in decent comfort without being compelled to work excessive hours of overtime and Sunday-time&#x2014;to spend the hours that heaven sent, away from home in order to keep the wheels turning and in order to earn sufficient to make ends meet and to keep their home together in ordinary common decency. Those are the things that we pleaded for, Sir. And with what result? As I say, we often got a scornful rejection of our pleas. Requests from the Railways Staff Associations in the main met with the same replies. Until the hon. the Minister felt that it was expedient to acquiesce to them, the answer was an emphatic &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Railwaymen and their families were left to struggle along as best they could, making ends meet by having to work the excessive overtime reflected in the figures just quoted by the hon. member for De Aar (Colesberg). This was time that they should not have been expected to work long hours in order to earn a living wage. During those same times, the Railways were producing record surpluses year after year. It became common-place for these hidden millions or rands to come along as surpluses. They were those buoyant years when the staff might justifiably have expected to experience some relief&#x2014;some relief as their share of the extra income the extra wealth which their efforts had helped to earn for the Railways. It is in times of such buoyancy and big surpluses, even when such surpluses are to some extent the result of planned surplus budgeting, that the staff have a right to expect some increase. But this is not such a time, Sir. In his speech introducing this Part Appropriation Bill, the hon. the Minister had a very different story to tell. He told us of the progress still being made, but he also told us that he was unable to make any reliable forecast of the financial results of this year owing to the change which has taken place in the last few months. He told us of the general decrease in income in certain sections of the Railway&#x2019;s activities. He also told us that any deficit would be met from the Railway Rates Equalization Fund&#x2014;funds themselves substantially increased during the buoyant years by money earned to a large extent as a result of the loyalty of the Railway staff and put away into these funds instead of a portion of it at least being allocated to the relief of the men who helped to earn it. If these increases had been awarded earlier, they might well have relieved those men of much of the worry and hardship which they and their families are being called upon to endure. I should like to warn those families even now that&#x2014;fine as the position may seem at the moment&#x2014;these advances are only a very temporary loan that they are being granted. They will soon be more than swallowed up by the rocketing cost of living which is, to a large extent, due to the ineptitude of the present Government&#x2019;s management. Is it because there is a general election only eight weeks ahead that the hon. the Minister has used this advance Budget speech&#x2014;an advance Budget speech in which the Budget itself was not forthcoming&#x2014;to paint the brightest possible picture of the Railway position, calculated to win support for the Government on election day? It may be a natural thing for any Minister <span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0359"/>in office to use these things to the best advantage. I am not quibbling about that. But is that one of the reasons that has brought about this change of mind? The hon. the Minister has painted rosy pictures of the increased services and the improvements in the majority of the principal departments of the Administration. The actual position is, of course, not quite so rosy as the Minister painted it. What actually happened was that the tremendous economic and industrial expansion in the Republic over the first half of this year, coupled with the vast expenditure which has taken place to put the Railways in a position to cope with such increased traffic, compelled the increased transport services to carry the extra load of traffic. The extra load was there as a result of the boom. The State provided the extra money to allow the Railways to be in the position to meet that. The Railways were really carrying the extra load as their part of the boom. That demand on their services continued, as the Minister&#x2019;s figures showed, until the Cabinet, of which this Minister is a senior member, found themselves quite unable to deal with the problems of national prosperity. What did they do then? They took urgent and clumsy measures to put brakes on the boom. The second portion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech reflects the application of those brakes&#x2014;brakes on the boom of prosperity which, I will have you remember, Sir, the Government, through the hon. Minister of Finance, claimed that they had planned, and that the Cabinet had planned. This is the boom the Cabinet claim to have planned, a boom which one of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s several economic advisory bodies not only forecast, but advised the Government of the anticipated annual percentage expansion to be expected. So that they should have been in a position to meet the boom and to deal with it. They had all the advance information of the experts for a boom that they themselves had planned. With this pre-warning and advice, this House voted the Minister and his Administration all the money necessary for them to play their part in it. I want to give a couple of examples to contradict the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s claim. The Minister stated that the Railways were equipped to transport coal in the country over long distances. This is not a new claim. The country has heard that claim not once but many times, but the country from one end to the other will not lightly forget the annual coal crises which have been created despite these promises, due mainly to the Administration&#x2019;s failure to transport at any time the coal that the country needed. The public will not lightly forget the dangerous state to which power stations and industrial organizations are reduced every winter and the chaotic conditions created in the Northern Provinces nearer the coalfields when the Administration was forced to throw open the transport of coal to road traffic as they were incapable of handling it by rail, and the conditions which that caused, leading to major public inconvenience narrowly skirting danger in many spheres. These inconveniences and risks are what the public will set against the Minister&#x2019;s reassurances that they are now in a position to meet the demand for the long-distance transport of coal. There is also the failure of the Railways to pursue an active policy of stockpiling coal at strategic points at times when the coal is not being heavily consumed, e.g. in summer. In this city the bins provided in the new power-stations many years ago have never been filled to capacity to this day, either in summer or in winter. One would expect them to be filled in summer to help carry the winter increased load, but that is not done and the City Council has been unable to stockpile the necessary amount of coal during the summer season. That is the information which has been given to me.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the harbours, which are a key point in our national development. They are the gateway to exports and imports without which the whole of the Republic&#x2019;s economic life would soon come to a standstill. The Minister said that harbour requirements were under constant survey. I have not the slightest doubt that that statement is correct and that they are under constant survey. There have undoubtedly been certain improvements. They form portion of the forward planning of the Government. The Minister quoted Richards Bay as an example of this forward’ planning, but Richards Bay itself is a very special case. Basically it is being developed as a strategic port, in view of the Republic&#x2019;s over-all defences towards the east. Special facilities will be provided there for the bulk handling of coal and ore, to be exported eastwards, a demand which is growing very urgent. It is not to be considered on the same plane as the normal commercial ports of the country at this moment. It may be that at a later stage it will. But I want to come to our other main ports which are already in use, and on which the country has to depend.</p>

<p>The Minister gave what appeared to be imposing percentage figures of the increased cargo dealt with, ranging from 15 per cent to 20 per cent over the various ports, but again the public, commerce and industry, cannot get the Government to take action in time, they cannot forget the pressure needed to get action when there were queues of ships lying off our ports day after day unable to get alongside and cargoes were held up due to port congestion. The public cannot forget the delays in landing urgently needed materials and the attendant serious hold-ups of development work for which they are required. Commerce and industry and the public cannot forget the transhipment of cargo over-carried because the vessels could not put into port and the cargoes had to be taken somewhere else and then had to be transhipped back at increased cost. The need for that expansion also was not unforeseen. Warning after warning has been given to the Government and the Administration that this demand was inevitable, but the answer came too little and too late. This is also part of the boom planned and forecast by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s economic advisers. <span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0360"/>The Railways should have been ready for it. They had the advance information. Yes, there is expansion taking place in our ports, valuable expansion, and I do not want to belittle that for a moment, but it is expansion forced on to the Administration when it is no longer able to ignore the existing demands and port congestion. But, in many cases, as I say, it is too little and too late. Take the example of our own development here in Cape Town, the new oil berth. If you study Hansard, Sir, you will see that from the very first day that scheme was spoken of, the Official Opposition warned the Government that the berth was too small to deal with the tankers already in existence and plying off our coasts. Now it has been generally accepted that it is too small before it has even been completed. We are faced with the trouble of having to find berths for the bigger tankers which are coming along every day and which will continue to come here whether we want them or not. In an earlier session the Minister said that the oil companies would have to suit the ships to the accommodation available. But companies do not do that. Within reason one should provide the accommodation for the ships one needs.</p>

<p>I want to quote another example, the fishing harbour for Table Bay, which has been bandied about between one Department and the other for over two years now, one Department passing the buck to the other. It is something desperately needed to clear the main commercial dock for shipping and to provide for the much-needed expansion, a harbour which will cater for deep-sea fishing craft, vessels of from anything up to 3.000 tons, including the carriers and the parent ships, and of trawlers of 500 or 600 tons. These are things which are urgently needed, but there seems to be very little progress made. If this is part of the forward planning, it is time that we got a move on. It is a sort of departmental &#x201C;over to you. Jack&#x201D;. Each Department dodges the issue. The Minister may well plead that the expansion and the development have been delayed by his acute shortage of staff. He can well claim that because it is a fact, especially the shortage of experienced engineering staff which is essential for planning and carrying out the development. But our charge is that the Minister as a senior member of the Cabinet must accept his full share of responsibility for this shortage. He was one of the Cabinet which made the decision which rendered this shortage inevitable, the decision to destroy the already operating United Party immigration plan which was in full swing when this Government came into power and for which the country is paying the price to-day. Something which this Government has done its best to try to revive. The Minister himself told us that on three occasions he sent missions overseas to try to recruit staff and that these proved failures. That is not a valid excuse; it is something for which the Government itself must take the responsibility.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) in his opening remarks referred to the unfortunate fate of the Government&#x2019;s attempt to build up the immigration scheme they initially destroyed, an action for which the whole of the Republic is paying a bitter price to-day. The national life of the country is suffering, and the public will not lightly forget that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I could give other costly failures of the Cabinet of which the Minister is a senior member, but I want to refer to two other matters. The first is a matter which has already been discussed briefly by previous speakers; I just want to touch on another phase of it, and that is the penalty which Railway pensioners suffer through the application of the means test to their special allowance which augments the Railway pension. The pension of the railwayman is his own property. It has been bought and paid for by his deductions and by his years of loyal service to the country. He should be like any other man. This country is in need of skilled technicians and many of the Railway pensioners are the right type of people who can give that skilled assistance. But if they go to work outside of the State employment they are penalized by this deduction from the special allowance. The special allowance is given to bring the money value of the pension into line with the value of money to-day, and in that sense it becomes a portion of the man&#x2019;s pension which he has bought and paid for. Any tax applied to that is equivalent to a tax on his pension. To me it is a shocking thing that at a time when we are in such desperate need of the additional services of such men, they are prevented from earning that little extra money they so desperately need to have comfort in their old age, and they are also prevented from providing the additional services the country so desperately needs because the money they earn is then reduced by this deduction, a practice which does not apply in any other sphere. It would not apply if they worked for the State. Why should it apply if they work elsewhere? They may work for a contractor working for the State and building a railway line which is desperately needed. If the man works on the railway line for the Administration there is no deduction, but if he works on the opposite side of the fence for the contractors he suffers this deduction. The hon. member for Yeoville said it was discrimination, but in fact it goes a long way beyond discrimination.</p>

<p>Then I want to touch on one last point. It will probably be the last time I shall be able to make this request of the Minister in this House. It deals with two very old friends of the Minister and I. That is the suburban railway system and its passengers, and I refer particularly to the suburban railways in the Peninsula and the Northern Areas. One of the Railways&#x2019; most important assets is the suburban railway passenger, even though the Minister&#x2019;s figures show that in the books these lines are run at a loss. But it is a very valuable loss, <span class="col_701-702" refersTo="page_0361"/>because it eventually promotes very sound gains nationally for the country. Despite the progress made in the Peninsula, and there has been progress made on the suburban lines, there is room for much greater improvement in our suburban railway system including in the northern areas as far as the Strand there are still too many trains running late at peak times of the day, there are still far too few express trains to the more distant areas. There are still too many suburban railway stations which qualify better as national monuments than as modern railway stations. These national monuments of the past have long outlived their service and they have long been overdue for replacement. They are far too unattractive under present-day conditions to attract passengers to them. Through their condition including their lack of parking facilities they chase away customers, and the Railways should be a business attracting customers. They force people to travel into the city by car, instead of parking their cars at the stations and going into the city by train I can quote stations in my own constituency of which I have personal knowledge, where the Administration completely failed to keep abreast with local population development in the areas they serve. They might have been good enough 50 years ago, but these stations are quite obsolete to-day. Commercial and industrial development are faster and faster driving residential development southward towards Simonstown and northward towards Bellville. With it there is the demand for residential property, for housing the people who now have to travel backwards and forwards. Coloured passengers, according to the Railway returns, are a most valuable asset on the suburban lines, quite apart from our Whites. In the Retreat-Steenberg area in my constituency there are approximately 4,000 nonWhite workers employed in factories which have developed in that area over the last ten or 12 years. At Retreat there are some 1,500 or more Coloured families working all over the Peninsula but living there in the big municipal housing scheme. But the Retreat station and others are so dangerously overcrowded at peak periods that the train staffs are unable to cope with the crush of passengers trying to get in and out of the trains. I asked that the railway police should help on the stations, but I was told it was not their duty to keep order on the stations. If this is so then Heaven only knows what their duties are. But dangers which affect both White and non-White passengers are developing in this respect in that area and in others. The Minister&#x2019;s engineers have reported for a long time that the first thing that has to be done to bring the suburban services into a proper state of efficiency is for another pair of tracks to be laid at least as far as Plumstead and for another single pair of tracks from there on to Simonstown. Unless that is done, the engineers have reported that it is quite impossible to provide the express service necessary for the more distant areas and to cope with the traffic demand which is developing in those parts. With that must go a comprehensive rebuilding and modernization of the railway stations themselves, including parking facilities. This will be costly but it is essential for railway development to cater for the growing passenger demand in those areas which are not served by any other form of public transport. I want to put this suggestion to the Minister, that he makes this a long-term plan and that he appoint a special committee from amongst his professional staff to work in collaboration with the local authorities and the other interests concerned in those areas. To put forward a planned development of the railways in those areas so that the Administration can develop a five-year plan, or whatever you like to call it, to carry out that development and put the railways in those areas on to a sound footing. It has to come and only such a report can lead to that development. I commend that to the Minister as something well worth doing.</p>

<p>Sir, if you will permit me, I want to say a few closing words. I have spent many years as a member of the Select Committee on Railways of this House. I should like to take this last opportunity I will have in the House to convey to the staff and that Committee itself my appreciation for their co-operation and assistance at all times, and to congratulate the Minister on having such a loyal, experienced and efficient staff without whom the railways in this country could not function. They have given their best as Railway servants in the best interests of the country.</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is with appreciation that we can all bear witness to the dedication with which the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) has fulfilled his functions as member of the House and in particular to the exceptional interest he has taken in Railway matters as a member of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours. We can bear witness to the fact that he has always done his duty, that he has never been bitter in his criticisms and that he was never a person who fought offensively.</p>

<p>The hon. member touched upon a few matters which have already been replied to in full by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. Van Rensburg) and other colleagues on this side, there was the question of the increases in salaries and pensions for example, and I do not intend spending any more time on those matters. The hon. member also complained&#x2014; or so it seemed to me&#x2014;about the fact that there has not been a serious transport crisis in the country during the past few years. It is a fact that the Railways have in recent times been and are to-day able to transport everything offered to them. We here in the Cape, who are the furthest removed from the coal fields, experienced a very severe winter last year, and there was no coal crisis. It now seems to me that the hon. member for Simonstown found it a pity that there had been no coal crisis.</p>

<p>Then I would just like to refer to another point made by the hon. member, i.e. in respect of harbour development. Since 1954 tremendously <span class="col_703-704" refersTo="page_0362"/>great amounts have been spent on our country&#x2019;s Railways and Harbour system in respect of capital development, and since 1954 the tempo has never slackened. Of the R1,890,000,000 capital investment spent by the Railways, R101,000,000 went towards harbour development, and since 1950 when 12,000,000 harbour tons were handled in all our harbours collectively the tonnage increased until last year it was 13,500,000 harbour tons. The revenue from our harbours increased from R2,400,000 in 1950 to R28,000,000 in 1965. This gives an indication of what a tremendous increase there was in traffic. But there was attendant development. Anyone going through the country with open eyes could bear witness to the tremendous development which there has been in the harbours. But the remonstrations of the hon. member and his party here, where they come forward with an argument&#x2014;practically a reproach&#x2014;against the Minister that there has been a stoppage in the harbours, are inconsistent. I want to tell the hon. member that a few years ago when the Railways, as a result of this tremendous capital development, were a little ahead of the country&#x2019;s economy and practically had reserve carrying capacity the Opposition said: We should now invest less capital in the Railways and Harbours; we should keep the development in check. But where would we have been to-day if we had followed their advice?</p>

<p>Owing to the dearth of arguments on the other side of the House. I want to dwell for a moment on one matter raised by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). This is the accusation levelled at the hon. Minister that he had neglected to inform this House fully of all the activities of the Railways, and had neglected to draw a picture of the possibilities for the Railways in the immediate future, particularly in the financial sphere, and that the Minister, instead of doing that, had made use of his speech to make a pre-election political speech. Sir, we are faced with an election. Nobody can get away from that fact. We are coming to the end of a term of government by this side of the House and I think it is no less than right that the Minister should, on an occasion such as this, a last occasion before the election, give an account of his stewardship and the activities of his Department. I think the hon. member for Yeoville would be very much in the wrong if he did not see this matter in the same light. All that the Minister did was to tell this House, and it was for the information of the country too, what the Railways have done over the past few years; how they have acquitted themselves of their task and what the development was in every department. The United Party does not like that however. The United Party does not like hearing where we picked up the Railways in 1948, and they do not like hearing about what achievements the Railways has been capable of over the past years under the Nationalist regime. That is why I want to dwell on a number of these aspects to-night, and in particular I want to point out what an important role the Railways has played in the development of South Africa during recent years. The development of the transport system of Africa is intimately connected with the development of our country&#x2019;s economy and its progress and in the economic field and to-day we are having it good. In recent years under the Nationalist regime there has been an unprecedented development in the industrial sphere. Our country&#x2019;s transport system played a decisive role in this progress and prosperity. In this process of industrial development and economic growth our national transport service was not a mere camp-follower. The transport service was not carried on the back of economic progress. The Railways was an important tool which was used to initiate, extend and carry on the development in our country. Wherever it went in our country the Railways carried along with it prosperity and development. It made a real and vital contribution to the development of every sector of our national economy, and under this Nationalist regime it performed this comprehensive and responsible task with great distinction.</p>

<p>This national transport system of South Africa of which we, together with the United Party and every railwayman, can be justly proud to-night played its part in various different spheres and I cannot go into all the aspects, but there are a few aspects in regard to which the United Party and ourselves took up diametrically opposed stands, and I want to deal with one or two of them to-night.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to mention the tariffs policy of the Railways. This is a matter on which the United Party and ourselves never saw eye to eye. There is no doubt that the Railway tariffs policy which was implemented under this Government made a valuable contribution to the development, not only of our secondary industries, but to our overall national economy. With its tariff policy of &#x201C;what the traffic can afford&#x201D;, the Railways succeeded not only in benefiting individuals and limited groups and interests, but also in serving the country as a whole.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, with its road transport system. Against this policy of what the traffic can afford, the United Party stood by the so-called principle of &#x201C;the costs of the service&#x201D;, whereby there has to be a separate tariff covering the transport costs for each separate article. I now want to point out how, as a result of the tariffs policy which was pursued under the Nationalist Government, the country&#x2019;s economy benefited and the development we have to-day was able to take place. In the first place I want to mention agriculture, and in this regard every farmer and anybody who looks around him and takes in what he sees, can bear witness to the fact that the Railway tariffs have made a considerable contribution to the promotion of our agriculture and the stabilization of our agricultural products. <span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0363"/>Nobody can deny this. For example, there were special tariffs to promote maize exports; there were special tariffs for export fruit; there were other tariffs for agricultural machinery and fertilizers. There were also special tariffs for fodder, for the transportation of cattle from drought-stricken areas, and without these special tariffs agriculture would not have been able to develop to the extent it has developed. In these difficult times through which agriculture is going to-day, where would it have been without these special tariffs which the Railways introduced for agriculture?</p>

<p>&#x2026;at tariffs for which no other cartage contractor or private body could do so. No other member on the opposite side can dispute this fact. Bring me anybody to-day who would transport coal from the Reef to Cape Town at the same tariffs. But this is a service which the Railways rendered to the country and all the industries. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Yeoville must not come along here as he did this afternoon, with the criticism that the private cartage contractors should be allowed to undertake more transport. Private cartage contractors do not want to render these services to the nation. The Railways have been called to do so and over the years they have performed this task magnificently. But apart from coal, there were also low tariffs for the transport of export ore and in this way our mining industry was encouraged by the tariffs structure of the Railways, as carried out under the policy of the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>Take our secondary industries for example. We know that during the pre-war years, when South Africa was beginning to develop in the economic sphere, the Railways had special distribution and preference tariffs in order to encourage young industries, to enable them to sell their products in South Africa in competition with imported products, and if it had not been for that, many of the flourishing industries which we have in South Africa to-day would never have existed. They owe their present existence to this stimulus which they received from the national transport system under the policy of this Government.</p>

Even to-day the industries are being helped in this way by the national transport organization of our country, and in order to promote exports, there is still a special system of export tariffs as a result of which the Railways sacrifices an estimated R3,000,000 in revenue each year.</p>

But there are other aspects as well. The Railways has made itself felt in our national housekeeping, in our national economy and in other ways as well. Just take for example the Railways&#x2019; role as consumer. The Railways, as hon. members all know, is one of the largest consumers in our country, and, true to the policy of the National Party of putting South Africa first, of purchasing South African products first, the Railways has over the year spent enormous amounts in our country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come in a moment to that aspect of imports. Railway purchases at the moment total approximately R150,000,000 per annum. That is proof of the tremendous buying power of the Railways. It is proof of the tremendous influence which the Railways has on our country&#x2019;s economy. The purchases of locally manufactured goods total approximately R125,000,000 per annum. In its policy of preference for South African goods the Railways even went so far as to purchase locally manufactured goods at a price which in many cases was 10 per cent higher than the price for which it could be imported&#x2014;something which the Opposition would never have done.</p>

<p>We come to another field, the field of industrial development, and here I can tell hon. members opposite that many industries in South Africa came into being as a result of, and are to-day still totally dependent for their existence on the orders they get from the Railways, and if it were not for the Railway orders and the fact that the Railways had those industries manufacture its requirements, then those industries, some of which are vital to our economy, would never have come into being and would never have been able to survive. In this way the Railways is, for example, one of the major purchasers of steel goods in our country.</p>

<p>I shall come in a moment to things we imported. Ten years ago we still imported ore, passenger vehicles and electric locomotives. It never occurred to United Party men that these things could be manufactured in South Africa. To-day the Railways spends millions of rands each year on the manufacture of Railway vehicles, passenger vehicles and electric locomotives here in our country. The United Party men, if they had been in office, would still have been importing those things to-day. That is my reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which we cannot refrain from mentioning. The Railways has a tremendously great staff, and each month the staff earn approximately R25,000,000, thanks to this Nationalist Government which does not make them work for starvation wages as the United Party Government did in its day, and that R25,000,000 reaches the remotest corners of our country and every little shop in the remotest corners of our country is benefited by the buying power of the railwayman. But I want to make another point here: The Railways to-day is the largest employer in the country; the Railways to-day affords many White people coming from the country districts who have very little education and no vocational training, people who could find a refuge nowhere else, the opportunity of making a decent living, and that is why we are grateful for this tremendous role which the Railways has played in the development of our country over the past 17 years. Ten per cent of our national income to-day derives from the Railways and from our joint transport services.</p>

<p>This is a brief sketch of the Railways&#x2019; contribution to the stimulation of our country&#x2019;s economy. Every Railway servant can be as proud as we are to-day of the achievements of the Railways over the past 17 years under the Nationalist Party regime.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Why were the Railways able to meet the high demands made of them during those years? I shall tell you: It was because this transport system of South Africa, under this Nationalist Government, was built up into the most modern and most effective national transport system in the world. It has always been the aim of the Administration and the Management to strive single-mindedly to achieve the greatest measure of success as well as of efficiency and modernization, and they have succeeded in carrying out properly, this important, primary function which the Railways has to fulfil, namely to promote the national development by means of cheap transport. They have succeeded in making available first-class transport services at the lowest tariffs. Efficiency and modernization was the watchword of the Administration, and in order to achieve that they strove to maintain certain fundamental policy principles. I want to mention just one of them, and that is the policy of the electrification of our railway system. More than 4,200 route miles of our tremendous railway network have been electrified to-day and more than 1,000 route miles of electrified line is under construction. On the other hand, the Railways made a start with the introduction of diesel power on certain lines to replace steam power. This policy of the introduction of electrical tractive power and diesel power has brought about a revolution in our railway transport system.</p>

<p>To prove what a revolution took place as a result of the use of tractive power I can mention that over the past ten years the use of steam tractive power remained practically constant. Electrical tractive power on the other hand, which was 4,897,000 lbs. in 1951. increased to 21,887,000 lbs. last year.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. speaker, if we spend money on the railways in order to modernize the railway system so as to be able to comply with the transport requirements of the country, then hon. members on the opposite side say that we are spending a lot of money; if the railways fails to comply with the high demands made of it, then they say on the other hand that we neglected to invest sufficient money in the railways. that is precisely how a united party man argues! the joint diesel power in 1951 was 17,000 lbs., in 1965 it was 7,192,000 lbs. in 1950 we only had two diesel locomotives, and now we have 168 in operation. in their day this sort of thing never occurred to the united party: In this way this Government has built up the Railways so that it was and still is able to supply in full the transport requirements of the country.</p>

<p>I just want to mention in conclusion that the National Party can come along here at the end of its term and make a proud report of its stewardship. Thanks to the primary actions of the Railways, the Railways can to-day transport all the traffic which it is offered. Things are going well with the Railways and for that reason things are going well with South Africa too. But things would not have gone so well if the Railways had had to operate under a United Party regime, for it is the Nationalist Government which protected the national transport system of ours against being demolished by the Opposition; it is the United Party who agitated over the years that some of the best <span class="col_709-710" refersTo="page_0365"/>sources of revenue of the National railway system should be drawn away to private bodies. In this way they wanted to break the so-called transport monopoly in South Africa, but what they really had at the back of their minds was that they wanted to break the Railways&#x2014;and they could not succeed in this because the Nationalist Government took our national transport service under its protection. The United Party wanted to go further in its process of demolition. At a certain stage some of the pre-eminent members of the Opposition said that the Minister was wrong in his policy of investing as much capital in the Railways as he in fact did.</p>

<p>It was said by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), by the former member for Wynberg. Mr. Russell, by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) and by other members on that side. I quoted it chapter and verse last year and laid it as the door of the hon. member for Yeoville. I am saying that the Opposition wanted to break the Railways by curtailing the development of the Railways and by drawing off the best sources of revenue of the Railways to private interests. The United Party wanted to break the Railways because they are not fond of the Railways; because the railwayman votes Nationalist. The United Party is therefore quite welcome to woo the officials of the Railways Administration like cooing doves. They, however, will know who their friends were in the past and who their friends still are to-day. Under all economic circumstances South Africa has been able to rely on the contribution of the national transport services. In times of prosperity it was there to do its share, but in times of economic setbacks too, as in the early 60&#x2019;s when South Africa had its back to the wall and was being attacked both from within and without and when attempts were being made, with the approval of hon. members on the opposite side, to bring it to its knees, when they were doing everything in their power to place obstacles in our way, when they were putting their seal of approval on the attempts which were being made to break South Africa economically, then the Railways were there, in times of need, too, to do its share.

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down made a speech which was illuminating at least in one respect. Until the last three or four minutes of his speech, it indicated one thing which I had never known before and that is that the hon. member is able to read. He has obviously read the report of the General Manager and he has summed up that report by extracting from it certain isolated statistics which he thought would make an attractive-sounding election speech. [Interjections.] Well, obviously I have misjudged the hon. member. I am sorry, if he has not read the report then it is a strange coincidence; then someone must have told him what was in the report, because his speech was nothing but a summary of the highlights of the General Manager&#x2019;s report until in the last five minutes of his speech he accused this side of the House of trying to sabotage the Railways. He used the words &#x201C;waar ons die Spoorwee opgetel het in 1948&#x201D;. Sir, I will tell them where they pick it up in 1948. They picked up a Railway Administration which had on the Brown Book £231,000,000 (R462,000,000) of planned, approved development. Provision was made for that development in the Brown Book passed by Parliament, passed by the United Party Government. And what did his Government do with that developmental project? They cancelled it; they &#x201C;scrubbed&#x201D; the lot and having &#x201C;scrubbed&#x201D; it they then appointed a commission to investigate why they had &#x201C;scrubbed&#x201D; it. It was something like the grievances commission they appointed at the same time. They were going to show in what a shambles the Railways were and, by political incitement and nothing more nor less than political incitement, they got 3.000 people to lodge complaints before their grievances commission, and even their own commission&#x2014;and that is saying a lot for a Nat commission&#x2014;could only find a handful of justifiable complaints. Even their own commission, appointed to investigate the capital development programme&#x2014;and the hon. member cannot deny it; he knows it is true&#x2014;found that apart from a few pictures and a couple of hotels every single cent of that R462,000,000 developmental project was urgently needed. I challenge the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) or the member who speaks after him to produce the figures in this House of the developmental programme of the United Party and the amount spent on capital development by that Government from the time they came into power.</p>

<p>What they took over from us was a railway system functioning effectively and efficiently and meeting the demands of the country&#x2019;s transport, but what is more, it was a railway system which was functioning despite the fact that for six years some 35,000 of the Railway employees were serving their country in its armed forces; were building bridges and tunnels and roads in North Africa, in Italy. On the Continent of Africa, on the front doorstep of the White man&#x2019;s security in South Africa. The railwaymen of South Africa were doing their duty to South Africa while the supporters of that party were blowing up the very railway bridges which we handed over to them. Not only did we have to keep the railways going, we had to have guards on every bridge and on every station. We had to have civilian guards on every set of points guarding them against the supporters of that party, who were not using words to sabotage the Railways but who were using the bombs of the enemies of South Africa to blow up the bridges over which the White people of South Africa were riding in the trains of this country, <span class="col_711-712" refersTo="page_0366"/>endangering the lives of the people of South Africa, endangering the lives of women and children; yet the hon. member asks: &#x201C;Waar het ons die Spoorweë opgetel in 1948?&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back from the past; I want to come to the present, to this afternoon, and I want to refer to two speeches made by hon. members opposite. [Interjections.] I am not referring to the bleating of the goat of Cradock&#x2014;I mean the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker), who may soon be back in his little kraal amongst his sheep. I want to refer firstly to the speech of the hon. membor for Bloemfontein (East) Mr. van Rensburg) who accused us on the United Party benches of making political capital by pleading for an increase in the wages of railway servants. When we pleaded for the railwaymen last year and the year before and said that it was in the interests of South Africa that the railwaymen should receive an increase they accused us of making political capital; they accused us of trying to buy votes. I want to put this to that side of the House: If to ask for an increase is bribery, if to ask for an increase is trying to buy votes, then what is giving an increase? The hon. member says it is in order; it is O.K. to buy the voters&#x2014;to give the increase&#x2014;but it is wrong to plead for an increase. I want to say to every member on that side of the House&#x2014;and I say this without fear of contradiction&#x2014;that if the United Party had not fought tooth and nail for two years for an improvement in railway salaries and in conditions of service, they would not have got the increase before the election. The railwaymen have got their increases because of the fight that we put up, because of the demands that we made and because of the knowledge of hon. members opposite that eventually they would have to accede to our demands. Now they come along and say: &#x201C;Look what we have done; we have given the railwaymen an increase&#x201D;&#x2014; three years too late and too little, because for three years the cost of living in South Africa has crept up and up, ahead of the salary and wage increases of the railway servants, and now that the increase has come on the eve of an election, what is the position? We note that the election is so close the the railwaymen will probably still have a few cents of that money left before they pay the debts which they incurred over the last few years. For three years the Railway servants and the Public Servants of South Africa had to incur debt and more debt. This increase will do no more than pay what they have already incurred in the way of debt. It will not put them on the road to a better future; it will only help to meet the liabilities which they have already incurred. The hon. member for Parow spoke here in glowing terms of the wages paid to railwaymen; he said &#x201C;Ons gee hulle nie ’n hongerloon nie&#x201D;. Sir, this is the fishy thing about the hon. member&#x2019;s speech: He represents a Railway constituency but apparently now he is not interested in the welfare of the railwaymen. He referred to railwaymen once in his speech and that was to indicate how much they were contributing to the economy of South Africa What is fishy about his speech is not only his lack of concern for the poor man, the railwayman, the man who has to live and struggle to exist on the salary he earns but that he called it a wage which is not &#x201C; ’n hongerloon&#x201D;. Now, I do not know what railwaymen he has in his constituency, Mr. Speaker. But the week before I came to Cape Town I dealt with the pathetic case of a man with a wife and four children living on a pathetic £35 per month. I repeat, Sir, a mere £35 per month nett. Out of that he had to pay his rent, buy clothing and food and send his children to school. Is that not a &#x201C;hongerloon&#x201D;? Why, I pay my Bantu driver almost more than that. He receives £35 a month, and yet hon. members opposite say they do not pay a &#x201C;hongerloon&#x201D;, and that a hunger wage was paid by the United Party. What does that hon. member regard as a hunger wage, Mr. Speaker? [Interjections.] Or has he become so far removed from the troubles and struggles of the ordinary man that he no longer feels for them? Has he grown so far away from the men who have to battle to make ends meet that he can no longer feel for them? I say to the hon. member, Mr. Speaker, if I were a member of the Government party, and the Government made people live to-day on a mere £35 per month, a man with a wife and family having a responsible job in the Government Administration, I would not get up and thank the hon. the Minister and the Government. I would get up and demand a better life and a better future for those people. My charge against this Administration and this hon. the Minister is that the lower-paid worker on the railways is not treated as a human being. He is treated like a cypher, a number fed into a calculating machine or computer. The only interest which the Government seems to have in the worker, Mr. Speaker, is how he comes out as a statistic. Look at this report of the General Manager of the Railways. In it the worker is treated as a statistic. We read here how many workers per thousand are killed; how many passengers per million are injured; how many tons per mile are transported. Read this report and it becomes clear it is but the calculations of a computer. The human element is missing. It is the human element which regards people as individuals as human beings which is missing. I want to give the House an example of what I mean. I have recently written to the hon. the Minister about the matter, but I have not yet received a reply from him because it is too soon. I will give a striking example of how workers are treated as mere statistics, strangled by the red tape of the Administration. I have had three cases this year of men who were charged with offences in civil courts. They alleged that they were victimized by a railway policeman whom they had annoyed. He charged them but they were found not guilty and discharged. They were completely exonerated from any blame. In the process they were suspended from duty for between six and eight months each. In the <span class="col_713-714" refersTo="page_0367"/>process one of the men incurred over R1,000 legal expenses, whilst the others incurred R300 and R400 each in legal fees. As I said, they were found not guilty and cleared of the charge against them. They were not charged departmentally for contravening any railway regulation. They were not subjected to any disciplinary action. They were reinstated but told they were not going to be paid for the period of suspension. Last week one of those men was notified that his period of suspension was being regarded as unpaid leave. The Administration said that because of that leave of absence he would have deducted from subsequent salaries the usual pay-sheet deductions which would have occurred had he been paid a salary during the suspension, namely stoppages for insurance, housing, pension, and various deductions. This means that at the end of his first month he will probably draw no pay at all. At the whim of one person who laid a charge against him he has in effect been fined six months&#x2019; pay. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider this regulation which lays down that if a man is suspended and reinstated in the service with no railway conviction against him he nevertheless loses his pay for the period of suspension. It has been a proud principle of South African justice that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty. But as far as the hon. the Minister of Transport is concerned, we have a new principle, namely that a man is guilty until found innocent. And having been found innocent, there is no reinstatement with retrospective effect. I want to plead that where a man has been found innocent by the courts, he must be reinstated and be paid for the full period of his suspension.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. members for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) and Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) came here with a multitude of figures to illustrate what the Government was doing and has done for the worker. But I allege that the figures quoted by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) were nothing else but a political trick. The hon. member had the temerity to inform this House this afternoon that the workers on the South African Railways had received R1,600,000 in increases since 1948. I challenge him at the time by way of interjection. Do you know how he calculates his figures, Mr. Speaker? He takes the increase granted in 1949 and multiplies it by 17, because the workers have had it for 17 years. Then he takes the 1950 increase and multiplies that by 16, and he adds it to the previous figure. So he takes year by year and multiplies the increase by one figure less and then he adds all the figures up. So he ends up with a figure of R1.600,000.000. He divides it by 18 years. That figure is divided by 200,000 employees-&#x2014;both Black and White&#x2014;giving one a figure of R440 per year. Now, Mr. Speaker, ask any railwayman whether he has received R440 per year increase for 14 years. The hon. member makes such a statement, well knowing that very few people are going to check on it. He knows very few railwaymen will take the trouble to sit down with a pencil and piece of paper and work it all out. He believes he will thereby mislead the railwaymen of South Africa into saying, &#x201C;Look what the Government has done for us. it has given us nearly R500 a year increase.&#x201D; The correct figure is something like R4 per month. A mere R50 per year. That is the figure for a period extending over 18 years. And that is the measure of the immense generosity of the Nationalist Party! This is how they try to mislead the workers. This is how they try to make them think what a wonderful time they are having. Because already people are beginning to forget their debts of last year and the previous year Their wives have had to go out and work to make ends meet. If not, they have had to borrow money or find it in some way or other. Somehow they have managed to struggle through at a lower standard of living. They have managed to keep going.</p>

<p>We accept without equivocation the traditional colour bar in industry, laid down by negotiations between employer and employee.

And a slip of the tongue, when I referred to &#x201C;night jobs,&#x201D; was perhaps not intentional but that is what they are. In the day-time you have White shunters on duty, and at night you have Abdul, the Black shunter, shunting trains. And so they call them the night shunters because they only appear at night. The hon. the Minister is diluting White jobs, and he is doing it correctly in terms of United Party policy, in terms of the United Party&#x2019;s law. He is using a law which we put on the Statute Book in order to negotiate with the employees&#x2019; organizations. He seeks their agreement, he obtains it, and that.

That hon. member knows very well that is has never been, nor is it now, the policy of the United Party to endanger the standard or to challenge the position of the White worker with uncivilized or low-paid labour. The &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is an industrial expression used in international trade unionism, something which is so far removed from the knowledge of the hon. member that we cannot expect him to understand it.

<p>I had hoped to deal with some other matters concerning our Airways. Because here too, I believe we have a forgotten group of the staff. I refer to the ground staff, the maintenance staff and the cabin crews. These people, like the middle group of the Railways, are I believe, being taken for granted. Whilst I have not time to develop the theme, I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to recognize that these people are as important to the proper functioning of the Airways as the flying crews. The maintenance staff have in fact grown less since last year. Their numbers have decreased from 1,335 to 1,329. And that despite the fact that more aeroplanes, many of them having a complicated and involved structure, have entered the service.</p>

<p>Yes, only six less, but how many new aeroplanes have not been taken into service? And are those aeroplans not of a more complicated nature? These people are being asked to carry out far more responsible duties. They are working on planes with a greater passenger capacity. And while hon. members on that side crack jokes about the lives and safety of the Airways passengers, I take the matter seriously. I plead with the hon. the Minister to think again about the status and pay of those people working on the ground who ensure that our aeroplanes keep flying, those workers who handle the passengers at the airports, and the staff who serve them in the air. I believe there is still a leeway to be made up and the hon. the Minister can do something for those who are doing so much to make our Airways service the proud service that it is.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister in his reply will also deal with the questions put to him concerning the breakdowns experienced on the new Boeing 727 aircraft. Brake difficulties have been experienced and there have been several break-downs. I believe that to be another matter to which the public of South Africa are entitled to a frank answer from the Minister.</p>

<p>On other occasions we can deal in more details with some of the minor problems. But I have only dealt with these affecting people.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by saying that our appeal to the hon. the Minister is to look upon the workers of the S.A.R. not just as cyphers to see how much profit they make, not just as figures and pawns in a business undertaking. I ask him to regard them as human beings, as fellow South Africans with pride and feelings of their own. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to lift the bottom grades, the ungraded railway workers, the lowest paid employees of the service, to help them to rise to higher positions and with those higher positions to a higher standard of living. Because I believe it is unworthy of South Africa that many of our White people should live as they do and carry out the tasks which the Railways expect of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, according to information I have received, the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) suffers from a nightmare in which he dreams that a voice repeats as regularly as a train on the rails, &#x201C;Medwin, Medwin, Medwin, Medwin &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) also mentioned the brilliant plan the United Party is supposed to have left behind in 1948. I suppose the transport service had to be carried out by means of fine paintings and magnificent hotels, for that was the <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0369"/>planning we inherited at that time. Well, with beautiful paintings and luxurious hotels, one would not be able to transport a single parcel from one place to another. [Interjections.] The hon. member insinuated here that railwaymen can be bribed with money to vote in a certain way. I want to tell the hon. member that it is a terrible insult to the Railway workers if he pretends that their votes can be bought by increasing their salaries. It is not and has never been in the minds of the Government or members on this side to grant railwaymen increases in order to get their votes. Let me substantiate this statement by an example.</p>

<p>In 1960 the hon. the Minister said in this House that he would increase the wages and salaries of railwaymen when the time was suitable. That was before the election. And he did not increase them. In 1961, after the election, the time was suitable and then their salaries and wages were increased accordingly. Last year, when they insisted on increases, the hon. the Minister said once again that it would be done at a suitable time. If the increases were granted last year, they would have added to the inflationary tendency. But the measures taken then by the hon. the Minister of Finance curbed those tendencies. That is why the increases could in fact now be granted without harming the country&#x2019;s economy. No member on this side would dream that it is possible to buy a railwayman&#x2019;s vote, but we shall make a point of telling the railwaymen at every election meeting that that side of the House is of the opinion that the railway officials can be bribed. This side of the House rejects that insinuation with the contempt it deserves. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Point) had a great deal to say about the rate for the job, as though it were an industrial term. It is no longer a matter of policy with them. It is merely an industrial term for integration. Let us see what the hon. Leader of that side had to say in this connection. According to the publication <i>Skietgoed</i> which covers the year 1964 to 1965, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the following in Bloemfontein in 1963 (page 1967)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is there any person present who can defend a policy prohibiting a human being from using the abilities God gave him to the best advantage, that denies him the right to improve himself through hard work and self-discipline and would stop him from changing himself, from being a high-cost burden to a producing asset? A United Party government will replace job reservation by the proper application of the principle of the rate for the job.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Now the hon. member comes and tells us that the rate of the job is merely an industrial term, and that it would be a lie if it were pretended here in the House or outside &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member said it would be a lie if we spread the story. Well. I want to tell the hon. member that I am going to repeat that. I am going to repeat it at every meeting I hold. For their policy is one of the rate for the job. Now an atrocious allegation is made against the hon. the Minister. The hon. member alleged that the hon. the Minister now wants to carry out the policy of that side. I presume the hon. the Minister also wants to implement the policy of the rate for the job, according to what that hon. member alleges. That is not at all what the hon. the Minister said. I shall quote from Hansard what the hon. the Minister said last year in this connection. The Minister said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to point out too that there are certain posts in which non-Whites cannot be employed and where I am sure the staff associations would not agree to it. Let me give a few examples. We have a serious shortage of station foremen and station masters, but I do not think there is any hon. member on that side who would suggest that non-White station masters should be appointed in White areas. In the case of conductors, firemen, drivers&#x2019; assistants on locomotives, skilled artisans, to mention just a few posts, it would be quite impracticable and undesirable to appoint non-Whites.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But those are not reserved jobs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We are now talking about policy. It is the policy of the Nationalist Party that these skilled artisans should not be replaced in the Railways. Where does the rate for the job come into it now? That is what the hon. the Minister said in that connection last year. The hon. member should stop misrepresenting matters.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to what the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) said. He went into a lamentation for our harbours, which are supposedly not enjoying the necessary attention. I am dumbstruck by his argument. Only this morning the hon. the Minister for Finance said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For example, imports increased from R1,127,000,000 in 1960 to approximately R1,800,000,000 in 1965 &#x2026;</block>

<p>If during the past five years there has been an increase of 60 per cent in the import trade handled by our harbours, how can the hon. member now aver that our harbours cannot do the necessary work? The harbour have contributed their share to the tremendous boom in the country&#x2019;s economy. How can the hon. member complain that the harbours are not receiving adequate attention? The export figures are even more imposing&#x2014;I do not even want to quote them here.</p>

<p>Sir, the Railways, like any means of communication in any state, are the lifeblood of this state, for no country&#x2019;s economy can flourish if the communication system is not in first-class condition. And surely that is the case in South Africa even more than in any other <span class="col_719-720" refersTo="page_0370"/>country. In fact, I want to state to-night that the Railways are virtually entirely the lifeblood of the South African economy. Without this lifeblood the boom to which the hon. the Minister of Finance referred in this House this morning, would not have been possible at all.</p>

<p>I just want to ask hon. members on that side a few questions. If the Railways and Harbours had not kept abreast with developments, would there then, for example, have been an average growth rate of 6 &#x00BC; per cent per year in this country? Would we have experienced that if it had not been for the Railways&#x2019; share in that economic boom? Would we have had that boom at all without the Railways? For example, take the predominating role of our industries to which the hon. the Minister of Finance referred this morning. Would industry have risen to those heights if it had not been for the Railways, which were organized so efficiently to carry out the necessary work? I want to give the hon. member for Yeoville one specific example. In 1953 the station Coalbrook. near Sasolburg, was a small station with only two railway lines. But let him go there to-day and see the amount of goods being sent by rail from there. Let him go and see the role our Railways play at just that one small station in South Africa.</p>

<p>A man would have to be blind not to see that our Railways have played an exceptionally important role in the development of our economy. But I now want to come to a few other points made by the hon. member for Yeoville. The hon. member&#x2019;s speech here this afternoon was merely a repetition of his speech last year. In fact, he repeated his speech of last year virtually word for word. Let me quote a few phrases from both speeches, then you can see for yourselves. Last year he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I went to places like Angelo&#x2014;to mention a few examples &#x2026;</block>

<p>This afternoon he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I recently stood on a mine dump at the Angelo station and there I saw how the boys were working.</block>

<p>It is significant that the hon. member should take up a position at Angelo station to gather inspiration for all his speeches in this House. The only difference one finds is that he takes up a position on a different dump every time. I do not know on which dump he is going to stand next year.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<p>In any event, he said the following with reference to the people there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would not be surprised if they have to run from ten to 12 miles a day. because that station and the other stations I visited, were congested with wagons. There was a congestion of traffic.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member said this afternoon. Now look what he said in his speech last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One saw tremendous congestion and bundling up of trains outside these marshalling yards and outside the signals.</block>

<p>On one occasion he counted as many as 40 trains.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Is he still at Angelo?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he is still at Angelo. This year he comes up with the same story. Last year he also came up with the story that there was a time when shunters had to work long shifts of up to 12 hours. This afternoon he came here and said the same thing, except that this time he increased it to 14 hours. These, Mr. Speaker, are things he noticed while standing there on the mine dump. From there he sees what long hours have to be worked and how the regulations are infringed. The only difference between the speech this year and that of last year is that last year he did not stand on a mine dump. On that occasion he also referred to refreshments, and alleged that workers could not get refreshments there because there was no restaurant. Because he was standing on a mine dump at this time, he could not see whether or not they now have a restaurant. He does not know; that is why he did not refer to that again this year. Apparently that hon. member wants to assume the image of a sentinel on the walls of Zion, or rather, a sentinel on Angelo station. This year he noticed only 35 trains there, that is, a difference of five, for last year he had noticed 40 trains.</p>

<p>As regards pensioners, this afternoon he repeated his speech of last year on the same point virtually word for word. He actually comes here and repeats the same allegation made by him last year, and that despite the fact that the Minister gave a complete and satisfactory reply to that last year. I have his two speeches on that matter here, and I find that last year he only spoke a bit longer than he did this afternoon. I suppose that is because this Session is rather short, and he is in a hurry to get to his constituency.</p>

<p>He also asked what the hon. the Minister was doing to meet the shortage of labour. Last year he asked the same question and the Minister then replied to it. The Minister then pointed out to him that there were three methods which could be used to meet the shortage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But not one of the methods was of any use.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Apparently the hon. member did not listen, or else he would have realized that the methods applied have indeed been of considerable use. If I can give the hon. member any advice, then it is that he should rather spend some time on studying the Minister&#x2019;s speeches, instead of taking up a position on the mine dumps at Angelo station. As I <span class="col_721-722" refersTo="page_0371"/>said, the hon. the Minister last year mentioned the various methods which could be used to meet the shortage of labour. <i>Inter alia,</i> he pointed out that salaries would be increased when the time was ripe. Since then, we have had that increase. Considering the fact that those increases are not even in full operation yet. how can the hon. member come and allege that they have been of no use? Or is he first going back to the mine dump at Angelo station to try to determine what the effects of the increase are? How can the hon. member aver that mechanization has been of no use, when mechanization is still being introduced on the Railways every day? The Railways Administration is continually mechanizing work methods. If all these things have been of no use, how could the Railways possibly have been able to transport all the goods which resulted from a growth-rate of 6 per cent in the country&#x2019;s economy? Another method referred to by the Minister was the providing of facilities. These facilities are being provided. For example, study bursaries and housing are being provided. On housing alone, R5,000.000 is spent every year. That is a remarkable achievement. Not only does providing all these facilities help to retain the services of the Railway&#x2019;s staff, but it makes it possible to meet the demands made on the Railways. In fact, the Railways are flourishing in the fullest sense of the word.</p>

<p>Then there is the matter of the R35 allowance which pensioners can receive if they return to work on the Railways. Why should the hon. the Minister be expected to subsidize private firms for whom pensioners work, in that way?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not paid to the firms, but to the pensioners.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member requested that pensioners should not be deprived of this allowance as a result of their decision to enter the employment of private firms. The hon. member is forgetting that this allowance is not part of the basic pension, but is a cost-of-living allowance which has no connection with the basic pension. Now the hon. member wants the Railways Administration to subsidize private firms in respect of ex-railway workers employed by them, workers who spent all their lives in the employment of the Railways and can be of much more use there.</p>

<p>But I want to come to the hon. member for Maitland, who unfortunately is not here at the moment. He made certain statements in connection with job reservation, and I want to take him up on that. He, too, was most indignant about what the hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) had said in this connection. I now want to repeat what the hon. member for Bethlehem said, namely that those members on the other side are advocates of integration and that they want to do away with job reservation. The hon. member for Maitland no longer likes the rate for the job either, because the rate for the job is catching up on them. It is now their policy to do what the trade unions prescribe to them. If the trade unions said, for example, that a certain type of work should not be done by non-Whites, they would see to that. That is now their policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But that is what the Minister is now doing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As far as that is concerned, the hon. the Minister also replied at length last year. On that occasion he said that even if trade unions recommended that a certain type of work be reserved for non-Whites, and he did not consider it advisable, he would not do so. That was as far as skilled labour was concerned. As regards unskilled and semiskilled labour, the hon. the Minister said that he would comply with such a request on the part of the trade unions, and the Minister gave a few examples, such as firemen on ships &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>And shunters.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>He said &#x201C;possibly also&#x201D; shunters. But the Minister added to that that there were certain skilled labour spheres which he was not going to award to non-Whites. The hon. the Minister put that very clearly. I want to recommend that the hon. member for Maitland read that speech once more. In that speech he will find an answer to his misrepresentations of our policy, namely that we are now following in their footsteps in that regard. That is certainly not the case. In fact, he avers that there is even mention that we are going to introduce the rate for the job! We are much more courageous than hon. members on the other side. We first lay down principles, and then we build our policy on those principles. They, however, now want to hide behind trade unions, and whatever the trade unions prescribe to them, they assent to. Has their policy been given over completely to the prescriptions of the trade unions? Do the trade unions prescribe to them what their labour policy for the country should be?</p>

<p>No. When I wanted to ask him a question while he was speaking this afternoon, the hon. member was not prepared to grant me the privilege. Now I shall not grant him that privilege. If he had been courteous to me this morning I would have been courteous to him now. The hon. member took the hon. member for Bethlehem severely to task for what he had said in connection with pensions, but the hon. member for Maitland&#x2019;s attitude is the same as that of the hon. member for Yeoville. I have already replied to that.</p>

<p>If we survey this whole debate we will see that it is a most unrealistic debate. As far as the Opposition is concerned, it has neither rhyme nor reason. At no stage did they penetrate to the crux of the matter. All that was done was that the hon. member for Yeoville went and stood on a mine dump from where he observed certain things. As far as essential <span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0372"/>matters and policy matters were concerned, they had nothing to say.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), has delivered a speech which is noted more for its oratorical vacuity than for its constructiveness. He seemed to derive a considerable amount of amusement from the fact that the hon. member for Yeoville has found it necessary to repeat this year certain arguments he used last year. But it seems, Sir, that tedious repetition is a very necessary attribute of this side of the House if we are to engage the full attention of the Government and goad them to implement some of the constructive suggestions emanating from this side of the House. On reflecting upon the amount which the Minister is asking for in this Bill, I was led to two hypotheses. The first of these is by how much could this amount have been reduced if full advantage had been taken by the Minister and his Department of the many facilities which are at their disposal. What in fact would have been the position if the Railways had been functioning on a competitive instead of a monopolistic basis? Secondly, I ask myself how many people benefited as a result of the Minister&#x2019;s largesse in granting an increase in salaries? How many of these people are among the electorate and how many among the under-privileged? The Minister said he required R400,000,000 for expenditure out of revenue. As items of expenditure he listed amongst others: concessions to staff, rising cost of materials, increases in operating expenses and payments to meet overtime and Sunday time payments having to be incurred as a result of the shortage of staff. There is one aspect of the shortage of staff and of the ever-increasing expenditure with which I should like to deal.</p>

<p>I submit that full advantage has not been taken of all the facilities being provided by the Railways at very great expense. I am referring specifically to those facilities provided for long distance passenger train services. If one takes the Durban-Johannesburg route, one sees on the basis of information given by the Minister&#x2019;s Department itself, that during the past 20 years an amount of R22,000,000 has been expended on various improvements to the line. Only recently another R9,000,000 was expended in effecting improvements between Pentrich and Umlaas Road. One has every right to expect that some of the advantages derived from these improvements would be passed on to the travelling public. But one finds that that is not the position. If one compares the position as it is to-day with what it was 30 years ago, one finds that there has been a decrease in travelling time between Durban and Johannesburg but that at the same time there has been a large increasing in stopping time. Thirty years ago a journey between Durban and Johannesburg or vice versa involved an average of 80 minutes stopping time compared with 140 minutes to-day. The Minister gave this information to me in reply to a question. Let me say here that we appreciate the completeness, thoroughness and courtesy with which questions are answered by the Minister&#x2019;s Department. I feel that this is an example which may very well be followed by other Ministers. I asked the Minister what the reason was for the increase in stopping time and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reason for the increase in stopping time is that the 6 p.m. departure and 9 a.m. arrival times are favoured by the majority of passengers. Although a reduction in the scheduled time is technically possible a later departure or earlier arrival would not meet with favour and, consequently, spare time must be absorbed en route. Adequate time is allowed at the larger stations to enable passengers to en-train and de-train in comfort and for the handling of parcels, traffic which has increased considerably during recent years.</block>

<p>This is very interesting, Sir, It is very interesting to think that adequate times are allowed for passengers to en-train and de-train at stations like Ladysmith, Glencoe and Volksrust, all of which are reached either late at night or in the small hours of the morning. I find this consideration of the Minister in regard to the convenience of passengers quite touching in its solicitude but I also find that this is costing the country a great amount of money, money which I believe could be put to better use. I also asked the hon. the Minister last session a question on the cost per mile and per hour of operating passenger trains. In reply thereto he informed me that the cost of operating the Blue Train per hour was R117 and R101 in the case of the Trans-Natal Express. I must admit that I am unable to assess what the cost of stopping time at stations amounts to, although I believe that it must have some relation to the cost of running time, which averages for the four trains in respect of which information was given at R110 per hour.</p>

<p>As far as the Trans-Natal train is concerned, there are to-day as compared with 30 years ago two hours longer stopping time on the double journey. On that basis I believe I am correct in putting the unnual figure at 730 hours for this one train or a total of 2,920 hours for the four passenger trains operating each day. Taking the cost of running a train at R100 per hour, then we find that R300,000 is being wasted in this way. In arriving at this figure, I have not yet taken into consideration numerous special trains that are being run. Another loss involved is a loss of man hours. This is a point which should cause concern especially in view of the fact that the Minister has admitted that there exists a serious shortage of staff and that he is unable to recruit the necessary labour. Yet we find that train crews are required to spend many hours in unproductive work whilst waiting at stations in order to fit in with the convenience which the Minister considers to be necessary to the passenger. While on this subject of train crews, I should like to express my appreciation of their unfailing courtesy at all times and at the same time appeal to the Minister to make some provision <span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0373"/>to give these train crews, especially the crews attached to dining saloons some form of summer rig more fitting to the conditions under which they have to work during summer. I believe it is a great hardship for them to work in their present uniforms.</p>

<p>I have dealt with just the one section from Durban to Johannesburg and have indicated that possibly an amount of R| million is being wasted needlessly because I submit that this time can be taken up by train crews by work on other duties, thereby relieving to a certain extent the shortage of staff and the high Sunday and overtime payments. But what figure will one arrive at if one takes the Durban-Johannesburg line as an example and applies it to all lines right throughout the Republic. I believe the amount will be considerable and it could be applied to much greater advantage in other directions. I do not believe that it is so particularly important or convenient for people travelling from Durban to Johannesburg necessarily to arrive at Johannesburg at 9 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. I do not think a business man who has business to do in Pretoria finds it very convenient to arrive in Pretoria sometime after 10 o&#x2019;clock.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to the airways.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and I was coming to that. There the travelling public have become used to the necessity for rising early and returning late that night if they want to put in a full day&#x2019;s business. I have already calculated what I believed to be the man hours lost on the South African Railways through stopping at stations but I hate to calculate the loss of man hours caused thereby to the travelling public. Many may find that the time available to them at their place of destination is not sufficient for them as a result of the time wasted en route. For reasons of economy and finance, I believe that many business men still prefer to choose a train journey instead of the more expensive air journey.</p>

<p>I have mentioned certain respects of the Durban-Johannesburg line. The same applies to some extent to the Orange Express. On this train I would say three or four hours are spent in stopping time. While I am on the subject of the Orange Express, I should like to commend to the Minister a request that he should try to avoid passengers having to travel through the Karoo during the hottest time of the day. Anybody who has made this trip will understand what I mean. The trip could be much more pleasant to the traveller if an adjustment to the schedule is made.</p>

<li>(i) Normal.</li>

<li>(ii) The ship sailed from East London on 17 May 1965 and was scheduled to arrive at Port Elizabeth on 21 May. Prior to the ship&#x2019;s departure from East London arrangements were made with the Supply and Transport Depot at Port Elizabeth to take in rations on her arrival there on 21 May. As a result of operational orders to the ship at sea, she altered course and only arrived at Port Elizabeth on 24 May. Her assignment was of such a nature that radio silence was an operational requirement and she could not, therefore, inform the Supply and Transport Depot of the change in her date of arrival at Port Elizabeth. As was arranged, the depot delivered the rations on the quayside on 21 May. When the ship did not arrive the rations were taken back to the depot. Due to the limited space in the cold room of the depot, the ship&#x2019;s rations could not be taken in. They were then transferred to the cold room of the local non-commissioned officers&#x2019; mess and delivered to the ship on her arrival on 24 May. A Board of Inquiry, which investigated the matter, found that the temperature of the mess&#x2019; cold room was, due to a faulty thermometer, too high for the storage of perishable food for periods in excess of 24 hours. As the ship was expected at any time during the week-end the rations had to be kept available for immediate issue and could not, therefore, be issued to other units.</li>

<li>(1) What measures are taken to ensure that immigrant children are immune to poliomyelitis;</li>

<li>(2) what is the minimum age above which such measures are not enforced.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs" to="#hopewell">

<from>The MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>(1) and (2). May I refer the hon. member to the regulations on immunization against poliomyelitis, which were published in Government Notice No. R1989 dated the 27 December 1963. These regulations require that every immigrant who has the custody of a child, and every immigrant under the age of 40 years, shall ensure that immunization of such children and himself is commenced within three months of entering the Republic of South Africa and completed within a period of 12 months. A notice to this effect is handed to the immigrant at the port of entry by the authorities concerned.</p>

<heading>Flying School to be Moved from Dunnottar</heading>

<question by="#taurog" to="#minister_of_defence">

<num>*26.</num>

<from>Mr. TAUROG</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether the South African Air Force Central Flying School is to be moved from Dunnottar; if so, (a) where and (b) why;</li>

<li>(2) what will the existing buildings, houses, equipment and ground be used for;</li>

<li>(3) whether the move will result in a reduction of personnel employed at the Central Flying School.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#taurog">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) Possibly to Langebaanweg, but the matter is still being investigated.</li>

<li>(b) The Harvard ab-initio training aircraft will in due course gradually be replaced by the Impala jet trainer. With the introduction of the jet trainer, Dunnottar will be unsuitable for the following reasons:

<ol>

<li>(i) It is a restricted flying area, which is bounded on three sides by civil air corridors, and the new jet training aircraft will operate at an altitude which will endanger civil aircraft. Flying at high altitudes is essential with the Impala because of its jet engine.</li>

<li>(ii) The poor ground visibility caused by smog from large Bantu townships, and the industrial complex in the area, is dangerous for training on high-performance jet aircraft.</li>

<li>(iii) Dunnottar is a grass airfield. Although the Impala can be operated off grass airfields, it is, nevertheless, undesirable as dust, grit, metal particles, etc. can be sucked into the engine and can cause extensive damage thereto. At least two macadamized runways will be essential for continuous operation of the jet trainer. Langebaanweg is an airfield where macadamized runways are already in existence.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) The intention is to utilize the airfield and facilities fully as an Air Force Base, possibly for following purposes:

<ol>

<li>(a) 40 CF Squadron already at Dunnottar.</li>

<li>(b) Conversion unit for Harvard aircraft as long as this type of aircraft remains in use.</li>

<li>(c) Mobile radar unit.</li>

<li>(d) Storage of mobilization vehicles.</li>

<li>(e) Storage of aircraft.</li>

<li>(f) To establish, eventually, a helicopter squadron there.</li>

<li>(g) Administrative and workshop buildings are required to accommodate personnel of the units referred to above.</li>

<li>(3) Yes, possibly to a limited extent.</li>

<question by="#taurog" to="#minister_of_transport">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he has received complaints of irregularities or defects in the Boeing 727 aircraft in the service of South African Airways; if so, (a) what is the nature of the complaints and (b) what steps are being taken to remedy any defects;</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#taurog">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) No, but occasional difficulty was initially experienced with the brake assembly of these aircraft. As is the case with all new aircraft, improvements are continually introduced by manufacturers in accordance with experience gained in practical operations. The Boeing Company has modified the brake system of the 727, and the modified equipment supplied by the manufacturers was fitted at the earliest opportunity. Since then no trouble has been experienced. The problem did not in any way affect the safety of the aircraft, however. (a) and (b) Fall away.</li>

<from>Mr. TAUROG:</from>

<p>Arising out of the Minister&#x2019;s reply, has his attention been drawn to the fact that there was a report in an American newspaper that the interior of the Boeing 727 constitutes a fire hazard?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#taurog">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<p>My Department is still awaiting that report from the civil aviation authorities in the United States, but I can give the assurance that there is no question of danger. What actually happened there, is that the aircraft came down about three times harder on the ground than it should have, and certain of the pipes burst. That will also be replaced. But I can assure the public and the hon. member that there is absolutely no danger inherent in the Boeing 727.</p>

<li>(3) With a view to eliminating industrial accidents among its employees, the South African Railways launched a major accident-prevention campaign some years ago. The campaign has recently been intensified and those areas where accidents involving death or injury frequently occur, have received particular attention. The services of safety guidance officers are utilized not only to combat industrial accident hazards, but also to educate the staff in safety practices. Films and slides are shown to workmen, pamphlets and posters issued, and letters are addressed to members of the staff at regular intervals to obtain their co-operation in the matter. Special incentive schemes to stimulate the interest of the shunting staff in accident prevention are at present being introduced at all major shunting yards, and industrial safety officers have been appointed to assist with accident prevention in workshops and elsewhere.</li>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have objected to this measure in both the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage, and we objected to it last year and the year before also. We have done so, as I have repeated so often in this House, because we object to this measure which applies not only to Sobukwe but to a large number of people. The Minister has taken this opportunity, of course, of making an emotional appeal to the electorate just before the election by using the name of <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0388"/>Sobukwe. He has already indicated that that will be the type of appeal which will be made and directed against us, that we supported the freeing of Sobukwe.</p>

<p>That is not a fact either. The Minister of Justice should be more careful of his facts. This is an indication of what is going to happen in the election. The Minister is making use of Sobukwe in order to make an emotional appeal to the people. He will deal with the threat of the A.N.C. and the P.A.C. again. He started doing that in the House here and then he realized of course that he was making a mistake, because he is the powerful Minister and he assured the country that the country was at peace, so he went on to say that we underestimated the influence of Sobukwe. He had to do that otherwise the country would have said that the Minister was afraid of Sobukwe, and of course this Minister is afraid of no one. I say that if ever we have had an example of lack of ‘kragdadigheid’ we have it in this case from this Minister and from the Government. The Minister has had three years in which to find a way of dealing with Sobukwe without keeping this bit of legislation on our Statute Book, legislation which he himself said was drastic and which he himself said was to be of a temporary nature. He told us in the second reading debate that Sobukwe may be released this year. They have not made up their minds yet. If Sobukwe is released this year then this objectionable measure would still be on our Statute Book.</p>

<p>The Minister says there is a possibility that Sobukwe may be released and yet this legislation is going to remain on the Statute Book. The Minister himself has indicated, as I have said, that it is only of a temporary nature and we say that Sobukwe, being a Bantu, is covered by so many laws under which he can be detained that we are not prepared to keep this measure on our Statute Book, unless the Minister can assure us that there is some other threat from which the country must be protected. He has indicated that everything is peaceful; that he has everything under control. We say that if that is so he does not need a measure of this nature.</p>

<p>The Minister says that we are following the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). Sir, the Minister is going to make that propaganda again. How it benefits him I do not know. What benefit can be got out of that? I indicated before the hon. member for Houghton spoke that we were going to oppose the measure and that we were going to vote against it. The hon. member for Houghton spoke afterwards and moved an amendment and you, Sir. put the first portion of the amendment, that the word &#x201C;now&#x201D; be deleted. What did that mean? It only meant that the Bill would not be read now. The amendment was negatived and we never got to amendment of the hon. member for Houghton that the Bill be read this day six months; her amendment fell away. What is the difference whether we voted for the deletion of the words after &#x201C;now&#x201D; or whether we voted against the Bill? [Interjections.] The Minister is now going to make cheap propaganda by saying that we followed the hon. member for Houghton. It will not help him. The suggestion is that the hon. member for Houghton and the United Party voted together but I would like to point out that for every one occasion on which the hon. member for Houghton and the United Party vote together the party on the other side and the hon. member for Houghton vote together ten times. Is there any objection then? I could prove to the country on how many occasions the hon. member has voted together with the Government, but what is to be gained by doing so? What objection can there be to it if you both happen to oppose a measure and you vote against it or, if you both happen to approve of a measure and you vote for it? I appeal to the hon. the Minister to drop this cheap political propaganda in dealing with a measure which has such serious consequences for the country. A professor from Britain, according to this morning&#x2019;s paper, who supports the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development indicated when he was questioned as to whether he was satisfied with the position in South Africa that there were certain laws which gave him cause for concern. Well, a man like that, who is a friend, would have cause for concern over a measure of this nature. It is Bills of this nature which do us more harm overseas than the discussions at the United Nations. It is the actions of the Government themselves, it is the Bills passed by the Government itself, which adversely affects us, not false reporting in the Press. It is measures of this kind which are kept on our Statute Book unnecessarily that harm us overseas.</p>

<heading>AMENDMENT OF FIRST SCHEDULE OF THE DEFENCE ACT, 1957</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, in terms of Section 104 (2) of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No. 44 of 1957), approves of the First Schedule to that Act being amended by the substitution for sub-section 129 (1) thereof of the following sub-section:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;(1) Whenever a military court convicts any person subject to this Code of an offence, other than an offence relating to the driving of a motor vehicle, and any act or omission constituting such offence has caused any loss of or damage to public property or property belonging to any institution, the court shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), order that the accused be placed under deductions of pay to the amount of the loss, damage or injury: Provided that where the court is satisfied that the offence was not committed wilfully it may order that the accused be placed under deductions of pay to such lesser amount as it may in its discretion determine.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I wish to explain that the proposed amendment, i.e., the insertion of the words &#x201C;other than an offence relating to the driving of a motor vehicle&#x201D;, is aimed at procuring for members of the South African Defence Force who drive motor vehicles in the execution of their duties and become involved in accidents, the same protection as that enjoyed by public servants.</p>

<p>The existing sub-section 129 (1) covers damage in general which is caused in committing an offence, and makes it compulsory for a court to place the accused under deductions to pay to the full amount of the damage or. if the offence was not committed wilfully, to such lesser amount as the court may determine. In so far as the section also relates to damage caused by the negligent driving of motor vehicles, however, it is not consistent with the position applying to Public Servants.</p>

<p>Since Government employees who are required to drive Government vehicles in the execution of their duties do not enjoy the protection of motor vehicle insurance, the State has accepted liability for third-party claims and for damage to Government vehicles which would normally be payable by an insurer. In a circular issued by the Treasury, it is provided that the driver of a Government vehicle shall forfeit this protection if the accident is due to his being under the influence of liquor, or if he admits liability towards the third parties concerned before the State Attorney can act in the matter.</p>

<p>The effect of the existing Section 129 (1) is that military courts frequently place drivers of the South African Defence Force who have <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0390"/>been convicted of negligent or reckless driving or of driving at excessive speeds, and who become involved in accidents as a result, under deductions of pay in order to make good the damage to the Government vehicles, although such drivers should also be able to claim the protection enjoyed by members of the Public Service. The amendment aims at eliminating compensation orders by a military court in cases of damage resulting from driving vehicles. Driving offences will be heard and punished as previously, but the matter of compensation will be dealt with administratively, as is done in the case of public servants at present.</p>

<p>The Official Opposition will support the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s motion. He has given a full explanation of what it actually amounts to, and in brief one can say that in principle it places the staff of the Defence Department on the same footing as servants in other Departments of State. At the moment there is a barrier which compels the Defence authorities to take certain more stringent action than applies in other Departments of State. This motion will allow a certain amount of discretion. It introduces a uniform system throughout the Service. It does not in any way conflict with the civil or criminal law where it is applicable, and as far as this side of the House is concerned, we will support the motion.</p>

<p><b>(Second Reading Resumed)</b></p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>As I said in another context yesterday the Minister and his Administration appear to enjoy a good image because of the fact that the profits which have been earned over a period of years, seem to have increased from year to year, and the Railways seem to have settled down to a period of great expansion and prosperity. This, of course, helps the Minister very considerably in satisfying the public that all is well within the Railways Administration and, more particularly as far as the public is concerned, that all is well in so far as the interests of the users, the members of the public, are concerned. I would like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, not only in the interests of railway users, but also in the interests of the Administration, to many defects, however small they appear to be, which create quite a different image in the mind of the user of the railways to that created by these globular profits, the tremendous expansion programmes and the very brief but important statements that we find, for example, in the Part Appropriation Bill before us. I must say that the public is not very concerned about the fact that here we have a measure which will provide the Administration with R480.000.000: it does not make any impact. What does make an impact is this: What kind of treatment does the person concerned get when he requires the services of the Administration; for example, when he goes to a station or, for better example, when he travels in a train? May I say that I think I know more about travelling in trains than most hon. members of this House because I am a train user, habitually, rather than a flier&#x2014;and because of my circumstances, I travel by train at least twice every working day. I would say that in every year I have several hundred journeys, long-distance and short-distance, to my credit or to my debit&#x2014; which is more, I would imagine, than the average of any member here. I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will accept that what I say to him is said in good faith&#x2014;and from personal experience, not merely from hearsay.</p>

<p>For example, hon. members and people who work in this building are supposed to be able to find out the details of the scheduling of trains, whether it is the Cape Flats line or the Cape Town/Simonstown line or any local line, simply by going through that door behind you, Sir; or, if they are outside, by going along the passage and looking at one of the timetables on the outside wall of this Chamber. How can the hon. the Minister, who is based right here, every day during the Session, who has several employees here, and who has a Railway bureau here, account for the fact that if he looks at the timetables on the wall, he will find that the three timetables there are the timetables of 7 December 1964 not December 1965, when the new timetable was introduced. I will tell him what happened just a couple of nights ago. I was asked to meet somebody at Kenilworth station. I caught the 6.30 train from Cape Town because, according to my little notebook, the 6.30 train gets me to St. James at a certain time and should get me to Kenilworth, say, 20 minutes earlier. It so happened that since the Minister and his Administration changed the scheduling in December 1965, that particular train no longer stops at Kenilworth. So Bob&#x2019;s your uncle!&#x2014; you think you are going to Kenilworth when you get on that train, but you land in Wynberg, because the first stop is at Wynberg. This sort of thing may sound nonsensical, but here we have an Administration that spends hundreds of millions of rands, that has hundreds of thousands of employees, and here, in the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, if you, Mr. Speaker, for unforeseen reasons, had to catch a local train, you would be given the wrong information as soon as you walk out of that door! I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister, as he often tells us on this side to do, will clean up his own doorstep, literally, by putting up some new timetables.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. gentleman is also the Leader of the House; he holds many offices. Maybe he can give instructions to somebody who works here, and he Can give <span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0391"/>another instruction to the Administration to provide a new timetable. Be that as it may, I think the timetable oversight is interesting, because it illustrates how small things are overlooked in the best-run administration, in the biggest business. These are the things that the user of the railways knows, and these are the things which should be brought to the attention of the Administration.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about the Simonstown/Cape Town line is&#x2014;and I would like the hon. the Minister to check it for himself&#x2014; that if you were to enter the train at a place called St. James and you look at the indicator board on the platform, you will see that it reads: &#x201C;Distance to Cape Town 16 miles. Altitude 18 ft.&#x201D; Sir, the train leaves St. James and heads towards Cape Town&#x2014;and in due time arrives at the following station which is called Muizenberg, but there the board on the platform reads: &#x201C;Distance to Cape Town 16 miles.&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, you have not moved at all from St. James&#x2014;and it goes on to say that &#x201C;the altitude is 21 ft.&#x201D; So instead of moving forward, according to the board you have only moved <i>up</i> three feet in altitude&#x2014;but you have not moved towards Cape Town at all. I have wondered for years (and I have maintained a sort of restraint about this&#x2014;I say again that I travel this line at least twice a day at least five and sometimes six days a week&#x2014;when it would dawn on somebody in the Railway Administration that when the train leaves St. James and takes two minutes or so to get to Muizenberg, it has in fact reduced the distance between St. James and Cape Town by several miles.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member may think this is funny, and that is because his mind is as &#x201C;big&#x201D; as it is. The fact remains that there is a difference between the distance from St. James to Cape Town and from Muizenberg to Cape Town, and something should be done to correct this board. It may be a small thing but it is ridiculous, and I cannot understand how this has come about, or why the board has been allowed to remain as it is for so many years.</p>

<p>The Minister will also find, if he travels in the Simonstown trains, that the scheduling in the morning is far from ideal. I have noticed that at the end of each year the timetable changes, and I must say that as to the peak-hour service, it seems to change for the worse every time. The present situation is that the train which leaves Simonstown at 7.49 gets very full by the time it reaches, say, Muizenberg, because there is a big station at Fish Hoek and so on, and surely the Minister cannot take pride in the fact that as many people stand in that train on the way to Cape Town &#x2014;the 7.49 from Simonstown&#x2014;as are seated. Having regard to the quantum of rolling stock which we are told has been acquired every year, it is difficult to understand why it should be necessary for so many people to spend 40 or 50 minutes standing in the train. In many cases they are elderly persons. If they want to avoid standing, the next train from Simonstown leaves at 8.45. A difference of almost an hour, as there is between 7.49 and 8.45, is far too great a gap during the morning peak, because the person who wants to get to Cape Town in order to get to work at a reasonable hour cannot take the 8.45 train&#x2014;it arrives in Cape Town, as the hon. the Minister will know, more than an hour later, which is too late for most of the people, who cannot find seating accommodation on the 7.49. The very fact that there are more trains scheduled later in the day, at short intervals, seems to suggest that the rolling stock is available. I am no expert on the control of traffic on the railway lines, but I would suggest that if the rolling stock is available and the manpower is available at, say, 11 o&#x2019;clock, to run a train at 11 o&#x2019;clock from Simonstown&#x2014;I give this as an example&#x2014;and then again at 11.30, then surely it should be possible to put one more train on the schedule between 7.49 and 8.45 from Simonstown&#x2014;to relieve the pressure on the 7.49, enable more people to get to work at a reasonable time, whether at or near Cape Town, and to alleviate the situation in which so many people have to stand in a train every morning of their lives. They get on at a certain station; it is inevitable that there are no seats, and then they stand all the way to Cape Town. Sir, I hope that something can be done to alleviate these not-very-small discomforts, but discomforts from which. I think, the travelling public should be protected.</p>

<p>A point which I think is also interesting is that very often, and for a reason that I have not been able to establish, the toilet in these local trains is kept locked. I do not know the reason, but one finds very often that there are people who wish to use it &#x2026;</p>

<p>Is there not somebody inside the toilet?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, we assume that when there is somebody inside, that person would lock the door&#x2014;but that is not the reason That door has been locked, and nobody can get in or out. Of course, one has to get in, in order to get out; we know that, too. I have often watched elderly ladies, particularly, standing in front of the door, having tried the handle, they stand there gazing intently at the door and at the lock, and then I think of the song called: "Wishing won&#x2019;t make it so&#x201D; because that toilet has been locked by the Department&#x2019;s officials! I have asked more than one ticket examiner, and I have been told that they do not know why the toilets are kept locked. I would like to know why, if toilets are provided in one of the coaches, as they often are, they should be kept permanently locked. Sir, I do not want to dilate on this; though it is a rather interesting matter for speculation. I hope the Minister will find out what it is all about, and I will leave the matter in his custody.</p>

<p><span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0392"/>So much, then, for what happens in the trains from Simonstown to Cape Town, and from Cape Town to Simonstown. Another aspect of the matter is, what happens when you arrive at Cape Town station? Something that has struck me very forcibly is the very small number of public telephones that are provided in the new station concourse. Unlike the situation in other countries, particularly the United States, where the public is induced by every possible means to use telephones&#x2014;and the most obvious means is the provision of &#x201C;pay-phones&#x201D; as they call them, in such profusion that even in a city like New York, you hardly ever have to wait to use a telephone at Grand Central Station&#x2014;you find that there is a cluster or row of four telephone booths in the new Cape Town station concourse. 1 have observed this time and time again, and I have experienced it time and again that those four booths seem to be permanently occupied, especially at peak hours. Then, if somebody has to make an urgent call, he or she is placed in the position of standing with the other people who are waiting for somebody to complete a call inside the booth, and taking his or her turn in the queue&#x2014;and one does miss one&#x2019;s train that way! The hon. the Minister has heard the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs telling us in this House from time to time about the tremendous increase in the volume of equipment available to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and the fact that this equipment is being made in South Africa has to some extent helped in the supply of this available material. Is there any reason, therefore, why, instead of four there, should not be 12 public telephones in the central suburban concourse of Cape Town station?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The Postmaster-General has to supply them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know, but if I were to ask the Postmaster-General to provide another eight telephones at the Cape Town station, you know the kind of answer I would get. I think that if the hon. the Minister were to ask, he might even get the telephones! We heard the hon. the Prime Minister here just a couple of weeks ago, referring to the tremendous improvements in various facets of the Government&#x2019;s administration of South Africa &#x2014;very soon, according to the Prime Minister, all of us will be able to pick up a telephone here in South Africa and dial somebody in, say, America direct. Mr. Speaker, I have a friend, for example, in a place called Tulsa, Oklahoma, but I am very loath to telephone him because it would cost about R16; yet when I want to make a call from Cape Town station to somebody in Cape Town, or in Hermanus, that is when the trouble starts. What, then, is the use of offering us this enormous and wonderful improvement in the telephone service, by which we can dial direct all the people in the world whom we do not want to dial direct, when we have difficulty in making a local call from Cape Town station?</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Minister will see what can be done about the provision of telephones &#x2014;and I do not want to deal with the position in Johannesburg, it is not as bad as it is in Cape Town&#x2014;because there should be more public telephones on Cape Town station.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<p>There will be as soon as the station has been completed.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you very much. I hope that the same thing will be done in Johannesburg. I am sure that the revenue of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will benefit from this service, and I am sure that all users of the railway system here will be pleased to know that one can enter a telephone-booth within a reasonable time and make a call, without all the congestion which exists at present.</p>

<p>Now moving away from the local field, I want to deal with the long-distance trains of which I am a habitual user. Unlike the hon. the Minister, who flies everywhere, I know what goes on on the Trans-Karoo Express&#x2014; from personal experience. I should like to tell him a few things about the Trans-Karoo Express, which is a &#x201C;crack&#x201D; train, which has an excellent safety record and which is usually staffed by the most courteous and helpful people&#x2014;I say this in advance&#x2014;but which has some very obvious and glaring defects, considering that people are expected to pay for a first-class ticket and then having been given first-class accommodation, find all kinds of defects which are inherent, not in first-class, but in third-class transactions. For example, in the toilet of the Trans-Karoo Express &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am tempted, but I will not answer the hon. member. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that in such a toilet which is there literally for the convenience of the public, it is not unreasonable to expect the provision of a towel, or one of these continuous towels, or even paper towels. I can remember that just a few years ago there were, at least, paper towels in these toilets. I have asked the people in charge of the trains why this is no longer so, and they have replied that the Administration no longer provides them. In other words, there is simply no facility for washing one&#x2019;s hands properly, in these toilets on the trains. You may say that it is a small thing&#x2014; it is, it probably would only cost about R2 per journey to provide paper towels. Why should they not be provided? The Administration is not losing money, it is earning profits. Why not treat people as if you consider them entitled to first-class treatment? There is no towel, there is no soap, there is no tumbler or drinking-glass in any of the first-class toilets on the Trans-Karoo Express. I do not know what the position is on the other trains, but I travel on that one regularly.</p>

<p><span class="col_765-766" refersTo="page_0393"/>Let us consider the showers. Some people, whether they are travelling or not, like to have a bath or a shower every day. I see that my hon. friend for Bethal-Middelburg is not interested in this aspect of the toilette.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I leave the field to you.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>True enough, there is a shower in some of the carriages. There was a time when one could hire a bath-towel for 15 or 25 cents from one of the bedding-attendants. Some three years ago I was surprised to find that this service had been stopped&#x2014;again, the information was given to me cursorily, on the train, that the Administration no longer provide towels for hire. Do hon. members know what happens in the case of the person who is determined to have his shower&#x2014; and why should he not, because the water is there, the shower-room is there and he has his own soap, since the Administration will not provide any? He simply takes that little towel which is sold on the train for 15 cents&#x2014;and I defy anybody of any size to have a proper shower and then to dry himself with a towel about 18 inches long&#x2014;or he is compelled to carry his own bath-towel up and down the railway-line. Who would do it? Otherwise, and this is the last resort, he uses one of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s sheets, from his bedding. So where does he score? I have seen this for myself because&#x2014;and I say it here&#x2014;I have done it for myself. I am sorry but when 1 board a train and take along a little bag with my over-night things, I am not prepared to take an enormous bath-towel with me every time I go to Johannesburg.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I was wondering what was happening to all my sheets.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>What happens to the sheet is that it is used in lieu of a towel, and it is then wrapped up with all the other bedding &#x2014;and I doubt whether it does any of those articles any good whatsoever. I would therefore suggest, with great deference to the hon. the Minister, that everybody&#x2014;the traveller in the Trans-Karoo Express and the Administration &#x2014;would be better off if the Minister would allow the traveller to hire a bath-towel for 25 cents rather than force him to some other means of drying himself.</p>

<p>Sir, the observation or lounge car on a long-distance train has become a very much-used and popular amenity. The observation car is an amenity that is appreciated. As the hon. the Minister knows, most of them are well furnished and colourful, and pleasant to sit in. They are also air-conditioned, which is very important during summer. Around and during the school holidays it is almost impossible for the average adult to enter one of those observation or lounge cars. They are jammed with the youngsters who travel to and from school or university. Parties of 16 or 30 students enter these cars and take up all the accommodation. One of them buys a something-cola and they stay there for the whole morning, so that what I would call the elderly or legitimate user of that observation car does not even get into it. I know that this is a difficult problem. I do not for a moment suggest that young people because they are young or drinkers of cola should be debarred from the observation car&#x2014;in fact, some of the brandy drinkers should be debarred! But if there were the kind of notices which one sees on trains in other parts of the world&#x2014;particularly in trains, as well as restaurants, in the United States&#x2014;on the lines that patrons are asked to remember that there are other people waiting to use this facility, I think it would help. In other words, when you have had your drink or you have sat in the observation car for a reasonable length of time, please make way for somebody else. I think it would help, and a little encouragement from the person in charge of the lounge car would help these youngsters to leave, and so make way for other people. Another thing which could be stopped to the advantage of all users of the lounge car, is the playing of transistor radios in the lounge car. The Minister should travel on one of his trains, one day. He should, for example, sit in a corner of the lounge car. Travelling through the Karoo his compartment becomes very hot &#x2026;</p>

Now the hon. the Minister may want to enter the observation car and sit and read quietly while he has a drink, but he is compelled to listen to five radio programmes blaring at the same time through 27 sets.</p>

<p>No, anything but that! What I am telling the hon. the Minister is that you go into the observation car, and you find yourself a seat&#x2014;if you are lucky! Then you find that there are 20 or 30 youngsters, and some middle-aged people too, all with transistor radios. One is tuned in to Radio Highveld, another to the English or Afrikaans service of Radio South Africa, another to Springbok Radio&#x2014;and somebody else is trying to get some other programme. You are compelled to listen to all these sets blaring at the same time on different wave-lengths, and different programmes.</p>

<p>Do you want television instead?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>As long as this Government is in power, I have no prospect of television&#x2014;but it will not be very long now before we get television, too! I want to say that I think that the Administration is entitled to expect a person who wishes to listen to a certain programme, to listen to it privately in his own compartment, and not to inflict it on the public. I think that this can be enforced without any difficulty whatsoever.</p>

<p>I also want to tell the hon. the Minister, and this is more than an aside, that I have seen that sinkhole near the Oberholzer station several times during the past few weeks. I do not want to deal with the technical aspect of the sinkhole, but merely with the railway aspect. I have here the technical opinion of Dr. Enslin, the Chairman of the State Coordinating Technical Committee on Sinkholes, who said quite recently that the sinkhole constituted no danger to the adjacent Johannesburg-Cape railway line. The official measurements of the sinkhole were 36 feet wide and 35 feet deep. Be that as it may, every time the train crawls past this sinkhole at four or five miles an hour, almost all the passengers gaze at this scene, and there are usually one or two railway employees, at least I think they are railway employees, standing at the sinkhole. Somebody is bound to call out, usually to the Bantu there: &#x201C;Hoe diep is daardie gat?&#x201D; The answer comes back: &#x201C;Baas, hy is ’n honderd voet diep.&#x201D; This statement here says that it is 35 feet deep. The issue is not how deep the sinkhole is, but the fact is that it is so near the railway line that it is causing concern not only to the people who live and work and mine in that area, but also to railway-users. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister in the interests of his Administration cannot take some steps to stop making this hole the sort of permanent monument that it is at present&#x2014;in other words, to obscure it. It does not help anybody to see the sinkhole &#x2014;it does not help the Administration. It simply arouses all kinds of morbid fears on the part of the travellers, and I have heard from several elderly people that they are terrified when the train passes through that area. Why should they be unnecessarily terrified? Terror will not avert a disaster if there is going to be one, and I think that this kind of &#x201C;advertisement&#x201D; of the sinkhole is not in the interests of the Administration and should be avoided.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the limited time left to me, having examined some of the defects of the railway system from the point of view of the user&#x2014;both of the local and the long-distance trains&#x2014;I should like to deal with several general matters. One of these is the level-crossing danger. It was estimated quite recently that at the rate at which the Administration was eliminating level crossings&#x2014;and having regard to the fact that no new crossings would be created&#x2014;it would take some 50 years before all the level-crossings had been eliminated. This was, I think, an Automobile Association estimate. If that is the position, then I think that in times of prosperity one can perhaps look to the Administration to spend more time, energy and money on eliminating level-crossings. We know that the death-rate is such that it has concerned the Minister, and I have heard him say so in this House. I wonder whether the Administration should not seriously consider expanding its programme of eliminating level-crossings rather than buying, although it may be necessary, new coaches all the time&#x2014;and in this way, save lives, facilitate the running of the main line trains, and thereby re-assure the public. Because to look forward to another 50 years of level-crossings in South Africa, with all the disasters which seem to be almost inherent in their existence, and the danger to human life, is not a very happy prospect.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, may I deal briefly with the pipeline situation? I recall what the hon. the Minister said to us when I urged him to give the inland-user the benefit of the saving from the transportation of petrol because of the introduction of the pipeline. But he was not prepared to let them off lightly, as it were, and to give them the benefit of that saving. I would like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the &#x201C;Federal Laws and other material relating to Highways&#x201D; of the United States Government. He has seen those highways, as well as the railway system, for himself recently&#x2014;and the law there in this regard is quite clear. Article 126 deals with the subject they call &#x201C;Diversion&#x201D;. The article states:</p>

<block name="quote">Since it is unfair and unjust to tax motor vehicle transportation unless the proceeds of such taxation are applied to the construction, improvement or maintenance of highways &#x2026; all revenues from State motor vehicle registration fees, licences, gasoline taxes and other special taxes on motor vehicle owners and operators of all kinds (are used) for the construction, improvement and maintenance of highways and administrative expenses in connection therewith &#x2026;</block>

<p>All these revenues have to be diverted, as they call it, into the construction of highways. Now why should one country which has had long experience in the operation of highways, railways and pipelines, take that view&#x2014;that the savings from the transportation of gasoline can only be used, under the law, for the provision of new highways&#x2014;and why should the position be so different here in South Africa, where the Minister says that since there is no such law, he is under no compulsion to do <span class="col_769-770" refersTo="page_0395"/>as they do in America? He takes all the revenue, and therefore also the saving from the transportation of petrol through the pipeline, puts it into his general funds, and uses it as he pleases. I would like to plead with him again, having regard to the abnormally high cost which the inland-user has to bear for every item that is railed or sent up from the Coast in one way or another, that at least the pipeline should be of some tangible benefit to the users of petrol in the Witwatersrand-complex, where some 40 per cent of the total petrol consumed in South Africa is used. I hope that the hon. the Minister will think this over again, now that the pipeline is operating, and give us back a couple of cents per gallon of petrol&#x2014;even if he cannot give us the whole saving of five cents&#x2014;to show his good faith, and to recognize the fact that it is unjust, even if it is lawful, for him to use this revenue for any purpose, as by putting it into his general funds.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>The entire speech made by the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) was based mainly on local affairs and on matters which I shall not pursue any further. In the course of my speech I shall try, however, to reply to a few of the points raised by previous speakers. The working results of the Railways during the period under review showed us what the Railways are capable of. I want to refer in particular to five of the most important sections of the Railways, namely, goods traffic, the passenger services, the road transport services, the harbours and the South African Airways. It is indeed a vast organization&#x2014;the largest single undertaking in our country, and the Railways is not only an undertaking that provides employment to more than 200.000 people, but probably the most important factor in the promotion of the economic growth of our country. The rising revenue of the Railways, which is increasing by the year, reflects the general progress made in the Republic. We cannot neglect paying the highest tribute to our hon. Minister, to his staff and to every railwayman in our country. These exceptional results could only have been achieved by planning ahead, by ordering the necessary equipment timeously in order to keep abreast of the growth and development of our country, and also by having faith in the future and by believing that we do in fact have a future in the Republic&#x2014; unlike the prophets of doom on the other side. Furthermore, to increase the efficiency of the Railways by according fair and equitable treatment to every railwayman. Several speakers on the other side have called the shortage of manpower a very serious matter. That is true, but we know that in any country&#x2014;and particularly in a country like the Republic, with its ranid development&#x2014;that is no more than a fairly normal phenomenon. The hon. the Minister and his staff are doing everything in their power to improve the working conditions; facilities have been provided, salaries have been increased and mechanization has been introduced. A great deal is being done as regards salaries, and in addition to the increase granted last year, the greatest single increase ever granted in the history of the Railways was recently granted to the railwaymen&#x2014;an average increase of 11.5 per cent. The railwayman is sincerely grateful for what he has received, but the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) spoke sneeringly about the increase. The hon. member suggested that this increase was granted merely to buy votes for the election, and he also spoke rather sneeringly about what has been done over the past years. Now, I think it will be a good thing if we start off by referring to the record of the United Party. It strikes one if one looks at the benches on the opposite side&#x2014;one of the hon. members made great play of the fact that there are sometimes so few members present during the debates&#x2014;if I have Counted correctly, that there are only six members on that side of the House&#x2014;and that during an important debate such as this one. [Interjections.] No, there are only six members. The hon. member can count again. I want to mention that the National Party has an exceptional record as regards salary increases. The National Party&#x2019;s record over the past 18 years does not consist primarily of increases granted before an election. The hon. member for Durban Point said that we were trying to buy votes. The first increase granted under the National Party r&#x00E9;gime was granted in 1948-9, immediately after an election. That increase amounted to R14,765,000, but let us go further and see when the next major increase was granted. Increases were granted in the years 1951-2, 1952-3, 1953-4 and 1954-5, and the lareest one was granted in 1955-6&#x2014;a total of R55,510,170 was granted during those few years, but that was not before an election. We had an election in 1958, and before that election an increase of only about R7,500,000 was granted, but after the election in 1958-9 provision was made in the Estimates for an increase of R14,773,300. But let us examine the present position. In 1962-3, when there was no election, an increase of approximately R13,000,000 was granted, and in 1963-4 an increase of approximately R24,000,000. In 1964-5 and other R20,000,000 was granted, and in 1965-6. R35,500,000. Now those hon. members argue that this increase has suddenly been granted with a view to the election. During the past four years an increase was granted every year. Look at the record of the National Party over the past 18 years&#x2014;increases to the amount of R190.500.000. That is indeed an achievement. The hon. member for Durban (Point) also spoke sneeringly about, <i>inter alia,</i> the total of R1,600,000.000 mentioned here by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East)&#x2014;namely the aggregate increase granted by this Government &#x2014;and said we should divide that and see how much it meant per month. I think that is decidedly ungrateful. Apart from these increases, there have been periodical improvements of facilities and working conditions. The working conditions are being improved from <span class="col_771-772" refersTo="page_0396"/>day to day. We are in the process of mechanization, and because of that the working conditions of our staff are also being improved in order to keep the wheels turning. Intensive training is also being provided for the railwaymen. Study bursaries are being granted. Last year 270 students studied by means of study bursaries. Apart from ordinary housing, hostels and homes are provided where unmarried employees can board at a very small charge. We, as a Nationalist Government, have an exceptional record as regards housing. I want to mention that because I believe it to be necessary&#x2014;the people outside and the railwaymen take note of that. Let us just cast our minds back for a moment to the housing conditions which existed while the United Party was in power. Firstly, they built houses for railwaymen which had no bathrooms, but that was not the worst. They isolated them and separated them from the general public. In their view, of course, it is wrong to let them live among the general public. In their time the railwaymen were fenced off to one side so that they could not join the general public in the social and other spheres. But since this Government came into power&#x2014;and I have to mention these figures&#x2014;11,371 departmental houses have been built at a cost of R63,712,608. But over and above that we have spent more than R59,000,000 under the house ownership scheme, and through the 10 per cent contribution a further R7,949,453 under the same scheme, not even to mention the hostels and homes. In the training college in Bloemfontein alone, 500 students have been accommodated. This housing is of exceptional value to the railwaymen and they sincerely appreciate it because these facilities make them and their families happy people, and if you are happy in your work, you also give your undertaking your best. But what are we doing for the pensioners? Increases amounting to more than R50,000,000 have been granted to pensioners. The concession made by the Minister in granting railway pensioners the opportunity, if they are physically strong enough, to return to the Railways and to work and yet retain their temporary allowance, is one of the things requested by these people, and they are deeply grateful for that. We have many of those people in service to-day, and they are rendering good service and are a particular asset to the Railways.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with another matter, namely the matter which has been raised here in connection with employment. We know that the maintenance of the Colour bar has been mentioned here. Certain members of the United Party repeated the statement made by their Leader, but I do want to mention here&#x2014;and I want to say in advance that we realize that the Industrial Conciliation Act does not apply to the Railways, and that Section 77 of the Act, which relates to work reservation, therefore does not apply&#x2014;that maintaining a colour bar is traditional policy in the Railways. The question is whether the United Party believes in that. We know they are fond of changing their policy. Last night the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) quoted to us what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had said with regard to the rate for the job, and we know that that is the policy of the United Party. The hon. member for Durban (Point) objected to that, however, and referred to what the hon. member for Bethlehem had said. I think it would be a good thing if I refreshed the memories of the hon. members with regard to what they said only recently in the debates, namely, that job reservation should be abolished on the Railways. I should like to quote from Hansard (Col. 2869) of 11 March 1964, in which a speech by the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) is recorded. In that speech he discussed the employment of Coloured persons on the Railways. He said, <i>inter alia:</i></p>

<p>Here it is stated quite clearly, and it has never been repudiated by any hon. member. Why did the hon. members on the other side make such an issue of, and why did they come forward with so many complaints about, the manpower shortage and the amount of overtime that has to be worked? If the United Party kept in close contact with the workers and knew what the workers wanted, they would not come here and plead that overtime and Sunday-time be abolished. The railwayman earns a large extra amount in that way. The United Party would therefore certainly not be doing the worker a favour by recommending that the Minister abolish overtime and Sunday-time. No, Mr. Speaker, all those pleas have only one object, and that is to show that there are not enough Whites to do the work, and that non-Whites should consequently be employed. We can see that that is what they are aiming at. In fact, they themselves state that very clearly. For example, the hon. member for Salt River said that that was the solution. Let us now see what the United Party did in this regard during the last eight years of its r&#x00E9;gime. We find that during the eight years prior to 1948 the employment of non-Whites on the Railways increased by 67 per cent, while under the National Party the employment of non-Whites has decreased by 8.3 per cent during the past eight years. In 1957, 120,000 non-Whites were employed, compared with 110,000 in 1964, that is to say, a decrease of 10,000. Compared with that, we find that during the past seven years the number of White personnel has increased by 11.1 per cent. That is indeed an achievement. We are on the eve of an election, and if we were to present the electorate with two pictures, one of what the United Party did while it was in power, and another one of what this Government has done, what will we find? We shall find that this Government can <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0397"/>look back in pride on what it has done for the railwayman. As far back as 1924 the United Party started a blackening programme when they began importing cheap non-White labour. And from the figures which I have quoted and which reflect the position for the eight years prior to 1948, it is apparent that even then they had not changed their views, and that the electorate of South Africa saved our country from them only just in time. Compared with that, the railwayman feels that he may safely rely on a Government which advocates work reservation and protects the position of the Whites in that way.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has followed on the lines of other members on the other side of the House by filling in what the Minister did not tell us what the Nationalist Government had done for the workers. Towards the end the hon. member could not resist climbing upon a political platform by proclaiming that this side of the House wanted to break down all forms of colour reservation as far as the Railways were concerned. But that of course is so much rubbish. First of all, job reservation does not apply to the Railways and, secondly, if he had listened or had bought one of those yellow pamphlets of ours, he would have known what our policy in this connection was. We stand by the traditional colour bar and we accept the existing industrial machinery whereby the admission of Coloured labour into any industry is regulated by negotiation between employers and employees. We have never said that the Railways should be flooded with Black labour. The hon. member quoted a lot of figures in this connection. But that reminded me of a story about General Smuts who when he started quoting figures in the House and was asked by his private secretary where he got them from replied that it did not matter as it would take people at least nine months to establish their correctness. So with this hon. member. He knows that we will be going into a general election shortly and that figures can lie. He quoted these figures to enable him to cart his Hansard round the country and say what a good boy he is and what the United Party was doing in so far as the railwayman is concerned. Let me remind that hon. member that when they came into power in 1948 we had just been fighting one of the most terrible wars in the history of the world. Many things were in short supply but nevertheless we were able to give the railwayman some sort of comfort. There were many to be housed and many had to be put up in military hutments. But we played the game and looked after these people. The Government had to look after its main task, however, and that was to defend our country. But these facts the hon. member forgets. You see, Mr. Speaker, they have very short memories and they think that is also the case with the electorate because now they are trying to confuse them.</p>

<p>Even the speech of the hon. the Minister was a pre-election speech although I cannot say that he descended to the same depth as the hon. member who has just spoken. The Minister also quoted figures to show what has been done in order to expand the Railways during the period 1948 up to 1965. Well, I think it would be surprising if nothing had been done. After all, this Government has now been in power for 18 years. In addition, we are living in a prosperous world although this prosperity struck South Africa only at a very late stage. But how much better could the position have been had we not had that period of muddling by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor in office. It was then that this Minister came forward and placed his political career in jeopardy if he did not put the running of the Railways on a sound footing. Over the years, however, the Minister followed the stop-go method of planning. It seems to me that he has never had that degree of confidence in our country which we all have. In his speech the other day he referred to far-reaching planning. That may be so but we do not see any evidence of it. Throughout the Minister seems to have adopted a stop-go method of planning. Of this the pipe-line to which reference has often been made in this debate is an example as is also the Hex River Tunnel. The Government built a big grain elevator at East London but then all of a sudden found that the line traction was unsuitable and then the hon. Minister suddenly decided to buy diesel locomotives. The same applies to Port Elizabeth where an ore port was built, there were found to be bottlenecks on the rail-route with the result that every locomotive had to be thrown in in order to convey ore to Port Elizabeth. Such things would not happen had there been proper planning beforehand. Let me refer again to the pipe-line. It is being said that this pipe-line is already inadequate and one wonders whether the time has not already arrived for the Minister to start planning for a new pipe-line. You see, Sir, one has to plan years ahead. I know it is not possible for the Minister to plan for peak traffic but he must plan for the development of the country and such plans must be on a long-term basis. We have had with us over the years the old bogey of coal supplies to coastal ports. Year after year we are warned to stockpile coal. One would have thought the Minister by means of long-term planning could by now have overcome the continual shortage of trucks for the conveyance of coal. And it is not only the coastal ports that cannot get coal. The other day I noticed that a certain engineering foundry in Johannesburg had to stop for two days on account of a shortage of coal. So we feel that if there were in fact long-term planning as is contended, then there must have been a slip up somewhere.</p>

<p>There is the question of our harbours. It has been pointed out that the revenue from our harbours last year amounted to R29,300,000 in comparison with an expenditure of R19,000,000. This is one of the revenue producing units of our administration but here again there has been this terrific lack of planning.</p>

<p><span class="col_775-776" refersTo="page_0398"/>It is most difficult to find out and determine what is going to happen. Year after year we have had a piling up of ships in our harbours, in the Durban harbour particularly, but only lately has the Administration entered into a contract for the expansion of the harbour to be completed round about 1970. But 1970 is just about upon us and it can be expected of the Government that it should already have planned further ahead. There has been talk about Richards Bay but developments will not take place in our day.</p>

<p>There is, however, one bright star as far as planning is concerned and that is the Airways. We must acknowledge that we have a very modern airways system at the moment. Airports unfortunately are inadequate to cope with the increasing traffic. We here in the Western Cape are sometimes worried about the expansion going on to the North of us&#x2014; in Johannesburg, Pretoria, etc. Sometimes we feel that the eyes of the Government are exclusively focused on those areas. Let me in this connection refer to the Railway workshop at Salt River. This was one of the largest shops in the country. It has, of course, become necessary over the years to build Railway workshops elsewhere but the Railway workshops at Salt River, except for minor additions, have been standing still. One seems to gather the impression that it is the intention to cut the activities of this workshop down to a minimum, and to transfer most of the work either to Bloemfontein or to Pretoria. The money which was spent on these workshops is public money. Furthermore, these workshops assist us in the Western Cape. I would commend to the Minister to give serious consideration to the desirability of decentralizing some of these larger units. The workshops at Salt River will then be kept going. I can understand that with the switchover from steam to electricity, some of the shops are no longer required.</p>

<p>As has been said, this side of the House welcomes the wage increase which the Minister has announced but as one listened to the speech of the hon. member who spoke before me, one would get the impression that these increases were granted spontaneously. But that is definitely not the case. If he reads Hansard a little bit closer he will find that this side of the House has over the years had continually to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that Railwaymen were not getting a fair deal as far as wages were concerned. Industry also realizes that the value of the rand has deteriorated and is accordingly putting up wages. As far as the Railwaymen are concerned, they can thank this side that they have received these increases. But let us face it and admit that these increases are already out of date and too late. It is time that the hon. the Minister should start negotiating for the next increase. He has to do that if he wants to keep up to date with increasing costs.</p>

<p>We have heard of the shortage of staff and how this Government abandoned the immigration policy of the United Party of 1948. The Minister himself has had to admit that it is well-nigh impossible for him to recruit workmen overseas. That is understandable especially if it is kept in mind that overseas there is a very high standard of living. Artisans are being well paid and receive all sorts of social benefits. Consequently this country cannot offer him sufficient attraction. So we have to look to our own resources for the building up and maintenance of our labour force. If one looks at the newspapers and the cinema screens we notice that private enterprise is going to great lengths in order to recruit labour. But what is the case with the Railways? They still hold on to an out-dated system. You apply for a job, you get a form which you have to fill in, you get the necessary references, return the form and then have to wait and wait. I think this is a matter which should be investigated, i.e. the method of recruitment of labour. The recruiting section of the Railway should be streamlined. It is not an easy matter to get onto the staff of the Railways. You have first to cross a difficult hurdle. I say it is not an easy matter to get in on the Railways and that despite the shortage of staff. Let me give the House an example of this. Recently the hon. Minister indicated that he would like pensioners to return for temporary service on the Railways. There are quite a number of artisan pensioners who should like to resume work again, but not as artisans. They would like to go in for clerical work. However, very few of them are able to produce a J.C. Certificate with the result that they cannot be accepted. There is a large reservoir of very capable people available if they can be absorbed. If the Minister&#x2019;s Department is really serious in its desire to recruit staff, it should remove these small headaches. Although there is a shortage of artisans on the Railways, the efforts of the Railways to recruit more artisans result only in a very restricted inflow. Every applicant is subjected to a strict test and not everybody is accepted. Efforts should be made to secure a continuous inflow of apprentices. In this way our artisan staff could be built up. We should not confine our recruitment to fixed periods.</p>

<p>If you listen to hon. members on the other side you will gain the impression that everyone on the Railways is happy. Of course the railwaymen welcome the rises in their wages that they *have had but it is difficult to get a true reflection of their mind because they are afraid to talk out of fear of victimization. They will not allow you for instance to publish their names. I can, however, state that there is a great degree of dissatisfaction in the workshops about the application of the disciplinary code, i.e. these petty fines, etc. There is of course a prescribed code but it is its application which gives rise to dissatisfaction. Many of these men are unhappy. This is another matter for the Minister to investigate as it is a matter for him and the artisan staff association. These little difficulties should be ironed out. There is no doubt about it that many of the resignations that occur amongst the artisan staff result from an unfair application of the disciplinary code.</p>

<p><span class="col_777-778" refersTo="page_0399"/>Overtime has also been referred to. Look at the time ticket examiners have to work on the suburban services of Cape Town. Mr. Speaker, you will be shocked to see the schedule according to which these people have to work. Normally they come on in the early hours of the morning and finish only late at night. The result is that on occasion you have men going off the &#x201C;rail&#x201D;. You see, Sir, they have free periods in town, too far away from their homes to enjoy a meal and on occasion they meet a pal and go to the local bar and if they happen to be caught under the influence of liquor they lose their jobs. This constitutes a real problem, one to which the Minister should give his attention. I know the men welcome overtime because they need the extra money.</p>

<p>I have, Mr. Speaker, tried to convey some of the grievances of the railway staff. I have mentioned the real lack of planning. As a matter of fact, this Government cannot claim that it has undertaken any long-term planning at all. Their entire policy proves it. Any claim to long-term planning that it should advance, is therefore not justified.</p>

<p>There are a few matters I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice, but before I come to that, I want to refer to the fact that the hon. member who has just sat down denied that they are against work reservation. Of course we know that that is not true, but now that the election is at hand, they want to swing round and try to advocate a new policy. But let me tell the United Party this: No matter how hard they try, they will not succeed in gaining the support of the railway worker. The railwayman knows who his friends are, and he knows under which Government he has received benefits. He can still remember clearly what happened to him in the days when the United Party was in power. If it was true that they safeguarded the interests of the railwayman as well as the hon. member claimed, then I want to ask him how it came about that they dismissed thousands of White railway workers without notice and without telling them where they would get their next piece of bread, and then employed non-Whites in their stead? Is that the way to look after the interests of workers? Now they come and court the railwayman&#x2019;s vote. Let me tell the United Party that in my constituency, Langlaagte, there are only seven United Party voters left.</p>

<p>With the coming election the majority will show a tremendous increase again. I called on these seven United Party members, and one of them told me that before their father died, they had to promise him that they would vote for the United Party, because he was a Smuts/Botha man. This person has now decided not to vote, however, so that the United Party is losing one of the seven. In the past I have frequently pleaded with the Minister for the interests of the shunters, and now I have the opportunity to thank him very sincerely for what he has done for the shunters. In my opinion it is still far too little to compensate for the dangerous work done by these people, but I cannot see any way in which one can improve their position. I leave that in the hands of the Minister.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the Minister&#x2014;I have mentioned this on previous occasions in this House&#x2014;please to demolish the hovels which the United Party erected in a part of Langlaagte-Noord and in which railwaymen are obliged to live now. There are approximately 30 or 40 such hovels. They should be demolished and replaced by decent dwellings such as those built under the National Party Government. They are situated in a part of Langlaagte North, and are simply unfit for human occupation. I have brought this to the Minister&#x2019;s notice before.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the Minister for what has been done in connection with unguarded crossings, although there is still a great deal to be done. We hear about accidents every day, and in the past I pleaded repeatedly that gates or something of that nature should be erected there to warn those people until such time as all those crossings have been eliminated&#x2014;which will take many years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, seeing that I have now come to the end of my political career and this is probably the last time I shall rise to address this House, I feel obliged, firstly, to thank the Minister and the Administration for the courtesy, goodwill and friendliness extended to me during the years I have represented Langlaagte. I have met with nothing but courtesy and they have always tried to assist wherever possible. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that the Minister and the Administration deserve this tribute. Even the railway workers, from the highest to the lowest, are always courteous, which is the way it should be, since these people have been looked after by way of improvements in salaries and pensions. I also want to proffer a word of thanks to the railway workers in the Langlaagte constituency for the faithful support which I have received from them during the years I spent in this House. I trust they will adopt the same attitude in the future.</p>

<p>I rise to take an extraordinary step, and that is to appeal to you personally in my capacity as a back-bencher. We have been engaged in a very important debate for almost two days. I have tried to follow it carefully, and the impression I have gained has reminded me of D. F. Malherbe&#x2019;s words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Hoe pynig my tot laat nanag-stonde die innerlike volksgebrokenheid.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In this case I am applying those words to the dividedness of an ineffectual Opposition. We <span class="col_779-780" refersTo="page_0400"/>expect something better from them. Seeing that conferences are so much in the news nowadays, I want to appeal to you, Sir, to arrange a conference among the Whips in order to investigate ways and means of putting some &#x201C;pep and go&#x201D; into this helpless Opposition. It really requires an effort to respond politically on the plane on which those people move.</p>

<p>We had a tremendous tirade from the opening speaker in the debate, the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). He started off most dramatically by way of a personal attack on the hon. the Minister, and with great emphasis denounced the lack of policy on the part of the Minister and his Department. The task of further motivating his point of view, was left to his supporters, but what did he get? We heard members on this side of the House being accused of blowing up bridges during the war years, while the Railways officials did their duty during the war, in the full knowledge that the General was sitting on their side of the House and not on ours. That is a blatant and objectionable anomaly. It was an effort to substantiate the suggestion that our Minister and his Department have no policy, a courageous effort, but it was clearly recognizable that while he was trying to create the impression that he was approaching the matter in all seriousness, he could not resist laughing at himself. It is a terrible situation, and I think these circumstances call for closer examination. Sir, somebody once asked the late Mr. Churchill what he thought of his possible successor, Wilson. Mr. Churchill replied: &#x201C;I do not think much of him.&#x201D;The questioner wanted to know why, and he said: &#x201C;I actually have two reasons, and the first is his face.&#x201D; The man then asked what the second reason was, and Mr. Churchill said: &#x201C;Also his face.&#x201D; The two-faced mentality of that party sickens those among us who take an interest in politics. We have heard policy statements&#x2014;I wrote them down&#x2014;no fewer than 11. In actual fact that party is an 11-faced one.</p>

<p>The United Party criticizes the Minister and his possible deficit, and tried to stir up suspicions in this connection, but the fact of the matter are simply these: For the past few. years the Minister&#x2019;s revenue from transporting maize to the coast alone amounted to R30,000,000 per year. Last year there was practically nothing. This one item alone explains why we may possibly get a deficit. I do not want to go any further by mentioning the increased cost of materials, increased building costs, and wage increases&#x2014;quite rational and reasonable explanations for the situation. But those people are not prepared to mention these things in their arguments. All they are trying to do is to create a false impression, even by using facts which have been taken completely out of their context. The same speaker tried to say something about the so-called inefficiency of the Railways, about its defective administration and control, and told us most dramatically how he had stood on a mine dump in Johannesburg with a pair of goggles on and had looked down upon a station.</p>

<p>In the first place, he did not complete his sentence properly. He wanted to tell us how he had stood upon an antheap and had tried to count the wagons at Poupan. It is painful to have to condescend to replying to arguments of that nature in deference to the procedure of this House. The truth of the matter is that Angelo is one of the Railways&#x2019; large shunting stations where trains go to be broken up and where the trucks are reassembled in new trains, and it sometimes happens that they tave to wait hours for the specific trucks from which the new train is to be assembled. According to this hon. member the locomotives should move aimlessly up and down the railway line while waiting for the trucks, in order to create an impression of good administration. That is the only logical deduction one can make from his argument. To talk about a policy and then to stand upon a mine dump and to try to get a total impression of a station from a long distance, without showing enough interest to approach the station master and ask him a few intelligent questions about the impressions he had received, is to make a caricature of what we call policy. That is ridiculous and petty, and a most unintelligent approach to such a situation. The position at Poupan was that during the Christmas holidays it came about that as a result of the drought and other reasons, many of those trucks were not needed by the Western Cape and by South West Africa and had to be uncoupled north of De Aar.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the coal mines did not require those trucks very urgently at that time, with the quite normal result that some wagons perhaps remained unused for a few weeks. But that had absolutely nothing to do and had no connection with administration and control. The hon. member for Yeoville also made great play of the irresponsibility of this Government, which was competing with private initiative, and said that that was why the Government had landed itself in its present financial position.</p>

<p>That same hon. member and also the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) and others adopted the same attitude only a year ago when they recommended to the Minister that he should leave the transportation of coal to private transport, to people who also wanted to make a living and who had licences and who could easily undertake it without prejudicing the Railways. That was only a year ago, but yesterday they came here with great ado and said that one of the worst sins the Minister could commit would be to leave the transportation of coal in the hands of private transport. When I was a young student, we had to hold a mock funeral for a grasshopper, <span class="col_781-782" refersTo="page_0401"/>and on that occasion we had to laugh and cry simultaneously. Here I have seen the mock funeral of a party with 11 heads, 11 personalities and 11 policies. It is a freak; it is something unnatural. That is why they have been laughing and crying simultaneously in this House since yesterday, much to my surprise, and have contradicted one another ten times over as regards their policy. Each one of them had his own interpretation. Another example is the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). He talked about the rate for the job. He said we were making a mistake; it was a term we had taken over from the international trade union movement. That is not altogether an unintelligent answer, because we are aware of the fact that in their past professions of policy the Opposition revealed sympathy and spiritual bonds with the communist-inspired international trade union movement. It was quoted in the debate&#x2014;and I want to refer to that again&#x2014;that they do not advocate the rate for the job, but that it is officially their policy that the non-White in this country should be integrated economically. That was stated repeatedly by their Leader himself. I should like anyone of them who rises after me to explain to us the difference between economical integration and nonsupport of the rate for the job idea. They are quite clever. They advocate economic integration, because they know that that is the most important lever for applying and implementing the policy of the rate for the job. Until they have economic integration, they come into conflict with the traditional policy of this country, namely job reservation. They know they have to break that, but they can only break that after economic integration has become an accomplished fact. [Quorum.] In a further attempt to state their policy in this House, we heard about a few cases of disciplinary action. We heard about mileage signs between Simonstown and St. James, trifling matters which they inflated into matters of policy and inefficiency on the part of the Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) said that the Administration was making cyphers of the Railway officials, and that in the annual Report of the General Manager they found only figures and statistics. Sir, my humble conception of business and good administration is that that those matters are based on three fundamental premises. The first is that one should have a clear conception of one&#x2019;s task; one should know what one wants to achieve. The second is that one should have a rational basis of labour division, and the third is that one should apply self-control regularly and systematically. Now I should like to know how the General Manager is supposed to comply with these high requirements without using statistics. In contrast with the uncalled-for and unfriendly comments on the Report of the General Manager, I want to give them the assurance from this side of the House that we regard that as sound business control, as the application and the recognition of most important and fundamental business principles.</p>

<p>We congratulate him on that, and we hope and trust that in future, if it is at all practicable, he will break down all data in order to set us, as far as humanly possible, the perfect example of business control we have been accustomed to receive from the hon. the Minister and his Department up to now. I give them my best wishes and congratulate them.</p>

<p>After listening to speeches by members of the Government party, one would think that the Railways was an all-White undertaking, and that diabolical efforts and attempts were being made by us to introduce workers into the Railway Service who are not White, when in actual fact the Railways already has many thousands of Bantu and Coloured workers in its ranks. I want to ask these hon. gentlemen who talk about integration, whether or not a business which employs 100,000 people has those people integrated in its system, or whether they are segregated and out of the system. I have never listened to so much nonsense in my life about these attempts which are being made to try and suggest that the United Party has some deep, cunning plan to oust the White man from his job and to substitute him by Coloureds and Bantu. In actual fact, I want to make a statement to-day to this effect, that no Coloured man wishes to get employment at the expense of his White colleague. But what the Coloured people do say is that this country is developing, particularly the Railways, to an extent where we cannot cope with the traffic which is offered. We hear the Minister say, and correctly, that he is short of staff. In general terms the manpower shortage in this country is common to all industries, so much so that the Minister of Labour has had to agree in various Industrial Council agreements to allow certain types of workers to do semi-skilled work. This means that those people are in the industry; they are not just brought in but are already there. They are part and parcel of it. No matter how much the Nationalist Party may squawk and scream about it, that is a hard, incontrovertible fact. In dealing with the question of labour, my plea to the Minister to-day is that in his search for new employees he should consider Coloured persons. He had a mission overseas which was partially successful and brought people out here&#x2014;but my information is that numbers of these people find difficulties in this country with the languages, not only with the Afrikaans but also with the English language, because they come from Southern Europe. There are also people who come from the welfare states, and they find it difficult to adjust themselves to a country where there are no free hospitals or medical attendance. Then there are domestic reasons why they leave. Some members of the family do not like it here and want to go back. I want to suggest to the Min ster that he should institute a method of inquiring, as part of his policy, into the finding of suitable avenues of employment in the Railways which could be filled by the Coloured people of this country who number l,500,00( of the population. They are people <span class="col_783-784" refersTo="page_0402"/>who understand the country and they speak both the languages. They are South Africans in every respect. They are loyal servants. They have taken their stand with us, when we have had to defend ourselves, and they are as good as any other group or class of persons in the Republic. I therefore make an appeal to the Minister and ask him to consider doing this on a basis of its being a plan and part of his policy, and not on the basis of an expediency. I do not want him to say, as the Minister of Mines said during the week, that he has a shortage of 2,000 White miners but that when the old mines close down those who will be released there can fill the positions. It is quite conceivable that new mines will be discovered yielding both minerals and base metals and that there will always be a shortage of miners. The Railways, however, have no prospect of closing down part of their activities and therefore whatever changes in personnel do take place must be permanent. They cannot be temporary, on the basis of the thinking of the Minister of Mines, which I think is extremely short-sighted. The Minister of Railways, to give him the credit, has not done too badly on the Railways, although there is plenty of room for criticism and he will still be criticized. So my first point is an appeal to the Minister to employ Coloured persons to a greater degree than he does now, in grades and positions where they can be most useful. I know he will tell me that representations have been made to him to employ these people in those areas which have been declared as Coloured townships. But the Railways are not confined to one specific township; it covers the entire country and the services of the Railways are required by everybody all over the country. So I say the Minister should get away from the narrow thinking that he is doing the Coloured man a great favour by appointing him as a station master or as a foreman or as a shunter in some little yard in some remote Coloured township. I believe that the only prospect which will lead us to prosper to the extent that we should, is to utilize every possible source of labour we can.</p>

<p>Do you want a Coloured man to be the station master of Cape Town?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not concerned about the station master of Cape Town. That is the kind of ridiculous suggestion made by those hon. members opposite. That is not a valid argument at all, to suggest that because we want to put Coloured people in jobs which are vacant and for which there are no recruits, that by doing so the Cape Town station will be in the charge of a Coloured man. I would go further and say it is not unlikely in the passage of years that such a man will emerge, and if he did, what of it? In other parts of the world, there are people of different colours in high jobs and that is also going to happen in this country. We talk so glibly and lightly about job reservation as though it is the be-all and end-all. when in fact the Minister of Labour has granted more exemptions than he has promulgated proclamations to declare reserved trades and occupations. But that is good propaganda for people in the platteland who do not know what is going on. I can hear Nationalist Party speakers screaming now about what the hon. member for Karoo said in Parliament. The fact is that we have 1,500,000 Coloured people in this country and many of them work on the Railways.</p>

<p>I want to refer to one or two other items in connection with the Railways and ask the Minister for his co-operation and support and for some action. I have asked him before for a contributory pension fund for non-Whites. If my memory serves me correctly his reply was, &#x201C;where will I get the money? Do you realize what it will cost&#x201D;? That has been his answer for a long time but I think it is no longer valid because in the year which has just gone by we have had these tremendous increases given to White workers. Good luck to them; nobody begrudges them their increases.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HON MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>So you admit that it is a tremendous increase?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>One does not have to admit that a sum of money is tremendous; its size is obvious. These increases involve globular sums of money and there are many people getting the benefit of these increases and to some extent the non-Whites have been receiving some benefit. The point I wish to make though is that because there is an election coming along, every White worker has been offered a little bit of sugar or bait, a little sugar for the birds. That is the whole simple issue and whether or not it will pay dividends remains to be seen. I think the railway worker is a very sensible person. He knows quite well that his efforts to get more money were conducted through his trade unions, with the assistance of this side of the House, and that that side of the House has steadfastly refused to give them any increases, the excuse being that there was no money. Now we find that money has been found and I think the time has come to plead again for my proposition that there should be a contributory pension fund for Coloured persons in the Railway service. I am being reminded here that there will be a surplus and I have no doubt that that will be so.</p>

<p>Another thing that I want to ask the Minister to do for me is to introduce a cost-of-living allowance for all employees on the Railways and particularly for those in the lower brackets, whatever the colour of their skins may be, because with the rising costs I think it is inevitable that these people are going to be faced with difficulties in making ends meet. I would like to take time by the forelock and provide these people with a cost-of-living allowance before the position becomes serious.</p>

<p>I then come to the question of wages and salaries which, in general terms, are low and I would like to ask the Minister, through his trade unions, to see what can be done in <span class="col_785-786" refersTo="page_0403"/>that regard. Generally speaking I think the position of the non-White employees on the Railways could be improved considerably that they could be given more responsibility and that they could be paid considerably more than they are being paid at the present moment.</p>

<p>Then I also want to ask the Minister whether he will not do away with this system of gratuities and make pensions payable instead. There are cases where widows get nothing. I think the non-White staff should also be able to contribute to a pension fund as well as a widows&#x2019; and orphans&#x2019; fund. In other words, they should be put on the same basis as their White colleagues, or on a similar or appropriate basis. Sir, I say that because there is such a large number of non-Whites employed on the Railways to-day, that they represent a very real portion of the labour force in the entire country as well as within the Railway service. The complaint which is made to me quite often and which I wish to ventilate is the lack of accommodation provided in main line trains as far as reserved coaches are concerned. My information is that the General Manager of Railways has been advised by the Coloured organizations that one coach, which is customarily provided, is insufficient. You know, of course, Sir, that it is possible to book accommodation on the trains three months beforehand when the booking opens. Coloured people complain bitterly that unless they get their names in within a fortnight of the opening day, that is to say, 24 months before they decide to go away, they do not have much chance of getting on the train. The Railways do attempt to a certain extent to assist in times of heavy traffic and during holiday periods, but I have had several experiences which lead me to think that the flexibility at local level is so poor that the Minister could well investigate the position and make some changes to the benefit of the people concerned. I quote as an example a case brought to my notice quite recently where an individual wanted to put a Coloured person on a train from a big station and had to phone through to Durban to see whether there was accommodation on the Orange Express; had to phone Johannesburg to find out whether there was accommodation on the Trans-Karoo and had to phone elsewhere to find out whether there was accommodation on the Rhodesian Express. He had no luck at all. A whole week went by; people came to see me and I took up the matter with the System Manager. I want to say to his credit that this person was on the train the next morning. The point I want to make is this: Who got thrown off in order to get this person on the train? [Interjections.] No, they do not put on extra coaches, and I think that that is something which should be done. The Coloured people make quite extensive use of the reserved coaches on the main lines. They want to move about; they have business to attend to and they also go on holiday, and I think some of the difficulties placed in their way might be removed. I ask the hon. the Minister to give this matter his consideration.</p>

<p>I noticed that the hon. the Minister referred in his opening address to the fact that his catering services were still losing money. Sir, this service is one which I think should be examined with a view to using other personnel since the present personnel are hard-pressed. The dining cars appear always to be understaffed and I think the time has come when the Minister should examine that aspect with a view to employing Asiatic and Coloured people on the dining cars because that is a line of business which they understand and in which they excel. One can go into the best hotels and one finds non-Whites serving meals. I think this is one place where the Coloured man could be introduced with considerable benefit.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think that in discussing this important and large amount requested by the hon. the Minister, we should not only consider his stewardship for the past year, but should also examine the full five years of this Parliament&#x2019;s duration, in order to see what has been done and what has been omitted in connection with the Railways of South Africa. From the other side of the House we have heard a good deal about the mark made by the hon. the Minister during these last years, but he has made more than only that mark; he has made holes, and in many places he has also left wounds, and it will be a good thing if we also look at the other side of the picture this afternoon, the side which hon. members on the other side have not presented to this House.</p>

<p>Yes, we have had five years of Nationalist Government rule. In the first place, it was a r&#x00E9;gime under which dissatisfaction among the Railways staff reached a high-water mark such as this country had seldom experienced before. During the past two years that dissatisfaction grew and nearly came to a head, a seething and justified dissatisfaction among the Railways staff, and the position was saved only because the Minister&#x2014;one could almost say too late&#x2014;came forward with the recent increases. If I say that the dissatisfaction almost reached a high-water mark, we should take a look at the best barometer of dissatisfaction, and what better barometer can there be than the number of resignations? In any firm, in any organization, one always finds people who are dissatisfied but the test for true dissatisfaction is when people are driven to the point where they are prepared to resign from that organization, and that is why the r&#x00E9;gime of the past five years has been a r&#x00E9;gime of dissatisfaction virtually unprecedented in the history of South Africa, because the number of resignations has never been so high in the <span class="col_787-788" refersTo="page_0404"/>history of the Railways of South Africa. The number of resignations rose to 10,000 a year.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks how many have rejoined. I am comparing the position with those of previous years in which employees also resigned and joined. After all, figures have been prepared on the same basis, and the fact of the matter is that the number of resignations under this r&#x00E9;gime was larger than ever before in the history of the country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="#hensard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>And the staff establishment was also larger.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>For a few months the railwayman may now enjoy some relief, but hard on the railwayman&#x2019;s heels&#x2014;as a result of the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;there still follows the dragon of the rising cost of living, and ahead of him lurks a predator in the shape of the Minister of Finance, waiting to impose higher taxes; though fortunately the present Minister of Finance will not be introducing the next Budget.</p>

<p>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, this is the r&#x00E9;gime under which the Railway Service has experienced its greatest peace-time labour problems. The General Manager of the Railways himself states in his Report that there have been heavy losses of manpower; he writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Increasing staff shortages in certain key grades at times created problems of considerable magnitude.</block>

<p>Nobody knows better than the Minister himself of what magnitude those problems were. But not only was it a r&#x00E9;gime under which dissatisfaction reached a high-water mark, under which the labour problem reached a high-water mark for peace-time, it is also a r&#x00E9;gime under which particular sections of the Railways virtually fell into chaos. Thirdly, I refei to the shocking example of the catering department. It is well nigh incredible that the catering department is operated at such an astronomical loss of hundreds of thousands of rands per year. The latest figures at my disposal reflect an annual loss of more than R750,000, nearly as large as the previous year&#x2019;s figure of more than R900,000. The catering department incurred losses which increased from R100,000 to R400,000, to R500,000, to almost R1,000,00 in a single year. Compare that with the r&#x00E9;gime of the United Party, which is held up to such scorn, under which the catering department did not show a loss but showed a profit, as in the year 1947, of R419,00. As far as we can deduce, the reorganization of the catering department, to mention only one department, has resulted in increased losses. It has not resulted in a major decrease in the number of items, excepting in so far as the Railways got rid of or tried to get rid of its catering departments, and after it had got rid of them, it found that in many cases private undertakings could make a success of them&#x2014;where it had failed despite the fact that it did not have to pay rents for the premises in which its restaurants were situated. No, I will not be told that the r&#x00E9;gime of the past five years has been a r&#x00E9;gime of good government, good management and good stewardship on the part of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Fourthly, this is the Railways r&#x00E9;gime under which the policy of civilized White labour showed serious cracks, not only among shunters, but also on dining-cars and among railroad workers. One of the hon. members on that side&#x2014;I think it was the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) (Mr. J. A. Schlebusch) &#x2014;quoted a most extraordinary series of figures to us, by means of which he tried to prove that the percentage increase in the number of Natives or non-Whites on the Railways had been larger under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime than under the present Nationalist Party r&#x00E9;gime. As far as I can determine, however, the fact of the matter is, firstly, that the number of non-White labourers on the Railways at present is the highest in the history of South Africa, and it is also a fact that under this Government the number of non-White labourers on the Railways has shown a greater increase than the number of White labourers. The hon. the Minister must correct me if my figures are wrong, but according to the report of the General Manager of the Railways for the year 1948, the total White establishment was 98,000 and the total non-White establishment 90,000. According to the 1965 report of the General Manager, the total White establishment was 115,000 and the total non-White establishment 111,000.</p>

I do not know where the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) found his figures; I found mine in the report of the General Manager of Railways.</p>

<p>Our primary consideration is the efficiency of the Railways, but we must also take into consideration the principle of civilized White labour on the Railways, and the Minister must naturally take the blame for the present situation, since he is making it virtually impossible for the Whites to remain on the Railways, and since they are <span class="col_789-790" refersTo="page_0405"/>resigning in tens of thousands and he is forced to replace them with non-Whites. We maintain that anything of that nature should first obtain the approval of the Railways Staff Associations. Personally, I regret to see that happening, but if it is unavoidable under the policy of the hon. the Minister, well, what can one do with such a Minister and such a Government? Of course, if we had had a different Government, the situation would have been solved.</p>

<p>No, we are not opposed to that. We are in favour of the employment of more Whites and of course more non-Whites as well, but under our regime the increase in the number of non-Whites will not be so very much larger than the increase in the number of Whites as it has been under this Government. Naturally there will be expansion under a United Party Government. We shall have to appoint far more staff, both White and non-White, but I am quite sure that the increase in the number of Whites will be larger than the increase in the number of non-Whites.</p>

<p>Fifthly, this is the r&#x00E9;gime under which there has been so much boasting about railway houses and what has been done for the railwayman as regards housing. I concede that a good deal has been done. A United Party Government might have done much more. But, Sir, this Government must also be characterized as the one under which hundreds and hundreds of railway houses stood empty in certain years. In 1963 alone no fewer than 786 railway houses stood empty. And, Sir, do you know what was one of the main reasons? One of the main reasons, as furnished to me by the hon. the Minister, was that White railway workers were being replaced by non-Whites. He told me that in reply to a question, and I hope hon. members will look that up in Hansard. Almost 800 railway houses are standing empty because White railway workers have been replaced by non-White workers.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>In the sixth place, this is the r&#x00E9;gime under which planning has gone wrong in so many cases. We were glad to hear that the Organization and Method System had been introduced on the Railways, but I know that during the first few months after its introduction, at least, more personnel were used rather than fewer. There was no saving in personnel. I hope the position has now improved. Take a minor example. In the past one had to fill in three forms in order to send a parcel by air from Johannesburg to Cape Town. To-day one has to fill in seven forms after O &#x0026; M has given thorough consideration to the matter. That has been my personal experience. Consider the case of the laundry here at Culemborg, consider that money was voted for it as long ago as 1951, that machines to the value of tens of thousands of rands were bought, but stood there for years before they were taken into use, until finally there were machines to the value of R217,000, and only 12 years later was that laundry taken into use. Have you ever seen such an example of wonderful planning!</p>

<p>In the seventh place, this r&#x00E9;gime will be characterized as the one under which the entire financial system of payment nearly broke down at a certain stage. I am thinking of the numerous officials who at one stage did not receive their salary cheques in good time; I am thinking of the tremendous delays in sick fund payments. In 1964 there were no fewer than 1,168 cases of sick fund payments which had been delayed for longer than four months. Think of the misery caused by that. The man who had been ill had to pay his accounts: he had incurred great expenses; his children were at school and he had to buy them clothes and in 1,168 cases the Railways were either so heartless or so inefficient that those payments were not made in good time. At one stage during the past five years the Railways could not even pay its own accounts correctly. In 1961-2, in one year alone, accounts amounting to R400,000 were unpaid&#x2014;arrear accounts which should have been paid. Where is that wonderful image of the Railways which is presented to us? Why do not the hon. members on the other side tell the country more about these things?</p>

<p>In the eighth place, this was the period in which the Superannuation Fund waxed fat. Yes, the Superannuation Fund grew fat also as a result of the contributions made by the orginary railwayman, but what did the pensioner get? So far he has only received a few crumbs, in spite of the fact that the Government and the railwaymen have paid in up to three times as much as the ordinary railwaymen have actually received by way of pensions.</p>

<p>In the ninth place, this was the r&#x00E9;gime of vastly inflated Railway Estimates. Yes, vastly inflated, but nevertheless there were also enormous tariff increases which weighed heavily on all who made use of the Railways.</p>

<p>Finally, in this regard I think the hon. the Minister has given the country a new meteorological sign, a meteorological sign which the Weather Bureau would do well to adopt. In summer we have the sign of the sun; in spring we have the sign of the trees; in autumn we have the sign of the falling leaves, and in winter we have the sign of the coal crisis on the Witwatersrand; as inevitably as the flowers and as inevitably as the sun and as inevitably as the falling autumn leaves, we have had coal crises in 1965, 1964, 1963. I do not want to bore you with a list of all the years. I want to predict that unless a new Government comes <span class="col_791-792" refersTo="page_0406"/>into power within the next month or two, which is, of course, what we are all hoping for and expecting, the Witwatersrand will experience another coal crisis in June. Mr. Speaker, one can understand it if there is a coal crisis in one year; one can forgive the second year&#x2019;s; but when comes to the third and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth year, and that crisis persists, I refuse to be told by anybody that the Government is a capable and efficient one.</p>

<p>That hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling), who says that I am stupid, should rather start investigating the safety of the Railways in the Carletonville area, which falls within his constituency. Grave danger is threatening there. Sinkholes under the railway lines present a serious danger in those parts. In looking up the Railways&#x2019; records regarding accidents, we must realize that not nearly all the accidents which occur are recorded. In fact, nowhere in this report could I find the number of railway accidents that occurred last year and the year before last. The report does contain a very fine graph. The graph fell, and last year it rose again, quite sharply too. But the actual accident figures are not furnished. I put a question to the hon. the Minister in respect of one area only, namely the new hump marshalling yard in Bloemfontein. This yard was taken into service approximately 15 months ago, and in this period there were no fewer than 440 accidents. I repeat, Mr. Speaker: 440 accidents in one railway yard. And do you know how many derailments have occurred there? At this one place 62 derailments occurred. Do you think this report reflects all accidents? Do you think they are all taken into consideration? Certainly not!</p>

<p>If there in one aspect which should give us all much food for thought, it is the large number of injuries, quite serious injuries, suffered by railwaymen. I wonder whether the House and the country realize how many staff members were injured on the Railways last year, and injured to such an extent that their injuries had to be reported? Mr. Speaker, it is not a matter of 1,000 or 2,000. Oh no, it is a matter of no fewer than 24,000 railwaymen who were injured to such an extent that the injuries were reported. And in respect of those injuries, compensation amounting to almost R2,000,000 had to be paid. Our railwaymen are the ones who have to endure that suffering. They did not suffer minor grazes. Many of them suffered broken limbs. Some of them had to go to hospital. In some cases they were so seriously maimed that they could not go back to work. Some of those accidents even resulted in deaths.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not satisfied that the safety measures taken on the Railways are quite effective. I am not satisfied with a state of affairs in which our railwaymen incur 24,000 injuries in one year.</p>

<p>Did you say 24,000 a year?</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. Minister furnished this figure in his reply to me. On 25 January I put a question to him in this connection. The figure is 24,000 per year. I asked the Minister how many drivers, shunters, firemen, guards and other staff employed by the South African Railways were (i) killed or (ii) injured on duty during each year since 1961. The figures which he furnished in respect of 1964-5 were: drivers&#x2014;528 (injured); shunters&#x2014;1,678; firemen&#x2014; 1,284; guards&#x2014; 800; other staff&#x2014;19,749. That comes to a total of approximately 24,000 injured persons.</p>

<p>I want to say here&#x2014;and I think the public will agree with me&#x2014;that the services rendered by the Railways to the public at present are not the best, or nearby as satisfactory as they can and should be. Of course the quality of the service depends upon who is in charge. The services can be improved in many respects. In this connection, Sir, I wonder&#x2014;despite the reasons furnished&#x2014;why the electrification of the railway line between Beaufort West and Beaconsfield cannot be continued. Why cannot the railway line be electrified from Cape Town right through to Johannesburg? We now find that the line from Kimberley <span class="col_793-794" refersTo="page_0407"/>to Postmasburg is being electrified, and also the line to Hotazel. But I should prefer the other, more important section, the one between Touws River and Kimberley, to be electrified completely, even if it costs more than the other section.</p>

<p>Is it also an indication of good services being provided to the public if one finds that under this Government the average age of passenger coaches used on the mainlines is 45 years? I admit that new coaches are being bought. But not enough of them are being acquired to replace the old coaches to any appreciable extent. It should be borne in mind that these old coaches become another year older every year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have heard a great deal about this new Blue Train. We have heard about two new Blue Trains. The two of them are going to cost R2.6 million. I suppose they will be very fine trains. I hope my children will be able to travel in them one day. But you know, Mr. Speaker, when I studied the Estimates, I found that only R200 of the R2,600,000 was used in this year. This side of the House approves of those two Blue Trains. We hope that one day they will mean as much for the transport service of South Africa as is expected of them, particularly from the point of view of tourism. But why all the delay with those prestige trains?</p>

<p>There are major errors which have to be corrected, and there are minor anomalies which are quite unnecessary. As regards the latter, I am thinking of parking areas on the platforms of the Johannesburg station. Originally those parking areas were laid out, but later they were removed again. And for the third successive year the hon. the Minister is still unable to tell me when motorists will be allowed to park on the platforms of the Johannesburg station. Then there is the gallery tearoom at the Johannesburg station which has ceased to function. The Railways could not continue running it. We have the long oil pipeline to Johannesburg, and the fact that every time a motorist in Johannesburg buys a gallon of petrol, he has to pay 4c extra, as a result of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy and actions. It is simply called the &#x201C;Ben Tax&#x201D;!</p>

<p>Unfortunately I do not have the time to deal with all the points I wanted to mention. Before sitting down, however, I want to ask the hon. the Minister the following question: Does the Minister have any further information regarding the alleged commission which was alleged to have been paid in respect of the Boeing aeroplanes? When I asked the hon. the Minister about that, his reply was that the Railways did not pay one cent in respect of commission.</p>

<p>I accept that. In any event, I have written to the Boeing company and their letter to me, which I have before me, states that they have no agent in South Africa. A certain company in Vereeniging nevertheless, alleged that they had received a certain amount as commission on the sale of these aeroplanes. Well, that is quite a serious matter. I have submitted the matter to the Auditor-General, but I think it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s duty to find out what the real state of affairs is. And if commission has been received, by which person or body has it been received? [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I knew it was just a temporary phenomenon when the hon. member for Orange Grove began speaking very quietly, because I knew he would not continue in that strain. One must just give him a chance and then he again refers to everything under the sun in the superlative degree. The hon. member referred to the previous United Party r&#x00E9;gime, and according to him everything in the garden was rosy as far as the Railways was concerned. The rolling stock was brand new&#x2014;there was not so much as a little speck of rust to be seen anywhere. And what has happened under this Government? Alas, everything is going to rack and ruin. The trucks are empty. The funds have dried up. And in that strain the hon. member continued. But what I find very strange, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that although&#x2014;as the hon. member wants to give out&#x2014;Railway matters flourished under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime, and after that fell into decline under the Nationalist Party r&#x00E9;gime, just the opposite has happened in this House, because here the National Party has grown tremendously, while the numbers of the members on that side have been reduced repeatedly. If he could clear up this anomaly for me, I would be very glad, for if wretchedness has been prevailing under this r&#x00E9;gime for so many years already, we should no longer have been sitting on this side of the House.</p>

<p>I recall that quite a few years ago I read about certain things which the hon. member had had to say about Railway housing. I think it was in 1946 that photographs were shown in this House of a White foreman&#x2019;s dwelling under a pepper tree next to the railway line, a dwelling measuring only six feet by nine feet and built of corrugated iron. A mile away houses had been built for non-White railway workers which had wood block floors, four rooms and built-in baths. And now hon. members on that side of the House want to boast about what they did in respect of railway housing while they try and decry what has been done for the railwayman under this hon. Minister.</p>

<p>Many aspects of transport in our country have been discussed in this debate. The Opposition touched upon many matters. They found fault with everything. They criticized railway finances, carrying capacity, capital works, staff matters, train time-tables, and so one can go on. If I remember correctly, their criticism in the past was at least a little more confined within certain limits, within specific channels, and it dealt more with specific matters. <span class="col_795-796" refersTo="page_0408"/>But on this occasion they merely took all these matters, threw them into a pot, stirred violently and whilst stirring added even more matters to the contents of the pot. They did this because they did not want the impression to be gained outside this House that this Government might perhaps have done something good. The tactics of that side of the House were to throw everything they could lay their hands on into the pot&#x2014;yes, even the hon. the Minister had to be dragged in. They wanted to leave nothing untouched because they were afraid that at this stage, shortly before the election, the impression might be gained outside this House that there were a few matters which this Government had handled correctly and with which they could be satisfied.</p>

<p>As I have said, even the hon. the Minister was dragged in and thrown into the pot of criticism, notwithstanding the fact that the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) had said two or three years ago that if the United Party should one day come into office, the hon. the Minister should consider joining them so that he could manage railway affairs for them! I am satisfied that the hon. member was serious when he made that statement. Other hon. members condemned the hon. the Minister indiscriminately, until the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) had second thoughts and admitted that the Minister had not acquitted himself of his task too badly. He at least admitted that we could praise the Minister for what he had done. But apart from that, the hon. the Minister was criticized indiscriminately. They had forgotten what was said on that side of the House a year or two ago in regard to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s able handling of the country&#x2019;s Railway affairs.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at what the hon. member for Durban (Point) said here. What a long detour the hon. member made! He raked up hoary old stories and took his stand on blown-up bridges and railway lines. He said that that was the state they found the Railways after this side had tampered with them. Hon. members on that side allege that bridges which had had to be used by Whites had been blown up by people on this side, and that they had had to make the repairs. Mr. Speaker, not one of us, even in the days when that sort of thing was taking place, approved actions of that nature in any way whatsoever. If we look back to 1949, i.e. shortly after the National Party came into power, we find that there were also delays in the transport service of the Administration. There were many transport problems. The then hon. Minister said that we should bear in mind, however, that transport problems, including delays, were not only due to a shortage of trucks and tractive power. He explained that there were other causes. Platforms were too short; loading ramps were too small; marshalling-yards did not meet the requirements; goods-yards could not accommodate the desired amount of traffic; and loop lines were too short. These things, and many more besides, created great problems, Mr. Speaker. We had to overcome these difficulties. The short platforms were not the work of a few irresponsible persons who had been guilty of violence. They did not tear up the rails on loop-lines and carry them away. The marshalling-yards were not blown up into useless piles of rubble with dynamite. These things were the legacy in 1948 of the hon. members on that side. And this Government had to begin rebuilding from that point, not only as far as the expansion of the Railways was concerned, but also as far as rectifying staff matters was concerned.</p>

<p>When hon. members complain here about the congestion taking place in the harbours because the freight offered is too great for the available facilities, the reasons cannot be sought in the dynamite fumes which the hon. member once more tried to conjure up here. That was also something which this Government had to apply itself to and rectify from scratch. That had nothing to do with the actions which were committed on a few occasions and which did not meet with our approval.</p>

<p>It is of course a well-known fact that South Africa&#x2019;s participation in the Second World War caused disruption in the country, and when I say this I am not reproaching anyone and I am not picking a quarrel with anyone. At some stage or other of this disruption a new start had to be made in order to set matters right, particularly as far as staff matters were concerned. The necessary adjustments had to be made and discord amongst the staff had to be eliminated. We had to remove suspicion. All these things had to be tackled. All these things were accordingly done, and where do we stand to-day? I firmly believe, Mr. Speaker, that the position to-day is such that there is a degree of co-operation amongst the staff as there has never been before. There is good co-operation between the hon. the Minister and the various staff associations. There is mutual respect and trust which enables them to discuss and endeavour to solve the problems which have still to be overcome. What a tremendous building-up process it was just to place staff matters on a sound footing. One must also take into consideration the enormous quantities of rolling stock which had to be supplied, as well as all the other bottle-necks which this Government has had to get through since taking office.</p>

<p>Furthermore I want to refer to a matter touched upon by the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman), namely the question of over-time payments. This problem does not date from recent years. It is a phenomenon which has cropped up over all the years, and it is something, Mr. Speaker, which cannot be easily solved. During his Budget speech in 1947 the then Minister, i.e. the late Mr. Sturrock also expressed his concern in regard to this matter. He said the following, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">The enormous sum of £5,500,000 per annum is being paid in overtime.</block>

<p><span class="col_797-798" refersTo="page_0409"/>Even then the staff position was difficult. Of course, it was a few years after the war. At that time more than 14,000 White volunteers who had not worked for the Railways previously were employed by the Administration, as well as more than 8,000 Bantu, but even with all that extra staff, the Administration had at that time paid out this tremendous amount in overtime. I want to agree with the hon. member that this matter should continually be watched. Officials must be prevented from being overcome by fatigue as a result of overtime work, which could easily lead to accidents. I am convinced, however, that the Administration keeps a very watchful eye on this matter. However, we can forget about a formula for the easy solution of this question. This subject of overtime payments is tied up with so many factors that it will certainly not be easy to decide where overtime should be removed, where it should be limited to an extent and where it should remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to touch upon another little matter. As hon. members probably all know, the remuneration associated with a position offered by an employer is probably the most important factor as far as applicants for the post are concerned. Another very important factor is the relevant working conditions. Even if the remuneration were very good, a person would nevertheless leave a post quite readily if the working conditions are not to his liking. He would decide not to work there any longer as the working conditions were unsatisfactory. That is why I want to say that the Administration should be thanked for the way in which they have always taken care of the working conditions of the staff. They must also be thanked for what has already been achieved in this respect. I want particularly to refer to one specific matter, a matter with which I concerned myself and in regard to which I was in communication with the office of the hon. the Minister during the recess. I am referring to heating facilities in our goods train guard&#x2019;s vans. Of the 2,997 vans in service at present, 1,615 have already been supplied with stoves. It is expected that the other vans will also be supplied with stoves before the onset of the winter months. In other vans, alterations are being made which include, <i>inter alia,</i> toilet facilities. Unfortunately I do not have the relevant figures at hand. I know however, that good progress is being made in this connection. These heating facilities are, of course, a great comfort for our conductors. They are not only of inestimable value in the cold winter months, but also in the summer months when officials who are out of doors may get wet in the rain, for then they can dry their clothes near the stoves. We are greatly indebted to the Administration for these kind of facilities which make the working conditions of the railwaymen much pleasanter.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to refer to the cordial co-operation which exists between local authorities and the Administration. In this regard I am also thinking of certain large local authorities in the Transvaal who are busy with enormous road-building programmes. With these projects the Administration also comes into the picture as some of the bridges have to be built over railway lines and so on. I investigated the matter a little and my information is that the co-operation between the Administration and these local bodies is of the best. Whenever the Railways is approached in regard to some matter or other, the matter is dealt with briskly without any unnecessary delays. There are no unnecessary delays as far as the financial aspect of these matters is concerned either. It is, of course, important that there should be cordial co-operation between the Administration and our larger local authorities in particular. There is no doubt that a good spirit of co-operation has developed between the two bodies over the years, and there is no doubt about the appreciation for that on the part of the local authorities.</p>

<p>I want to say something in regard to our agriculture, but before I come to that I want to refer to what the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. Cruywagen) said. He said in the beginning of his speech that all that this side of the House contributed towards this debate was criticism and yet more criticism. He said sarcastically that under the United Party regime everything in the garden had been rosy as far as the Railways was concerned, there was not so much as a speck of dust to be seen anywhere, but that when the Nationalist Party came into office, they had disorganized everything. The hon. member is probably aware that we have already given the South African Airways credit for the good services which they are rendering and for the treatment the public is receiving from the service. Mr. Speaker, this side of the House has meted out praise to this hon. Minister and the Government for a whole lot of things.</p>

According to hon. members on that side there is absolutely nothing wrong with this administration. No improvements are needed. All that one hears is, &#x201C;thank you, thank you; it is the best service in the world; once again thank you, thank you and thank you once more&#x201D;.

<p>No, I am not ungrateful. All that we heard from that side was a comparison between what the position had been in 1948 and what the present position is. It was the same old refrain&#x2014;1948 and <span class="col_799-800" refersTo="page_0410"/>1966, 1948 and 1966. I want to give the hon. member for Germiston credit for admitting that after five years of war a certain degree of disruption was to be expected and that quite a good deal of reconstruction was necessary. In any case, if we want to draw comparisons as far as statistics are concerned, why do we not take the years 1938, 1948, 1958 and 1966? What would the picture look like then? But not a single member on that side would ever compare these years with each other. No, they steer as clear of 1938 as a hare from a hound. And yet such a comparison would be very useful.</p>

<p>While I am on the subject I want to elaborate a little on the pre-war position. The hon. member spoke of the disruption which arose. Well, of what use are all these effusive thanks? Would it not be better to help solve the Administration&#x2019;s problems? Surely there will be problems when such a tremendous undertaking is being dealt with? Surely there is always room for improvement. But instead of that side of the House giving a hand in order to see what can be improved, to see what further overhauling can be done, they are doing nothing more than to say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D;one after the other. As I have said, this country was involved in a war for five years.</p>

<p>South Africa was not subjected to bombing attacks and the railway lines were not destroyed to any great extent, except for some cases of destruction to which I shall return in a moment. But let us take the case of Japan or Germany. We know how efficient the Japanese railways are. The hon. the Minister has told us about a mission&#x2014; costing a lot of money&#x2014;which paid a visit to Japan. Many of the mission&#x2019;s recommendations have already been accepted. We know how fast the trains in Japan are. We know how efficient the service there is. And this is a country which had to endure severe bombing attacks in the Second World War. Terrible damage was done to the railways too. The same thing applies to Germany. Tremendous progress has been made in those countries as far as railways are concerned. Is it therefore only this Government or this Administration which, over a period covering 18 years, was so wonderful that it was able to achieve the reconstruction work which was achieved? Or was it the economic growth in every country &#x2014;including the two I mentioned&#x2014;which gave rise to the present position? In Japan and Germany the position after the war was much worse than it was in South Africa. In post-war years reconstruction had to be commenced in a badly disrupted country and on a badly disrupted transport structure. But all that notwithstanding their economic giowth reached far greater heights than what the case has been in this country. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I have been so disappointed to hear the arguments which hon. members on that side were raising, instead of their asking themselves what could be done to try and improve the Railways&#x2014;which are good&#x2014;even further.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) was arguing the same point and saying that it should be borne in mind that we had been involved in a war for five years, in the course of which supporters and sympathizers of the Government party had <i>inter alia</i> blown up bridges an hon. member on that side said, &#x201C;Yes, and the O.B. General is sitting on that side.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the fact that I was an O.B. General. I became one in 1940. I shall never conceal the fact. I am convinced that, in the light of circumstances prevailing at that time, I acted correctly. And I am equally glad that I left the movement in 1943, because the movement then did certain things for which certain hon. members on that side are being blamed to-day. The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) and the hon. member for North-West Rand (Mr. J. C. B. Schoeman) also threw stones, although they are both living in glass houses. I am sorry the hon. member for Heilbron is not present, for I very much wanted him to hear this. If I&#x2014;according to the information at my disposal&#x2014;had been treated by the O.B.&#x2019;s in the same way as that hon. member was treated, I would have hated them for many years to come. The hon. member for North-West Rand should at least remember that there are ex-generals of the O.B. sitting on that side of the House too. The General on this side did not have the dubious honour of sitting in a prison or a concentration camp at the Government&#x2019;s expense.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am only reacting to allegations made against me as an individual. Let me just say the following in this connection: Most of the hon. members on my side of the House took part in the war effort, and I am proud of the fact that I am sitting on this side of the House. As far as the opposite side of the House is concerned you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of hon. members who helped to keep this country free.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words about the railway tariff on the transport of wool. The hon. member for De Aar-Colesberg (Mr. M. J. de la R. Venter) also referred to it yesterday. It has been years now and representations are still being made to the Minister to decrease the railway tariff on wool. I want to give the hon. House a few figures in this regard. For grease wool the tariff is 56 cents for 300 lbs. over a distance of 250 miles. That means that for a statistical bale of 300 lbs. the tariff amounts to R1.68. That is for right-angled bales and if the grease wool has in addition not been compressed in a press, the tariff is even higher. For wool the tariff is 41.8 cents per 100 lb., or R1.25 for a 300 lb. bale. The difference between the transport <span class="col_801-802" refersTo="page_0411"/>tariff of a bale of wool and a bale of cotton is therefore 43 cents per bale. Can the hon. Minister justify this discrimination between two types of fibre which are both produced and processed in this country? He has never done this. I have said that discrimination at the expense of wool is taking place in regard to the transport tariff to an extent of 43 cents per 300 lb. bale or R430,000 on a clip of 1,000,000 bales. It therefore costs R430,000 more to transport 1,000,000 bales of wool over a distance of 250 miles than it costs to transport the same quantity of cotton of the same weight over the same distance.</p>

<p>What is the difference in price between the two articles?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately I do not know what the difference is at present. In any case the price of cotton changes from day to day. Let me just point out that one of the norms used by the hon. Minister in the calculation of railway tariffs is whether the industry in question can carry it. Now the hon. Minister should bear in mind in this connection that what the industry could afford five years ago, it can no longer afford to-day. The wool industry has also had its hard years, years of drought, etc., and livestock have diminished considerably. That is why I believe that today, more than ever, a case can be made out for a reduction of the transport tariffs on wool. I can also take my comparison further and compare the position of wool with that of other commodities. If we compare the position of wool with that of wattle-bark the picture becomes very strange. One gains the impression that wool is regarded as being the real gold of the country as far as railway tariffs are concerned. The Minister is probably aware that representations have been made to the Railways Administration for a change of the basis upon which the transport tariff of wool is calculated, namely from a weight basis to a bale basis. That is what is done in Australia and New Zealand. Once again, therefore, I want to make an appeal to the Minister to take the whole matter under revision, not only in order to bring about a decrease in the transport tariff, but also to change the basis of calculation from a weight basis to that of a bale basis. The industry would really welcome it because the present basis of calculation, namely a weight basis, causes much inconvenience. If bales are made the basis of calculation, all farmers will try to bale their wool themselves.</p>

<p>Many reasons can be given in support of a reduction of the transport tariff on grease wool. One of those reasons is that a consignment goes directly to the harbour from the loading point. In addition it is one of the easiest articles to off-load and one which can be off-loaded the most rapidly of all. A third consideration is that a truck cannot be dirtied. Usually a truck is fully loaded at the loading point so that it is not necessary to load or off-load again <i>en route.</i> If all these factors are taken into consideration there is surely a strong case for a reduction in the tariff. I want to ask the hon. Minister if he really thinks that the producer will in the long run be prepared to pay R168 for the transportation of a 100 bales of wool over a distance of 250 miles? Or will the producer eventually when he has reached his wit&#x2019;s end, have to use his own truck to transport his product and in that way deprive the Railways of revenue? Does the hon. Minister want the revenue of the Railways to be prejudiced?</p>

<p>Then there is the other matter of the transportation of livestock. I want to convey my sincere thanks to the Minister and his Department for the capable way in which livestock has been transported from one point to another during these drought conditions. I myself had to have some of my cattle transported and I can testify to the fact that it was almost fantastic to see with what speed the Administration were able to deal with a train load of livestock. It was done almost as rapidly as in the case of a passenger train. But I cannot make the same compliment as far as the transportation of slaughter-stock to the controlled market areas was concerned. Mr. Speaker, you will recall that yesterday when the hon. member for De Aar-Colesberg was speaking I intimated by means of an interjection that it took up to 14 days for a trainload of livestock to reach the abattoirs in Johannesburg. Well, I must admit that it did not take 14 days. Let me say, however, that it easily takes five days between Middelburg and Johannesburg. It sometimes takes seven days to Durban.</p>

<p>I know that, but the hon. Minister knows it too. That is something which may just as well go by the board because they will not even drink, let alone eat. Animals being transported to markets for slaughter do not necessarily deserve worse treatment than animals being transported away from drought-stricken areas. And yet we find that animals destined for the abattoirs have to stand for long periods in open trucks, sometimes under the most desperate circumstances. That is more particularly the position over Christmas when everybody wants to reach the market. It is absolutely essential that care should be taken that such animals are in transit for a short a time as possible, and definitely not from six to seven days. This is an anomaly to which a stop must be put.</p>

<p>Furthermore, does the hon. Minister know how much weight such an animal loses if he has to stand for days on end in trucks while in transit? That is a very important point. I want to illustrate it. I have here a report sheet on January before me. The railage for the transportation of 150 sheep over a distance of 250 miles is R50. The cost of marketing 150 <span class="col_803-804" refersTo="page_0412"/>sheep is almost R200. If this is the case you do not want your animals to lose weight as well because they have to spend days in trucks while in transit.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In the time remaining at my disposal I want to say something about our manpower. In East London there are two places where trains go across a street. I brought this to the attention of the hon. Minister last year, too. There is very heavy traffic on one of those streets. What struck me was that each time I went across, two very young men, they must have been between 20-25 years of age, stood at the level crossing to stop the traffic while a train was going through when shunting work was being done. Is it a reserved job? Is it work for very young men?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>They are usually the shunters operating the train.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Then I accept that. But as far as the other level crossing is concerned, that is definitely not the case. Another employment I want to talk about, is that of porter. In many places one finds that porters are middle-aged White men. Now I want to ask whether these people are all not competent to do other work? Must I accept that all of them have medical certificates stating that they are not capable of doing other work? If not, why are we wasting labour in this way? As far as I am concerned I would have no objection to a person other than a White person taking my baggage from the train to the taxi. I did not have time to obtain details from the Administration in regard to the number of White porters working on stations, but I am certain that it is a very great number. In conclusion I just want to repeat what I have already said in my speech, namely to thank the Minister from the bottom of my heart for the skill with which cattle and fodder were transported during the recent drought period. I want to go even further in my expression of thanks. There is a saying which goes in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king. Well in the existing Cabinet this hon. Minister is by far the best. But of course this does not detract from the fact that the country has become tired of this Government and I am full of confidence that we shall learn after 30 March that there is another Government with the same Administration.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend reacting to what has been said by the hon. member who has just sat down, because I have a few matters of my own I want to deal with. This debate, which is now drawing to a close, has revealed a number of distinct features. In the first place it has become clear that hon. members on the opposite side are fighting for their political survival. In no debate has it ever been so clear that the matters raised by them were intended for the information of their voters, particularly the voters under the railway people. As far as they are concerned, it is not the welfare of the railwayman which is at stake, but merely the number of potential votes from railwaymen.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the usual story.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not the usual story. Because the election is at hand they are employing every means of creating some sympathy for their own Party among those people. Their efforts to conjure up an image of being champions for the cause of the railwayman, remind me of a drowning man clutching at the proverbial straw. From the mine dumps at Angelo station, from where the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) had a panoramic view over railway activities, and from behind the kraal wall from where the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) summed up the situation at Danskraal, from these positions they seem to spy a few votes. As a matter of fact, they were so moving and so full of feeling that I feel obliged to describe the hon. member for Yeoville as the &#x201C;angel of Angelo.&#x201D; Unfortunately I cannot continue with this comparison, because it would not be quite appropriate to call the hon. member for Drakensberg the &#x201C;draak van Drakensberg&#x201D;&#x2014;neither the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan).</p>

<p>It is of course the right of any opposition in a democracy to do anything in its power to hold itself up as being a champion for the cause of the electorate. But what did we get from the side of the United Party in this debate? We on this side of the House know what we got, but does the electorate know? For that reason I am of the opinion that we should draw the electorate&#x2019;s attention to the fact that the United Party was actuated by the sole desire of gaining a few votes. As a matter of fact, I am surprised that the United Party has so grossly underestimated the intelligence of the voter. But unfortunately for the United Party it has displayed more zeal than common sense. That is particularly true when it comes to the increase in the railwaymen&#x2019;s salary, because one simply cannot get away from the fact that certain economic principles have to be observed in salary adjustments. As I have said, one can understand that the United Party is trying to create an image of being champions for the cause of the railwayman, but fortunately they are not fooling anyone. Certain definite economic principles have to be observed in any undertaking, and even more so in a large undertaking such as the South African Railways. It is absolutely essential that one should remain true to those economic principles. Let us examine the salary structure of the railwayman and let us relate it to the prevailing circumstances in industry. Salary increases may be financed from three sources. In the first place tariffs may be increased, which mean that the public would <span class="col_805-806" refersTo="page_0413"/>have to pay for the increased salaries. For obvious reasons, which have been made very clear in this debate, it is not desirable to take that step under present circumstances. The South African Railways plays an important part in the South African economy. As a matter of fact the South African Railways sometimes exercises a determining influence on the cost structure. The South African Railways is the yardstick by which we can measure the economic position of our country very clearly. Should one therefore set about things in an unrealistic way, a lack of balance could easily arise which could create many problems for us, particularly in a period of inflation such as we are now experiencing. If we should deal unrealistically with our tariff structure, we could create a vicious circle, which would entirely eliminate any benefit intended for the railwayman. That is why we should set about things very cautiously when it comes to our tariff structure.</p>

<p>A second method which could be employed for financing salary increases, is to increase the productivity per worker. If this method succeeds it is in itself a justified method of financing salary increases. In South Africa we have specific labour problems which are inherent to our country and which have to be faced. The composition of our population and the numbers in each group are of vital importance in discussing this problem. The Minister of Finance has already pointed out that we are up against an over-heated rate of economic development in South Africa. Consequently one is faced with certain problems if one wants to employ this method.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the Rates Equalization Fund. In this connection I am of the opinion that the hon. the Minister deserves a compliment from both sides of the House for the manner in which this Fund is being maintained. The function of the Rates equalization Fund is&#x2014;to put it in everyday language&#x2014;to serve as a buffer in times of economic fluctuation. That is why it was possible to make certain adjustments to the salary structure of the Railways without that having had any detrimental effects on the economy. Let us now examine what has been done for the railwaymen over the years. The salary and wage account for the year 1960-61 was R184,000,000; for the next year it was R196.000,000; for the year following that it was R215,000,000; and for the year 1964-65 it was R250,000,000. If we examine the increases granted, it appears that they constitute a continuous scheme of salary increases. That is why hon. members on the opposite side of the House blunder so badly as regards the contributory causes of those increases. In 1958 an additional allowance to an amount of R11,500,000 was paid as a non-pensionable allowance. In 1961 the remaining portion of the cost of living allowance was consolidated with basic salaries. That entailed additional expenditure of R11,500,000. In 1962 the consolidation of non-pensionable contributions demanded an additional R3,800,000, while in the same year a rationalization of salary and wage structures was responsible for additional expenditure of R17,800,000. In 1964 the railwaymen received a vacation bonus at a total cost of R9,000,000 while an increase in the rates of Sunday time and overtime payments was responsible for expenditure to an amount of R5,500,000 in the same year. I can continue in that vein, but to summarize I may point out that a total amount of R224,000,000 was spent for those purposes during the 10 years since 1954. As I have said, salary adjustments have been effected from time to time and that was done within a complex situation in which problems were encountered which could not be solved effortlessly. The point I want to make is that those adjustments were not effected arbitrarily. Discussions first had to be held with all staff associations concerned and the balance among the various staff groups had to be taken into account. Salary increases for the railwayman cannot simply be effected overnight. On the contrary, that is something which demands research and negotiations. Therefore it is an essentially slow process. And because the entire matter was handled with great caution it was possible to effect certain adjustments in the course of a number of years.</p>

<p>But apart from these improved conditions of service for the staff, or in spite of that, the Railways have gone from strength to strength and not in a single sphere has there been any retrogression. Thus we find that the tonnage of goods transported last year, was the highest ever, namely 104,500,000 tons. That was the first time the 100,000,000 mark was exceeded. This tonnage is 5| per cent higher than that of the previous year. The number of passengers transported amounted to 41,500,000, in other words more than 10 per cent higher than the figure for the previous year. At the same time a tremendous programme of development was carried out. Recall for instance the 800 miles of railway line which were electrified, the doubling of 128 miles of railway line, and the construction of 66 miles of new railway line. A total number of 16,252 new trucks was put into service, 633 carriages, 187 electric and diesel locomotives.</p>

<p>When we come to the South African Airways, we also notice tremendous progress. The South African Airways deserves our thanks not only for having maintained their disaster-free record, but at the same time having maintained their record as the safest airways in the world. As regards disasters, the South African Airways has the proudest record in the world. The purchase of Boeing 727 aircraft enabled us to introduce various parts of the country to developments in the field of aviation. For the first time various centres in our country could get acquainted with an aircraft which is almost capable of achieving the speed of sound. This is a tremendous step in the right direction in South Africa&#x2019;s aviation. Allow me to mention a few advantages brought about by this development. It is now <span class="col_807-808" refersTo="page_0414"/>possible to cover the distance between Johannesburg and Cape Town in a time of 1 hour 40 minutes as compared with the 3 hours it took previously. The distance between Johannesburg and Durban is now covered in 50 minutes as compared with 1| hours it took previously. It is interesting to know that on its flight between Johannesburg and Durban the Boeing 727 flies level for a quarter of an hour only and that the remainder of the time is taken up by ascending or descending. The Boeing 727 has an increased passenger capacity, namely 98 passengers as against the 56 of the Viscounts. Five years ago the South African Airways conveyed a total number of 279,000 passengers on its internal services. For the past financial year this number totalled 625,000. The introduction of the Boeing 727 aircraft on our first-class services, brought about a further benefit to the air traveller in South Africa, namely the fact that it was possible to make Viscount aircraft available for the popular air-coach service. Thus regular flights with turbine-screw aircraft on the air coach service became possible for the first time. The results of that are evident from the number of passengers transported on this service. During the first year of the introduction of that service only 31,600 passengers were transported in comparison with more than 103,000 in the past financial year.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that the South African Airways is one of the safest airways in the world. It is intersting to note in passing that our airways forms part of a larger international organization and consequently it will also be interesting to note how safe air journeys generally are all over the world. According to the International Aviation Association, to which 108 airlines, including our own, are affiliated, the disaster figure decreased to 0.61 per 100,000.000 passenger miles. That is 221 per cent lower than in 1963 which was the previous record year. If one compares that with other overseas institutions and any form of transport, it appears that flying to-day has become the safest means of transport by far. If one examines the facts regarding Boeing aircraft&#x2014;the South African Airways uses the 707 on its external services and the 727 on its internal services&#x2014;one finds their safety remarkable. Boeing aircraft have completed more than 5,000,000 flying hours throughout the world. This means that a single aircraft would have had to remain in the air for 570 years if it were to cover this air distance. Throughout the world 535,000 passengers are transported each week by Boeing aircraft alone, and during the 5.000,000 flying hours completed by Boeing aircraft throughout the world, 90,000,000 passengers were transported.</p>

<p>I should like to quote other figures in connection with the South African Airways in order to illustrate that ours is one of the few airlines in the world which has produced very favourable operating results. It is a feature of some of the major airlines, particularly in Europe, that they are heavily subsidized by their governments and that they show considerable losses each year. According to the Annual Report of the General Manager, the South African Airways showed a surplus of R2,200,000 as compared with a profit of R602,000 in 1963-4. This is a remarkable increase and a proud achievement on which we want to congratulate the Airways, because it has succeeded in producing very favourable operating results in spite of tremendous development. Revenue increased by R3,000,000 or 4.8 per cent from R31,000,000 in 1963-4 to R34,500,000, and that is a figure which inspires confidence in the future of the South African Airways. At this opportunity we should therefore like to conclude by wishing the South African Airways many flights and many safe landings.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not join him in the air. I would like to come down to earth for a while. Although my main interest in this debate is in regard to the Coloured people, I should like to say that we in this country must be particularly proud of the Blue Train that serves this country. I do not think there is a train which can measure up to the excellence of that service. I want to say that I think the food and the service are excellent. We should all be proud of it. But having said that in regard to the Blue Train, I want to say that it is like a man who has a beautiful suit for Sundays but wears rags during the rest of the week. I think one can extend for the benefit of the travelling public some of the benefits of the Blue Train, some of the better features such as air conditioning, because I think it would tend to make our Railways one of the best services in the world. The Minister knows the difficulties encountered in some trains overseas and then when we come back to our own country we find what a pleasure it is to travel in the Blue Train.</p>

<p>I have listened very attentively to the laudatory remarks which have come from hon. members opposite in regard to the railways and how wonderful they are, and they thank the Minister, but not one of them has ever mentioned the part the Coloured people play in this great service and how thankful we must be to the Coloured people of this country for assisting in making this service what it is to enable those hon. member to praise the Minister. It is quite clear that what I said last session is coming true and will continue to come true, and that the Coloured people of this country will have to be employed to a greater extent in this service, as indeed in the other services of the Government. I do not agree with some speakers who say or imply that there are too many Coloureds in the Railways. I do not think there are enough. There are not enough Coloured people in those branches of the Railways where they can help to relieve the shortage of manpower in the skilled or semi-skilled occupations. They should go to the workshops and learn to be useful workers in the more skilled aspect of <span class="col_809-810" refersTo="page_0415"/>the Railways. The same position will occur in the Railways as has occurred on the mines, where there has been a lot of discussion in respect of the Bantu. The Minister of Labour has found it necessary to relieve the position in regard to the Bantu employed in the building industry in the Transvaal and this Minister will, and has, I think, acknowledged the necessity for employing more Coloureds. 1 cannot speak of the Bantu because I do not know enough about them. I do not know what jobs they do, but I say he will never be able to arrest the progress of the Coloured man in this country who, despite adversity, has progressed and must play a greater part in the administration of all branches of the Government because they will be the saviours of South Africa as far as manpower is concerned. The quicker hon. members opposite realize it, the better it will be for the country. The sooner they realize that job reservation, this apartheid in work, is merely an election cry and not in the interests of the country, the better. I sincerely hope that the Coloureds will find their place in our economy, as they deserve to do. I can speak at greater length on this subject, but I understand there are still many speakers and I shall curtail my remarks. Finally, I want to raise one matter which I feel glad about but also a little disappointed about. The Minister gave certain replies to questions and indicated that there has been an increase in the wages of the non-Whites. The Minister will remember his reply on 1 February. He said that increase was 11.2 per cent It seems a reasonable increase, but what is disturbing about it is that according to that reply there are still 8,053 Coloured people who receive less than R2 a day including rations and allowances. Now I do not know what figure or values the Minister places on the rations and allowances. Those who receive less than R2 a day including rations and allowances number 8,053. I want to refer to this number of 8,053. I want to tell the Minister that despite the increase in the wages I do not think any Coloured man can live reasonably well in this country at this wage, which includes rations and allowances. I raised it last time and I raise it again. While I am happy about the improvement, I very much regret that it is not yet commensurate with the services rendered. We cannot expect these people almost to carry the Railways in this country and not be paid sufficient to live well.</p>

<p>Then there is another point. There seems to be a considerable number of casual employed by the Railways. I refer to the Annual Report of the General Manager for 1964-5. I notice that there is a total of 9,000-odd White casuals in the Railways and Harbour Service, which is an increase of about 1,500 over last year. As far as the non-White casuals are concerned, I see there is a total of 40,690, which was more or less the same as for the year before. What I want to ask the Minister is this. How long has a man to be a casual worker before he can get on to the permanent staff? I ask this because I notice that the report says that a compulsory savings fund was instituted for Coloured servants who had completed at least five years&#x2019; service. How long must a man be on the casual staff before he can become a member of the permanent staff? I take it that the reference to five years&#x2019; service does not mean in a casual capacity, but means that he is on the permanent staff. That means that there are a considerable number of Coloured workers who are casuals and who apparently can never qualify for this, but I do not know for sure. Perhaps the Minister can tell me how long a man has to be on the casual staff and how many of these casuals have in fact served for more than three or four years. My time has expired and I only want to say that 1 hope I will have other opportunities to deal more fully with certain matters affecting the Coloured people on the Railways. But one thing I would like to say to the Minister. You will never find betters workers than the Coloured workers who, knowing how difficult it is for them to keep a job if they do not do it properly, put themselves out and have proved that they are outstanding workers. I hope the Minister will continue to use them and that he will increase the scope of their employment and put them in other departments of the Railways where he will find them to be excellent workers who will help to maintain the high standards the Minister has to maintain.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>There are various aspects that one can bring to the notice of this House in this debate. I think one of the main issues raised by hon. members opposite has been in connection with the administration of the Railways, the conditions of service, and they have tried to paint a picture that the garden is very rosy indeed and that the conditions of service of the staff are excellent. But one important factor remains, and that is that in spite of the claims by hon. members opposite in regard to these conditions, it is surprising to note that perhaps the most important and serious problem facing the Railway Administration is that of the shortage of manpower. Hon. members opposite have quoted various figures, and last year the Minister replied to a question and he gave certain figures about resignation from the service. The only figures which were available were in respect of Whites. The picture that this presents is quite different from the picture presented by hon. members opposite. For instance, in 1964 there were 14,757 resignations of Whites from the Railway Service, 228 retired and 996 were discharged. That makes a total of 17,981. Now the figures for those persons joining the service as new employees total 17,014, so in actual fact for 1964 there was a loss of 967 White employees. This shows, in a breakdown of monthly figures, that in some months, as many as 1,400 resigned. I feel that this is a matter which should have received the attention of the Minister and of this House, to try to ascertain the main causes of the resignations. We know that it is imperative to the developing economy of this country that the Railways must keep pace with the economic development. It is also to the <span class="col_811-812" refersTo="page_0416"/>interest of the economic development of the country to see that as many skilled people as possible are in the employ of the Railways and play their part in the economic development. It would appear that this serious problem of the manpower shortage, particularly in regard to White persons joining the Railway Service, is a matter which requires very serious consideration. The Minister indicated when he introduced the debate on this Bill that he regarded it as a serious problem and that certain steps had been taken, but it did not appear to meet the challenge in regard to recruiting more White employees particularly. It appears that there are various alternatives the Minister has open to him, such as immigration, which I believe on three occasions has not proved to be very successful. Secondly, there was the question whether certain avenues should not be open to non-Whites where there are no Whites available to take certain posts; and then there is the question of the improved conditions of service, and finally, an intensified recruitment campaign. I feel that perhaps the last avenue open to the Minister is one which should be still further explored by him. I believe that if an intensive recruitment campaign could be commenced in the schools indicating the various advantages there are in being employed by the Railways, an all-out publicity campaign to ensure that there is a large influx of employees to the Railway Service, that will have good effects. I know that various vocational guidance bodies such as the Juvenile Affairs Board do their best to assist the Railways in the aptitude tests undertaken by those persons registered with the Juvenile Affairs Board, and wherever possible the Railway Administration receives a certain amount of priority in placing those young people in employment. It has been noticeable that many of these young people are unaware of the advantages of being employed by the Railways.</p>

<p>Another aspect which I believe might also assist the Railways in its manpower shortage is in connection with the young persons who are performing valuable services to the Railways and who are continuing their nine months&#x2019; military training. I think it will be in the interest of the Minister to make an approach to the Exemptions Board, which falls under the Minister of Labour, to see whether it is not possible that those persons who are employed on vital jobs should receive sympathetic consideration from the Exemptions Board.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to hear that. We know, too, that it is the practice of some young persons to join the Railway Service and then to go on their nine months&#x2019; military training so that they can receive full pay while they are at camp.</p>

<p>The main item I wish to discuss with the Minister concerns the Railway pensioners and other pensioners. Here I realize that the Minister is placed in a difficulty in that a number of the issues which affect the Railway pensioners also affect other civil pensioners, so it is not a matter which is entirely in the hands of this Minister. However, the Minister is responsible for the Railway pensioners, and 1 believe they number about 25,000, and they look to the Minister to present their interests when it comes to any concessions or improvements in their position. Let us face the fact that the spiralling increase in the cost of living results in these pensioners having to face a great deal of financial difficulty in the twilight of their lives and many of them are unable to fend for themselves and therefore they have to look to the State to assist them. The first point is the question of the temporary allowance. Several speakers on this side of the House have already dealt with this matter. It does appear to discriminate against those Railway pensioners who find employment outside the Railways, in the private sector. They are then faced with the loss of their temporary allowance. It has been suggested by some members opposite that it would be a case of subsidizing the private sector should the Minister continue to pay the allowance to these pensioners. However, I believe that these people who served the Railways loyally and who are trying to assist the country in its general manpower shortage should also receive some consideration from the Minister. I believe that if the Minister is unable to continue the payment of the temporary allowance to those persons who have taken employment in the private sector, he should at least give some consideration to the question of raising the means limit which is placed on these people. I believe it is possible to raise the means limit in those cases so that these people will then find that it is worth while to take up employment. There are certain important tasks that these people have undertaken at present. There are many others who would like to take up some form of employment, but they are discouraged from doing so. I believe that the more people who are productively employed the better it is for the economy of the country. Consequently we must find means of encouraging these people to remain productively employed rather than unproductively receiving the pensions to which they are entitled. The emphasis should be placed rather on encouragement than on discouragement. On the question of Railway pensioners I particularly want to raise the question of those pensioners who are to receive a small increase in terms of what the Minister has mentioned when he introduced this debate, and that is the person drawing the minimum pension, the married person or the single person with dependants, whose pension will now be increased from R88 a month to R92 a month, and for the single person without dependants from R44 to R46 a month. At the very outset I want to say I am sure that many of these people will gratefully receive these increases. However, at the same time we have to realize that they are receiving a very small reward when we take into account that large increases in salaries and wages have occurred in the various sectors and <span class="col_813-814" refersTo="page_0417"/>that consequently the effect of these increases will bring about further inflationary trends which must inevitably affect particularly these people who are struggling to exist on fixed and small incomes. They are the ones who feel the brunt and they are the ones who will have to live on the minimum amount of pension. I know that this concession which was made assisted many of the old pensioners who retired many years ago before the consolidation took place and who were entitled to very low pensions. When this minimum pension was introduced they received a good increase, but since then the increases have been very small. I should just like to cover this question of the increases because it does affect other pensioners and also these pensioners who are drawing a minimum pension. On 1 October 1965 these pensioners also received a small increase. The R42 a month for a single pensioner without dependants was increased to R44. I quote the single pensioner because it is a basis of calculation as to whether a person qualifies in terms of other laws for a social pension. We know that on 1 October 1965 a new means test came into operation for the social pensioners.</p>

<p>If a person was receiving an income of R42 a month, he would

qualify for a social pension of R2 a month. The point is that the

minimum pension was raised to R44 a month. It therefore excluded those persons from drawing a social pension. It appears that it was the policy to see that these people would be kept above that means limit of R42 a month; because as I said earlier the R42 would entitle a person to R2 a month social pension. Now my contention is that the system now being employed of increasing this minimum pension as a globular sum is not in the best interests of these pensioners. For instance, if a pensioner receiving R42 a month qualified to receive the R2, he then had various other advantages. He has the advantage of delaying his pension and as from 1 October 1966, in terms of legislation passed last year, he could then qualify for a higher rate of pension with a supplementary allowance. In the case of a man over 69 years of age he could then qualify for an extra R10 a month. By not qualifying for the social pension he is not able to enjoy that extra R10 a month which he could enjoy if he could qualify for the minimum R2 social pension. Similarly, if he qualifies for a social pension he could also be entitled to an attendant&#x2019;s allowance. Should he be unfortunate enough to suffer an illness which renders him incapable of looking after himself, he can apply for an attendant&#x2019;s allowance, which is another R10 a month. So these people are at a disadvantage through the system which has been adopted and the manner in which the minimum pension is being increased, as one globular sum, placing the person just outside the means test for a social pension. In actual fact, if the person was a war veteran, between 60 and 70 years of age, he could also lose the extra R8 per month which war veterans enjoy and which is to be increased to R10 per month from 1 April 1966. He therefore loses R12 plus the attendant&#x2019;s allowance of R10 per month, a total of R22 per month. Sir, these are matters of importance to the Railway pensioner living on a minimum pension, who is now debarred from qualifying for a social pension.</p>

<p>Your quarrel is with the Minister of Social Welfare, not with me.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I realize that. I said when I started to deal with this aspect that it was a matter of negotiation between the Minister of Social Welfare, the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Finance, but these 25,000 Railway pensioners look to the Minister of Transport to represent their interests in the Cabinet and to try to obtain the best financial advantage for them so that they can enjoy just a little bit extra in their old age, and that is why I am raising the matter with this Minister because he is the man who is responsible for the welfare of the Railway pensioners. I do hope that the hon. the Minister of Transport would be able to take up this matter at an early date on behalf of these people. I believe that the best system as far as Railway pensioners are concerned, would be rather to allow them to receive a minimum pension of R42 per month plus the additional amounts which are granted from time to time. In this instance it will be going up to R46 per month. That additional amount should be classified as an additional amount and the pension should not be treated as one gloubular sum so that they will then be able to qualify for a social pension and if they did not qualify for a social pension under the means test, they should then receive this additional amount, bringing them up to a minimum Railway pension of R46 per month. Sir, I believe that that would be in the best interest of these Railway pensioners and it would also make them feel far more satisfied.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter in which I believe that the Minister can assist Railway pensioners. I refer to those pensioners who also qualify for a war veterans pension. The increases which have been granted disqualify a number of these people from receiving a war veterans pension. It was then agreed that people who lost the war veterans pension, because their total pension would be less than they had received in the past, would receive a special allowance which would be paid by the Department of Social Welfare. Now, however, the taxation difficulty has arisen. These people who receive this special allowance have become liable for taxation on the full amount, whereas before no P.A.Y.E. deduction was made in respect of the war veterans pension, that part of the pension being exempt from taxation. I understand that this matter is still the subject of discussion between the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions and the Minister of Finance. As far back as 18 June 1965, the Minister of Finance stated in this House in reply to a <span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0418"/>question that discussions were still taking place between the Departments of Inland Revenue, Social Welfare and Pensions and the Railway Administration. Here too it is a question of assisting these people since they are at a disadvantage now because of the adjustments which have taken place.</p>

<p>There is one matter in regard to which 1 would like to make a plea to the Minister for assistance to the old-age and the Railway pensioner, and that is in connection with the concessions which are made to Railway pensioners. The hon. the Minister gave details in the House this morning of the travelling concessions which are granted to Railway pensioners. In certain municipalities such as the Municipality of Durban assistance is given to the old-age and social pensioners by giving them special travelling facilities on the buses. I would like the hon. the Minister to consider the question of extending the same sort of concession to those pensioners who utilize the Railways. Many of these people have had to move out <i>of the</i> main centres to the suburbs so as to have the benefit of lower rent and possibly lower cost of living. Many of them have to travel fair distances into town to attend hospitals and to receive treatment. Railway pensioners are granted special concessions; they are given free passes for themselves, their wives and dependants who have to attend hospitals, etc. I believe that the Minister would be doing a great service to these older people if he would favourably consider the question of granting some concession of this kind to social pensioners. I appeal to the Minister favourably to consider the question of extending concession facilities to these people in respect of a certain number of tickets per month.</p>

<p>There are other matters affecting Railway pensioners some of which have already been raised and which are of deep concern to these people, who look to this Minister for some assistance. I do hope that the Minister will be able to use his influence to extend greater assistance to these people to make their lives just a little happier.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down, must forgive me for not following up what he said. I only have a few minutes at my disposal, and I should like to confine myself to a few accusations made by the Opposition in general during this debate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will agree with me that the subject of this debate has been discussed not only to a point of exhaustion, but to a point of extinction. Practically nothing remains for me to discuss. Therefore I shall try to scratch about among the dry bones, as so many members of the Opposition have done. They have tried to dig into the past to find proof for their accusations. At the beginning of this debate, I sat here listening, attentively to the main speaker on the Opposition side, the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) with all his dramatics. I expected him to charge from his bench and attack someone and then I thought to myself that the hon. the Minister would have to watch his step this year because the Opposition intended breaking through Now towards the conclusion of the debate my summary of the efforts of members of the Opposition is that they have failed hopelessly. The ironic factor in the attack by the Opposition is that it is an old habit of theirs to go back to the distant past to look for something to rake up, because as far as the present is concerned, they are simply powerless. They launch an attack and in due course they land up in a period long since past and there they try to look for accusations. I just want to tell them that if we were to follow those tactics in order to attack&#x2014;because we on this side do not defend, we attack&#x2014;then we would be able to keep them busy here for the entire afternoon and the entire week-end &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. C. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member; we want to go home. Sir, in what way do the Opposition&#x2019;s accusations enter into the present, into the affairs of the day, into the world in which we live, into the circumstances and conditions of to-day, etc.? One simply has to confine oneself to the circumstances of the day. The Opposition is entitled to put forward constructive criticism and to tell us about the things we may not know about, because, we on this side, have never pretended to be omniscient; we have never claimed that we were present when the Lord created the world. We are always prepared to listen to anybody&#x2019;s reasonable judgment and criticism. I want to ask members of the Opposition whether they have forgotten the years of Marshall Clarke, when he then Minister, Mr. Paul Sauer, had to buy out Mr. Marshall Clarke&#x2019;s contract of service in order to dismiss him from the Railways, and had to appoint a grievances commission? Have they forgotten those days? If that piece of history was written into my book, then I would have destroyed that book; I would not want to possess something like that. This is only one of the many things of which we can remind hon. members on that side, and then they come along here and want to throw mud at a Minister and a general manager who has served the country in general. I am speaking here as a farmer in one of the major farmers&#x2019; constituencies in the country, and I know how they feel. Even supporters of the United Party admit that, and then they create a great deal of noise here and try to tell the world and the gallery over there that a great deal of dissatisfaction exists. They also forget that the railwayman has passed judgment against them in one election after the other; they now try to tell railwaymen that the increase in wages granted to them was a political decoy. Sir, that is foolishness; that is childishness. They know as well as we do that those increases <span class="col_817-818" refersTo="page_0419"/>in wages cannot be calculated overnight. One is dealing with expenditure amounting to millions of rands; one has to take the tariff rates into consideration, and increases in salaries can only be granted very judiciously so that we on this side and members on that side will at all times be able to justify and defend them. Now on the eve of the election they try to tell railwaymen that their increases were political bait and that the Minister granted them in an endeavour to catch votes. They know very well that that is not true and they know very well that the railwaymen will not believe that. The judgment passed by the Railway vote on 30 March will confirm that.</p>

<p>Another accusation made here was in connection with accidents. I have never heard anything as ridiculous from grown men as I heard in this instance. If one takes the fact into account that more than 200,000 people are employed on the Railways, White and non-White, then the low incidence of accidents is a blessing. In relation to the number of workers the number of accidents is minimal, but nevertheless railwaymen are told that their lives are endangered recklessly, that they are maimed and killed and that the Minister and the Management are to blame.</p>

<p>Take the question of appeals about which the Opposition have also made a great deal of noise. What is the position in this connection? How many appeals were there and how many succeeded? That is the test. The number of appeals rejected proves that those complaints were unjustified. Hon. members cannot possibly doubt the judgment of the Railways Appeal Board. That would be an injustice to the Board, but that is exactly what the Opposition does here in public and then they lay claim to the support of the railwaymen. Take for instance the question of the 100 per cent housing loan on the Railways. Two or three years ago they accused the Minister of having made that concession to the railwaymen as a result of pressure exercised by them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have said that there is nothing more to be said. I just want to say that as far as my constituency is concerned, I do not know of a single railwayman who is dissatisfied or unhappy. ’We know that they work hard; they work overtime. The country appreciates that and this House should have particular appreciation for that. This House is the place to educate the nation to be appreciative, but also in this respect the Opposition has failed hopelessly. The railwaymen work hard; we know they are conscientious. I have a strong Railway community at Coligny. The Minister and the General Manager are familiar with conditions there. Everything is in order at Coligny and there is satisfaction. Our railwaymen will do their duty and I want to add that many of them have told me that they appreciate the increase in their wages.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to express my appreciation here for what the Administration has done at the pretty rural village of Coligny. A number of years ago its buildings were very obsolete. That too was a legacy of the United Party. We went to work there and we have created utopian conditions. In passing I just want to tell the Minister and the General Manager that the dam which they have had constructed there for us is almost full. This must be good news for them. We have experienced difficult years there in supplying water to the Railway community. A beautiful dam has now been constructed there. Of course, we still do not know what it will look like once it is full, but it will probably be full one of these days, and then we are going to put a boat in the water and invite the Minister and the General Manager to join us in water sports.</p>

<p>Just before I sit down I want to bring one matter to the attention of the Minister and the General Manager, a matter in respect of which I have made representations before. As a result of the new delimitation, the railway station of Syferbult, now falls in my constituency. The hon. member for Ventersdorp, (Mr. J. C. Greyling) in whose constituency it used to fall, has made representations in regard to the station, and public bodies have made representations to the Administration. The station building there are obsolete; they are nearly as old as the mountains and they really are a disgrace to the community which uses that railway service. I want to bring this matter to the serious attention of the Minister and the General Manager, and I want to express the hope that they will build us a station there which will be as beautiful as the station at Lichtenburg.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down said at one stage that he had nothing more to say. Having listened to his speech I would like to know whether he has said anything at all that will be of any assistance to the railwaymen. He did thank the Railway Department for building a dam and he said that the dam was nearly full. The railwaymen, of course, will notice too that in extending an invitation to officials to come and make use of the dam and enjoy themselves on the dam, he only extended the invitation to the Minister and the General Manager. The ordinary railwayman, on whose vote he has to rely, is not even considered in extending an invitation to people to come and enjoy the pleasures of the dam! The hon. member said that the United Party in this debate had put up an attack which did not impress him at all. I would like to ask that member and any other member which member on the Government benches got up and criticized the Department in any way for its treatment of the officials. Do they all pretend that the railwaymen are so happy that it is not necessary for a single member on that side to put forward any complaint? According to them the railwaymen have got all they deserve; they deserve nothing more than they have been given. True, they paid tribute to the railwaymen for the hard work they do and for their loyalty to the Department but they have not put forward a single plea in the interests of the railwaymen. Sir, hon. members on this side of the House have made appeals on behalf <span class="col_819-820" refersTo="page_0420"/>of the railwaymen. If hon. members opposite knew anything about the complaints of railwaymen, they would know that a great injustice is being done to them especially in one part of the country and that is in the Transkei. Not one of them knows what is happening there. Let them go down there and find out whether the railwaymen there are satisfied. Sir, in 1963 the Transkei Constitution Act was passed here and self-government was given to the Transkei. In furtherance of its policy the Government seconded hundreds of White officials to assist the Transkeian Government in the administration of the Territory. The majority of these officials were brought in from outside of the Transkei; they were completely unfamiliar with conditions there. There were other Government officials in the Transkei&#x2014;policemen, post office officials and railwaymen. They had been in the Transkei before; they were old Transkeians. Many of them had bought their homes in the Transkei. They were working in the Transkei and performed just as essential tasks as the other officials who have now been seconded to the Transkeian Government and brought in from outside. While we all agree that the White Government officials who had been brought into the Transkei are needed to help with the administration of the Territory to avoid chaos, we say that these other officials who have been seconded are just as necessary. No matter how efficient the Department of Bantu Administration may be, and no matter how efficient these officials who have been seconded may be, without the railways and without communications there would be chaos in the Transkei but those officials in the Railway Department have been excluded from the special benefits which have been given to the other White officials who have been seconded to the Transkeian Government. These old officials have been there for years. The seconded officials are given special allowances; they are given territorial and housing allowances, not small allowances. They get a territorial allowance of between R20 and R40 per month, depending on their grade. They get a rent allowance of between R33.5O and R45 per month. Those members using Government houses are given a reduction of 80 per cent in their rental. Sir. how do the Railway officials feel about it? Admittedly they have not been seconded to the Transkeian Government; they are still working for the Government of the Republic. Without them business would come to a standstill. Those men are living, in many cases, under worse conditions than the officials who have been seconded. The officials who have been seconded have had houses provided for them. The Government has bought houses for them, but these railwaymen do not get that. Some of them have had to buy their own houses. Some of them are living in isolated spots. The majority of the seconded officials are living in the towns and the villages, near schools and hospitals; the railwaymen are living at sidings out in the country, away from civilization, isolated by themselves. They do not get these allowances. Sir, I say it is quite unfair to allow these men to work there under those conditions. Surely all civil servants in the Transkei&#x2014;post office officials, police and railway officials&#x2014;should be placed on the same footing. A lot of ill-feeling is caused amongst these other Government officials who are not getting the allowances which are being paid to the officials of the Department of Bantu Administration. I have made an appeal to this Minister before to give his officials these additional allowances. I understand that these allowances are being paid in South West Africa where a territorial allowance is paid. Those officials are working for the South African Government. Why cannot they get the territorial allowance in the Transkei? I ask the hon. the Minister to remember that these people do not always live in big towns. Some of them are living in isolated spots. They have to endure hardships; they have children to educate; they have to send their children to boarding school; some of them have bought houses in the villages and the towns which have now been zoned Black. They do not know what the future holds in store for them. They do not know how they will be able to dispose of their properties. They have not been told by the Government yet whether they are going to be paid compensation or not. With the zoning of Umtata, for instance, a large number of houses now occupied by railway officials are being zoned in the Black area. I want to ask the Minister whether his Department is giving this matter consideration and whether they are going to furnish these railwaymen in the villages with separate railway houses in the White area? I ask the Minister to give this matter his serious consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) says that the railwaymen are very dissatisfied. I want to concede at once that there are persons who leave the Railway Service for reasons which I shall indicate in a moment, but in general the railwaymen of South Africa are satisfied to-day. We all have large numbers of railwaymen in our constituencies, and we can speak from experience. We deal with the affairs of those people day after day. It is highly improbable that in so large an organization one will not find one single dissatisfied person, but a general statement that the railwaymen as such are dissatisfied is very far from the truth. On the whole one can say that our railwaymen are very satisfied under the present Government, with this Minister and with the Administration under which they fall to-day. As a matter of fact, that is proved by what the railwaymen have achieved during the past year. There is a shortage of staff, but we nevertheless find that with a smaller staff the Railways have broken all records of previous years&#x2014;and with a dissatisfied staff one cannot succeed in doing that. The Opposition are merely trying to use this Railway debate for political gain. They are now suddenly posing as persons who bear the railwaymen&#x2019;s interests <span class="col_821-822" refersTo="page_0421"/>at heart. They are posing here as the greatest friends of the railwaymen, but we know that it only happens before elections that they suddenly become the great friends of the railwaymen. They know that they can make a large number of irresponsible promises here which they will never be called upon to carry out. The Government has displayed the very greatest responsibility as regards taking into consideration the requests made by the railway workers, and as a result the railwaymen have been granted increases from time to time. I say that the United Party, in pleading here to-day for larger concessions to be made to the railwaymen, are most certainly doing so with ulterior motives&#x2014;they are doing so for political gain.</p>

<p>If we look at the General Manager&#x2019;s report for the period ended 31 March 1965 it gives us an idea of the importance of the Railways and of the expansion which has taken place over the past year. It also shows that the South African Railways have kept pace with the general development of our country. If we look at the revenue we find that of a revenue of R526.000,000 no less than 43.6 per cent was spent on wages. That in itself indicates what a large percentage of the total revenue is spent on Railway wages, and that the Government has done its duty as regards granting the railway worker his fair share. This amount of R233,000,000 which is placed in the hands of the railway worker gives him large buying power, which in turn has a wholesome effect on the South African economy. In the year 1948 the total amount spent on wages was only R89.000,000, as compared with R233,000,000 in 1964-5. In 1948 the average income of a railwayman was only R910 per annum, as compared with an average of R2,029 in 1964. That represents an increase of 122 per cent, whereas the increase in wages for the factory worker was only 83 per cent, and the cost of living increased by 65 per cent in the same period. That shows that the position of the railway worker is more favourable than it was when we took over.</p>

<p>Our Railways began in a very modest way, more than 100 years ago. We call to mind the difficult times when railways were built in the Northern Transvaal and how the people died in those malaria-stricken areas, how they risked their lives. To-day the Railways has developed to one of the finest undertakings in this country, an undertaking of which all of us are proud. To-day our railway workers are also proud of the undertaking in which they are employed. That is the reason for the success which is being achieved in the Railways. That is why the Railways are able to handle larger tonnages. The policy of the Minister and the Administration is that the railwayman should get his fair share, because a satisfied official gives better service. In this connection I want to appeal to the Minister to continue looking after the interests of our railway workers in a fatherly way, because they are people who perform important work for this country. They are people who are prepared to work over-time for very long hours in the interests of the economy of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that certain persons retire at the age of 55 years. I am thinking of railway drivers in particular. I recently found that some of those people would like to re-enter the service. They say that it is not easy for them to be placed in employment, while there is said to be a large shortage of Railway staff. I should like to bring this point to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice.</p>

<p>Another point that I want to make is in connection with the tariffs in respect of the products of the farming community. I think the Minister should pay special attention to that in the future, so that our farmers, particularly in the drought-stricken areas, will not be burdened with extra tariffs for the conveyance of their products. I am in close contact with those farmers, and I know what difficult times they are experiencing. I want to appeal to the Minister to take steps in the future to see to it that the tariffs in respect of our farmers are not increased unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to refer to a few observations made by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) earlier in the debate. In his speech to-day he surpassed the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) with his jeremiads. He mentioned the resignations from the Railways as allegedly taking place as a result of dissatisfaction. I have partly dealt with this matter, (but is it not a sign of the general growth in the economic conditions in this country that when people resign from the service of the Railways they can be placed in employment elsewhere? That is one of the reasons for people resigning from the Railways. They are perhaps called upon to do night duty in the Railways, and can get a position elsewhere in which they need not do night duty. There are various reasons for their resigning, but one of the main reasons is the very fact that economic conditions in the Republic are better than they have ever been before. In other words, these people can be placed in good positions elsewhere.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to more than 700 Railway houses allegedly standing empty. The hon. member is being wilful. It may be that there are Railway houses standing empty at outlying stations here and there, but surely he knows that as a result of planning and electrification certain stations are becoming less important and others more important? As a result of electrification it happens, for example, that at places where locomotives were previously used the people who worked in the locos leave. The houses occupied by those people then stand empty. But, as I have said, the hon. member is merely being wilful. He referred to accidents, and then blamed the railway worker for the fact that there were so many accidents occurring in the country.</p>

<p>Who has to see to that? The Administration has certain measures, and there are persons in the Railways who provide first-aid services and attend to that type of thing. He did not blame the Minister, but blamed the railway worker, who has to take the necessary precautionary measures and carry out the instructions issued to him. He also referred to the ratio between White and non-White staff. He is trying to suggest to the electorate that it is the policy of the Minister to dismiss Whites and to appoint non-Whites in their stead. Surely he knows that that is not true? The Minister has found it difficult to recruit sufficient staff, and we know that non-Whites have in fact been employed in certain posts. The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) said a moment ago that he welcomed the fact that non-Whites had been appointed in certain posts, because he could not see why it was necessary to appoint Whites in those posts. The Minister has not been able to fill the large number of vacancies in the Railways. Even if there has been an increase in the number of non-Whites, it was not the intention to replace the Whites. As a result of the expansion which has taken place in the Railways, it has been necessary to fill certain of the posts with Bantu.</p>

<p>I should like the Minister to tell us what progress has been made with the link-up of the Rhodesian railway line. This is a subject which I have spoken about on various occasions in this House. Does the Minister expect that our trade with our neighbouring state will increase considerably? It was recently stated in the Press that the Minister was to have an interview with the Rhodesian Minister of Transport. I should like to hear what progress has been made in that regard, because that link-up is of the utmost importance to us and to that country as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to avail myself of this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the Management of the South African Railways. I have had dealings with them in connection with a large number of matters over the past five years, and I can testify that my association with them has been an extremely pleasant one and that I have received the most courteous treatment from them. I want to thank them very sincerely for that.</p>

<p>The last speaker got so confused over the issues that we have been discussing. that if I were to try to put these matters straight, it would leave me no time for my own speech. For instance, he accused the hon. member for Orange Grove of blaming the rail waymen for the accidents. The hon. member did nothing of the sort. He indicated quite clearly that the safety regulations seemed to be at fault. He never said that the railwaymen themselves were the responsible bodies. He also spoke about the wage increases. We have heard a great many estimates and guesstimates and, I think, a very few authoritative statements on what the relative position is in regard to the purchasing power of wages in 1948 as against the purchasing power to-day. I think the guides that we should accept&#x2014;they are not 100 per cent correct, but they are more reliable than calculations that are made&#x2014;are the figures that are obtainable in General Managers&#x2019; reports. I find that in 1948 49.76 per cent of all earnings were paid out for labour. In the report just issued by the General Manager that figure has dropped to 43.66 per cent.</p>

<p>What does that prove?</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>It proves that the allegation that the wages of railwaymen in 1948 were out of proportion to the earnings of the railways is completely wrong. These figures show that in 1948 railwaymen were receiving a bigger percentage of the railway earnings as wages than they are to-day.</p>

<p>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, we can use figures whichever way we like. The test is: What is the actual purchasing power of money to-day as compared with what it was in 1948? One does not have to go to General Managers&#x2019; reports for that. One has to go to the homes of the railway workers themselves, and ask the wives. Those of us who have railwaymen in our constituencies have done just that and we know that to-day the purchasing power of money is so much less than it was in 1948 that although they may be getting a great deal more in actual money, they are not able to purchase as much as they were able to in 1948. That is, I think, the truth of the matter, and to try to argue by way of calculation and giving figures to this House, which can be misleading to the uninformed, is not of great assistance to the Minister in his attempts to meet the problems that face the Railways.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had one theme going right through this debate. I think it is understandable that that should be the case, because of the manpower position in the Railways and because of the election which is to take place next month. Normally we should have discussed the manpower problem in the way in which we have discussed it in former years. But this year, because of the pending election, an issue has been brought in to try to confuse the electorate as to what the policy of the United Party is in the employment of persons in the S.A.R and H., and what the policy of the Government is. Before I deal with this question, I should like to say that I believe there is also another factor that has to be brought to the attention of hon. members. I think we should go back to a report that <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0423"/>was published by the General Manager in 1945. It makes some very interesting reading, and the portion which I am going to commend to hon. members, particularly on the other side, is the postwar plan of the United Party Government. I am just going to take one or two items to indicate their significance to-day. The first has to do with the question of electrification&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principal item is the electrification from Bellville to Touws River, a distance of 149 miles, to permit electric haulage of trains between Cape Town and Touws River, which includes the difficult Hex River Mountain section.</block>

<p>The second item deals with the provision of Railway facilities to serve Native townships. Anyone listening to debates in this House over the last few years will imagine that the whole of the Native housing development around our large cities was something planned by the present Government. What do we find in 1945?</p>

<block name="quote">With the object of providing better housing conditions for Natives, several of the larger municipalities have established or plan to establish new Native townships at a suitable distance from the city, at which all Natives in the municipal area would reside, and several requests have been received by the Administration for the provision of Railway facilities to serve such townships.</block>

<p>This was in 1945, Mr. Speaker. Another item deals with the provision of airports:</p>

<block name="quote">Good progress is being made with the provision of major airport facilities in the Union, which will comprise one pf international type in the Pretoria-Johannesburg area and two national aerodromes situated at Cape Town and Durban, respectively.</block>

<p>This happened 21 years ago. Anyone coming to this country to-day and listening to debates in this House would imagine that all these things have come about as a result of the planning of this Government. And yet the proof is here in reports of the General Managers&#x2019;, indicating what was on the go as far back as 1945. In the same report there is an item dealing with the establishment of a central training institute&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During 1938 a Departmental committee was appointed to enquire specially into matters affecting the training of staff. The committee recommended, among other matters, that a Central Training Institute should be established in the vicinity of Johannesburg. The recommendation was accepted by the Government and the details worked out early in 1940.</block>

<p>If you look at later reports you will find how very valuable Esselen Park has become in the training of manpower for the Railways. I mention this, because it is necessary to get a background.</p>

<p>One issue, which I have not yet mentioned, and which has particular significance in relation to the manpower problem, is that in 1942 the United Party, under the guidance of the hon. member for Turffontein at the time (Mr. F. C. Sturrock), introduced the Staff Associations Identity of Interest principle. In other words, he brought about the recognition of Identity of Interest as far as the railways staff was concerned, which recognized the trade union principle and brought about the recognition of railway staff associations as trade unions. The Minister may say: What has that got to do with the present position? I shall tell him. Without this development in 1942 and the subsequent tremendous increase in the number of railway workers who became members of the staff associations, and without the development of the trade unions, the method used by the Minister in meeting the manpower shortage to-day would not have been possible. I shall deal with this matter as I go along.</p>

<p>When I listen to the hon. members on the other side dealing with the manpower question, I ask myself: Who are they trying to help? Are they trying to help the Minister? Are they trying to put the United Party in a spot? The truth of the matter is that the members on the Government side who are dealing with this problem of the manpower shortage are doing a disservice to the Minister and a disservice to this country, because the fact is that the Minister either has to employ non-Europeans in the Railways, or he has to curtail his services. That is the simple choice. Any steps that the Minister takes in the direction of maintaining a proper Railway service as far as manpower is concerned, should be looked at very carefully by members of his own side before they start making the type of speeches they have made to-day. This matter has been dealt with by so many speakers on the other side, and the majority <span class="col_827-828" refersTo="page_0424"/>of them have tried to interpret job reservation, the colour bar and all that in such a way as to make out that the United Party policy is wrong and that the policy that they consider that they support on the other side is right. It is necessary, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, to get the record straight, so that you will know exactly what is happening. I know the Chief Whip on the other side is particularly interested in this question because he has listened to some of the speeches of his own members and he has shaken his head. He realizes that it might be good political stuff, but he also knows that it is far from the truth.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with this question of a traditional colour bar and job reservation. I want to say right away that in terms of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, which deals with safeguards against inter-racial competition, generally known as job reservation or work reservation, we have for the first time in our legislation, measures to deal with interracial competition other than the traditional method, namely negotiation between employers and employees.</p>

<p>Yes, but what was the position under the Mines and Works Act? There it was a question of negotiation between the employer and the employee. But interference by the Government led to all sorts of difficulties last year. I admit that the Mines and Works Act did lay down a colour bar, but I am dealing now with the introduction into the Industrial Conciliation Act of section 77, which does not apply to the mines. The Minister will remember that the mines were specifically excluded from the provisions of section 77. I am dealing with the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act which gave rise to the term &#x201C;job reservation.&#x201D; I am dealing with it because the Government members have, I believe deliberately, gone out of their way to link job reservation and the traditional colour bar as one and the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with job reservation in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>But you said it is the first time that there has been a legislative colour bar.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was brought into the Industrial Conciliation Act. It may have exis ted in other Acts, but as far as the Industrial Conciliation Act is concerned, this was the first time it was introduced. That is the point I am making.</p>

<p>The second point is that section 2 of the Industrial Conciliation Act specifically excludes the South African Railways and Harbours from the provisions of section 77, which deals with job reservation. We therefore have the position that job reservation as it is generally known does not apply in the S.A.R. What we have there is the traditional colour bar, controlled without legislation. The question that next arises is: How has the traditional colour bar been maintained in the Railways over the years? I mentioned earlier that the United Party had in 1942 introduced the principle of identity of interest, under which staff associations were able to register as trade unions under the Industrial Conciliation Act. The staff were divided into groups on the basis of identity of interest. It was this principle which brought about a tremendous increase in the membership of the trade unions or staff associations as they are to-day referred to. The membership increased to 58 per cent in the three years from the inception of the scheme in 1942. I mention this point because it is important. Without the strong representation of staff associations in the Railways the Minister would not be in a position to negotiate as he has done in respect of the employment of non-Whites in the Railways. To-day the membership is&#x2014;I speak subject to correction&#x2014;in the neighbourhood of 85 per cent. The staff associations therefore have developed from this recognition in 1942 to the position where all the staff, with the exception of about 15 per cent, are represented by recognized trade unions or staff associations. Last year and in former years we pleaded with this Minister to utilize this machinery to overcome his manpower difficulties. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that when we suggested this method to him last year, the Minister said: What if they will not negotiate? What did we tell him? Try them and see, and if you do not succeed, then it will be better if you resign and let us try, rather than have curtailment of the industrial expansion as far as the Railways are concerned. You know, as a matter of history, Mr. Speaker, that the Minister did approach the staff associations and he did agree to &#x2026;</p>

<p>Not all of them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>No, but he did get agreement for the utilization of non-European labour in positions formerly held by Whites. This is why I say that members on the Government side are not doing the Minister a good service when they criticize the employment of non-Europeans in the Railways, not because it is a matter of policy, but because there are no Whites to do the work</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove criticized that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from><span class="col_829-830" refersTo="page_0425"/>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>He is one&#x2014;I did not hear that criticism&#x2014;as against at least eight members on the other side. The point I want to make is that over the years there has been roughly speaking one non-White to every White employed in the Railways. That has been the pattern. What is happening to-day? The Minister is unable to recruit the necessary number of Whites to do the work.</p>

<p>It is in this respect that we have had these most amazing statements made by the hon. member for Bethlehem. And, Mr. Speaker, you will no doubt have noticed that most of this criticism has come from hon. members representing O.F.S. constituencies. What difficulties in the labour field can they speak of? The members for Transvaal constituencies have not said much, and hon. members for Natal constituencies have not taken part in the debate. Hon. members from Cape Province constituencies have not referred to this matter to the same extent as the O.F.S. members have. I just mention this in passing.</p>

<p>Then we also had the cry: &#x201C;what about the rate for the job?&#x201D; I do not understand why there should be this confusion. I want to say that where there are workers of all races with equal skill who are subject to industrial council agreements laying down different rates of pay on racial basis, inter-racial competition becomes possible and the rate for the job principle applies. Now, this is not possible on the Railways because the hon. the Minister by means of negotiation sets the wage pattern. Because of the identity of interests principle there is only one staff association representing those people engaged in doing the same type of work. There is only one staff association with which to negotiate when it becomes necessary to introduce other than traditional labour patterns in the service. The hon. the Minister has to choose between sufficient manpower and the curtailment of services, notwithstanding the working of excessive overtime. As I said earlier on that is the choice that has to be made. And in meeting this challenge the hon. the Minister will have to fall in line with outside industry. The day before yesterday the Chairman of the Artisan Staff Association, Mr. Liebenberg&#x2014;who also happens to be the President of the Federation of Trade Unions, a very strong organization in this country&#x2014; indicated quite clearly that we will have to recognize that there is no alternative but to utilize non-European labour if we want to maintain our industrial expansion. There is no alternative, Sir. We will have to get down to providing the necessary machinery to enable the White workers to be protected as in the past, and at the same time allowing non-Europeans to be used. And what has happened in the building industry in the Transvaal is a forerunner of what will have to happen throughout the country. In the Transvaal an agreement has been entered into between the building workers&#x2019; trade union on the one hand and the employers on the other. I understand the hon. the Minister has signed the agreement, and it has in fact been gazetted. Considerable numbers of non-Europeans are now going to be employed on work traditionally done by Whites. The reason therefore is not because the employers do not want to use the Whites, but because they cannot obtain Whites to do the work. And if the Minister is prepared to take these steps, why should he be criticized by hon. members on that side? Why should his own side say to hon. members on this side of the House that we are on the wrong track? As I said, the hon. the Minister is using the machinery which forms part of the policy of the United Party, a policy we have had for years and years. Why, Sir, is this bogey being introduced? I think I know why. I think it is specifically because of the election to be held next month. Why will hon. members on that side not face up to the truth and say to Railwaymen, &#x201C;We cannot continue to run the Railways efficiently and properly unless we obtain a considerable number of White workers.&#x201D; I should like to remind the hon. the Minister that when he was Minister of Labour and I raised this issue with him many years ago as to what he was going to do if he failed to obtain sufficient White workers to do traditional White work, his reply to me was: &#x201C;Immigration.&#x201D; This Government at that time did not have an immigration policy, because they did not want White immigrants. The story being told at that time was that the United Party was in favour of immigration because we wanted to plough under the Afrikaner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you wanted to plough under the Afrikaner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>We did not say so. Propagandists on the Government side said so. But that no longer applies because the Government either has to get immigrants or it will have to make use of the services of non-Whites. That is the position that has developed. That is why 1 feel that the greatest disservice that Government members can do is to criticize the latest development in this field, a development which has taken place as of necessity. I believe they would be doing South Africa a big service if they were to explain to railwaymen and others throughout the country why it has become necessary for the hon. the Minister to take this step. They should cease blaming the United Party for the fact that more and more non-Whites are being employed on the Railways.</p>

<p>Before I resume my seat I should like to refer to one or two things which, if not attended to at an early date, will, I believe, cause difficulty in the Durban area. I am namely referring to the position obtaining at Rossburgh station. The hon. the Minister no doubt knows that Rossburgh serves the equivalent of some three or four constituencies. And yet not one of his main-line trains stops at Rossburgh station. Rossburgh is to Durban what Bellville is to Cape Town, or Germiston is to Johannesburg. I believe it will be to the advantage of all the residents and all the workers in these areas if <span class="col_831-832" refersTo="page_0426"/>the Minister were to take urgent steps to make Rossburgh a compulsory stopping place for all the principal main-line trains, particularly once he gets his new station at Greyville. I think the hon. the Minister must go into this matter at an early date, because it will require careful planning. Linked thereto is the greater utilization of the suburban services in that area now that the quadrupling of the lines between Durban and Booth has been completed. A former Mayor of Durban said that the Minister would expect the Durban Municipality to introduce feeder services to the suburban stations once the electrification took place and the quadrupling was completed. Well, these steps have now been completed, and I feel the hon. the Minister should now say to the Durban Corporation. &#x201C;what about those feeder services being established?&#x201D;, so that the Corporation bus service will not operate in competition with the Railways suburban services. All these things are linked up with the utilization of Rossburgh as a proper station. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has two characteristics of which I am envious. I am referring to his eloquence and his wonderful imagination. When facts are lacking, when his facts are insufficient, and when he has not made a study of his case, he relies on his imagination. The hon. member talked about the excessive overtime certain members of the staff had to put in. He referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to a case of an engine driver and a fireman who worked non-stop for some 102 hours. At a later stage I shall deal with this matter again. Sir, figuratively speaking, when the hon. member&#x2019;s imagination really gets into its stride, he entirely eclipses those officials.</p>

<p>The hon. member predicted an interesting debate. Well, there were certain matters I really found interesting. For instance, I found it very interesting to see how the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. Van Rensburg) bullied the hon. member. It was also interesting to see how the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) demolished him. Apart from that I must say that part of his speech really sounded like a James Bond thriller. I am referring to his mine dump story. He secretly scaled a mine dump near Angelo in order to have a better view of his surroundings from there. I do not know whether this was in day-time or at night, because the hon. member did not say. But apparently he scaled the mine dump from the back and eventually he reached the top. And. Sir. these mine dumps are quite high. It requires considerable effort on the part of the person who scales them; consequently it causes a reasonable amount of fatigue.</p>

<p>He probably drove up in one of those cars.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is indeed a possibility, but I do not believe that the hon. member drove up. The hon. member wanted to make a sacrifice, he wanted to struggle to show that he was doing his duty. At any rate, the hon. member reached the summit of the high mine dump and from there he spied on Angelo. And what did the hon. member see? He saw how a few shunters ran in order to apply the brakes of moving trucks. He also saw something which he had apparently never heard of before, namely, &#x201C;fly shunting&#x201D;. The hon. member alleged that in doing that those people were breaking Railway regulations. From the summit of the mine dump he also saw 300 trucks&#x2014;he counted them all&#x2014;standing in the railway site. He alleges that only five of those 300 trucks moved in the half-hour he spent on the summit of that mine dump. Well, Mr. Speaker, if &#x201C;fly shunting&#x201D; had taken place there, and only five trucks moved in the period of half an hour, the General Manager will have to go into the matter. I do not know precisely what happened there. I do not know whether they have perhaps been moving the same trucks to and fro. At any rate, that is what the hon. member supposedly saw there. And now he maintains that that is a sign of the ineffectiveness of the Railways because, so the member says, he was there last year, too. He was at Angelo and also at two other sites. The hon. member says that last year he visited a certain site where he counted 40 trains which were stationary and waiting to enter the site. I do not know how far the member could see on that occasion. Apparently he did not have the use of a mine dump to be able to see that 40 trains were standing one behind the other for miles on end. He must have been able to see for quite a number of miles in order to see all of the 40 trains he counted as they were standing there, waiting. Mr. Speaker, is it not pathetic that the hon. member should come out with such stories, with such arguments?</p>

<p>I should like to refresh the hon. member&#x2019;s memory by reading to him what he said in this regard. However, the hon. member talks so much nonsense that he does not like to remember what he said on previous occasions. The hon. member for Heilbron also referred to the stories the hon. member spread last year about all the stationary trains and trucks he saw, a story he repeated this year. It is, of course, a paucity of facts, a lack of something to say.</p>

<p>At any rate, the hon. member was not satisfied with merely looking at what was happening at Angelo. He sent a friend of his to Content and Poupan. This friend had to see what was happening on the Railways. The hon. member told the House what his friend had seen there, and I want to quote his speech now. He said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Recently I asked a friend of mine to look at the notes on the trucks at Park Station.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is a mistake of Hansard&#x2019;s. I said a few stations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I assume that is what the hon. member actually said. In any case, I am <span class="col_833-834" refersTo="page_0427"/>not making a point of that. What follows is really the point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He told me that he had noticed two things. At Content, near Kimberley, there were no fewer than fourteen trucks loaded with factory coal which had been standing at Content for ten days. They did not move, they were stationary.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member&#x2019;s friend went to Poupan. I do not know whether hon. members know where Content and Poupan are situated. Content is a small station situated beyond Warrenton and Poupan is an even smaller station situated between Kimberley and De Aar These two places were selected&#x2014;why, I shall never know&#x2014;in order to observe how badly the Railways are functioning. At Content the hon. member&#x2019;s friend saw fourteen trucks which had been standing there for ten days. He probably remained there for ten days in order to see how long they stood there. But at Poupan conditions were even worse. According to his friend&#x2019;s observation no fewer than thirty-five empty trucks had been standing there for an entire month. Yes, they were empty and there were manganese mines nearby! Well, at least the hon. member sacrificed a great deal to travel so far in order to see how badly the Railways handle their traffic. But the member also said other things in his speech. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is an important point that the trucks travel for an average of 8.39 days, but they cover less than three miles a day.</block>

<p>That is some 26 miles in all. In other words, the hon. member wants to suggest that all the trucks on the Railways do not travel further than 26 miles. He spoke of 8.39 days and they cover only three miles a day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is what the General Manager said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the General Manager said that the turnround time of the trucks was 8.39 days. The hon. member did not read correctly. It is typical of that member. The hon. member does not make a study of his case. [Interjections.] Every year I wait for the hon. member to put up a better performance, but instead of doing better, his performance becomes worse every year. The hon. member thinks that he can get away with it as a result of his eloquence and his vivid imagination&#x2014; &#x201C;he thinks he can get away with it,&#x201D; as the English say. If fourteen trucks had in fact been standing at Content and thirty at Poupan, and if it were true that all these thousands of trucks of the Railways merely covered three miles per day and travelled for 8.39 days, would that have been evidence of ineffectiveness? Is it a sign of ineffectiveness when the Railways transport 100 million tons of goods a year?</p>

<p>The hon. member and other members also maintained that winter after winter the Rail ways have not been able to do their work. The Railways can supposedly not provide for the wants of the public. There, too, the hon. member talked a great deal of nonsense. One of the hon. members alleged that for six consecutive years there had been coal shortages. Is that not the greatest trash ever? Because, Sir, there simply were no coal shortages. The newspapers blew up the situation and predicted that there would be shortages. But nobody had a shortage. Despite the predictions of the hon. members on the opposite side, not a single power station came to a standstill.</p>

<p>The hon. member also dealt with the application of the disciplinary code on the Railways. He attacked it and said that something was radically wrong. He then quoted a few examples. I shall now deal with his examples. I do this in order to show how faulty the hon. member&#x2019;s facts are. Often he has no facts at all. Then he wants to try to get away with it by making use of his imagination and his eloquence. The hon. member is under the impression that he is addressing a lot of U.P. supporters in a faraway hamlet where they believe everything he tells them. He often forgets that he is speaking in the House and that even the people of Poupan will not believe him. When the hon. member speaks in this House, he must bear in mind that the House requires facts of him.</p>

<p>I want to refer to a few instances now and I quote from his speech again. He spoke, <i>inter alia,</i> of alcoholics who were in the employ of the Administration. He complained of the inexplicable manner in which discipline was applied on the Railways. One would be able to write volumes on that, according to the hon. member. Well, I think if the hon. member had confined himself to writing books instead of making speeches, he would have had a far better and larger audience. In any case, the member said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Take for instance the case of alcoholics. It seems to be the Government&#x2019;s policy that if a man drinks too much and becomes a problem, he has to resign on half his pension. But recently a case was brought to my attention of a stationmaster with more than twenty years&#x2019; service. One of the members of his staff had made a mistake &#x2026; and that man was dismissed.</block>

<p>Apparently the stationmaster was dismissed because one of the members of his staff had made a mistake. I do not know what that mistake was. I do not know whether the stationmaster drank, or whether he was an alcoholic,, because the hon. member referred to alcoholics. He said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I feel like taking this case to the Minister and asking him to make further investigations, because something is wrong here.</block>

<p>Well, something is decidedly wrong with the hon. member&#x2019;s statement. There is something seriously wrong. It is a pity that the hon. <span class="col_835-836" refersTo="page_0428"/>member did not give me this case, because I have really not been able to trace such a case. He also quoted other cases to show how wrong the application of the disciplinary code was. He said that there were people who had to be transferred and who refused to accept transfer. According to him the Minister could have applied Section 13 of the Act of 1960, but he did not. This section provides that when a man is dismissed, not having been guilty of dishonesty, it can be decided that instead of paying out his pension, he will be given an annuity. The hon. member maintains that this section could have been applied. I know to which case the hon. member is referring. Once again he has not made certain of his facts. I do not want to mention the name of the person concerned unless I am compelled to do so. The person concerned was a clerk who was dismissed because he refused to accept a transfer. However, that was merely the technical reason. The truth of the matter is that this clerk was running a large &#x201C;call-girl&#x201D; organization in the head office. He used certain prostitutes. For this reason this clerk did not receive an annuity. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is a pity that the hon. member did not even take the trouble to verify his facts. That is all that is necessary. He merely had to put a single question to me before he made his speech, because I really want to set him right. I really want the hon. member to make sensible and proper speeches during the discussions of the Budget. I have told the hon. member in the past that if he wanted any information, an offer of which his predecessor availed himself, he should simply come to my office. I have instructed my secretary to tell the hon. member everything he wants to know. There is nothing which has to be hidden. I really do wish that the hon. member would make a decent speech. Indeed, he is the deputy leader of his party and it is expected of him to maintain a certain status, even in this respect. But he does not do that. He makes these wild allegations&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Proceeding, the hon. member said this in his speech: The point I want to make is that there are obviously no definite standards according to which discipline is being exercised in the Railways.</block>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, even as far as the courts are concerned, there is no uniformity for the same offences. However, let us leave it at that. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, I have mentioned instances of people having been severely penalized for trifles, but recently &#x2026; a senior clerk in the tourist service who dealt with overseas tours was caught appropriating large sums of Railway money for his own purposes. He was allowed to resign without any other punishment.</block>

<p>Those were the allegations of the hon. member. Once again he did not take the trouble to put his facts correctly. He did not take the trouble to obtain the correct information. What is the real position? I had this case traced. It appeared that a senior clerk who acted as companion on a train tour, had allowed his wife, his brother-in-law and the latter&#x2019;s girl friend, all of whom had no tickets, to accompany him on that journey. The cost would have been R177.03. The matter was brought to light, and what happened then? He was not allowed to resign. But, as is often the case on the Railways, he himself tendered his resignation&#x2014;owing to the disciplinary charge outstanding against him-&#x2014;in order to escape those charges. That is what happened. The Management did not dismiss him. He himself resigned before any disciplinary charges could be laid against him. He was asked for an explanation, he admitted the irregularities and he was suspended immediately. But he tendered his resignation simultaneously. That is the normal procedure. It often happens that an official resigns when disciplinary charges are pending against him. And these are the charges the member quoted as if to show how ineffective and how poor the application of the disciplinary code is.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member talked about the wages of railway officials. And what statements did he make in this regard? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no doubt whatsoever that as far as the Railways staff and the Public Service staff in general is concerned. South Africa has fallen behind other civilized countries &#x2026;</block>

<p>And what proof does he adduce to corroborate this statement? He mentioned pensions without the means test&#x2014;which is found in other countries, <span class="col_837-838" refersTo="page_0429"/>in Britain, for instance&#x2014;and free medical services. He also referred to other advantages of a welfare state. But our Railway people also receive pensions. It may be a contributory pension scheme, but it is there. But will a man come to us because he will receive an old-age pension, to which he has not contributed, for nothing? Such are the absurdities the hon. member perpetrates. He condemns South Africa&#x2019;s general standards in this regard, he condemns the wage structure. I have been abroad, and I can inform the hon. member that in the countries I visited, the position is such&#x2014;except in the U.S.A, where the wage and cost structure is so much higher&#x2014;that I am convinced that our position in this respect does not only compare well, but in many respects it is even much better and much higher.</p>

<p>No. How absurd the hon. member is! He did not make sure of his facts. I said that our attempts had failed, not because we could not get hold of the people, but because the people did not come up to expectations. We appointed more than 100 shunters, but when they saw what the nature of the work was&#x2014;because over there they had no experience of shunting and they had to be trained here&#x2014;they did not see their way clear to doing the work. They received good treatment, but the nature of the work was too much for them. They deserted one after the other.</p>

<p>The hon. member also alleged that the shunters&#x2019; allowance of 50 cents had been taken away. But that is not the case. It was consolidated with the increase they received. Instead of only 50 cents per day for every day they worked, the amount was consolidated with their increases. Where a worker previously lost that amount for every day he was absent, it is now included in his wages. He receives that amount for the entire month, which is, of course, a very great improvement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>They do not receive R20 per month as the other men do.</p>

<p>Everybody does not receive R20. The hon. member did not check that either. If he asked me for them, I should have shown him what the concessions and new wage scales are for all officials. Then he would not have talked such nonsense here.</p>

<p>In the course of his speech the hon. member also said that railwaymen were only granted relief in election years. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; if I were an employee of the State or of the Railways, I would pray for an election to be held every year, because it is only in election years that people are granted relief.</block>

<p>But what are the facts? What are the facts now? I only want to deal with the years since 1953. On 1 April, or rather, to be exact, on 15 April, 1953, there was an election, but there was an increase, an improvement of R2,200,000 in pensions and remunerations on 18 September of that year, after the election. In 1954, in June and November, there were improvements to the amount of R821,000. There was no election in that year. In November of that year there were improvements to the amount of R1,800,000. In April 1955 there were salary and wage improvements to the amount of R8.200.000, after the election and not before it. If the hon. member remembers correctly, I was threatened in 1958 with a go-slow strike by one of the staff associations if I did not grant them increases before the election, and I refused to do so. They did not go on strike then, but after the election I did in fact do it and I granted them the increases. But the hon. member alleges that this only happens in election years; in other words, it only happens before an election, as was the case last year, that increases are granted.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what should one do with a member such as this one, who says one thing one minute and a totally different thing the next? In February 1958 there were improvements again. After the election of 16 April there were improvements to the amount of R13,000,000, and that was not even an election year. So I could continue. Neither was 1964 an election year, but there were improvements to the amount of R672,000. In June of that year, after the Provincial Council elections, there were increases of R1,200,000 In July 1964, after the election, it was R773,000. In August 1964, once again long before the election, it was R710,000. In October 1964 it was R500,000. In November 1964 there was a holiday bonus of R11.000.000, That was not an election year. At that stage the election was still two years ahead. In October of last year there was an amount of R35,000,000. My reason for mentioning this, is merely to show up the hon. member&#x2019;s dearth of facts and how they use any possible thing to try to make propaganda and to benefit themselves, particularly to obtain Railway votes.</p>

<p>I want to point out another matter in the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville which hon. members will find interesting. He referred to a case where an engine driver and a fireman worked for a period of 102 hours, and in that period they only rested for six hours.</p>

<p>They were travelling from Germiston to Kroonstad and back and then to Klerksdorp. <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0430"/>Of those 96 hours they only travelled for 37 hours and they rested in the locomotives for 59 hours. Now he says, if the train has to remain stationary for hours on end, surely they could be taken off and used for other work. In the first place, I should like to know where they stood for 59 hours. If, for instance, they had been standing halfway between Johannesburg and Klerksdorp, should we have sent a motor car to take them off in order to do other work? Those are the absurdities hon. members perpetrate. And remember, that period of 59 hours during which they remained stationary, amount in actual fact to a period of two days and three nights during which they sat on the locomotive. They are super-humans! If one takes the total number of hours they supposedly worked, the 59 hours, plus the 37 hours, it means that in all the driver and the fireman spent four days and four nights on the locomotive. I do not even want to comment on that. Even members on the opposite side are able to realize how absurd it is and what trash these allegations are. It seems to me that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has made a rather unfortunate choice with the appointment of the hon. member for Yeoville as his shadow Minister of Transport. But you know, Sir, to a certain extent I have been instrumental in that. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition found himself in difficulties after the resignation of the previous member for Wynberg. I asked him one day whom he was going to appoint, and he said that he did not know. Then I said: Appoint Marais Steyn; surely he is your best man. Now I am guilty, together with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, of the fact that the hon. member for Yeoville was appointed.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with a few of the matters which were raised by some of the hon. members. Allow me to say immediately that some of the hon. members of the Opposition had constructive criticism and I shall be glad to reply to that. But some of them, did, of course, only do what was to be expected of them, and I shall deal with them briefly. Is the hon. member for Drakensberg present? No, she is not present, but I really have to reply to her speech, and therefore I shall deal with her later. The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) followed the example of the hon. member of Yeoville. If he wants to take my advice, he would not do that. He will land himself in the same wretched position. He should rather turn over a new leaf. I am now giving him paternal advice.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member touched upon two or three small matters. He says that there are only two considerations for overtime worked by the staff. Those were their loyalty and their poor wages. I agree with the first one, of course. I agree and it is with pride that I can say that railwaymen have been loyal all these years since I became Minister and since this Government came to power, and I think the previous Government can say the same of them. But he maintains that it is also due to poor wages. But does the hon. member not realize that it is a minority of the staff which works over-time? There are tens of thousands of members on the staff who never work over-time. Therefore it cannot only be as a result of poor wages, because the others never work over-time. Then there are members of the staff who work over-time, such as the engine drivers who, together with the artisans, are virtually the most highly remunerated workers on the Railways. Surely that is an absurd allegation. They do not work over-time because they like working excessive over-time. I myself do not like excessive over-time at all. If it is possible I shall cut down on over-time as much as I am able to. They do not like over-time, but they simply work because they feel that it is their duty to do so, and I admire them for that. They realize that we have a manpower shortage, and they put their shoulders to the wheel to help keep the wheels turning. That is the reason for their working such long hours. I agree that that is the reason, but under the circumstances nothing else can be done, because they put the interests of their country first and they know what will happen if a serious crisis should develop on the Railways.</p>

<p>Where must I get the people? The hon. member for maitland spoke of the labour shortage, and a few other hon. members also touched upon that matter. They asked that, in spite of the fact that the income of pensioners working for private employers exceeded the means test, they should nevertheless receive the same treatment as the pensioners who re-entered the Railway service. As far as the pensioners are concerned, there was only one reason for my making this concession to them, and that was to see whether I could move them to return to the employ of the Railways in order to alleviate the manpower shortage. That was the only reason. It was not to do them a favour or to accommodate them; it was to move them to return to my service, and for that reason I am not going to extend it to private employers, for otherwise it will be of no value to me; I want to draw those people back to the Railway service.</p>

<p>Yes, those who are physically capable and who can do a good day&#x2019;s work, and, of course, provided that there are vacancies in that particular grade. For instance, one cannot appoint as clerks pensioners who were artisans. They have no experience as clerks, and they probably do not have the qualifications. They may perhaps have Std. VIII, but they have no experience, and one cannot employ such an elderly man in a clerical post of which he has no experience.</p>

<p>The hon. member as well as the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) asked that the consumer of petrol on the Witwatersrand should obtain petrol more cheaply, because it is cheaper to transport the petrol by means of the pipeline. I have dealt with that matter previously. If I were to lose that revenue I would simply have to increase the tariffs on other commodities, because I have to obtain my revenue somewhere.</p>

<p>Because petrol is one of the commodities which can bear that, on the basis of what the traffic can bear. Petrol in South Africa is cheaper than in most countries of the world, and our people are very fortunate in being able to obtain petrol at the current price. Therefore it is out of the question that that tariff can be decreased so that there may also be a decrease in the price of petrol.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) pleaded for more study bursaries to be awarded by the Railways. That is a matter which always receives consideration.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) on a good, constructive speech. His criticism was good and deserves attention. Concerning the Airways, he touched upon matters which do not fall under this Department, because the Department of Transport is responsible for the buildings at our airports, and he will therefore have to raise that matter once again when the Vote &#x201C;Transport&#x201D; comes up for discussion during the next session. Then the hon. member suggested that our air hostesses should speak more languages on our overseas services. I should very much like to do that if I could find ladies who have a good command of more languages than the two official ones, but they are simply unobtainable. We have tried to obtain their services as announcers at airports, but we have not been able to do so. It is very difficult to obtain the services of ladies who can speak French or German and English and Afrikaans. If they were obtainable, we would certainly avail ourselves of their services. As regards the announcers over the loud-speaker system, the hon. member said that the pronunciation of the announcers should be improved. I agree. At the moment I do not want to refer specifically to one particular airport, but I get a pain in the neck each time I hear that announcer. It is very difficult to obtain the services of these ladies. We cannot give elocution lessons to all of them. 1 agree with the hon. member that ladies with better pronunciation ought to be appointed. However, the hon. member lays no charges against our travel hostesses. The pronunciation of our travel hostesses is very good. Sometimes their accent is just a little too &#x201C;Oxford&#x201D; to my liking.</p>

<p>The hon. member for De Aar-Colesberg (Mr. M. J. de la R. Venter) asked that servants who had committed some offence or other and who had been sentenced, should be re-employed in the Service. We do that. We are very accommodating towards these people when we feel that they have really been rehabilitated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) rather surprised me. I have never seen him so aggressive, and this in his valedictory speech. I was quite surprised. I had to open my eyes twice to see whether it was the hon. member for Simonstown talking or not. I do not know why the hon. member was so aggressive. I do not know whether he suddenly developed some action against me or whether he has a quarrel with me.</p>

He said that where a railway servant is found not guilty of an offence in a court of law and is not charged departmentally and is reinstated in the service, he should be paid during his period of suspension. He has written to me in that regard and the reply is lying on my desk. This has been the practice for all these years. In terms of the regulations if a railway servant is charged with anything that has nothing to do with ihs work, for instance, if the police charge him for theft outside railway premises or for contravening the Immorality Act, he must be suspended immediately and he is suspended until such time as the case has been concluded. The Railways cannot pay him during the period of his suspension. They are not responsible for his suspension.</p>

<p>Hon. members have asked about the Boeing 727. I have already answered that point.</p>

<p>Then I do not know what the hon. member for Durban Point meant when he spoke about shunters who are White by day and Black by night. I shall give him an opportunity to explain what he means if he would like to rise and do so. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I think we had better leave it at that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital has raised quite a number of matters which will receive our attention. I am sorry about the toilets. I can understand that the hon. member frequently has to use the toilet and that it is embarrassing when it is locked. I understand that the reason why these toilets are kept locked is that non-Whites also enter these coaches either when entraining or detraining and they very often use the European toilets. European passengers complained very strongly and so the ticket examiner now keeps the key. The hon. member must remember that when he needs to use a toilet, he must just ask the ticket examiner for the key.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River has raised an important point and I think I had better knock it on the head immediately. He has said that production at the railway workshops at Salt River is being kept down with a view to transferring the workshops to Bloemfontein or Pretoria. There is no truth in that statement at all. There is no intention nor is there any plan to transfer these workshops to Bloemfontein or Pretoria.</p>

<p>Production will expand if there is any need for it to expand; if there is no need, of course it will not expand.</p>

<p>I now want to say to the hon. members for Karoo and Boland in respect of the matters which they have raised; matters which they have raised before, that I am very sympathetic towards the Coloured people. Hon. members may rest assured that I do my best to create more opportunities and many opportunities have been created for the Coloured people over the years. That policy will continue.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad (Mr. A. L. Schlebusch) asked that the actual rights and privileges of the owners on whose land a servitude is taken, should be indicated on such servitudes. I have been assured that this is in fact being done. On the back of the servitude it is indicated what privileges, etc., the person in question has.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Orange Grove I should like to say that his speech is of the same quality as the articles he writes in <i>Ons Land,</i> the Opposition&#x2019;s official publication; one of these articles was referred to by the hon. the Prime Minister during the no-confidence debate. Everybody who has read those articles, knows of what quality they are. They are not very savoury.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Quite. I know that the hon. member is going to use the type of allegation made this afternoon as propaganda, and should hon. members perhaps read that magazine at some stage in the future, they will find everything that was said here this afternoon, with something extra added. There is, of course, the hon. member&#x2019;s allegation that the number of resignations from the employ of the Railways has never in the history of the Railways been as high. This has to serve as proof of how dissatisfied the staff of the Railways is. That is the norm. He maintains that the increases I granted were too late. Mr. Speaker, what are the facts? In 1965 there were 18.826 resignations, and not 10,000, as the hon. member had said, but 21,130 former railwaymen applied for re-instatement in the employ of the Railways. The hon. member&#x2019;s allegation is not true. There are many other reasons for officials resigning. Sometimes we investigate them. It is not a question of general dissatisfaction with the service. Sometimes servants resign because they want their pension money in order to settle debts. Others resign because they think that they have found a better job, and after a few months they find out that it is not the case. Others resign to go farming. Others resign because they are unable to obtain a transfer. There are hundreds of reasons for which servants resign.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>In any case, the number of resignations is greater than in the past.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>However, the fact is that 21,130 servants reapplied in order that they might come back to the Railways. We do not take all of them back either. We look at their records. Approximately one-third only is employed again. The records of some of them are so bad that one simply cannot risk employing them again.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the large number of non-White labourers. In this respect the position is a very strange one. Once again it is the old story that there has been an increase in the number of non-White labourers. The Opposition is going to make propaganda out of this: &#x201C;See the number of non-Whites who are taken into service all the time! &#x201D; They will say that outside in the country and also in their little newspaper. They will not say that here. The hon. member almost contradicted himself. When I asked him whether he was opposed to non-Whites being employed, he gave me three replies. At first he said yes, and that they stood for civilized labour. Later he hestitated and did not know what to say, and later he said that they were in favour of it, but that they would see to it that the White workers increased to the same extent. Mr. Speaker, why is it that there is such an increase in the number of non-Whites on the Railways, and that they increase more rapidly than the Whites? Because we try to see to it that the White man need no longer do pick and shovel work. We said that the Bantu should rather do that work and that the White man should do better work. Would the hon. member prefer those thousands of White workers to continue doing that pick and shovel work instead of our employing Bantu?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>If you send the Bantu back to the Bantustans, you will have to do that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the propaganda that will be made. Now, when this propaganda is made, we must remember that the hon. member, who is a propagandist for his Party, would prefer those thousands of White workers who have now been replaced by Bantu workers, to return to doing that pick and shovel work. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove also alleged that 800 houses stood empty, and do hon. members know why? Because White workers had been replaced by non-White workers. Which are the houses that are standing empty? Along the railway line where there always used to be a White ganger with a team of White labourers who used to have houses there. We have replaced those White workers with Bantu workers, of course. That is the reason for those houses standing empty, and in addition to that we have a new system of mechanical rail maintenance under which one platelayer with a team of Bantu workers managed five or six sections of the line, where previously we had a White ganger with a team of White workers for each section of the line. That is the real reason. But I say that is the type of propaganda we are going to find. Then the hon. member <span class="col_847-848" refersTo="page_0434"/>also spoke of the 24.000 Railway servants who are injured annually in the Railway service. But do hon. members realize that those figures include a man who has injured his finger and is absent from his work for one day. The slightest of injuries are included in this figure, and with an organization such as the Railways, with a staff of 200.000 people, it stands to reason that numerous people will be injured. 90% of these cases can be attributed to the human factor. In my reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question I told him what we were doing to prevent these accidents. I referred to the excellent safety organization which had been built up. We are trying to make workers safety conscious in order to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke of the commission which had supposedly been paid to an agency in Vereeniging. 1 have said before that the Railways did not negotiate with them. The Railways negotiate directly with the manufacturers. I also said that no commission was paid. But do hon. members know what the hon. member has done? He does not take my word for it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) advocated a decrease in the tariff on wool. He has done that before. In this regard I should just like to tell him that I am very grateful to him for the fine words he said about the Railways. I appreciate them and I thank him on behalf of my staff. I should just like to point out that the tariff on wool is not too high. The tariff on wool works out to .64 cents per pound and the average price of wool is 34 cents per pound. Railage of .64 cents per pound is a very low tariff. The hon. member also pointed out the difference between the tariff on wool and the tariff on cotton. The reason for a lower tariff in the case of cotton, is the fact that the price of cotton is so much lower. The average price of cotton is only 22 cents per pound, as against the price of wool which is 34 cents per pound. In the case of wattle bark the tariff is low, too, but the average price of wattle bark is only 1 cent per pound. Here once again it is the old tariff policy which is being applied, namely that tariffs are determined on the basis of what the traffic can bear, on the one hand, and on the other hand the cost of transporting that article. Further I should just like to point out to the hon. member that in 1958 when the 10% levy was introduced, wool was exempted so that during all these years wool has had the advantage of not being subject to that 10% increase.</p>

<p>As regards slaughter-stock, I can only assure the hon. member that the Railways is doing everything in its power to speed up the transportation of slaughter-stock. However, there are regulations which provide that after a certain number of hours on the train, such stock has to be unloaded to be given fodder and water. Those regulations have to be complied with. Therefore it often happens that by that time there is another train on the line and that the train with the slaughter-stock cannot get away immediately. However, I think that the average through-transportation time of the northern parts in South-West Africa is approximately seven days. That is very quick for such a long distance when provision has to be made for fodder and water.</p>

<p>The hon. member of Drakensberg has a weakness&#x2014;as I expected, of course, and as all of us expected, because she is fighting for her political life and she had to do what she could by means of a speech in this Parliament to see whether she could not obtain a few votes amongst the Railway people; I do not blame her. The weakness is that her facts are not always correct, and the Railway servants know what the position is. For that reason they will not believe everything she says here, because they work there. They know what the position is. I should just like to refer to a few other matters she touched upon. She said that despite the fact that a new welding depot appeared on the Budget for three years, it has not been built as yet. I want to give you the facts so that they may also be placed on record. As regards the flash-butt welding depot at Danskraal, the position is that provision has been made under Items 588 and 589 of the Brown Book for the necessary work. The statement that these items have appeared in the Brown Book for years, is not correct, Tant Sannie.</p>

<p>In 1964-’65 Item 588 appeared in the Brown Book for the first time.

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with the others. In 1965-’66 Item 589 appeared in the Brown Book for the first time. It makes provision for a new workshop, a mess and ablution block for Whites and a stores stacking area at the flash-butt welding depot. The total cost is R427,400. Construction commenced in July 1965 and progress is being made according to plan. All of this is for the Whites. If only the hon. member had taken the trouble to consult the engineer in command, instead of personally making enquiries on the site, she would have obtained the correct facts. [Interjections.] The hon. member should not move on the same level as the hon. member for Yeoville. [Interjections.] He was on top of a mine dump. The hon. member walked through the site.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to houses in Pretoriusdorp and she kicked up a terrible row about the fact that the houses were in such a bad condition and that the railway people had to live in such circumstances. The position is as follows: The houses are indeed rented by the Railways. In 1938 a contract was entered into with the municipality to rent 30 economic houses at Pretoriusdorp for a period of 40 years. All of the houses were new then. They were situated close to an industrial area. The maintenance is undertaken by the municipality. They are responsible for the maintenance. The municipality has to renovate the buildings now, but they say that they are going to increase the rentals. At present the rental is only R9 per month and the occupants are not prepared to pay more. The names of the occupants are on the departmental waiting list for houses, and as they are attended to, the houses are allocated to other persons and they know what the position is.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that I have reached the time limit. In conclusion I should just like to thank the hon. member for Langlaagte for the fine words he directed at my staff. We are all sorry that he will not return. We all know about his state of health and it is for that reason that he will have to retire. We have always appreciated him here. The hon. member always did his best to serve the interests of his voters.</p>

<p>Now I only want to ask this, Mr. Speaker: Is the Opposition going to gain any advantage from all these stories they are spreading. Are they going to attract any additional votes? I do not think so. I believe that this is the most futile attempt we have ever seen. A few hon. members, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Orange Grove, predicted that the United Party would be in power after 30th March. What a rude awakening there is in store for them! I am afraid that at the next Session of Parliament all of them will have a great deal of indigestion as a result of all the words they will then have to swallow.</p>
