<p><span class="col_991-992" refersTo="page_0506"/>Whether it is intended to raise the basic rate of pay of young men undergoing their nine months&#x2019; military training; if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#taylor">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<p>No, because:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Quarters, rations, uniform, medical treatment and transportation are all provided at State expense.</li>

<li>(b) By far the greater majority undergo their nine months&#x2019; training immediately after they leave school and the present rates of pay applicable to the various ranks and musterings are regarded sufficient to meet their limited needs during training. In cases where there are dependants an allowance of up to R1.70 per day, which varies according to the degree of dependence, is paid.</li>

<p>Arising out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply may I ask him whether it is a fact that certain statutory deductions are made from the 50c per day paid to ballotees, deductions for such things as hair cuts and lost items of uniform, thus reducing the 50c to something much less?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>A ballotee must in any case have a hair cut and if something is deducted from his pay for giving him a hair cut at a lower price, that is clearly in his favour.</p>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_planning" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF PLANNING:</from>

<ol>

<li>(a) (i)&#x2014;(iv). Local authorities are the only statutory bodies, who may in terms of the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953 in their discretion and without consulting me reserve beaches for the different race groups.<br/>As fas as Natal is concerned, it has been ascertained that the Durban Corporation has reserved the beach area from the harbour to the Umgeni River, a distance of approximately 5 miles, with the exception of two areas therein of 500 yards for Indians and Coloureds respectively, for members of the White group. Proper notice boards, indicating the areas reserved for the different race groups, have been erected by the Corporation. The whole of Isipingo beach is situated in an Indian group area and the beach is reserved for members of the Indian group. The Indian and Colloured group areas at Merebank also border on the sea and beaches can be developed there.<br/>I have made recommendations for reservations to the local authorities in the Cape Peninsula and Port Elizabeth.<br/>According to information at my disposal the local authorities concerned have responded as follows to my recommendations:<br/>Municipalities of Milnerton and Strand:<br/>Notice boards have immediately been erected.<br/>Municipality of Simonstown:<br/>Notice boards were erected two years ago.<br/>Municipality of Fish Hoek:<br/>No reservations have been made in the municipal area but the Municipality have notice boards available to erect when necessary.<br/>Municipality of Gordons Bay:<br/>Notice boards have been erected in a portion of the beach. Notice boards for <span class="col_993-994" refersTo="page_0507"/>the rest of the area have already been ordered and will be erected on receipt thereof.<br/>Divisional Councils of Cape Town and Stellenbosch:<br/>Arrangements are being made for the erection of notice boards where such boards have not yet been erected.<br/>Municipality of Cape Town:<br/>This municipality has so far resisted the implementation of the recommendations.<br/>Municipality of Port Elizabeth:<br/>The municipality has asked for postponement.<br/>Divisional Council of Port Elizabeth:<br/>The Council has, with a few minor exceptions accepted my recommendations, but must still erect the necessary notice boards.<br/>It must, however, be pointed out to the honourable member that my recommendations do not cover all the beaches in the said areas. Recommendations in respect of the remaining beaches will be made when convenient.<br/>East London:<br/>No recommendations have as yet been made by me, and no beaches have been reserved by the local authority for the different race groups.<br/>It is clear from the abovementioned information that it is not at this stage possible for me to determine the extent to which local authorities have reserved or will reserve beaches for the different race groups.</li>

The car must be insured in the joint names of the officer and the Government. The car may not be disposed of without prior Treasury authority before the loan is repaid in full.

<p>Which departments were affected by the curtailment of the audit of departmental accounts during the financial year 1964-5.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<p>The remarks in the Report of the Controller and Auditor-General regarding the curtailment of the audits of 13 departments were made to indicate to what extent the shortage of trained staff had necessitated the curtailment. The relevant departments are not aware of the curtailment and it is not considered in the best interest to disclose the names of the departments. The Report has been referred to the Select Committee on Public Accounts and I am of the opinion that if further inquiry into the matter is considered necessary, It should be left to that Committee.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_planning" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF PLANNING:</from>

<p>The route which the railway line must follow from the main line to the harbour, must still be determined. This matter is at present being investigated by the S.A. Railways. Methods to regulate the flood water of the Diep River, must also be found and in this respect the Department of Water Affairs is busy with an investigation. The Geological Survey is at present correlating seismic data to ascertain the depth of rocks in the harbour area, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is investigating the influence of the sea on the coastline. The result of these investigations will materially influence the planning of the fishing harbour and it is not expected that the task will be completed during the second half of 1966. The decision, as to when a start will be made with the building of the fishing harbour, rests with the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this House adjourned last night, I intended mentioning that there were 318,580 telephones in South Africa in 1948 and that the present number, according to the latest figures available, was 1,090,000&#x2014;an increase of approximately 300 per cent. The point I want to make is that a White man does not have a telephone installed in his house if he is unable to pay the account.</p>

<p>Similarly, one can take every sphere of the White national life in South Africa and one will find that under Nationalist rule unprecedented progress has been made for the White man. And the voters are aware of that, because the voters in every house in South Africa reap the sweet fruits of that Nationalist rule every year. Therefore, the United Party story that too little has been done for the White man in South Africa is devoid of any truth and is completely refuted by the facts. But for more than 17 years this Nationalist Government has been a target for the poison arrows of the outside world, for more than 17 years it has been accused of being a Nazi Government, one of the ugliest terms of abuse for many generations. What is the origin of that accusation? It lies at the door of that Opposition which has been accusing the Government for 17 years in this House of suppressing the Black man. And now those same people make a complete about-face in the 18th year. There is a nice word for describing that which I may not use in parliamentary language. They made a complete about-face and now they want to gull the world into believing that they are the so-called White leaders who want to maintain White leadership in South Africa. In this pretence, in this complete about-face, the United Party is standing before the people of South Africa like a crocodile. When it opens its mouth one does not know whether it wants to smile or whether it wants to bite.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the United Party has a bad record. That has been unmistakable for the past 18 years. In respect of what the hon. Leader of the Opposition said in this House <span class="col_1029-1030" refersTo="page_0525"/>during the no-confidence debate, I put it to him that the United Party has been &#x201C;right so rarely on so few things&#x201D; and that it has been right least of all when it came to the preservation of the White people in South Africa. The United Party&#x2019;s record in connection with the preservation of White people in South Africa shows undeniably that it is resolute in being irresolute, determined in being undecided, and absolutely determined to let things take their own course, and that as regards the most important issue with which a nation can concern itself, namely its continued existence. For that reason the United Party is powerful for one thing only, to be powerless. Contrasted to that one has the record and deeds of the Nationalist Government over a period of 18 years standing like a granite rock in a restless world. The nation of South Africa knows the United Party&#x2014;as I indicated in my speech last night&#x2014;as a tree is known by its fruit, and for that reason the justified departure of the United Party will be unlamented, unhonoured, unsung, unpraised, about 30 March 1966.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, listening to the hon. member for Edenvale (Dr. Koornhof) yesterday and to-day, I was reminded of what Chaucer wrote in his &#x201C;Canterbury Tales&#x201D; hundreds of years ago when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A clerk there was at Oxford also;<br/>Nowhere so busy a man as he there was And yet he seemed busier than he was.</block>

<p>I think one could sum up his whole speech in those few words. It shows how little the clerks at Oxford have really changed in these hundreds of years. They really seem much busier than they are and they really contribute far less than they think they do.</p>

<p>This hon. member accused this side of the House of denigrating South Africa by criticizing Nationalist policies in certain respects and thereby giving South Africa a bad reputation overseas, but what were his speeches at Oxford but a fundamental criticism of the basic policy of this country, migrant labour? He condemned it hook, line and sinker.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>That is not true.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Yet migrant labour is the basis of the Government&#x2019;s policy to-day. So if he accuses us of criticizing the Nationalist Government and thereby giving South Africa a bad reputation overseas, then he should have seen to it that his thesis was never published, because his thesis is a total condemnation of the policy of the Government. Furthermore, the hon. member seems to think when he quotes all these figures of development and extra telephones, etc., since 1948, that when the Nationalists came into power in 1948 everything had come to a standstill. But things did not come to a standstill in South Africa or in the rest of the world. If he wants to measure progress he must measure it in relation to what has happened in the rest of the world, as I will endeavour to do in my speech.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House of course accept that the Government and hon. members opposite are as determined to maintain Western civilization and the White man in South Africa as we are. The only thing that baffles us from time to time is the means they employ to do this. To give an example, we always thought on this side that the most obvious way of maintaining Western civilization here would be to strengthen enormously the numbers of the White man. That is why when this Government came into power they found that the Smuts Government had an imaginative policy of immigration, but what did they do? When they came into power they found this policy working so well that they were complaining that too many Whites were coming into the country. But immediately they came into power they choked this stream of White immigrants off to a trickle. It is only in recent years that they have reverted to a policy of large-scale White immigration again. I say that in the balance sheet of South Africa this Government has cost the Republic at least 1.000,000 Whites since they have been in power. That is the cost the country will have to pay for all time, that our White community is 1,000,000 less than it could have been. How much stronger would the White man and Western civilization not have been if we had had those extra 1,000,000 people to-day? But it was not only that the United Party had a dynamic immigration policy in 1948. It also had a well-conceived policy of family allowances, tax concessions and educational grants to encourage larger families. In 1953 the United Party issued a special pamphlet on this. A conscious policy like this has had dramatic effects in certain European countries like France in increasing the birth-rate. But in 1953 when we published this pamphlet hon. members opposite called it the &#x201C;Verenigde Party s&#x00EA; konynbeleid&#x201D;. Now, 12 years later, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration has dimly become aware that there may be a need for larger families and a more rapid increase of the population, and he has come with his emotional appeal for Republican babies. He is apparently unaware of the very complex factors in Western societies which make for low birth-rates. If he thinks he can solve them by such simple emotional appeals, he is wrong. Psychologists and sociologists have studied this problem in the Western world. It is a most complex thing, and simple appeals like this will not help at all. If the Government is genuine in wanting an increase in the White population, it will have to be tackled by very comprehensive policies along the lines outlined by this side, and particularly some of the suggestions made by the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) yesterday. Again we on this side realize that whilst the White man is and will remain for a long time the torchbearer of Western civilization here, there are <span class="col_1031-1032" refersTo="page_0526"/>also other racial groups whose destinies depend as much as that of the White man on the maintenance of Western civilization. We have in mind the 1,500,000 Coloured people who are a Westernized community. Again, the Indian people and the permanently detribalized Bantu have as much to fear from the twin forces threatening Western civilization here, African nationalism and Communism, as the White man has. All these groups have a common political interest with the White man to maintain Western civilization and Western standards here. But here again, what amazes us are the Government policies which seem to reject them as potential political allies in the maintenance of Western civilization here. The Government&#x2019;s Bantu policy can only actively stimulate African nationalism. As far as the Coloureds are concerned, it has rejected the traditional South African policy that the Coloureds are associated with the Whites politically. As far as the Indians are concerned, the Government has no policy at all now that it has abandoned its scheme for repatriation. It is surely political folly to neglect to cultivate and develop the support of so many millions of non-Whites in South Africa who have a common interest and desire with the Whites to maintain Western civilization here. Under these circumstances, how is the Government going to keep their promise to the electorate that it will keep the Republic White and maintain Western civilization, when their policies have led to the Whites becoming a shrinking and isolated minority in the Republic? When I first came to Parliament I remember the hon. the Minister of Finance making a speech here. In those days, of course, the policy of the Government still was physically to separate the races. I remember a phrase the Minister used, which was used often in those days, when he said that economic integration must lead to political integration, and political integration to social integration, and therefore the answer to keeping the White nation&#x2019;s identity was apartheid.</p>

<p>In those days it meant separating the races. We do not hear that slogan any more to-day because, of course, economic integration between the races has gone on merrily ever since, and even the Minister of Finance has forgotten those fine words of his of those days. Without it, the economic development which the Minister gave us here could not have taken place. What is more, the Government expects that it will continue to take place in the future as in the past. All one has to do is to look at the Economic Development Programme&#x2019;s forecast of labour requirements, and you will see that the Government expects for the next five years that the traditional pattern of the racial mixture in industry will be maintained. In fact, if you look at the figures carefully, not in a single case has the percentage of Whites increased, but there are several industries in which the percentage of Blacks and other non-Whites has increased. So they have given up all hope of separating the races. To give you an idea, Sir, the Economic Development Programme estimated that the demand for White labour between 1964 and 1970 would increase by 203,000, but they do not know where they will get 30,000 of those from. Even with an immigration rate of 20,000 a year, they only expect the White labour force to grow by 173.000. The demand for non-White labour they expect to increase by 774,000. So the Government has really rejected the concept of separating the races economically. It is a pretty good bet that the 30,000 White workers the plan estimates the country to be short of by 1970 will ultimately have their jobs filled by non-Whites. How then are we going to carry out this promise made by the Government that they will keep the country White, when in fact the Whites are in the minority and a declining minority, thanks to past policies? Nor, having abandoned baasskap, can they mean White baasskap when they say they will keep the country White. As far as we can discern, after having abandoned the idea of stopping economic integration and White baasskap, they now have another scheme to keep the Republic White without having to get rid of the vast majority of Bantu who are necessary for the Republic&#x2019;s economic life. And it is quite a simple scheme; it is to turn them into foreigners, or &#x201C;uitlanders&#x201D;, and then not count them as being in our midst, or entitled to any political say in our political affairs. It is just to pretend they are not there. Of course, the cost of this political fiction is the creation of a series of independent Bantustans in our midst and on our borders, and all that that implies. I do not want to recapitulate that, because we have argued it over and over again. We have repeatedly pointed out the dangers of such non-viable independent states, the fact that they will be centres for breeding extreme Black nationalism amongst all the Bantu in their homelands and outside, the fact that they will be in a much better position as independent Black states to invite outside assistance from the Western as well as the communistic world to interfere in our internal affairs.</p>

<p>As soon as you accept it, I will stop making these speeches. There is also a military danger inherent in this, and there is the fact that our economic base will depend on our overwhelmingly foreign labour force owing no allegiance or loyalty to South Africa in any crisis. Have those hon. members ever asked themselves what will happen, if we ever get into a war again, if some of these independent states choose opposite sides? What will happen to our foreign labour force, on which our industries are largely dependent, if they owe allegiance to these foreign states? It is really such a dangerous policy that to use an phrase an English statesman used once upon a time, anyone who votes for it must be &#x201C;bonkers&#x201D;. Nationalist spokesmen, fully aware of these dangers, fondly imagine that they are <span class="col_1033-1034" refersTo="page_0527"/>worth paying, because at least the Bantu will then not demand political rights in the Republic. But what on earth makes them think this? Was this the experience with the &#x201C;Uitlanders&#x201D; in the old Transvaal Republic? Has the Minister of Finance forgotten his earlier warning that economic integration must lead to political integration? If people live exactly as before, except that they are now technically foreigners, will they change their natures and their political aspirations? The fact is that if the physical separation of the races is impossible, as members opposite are now tacitly accepting&#x2014;they will not accept it openly yet, judging from their interjections&#x2014;apartheid as a policy to keep South Africa White has failed, and no political fictions can save it. The strategem of turning the non-Whites into foreigners only imperils our future more; it does not safeguard it any more. The Government is clinging to the concept of apartheid, whilst accepting that its basis, which gives it political sense, namely the physical separation of the races, has failed. Sir, it is heroic to adhere to a noble idea despite temporary setbacks, provided always it is a good idea. If not, it just becomes sheer stupidity. I am afraid that this is what apartheid or separate development has come to.</p>

<p>Now, the Minister has given this House a survey of the &#x201C;phenomenal&#x201D; development this country has experienced in recent years. I use the word &#x201C;phenomenal&#x201D; because he used it. He implies that this was because of sound Government policies. He does not seem to realize that it was at the cost of the central idea of this Government, namely separate development. The development that we have had has destroyed the core of the Government&#x2019;s policy to keep the Republic White, because it could only take place on the basis of the economic integration of the races. Nor do I understand why the Minister called it phenomenal. If he looks at the rate of economic development of South Africa since Union in 1910, he will find that economic development since 1948 has been more or less at the same tempo. So why is it phenomenal? This also answers the previous speaker, who claimed that there was phenomenal development. There has been no marked acceleration of the rate of economic development. If the Minister would draw a graph he would see that. Nor in fact has the economic development programme assumed a markedly rapid increase in the rate of economic development in this country. How can it be, unless it changes the whole structure of society? Otherwise a country cannot suddenly start developing phenomenally, and that the Government has not done. Nor can it be called phenomenal in relation to the rest of the Western world in the post-war period. I am sure the Minister will agree that the best measure of economic growth is the increase in real income per head, because provided it is evenly spread this measures the rate at which the standard of living of the people increases. I think the Minister will accept that that is a good index of the economic advancement of a society. After all, the whole purpose of economic development is to improve the standard of living of the people. If the Minister would look at some comparative figures according to <i>The Economist,</i> the real income per head for certain European countries between 1953 and 1963 is given as follows. For Germany and Italy it is 5.2 per cent per annum, Greece 4.9 per cent per annum, the Netherlands 3 per cent per annum, the United Kingdom is 2.1 per cent per annum. That measures the rate at which the standard of living of the people should have increased. If we come to South Africa, according to the economic development programme, at page 84 South Africa&#x2019;s real income per head for the 12 years from 1952 to 1964 increased by 2.2 per cent per annum, or considerably lower than the rate for Germany, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands, and on a par with that of the United Kingdom. Is that phenomenal development, where the whole of Europe regards the economy of the United Kingdom as a sick economy? But our performance has been no better over this comparable period than that of the United Kingdom. It is a great pity that we are not developing faster than the United Kingdom, but this is what the Minister calls &#x201C;phenomenal&#x201D; development. If the Minister really wants to use the word &#x201C;phenomenal&#x201D;, he should look at the Japanese rate of growth, which was 8.5 per cent per annum. That shows what is technically possible. Therefore I say that our rate of growth has not been phenomenal by Western standards at all. [Interjections.] We are already beginning to see the practical results. Salaries in countries like Germany and France have risen much faster than in South Africa. The gap which existed in salaries between European countries and South Africa is closing. What better illustration have you got than that of the failure of the Transvaal Provincial Administration to recruit personnel overseas, because they said the salaries were too low? And the Railways also failed to recruit people overseas for the same reason. The fact of the matter is that in Western Europe the standards of living, with the exception of the United Kingdom, have been rising faster than in South Africa in the post-war period; and this is a very dangerous development if it continues. Where will we get immigrants from in future? If this Government had not stopped immigration in 1948, South Africa certainly would have had a &#x201C;wirtschaft-wunder&#x201D; like Germany experienced, and for the very same reason, i.e. large-scale immigration. What is more, South Africa would have been a Whiter country to-day. A million extra Whites would have revolutionized our economy. Our economic power, and hence our military potential, would have been vastly greater. We can only really accelerate our rate of growth markedly if there are marked changes in the structure of our society, and the only way of doing that is really by large-scale immigration or very rapid acceleration of our educational standards. That is the only way in which you <span class="col_1035-1036" refersTo="page_0528"/>can do it. Unless you change your society fundamentally, you do not change the rate of expansion fundamentally, and the Government has completely failed to do that. In the end there is no stronger force to safeguard Western civilization here than a powerful and rapidly developing economy. Our relative immunity to sanctions to-day depends on our economic power. How much safer in this hostile world would we not have been if we had a much bigger White population and much greater industrial power? The more powerful we become economically and militarily, the more indispensable will we become to the West, which in this world in which we live is the best guarantee of their support. The more valuable we are to them militarily and economically, the more we can depend on them to support us. Speakers on the other side seem to imagine that the Government has planned the economic growth in the Republic. We have heard that over and over again. If this is so, we have really seen some rock-and-roll planning these past 17 years, short periods of rapid economic growth, followed by periods of stagnation. But the past 12 years we have had four such stop-go periods. Moreover, the planning of this Government has led to our economy being one of the most controlled economies in the Western world 20 years after the end of the war. I think the United Kingdom economy must be the only economy in the Western world which is controlled to the extent ours is. We have import control, capital control, price control&#x2014;and this in a country where the Government day in and day out profess that they believe in free enterprise unhampered as far as possible. This happens, moreover, in a country which is the biggest gold producer in the world and whose gold production has doubled in the past ten years. If ever there was a country in the world that should have been free of all control and should have developed evenly and rapidly over the past 17 years, it was this country, because of the stabilizing factor of gold.</p>

<p>The Minister denies also that he has bungled the boom, but let us see what has happened in recent years. We had the stagnant years from 1960 to 1962, followed by rapid growth in 1963, 1964 and 1965 and now we have a slowdown again. If this Government had a grasp of economic affairs, this could have been avoided. The Association of Chambers of Commerce points this out clearly in its &#x201C;Challange to Sustain Prosperity in South Africa&#x201D;. I quote &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">The present cycle was launched from a level of reserves and liquidity and corresponding unemployment and underutilization of capacity, quite different from anything in previous experience. It was to be hoped, therefore, that it would be possible, in the light of the greater room for manoeuvre that existed, to avoid falling into the same difficulties. However, this was not to be. Another credit squeeze has become necessary in order to correct a serious imbalance between domestic expenditure in money terms and domestic product in real terms. Early in 1964 it was recognized that the economy was beginning to bump up against the various ceilings imposed by a shortage of skilled labour in certain sectors&#x2014;notably the construction industry&#x2014;and inadequate transport facilities. Given the necessity to prevent undue inflation and to maintain a strategically high level of reserves, it was apparent at least eighteen months ago that the growth rate would have to be slowed down in the short term, for measures to increase supply were essentially of a longterm character.</block>

<p>Now, the Minister acted much later than that. The Minister apparently only became aware of this at Budget time last year. When he introduced his Budget he said &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to emphasize a proposition which in my view is too plain to need argument, namely this, that we cannot afford to gamble in our country with inflation. The importance of our gold mining industry and the dependence of our economy on foreign trade make it imperative that we should maintain price stability.</block>

<p>He then went on to explain that while the cost of living only increased by 1 per cent in 1962 and 1.4 per cent in 1963, it shot up to 4.1 per cent in 1964. Now. a rate of increase of 4.1 per cent is very inflationary, particularly in South Africa and for the reasons the Minister himself gave. The Minister then announced steps to restrict liquidity and to contain monetary demand. But what did the Minister himself then proceed to do. He started running down Government deposits with the Reserve Bank from R200,000,000 in March 1965 to R75,000,000 at the end of June and R14,000,000 at the end of July. Through this he undid the effects of the credit squeeze imposed on the commercial banks by him, to a large extent. I cannot do better than to quote the words of the Reserve Bank Bulletin of December 1965 in which they say &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">Naturally, this large movement of Government funds to the private sector more than offsets the moderate contractionary effect of the balance of payments deficit on bank and private sector liquidity during this period and reduced the effectiveness of the supplementary liquid asset requirement of the commercial banks.</block>

<p>In other words, the Minister’s right financial hand was undoing all the work of his left financial hand. The net result of the Government’s contradictory financial policies is. of course, that the cost of living continued to rise&#x2014;not only for this reason; there were also special reasons such as the drought. This is. however, one of the reasons. Thus between January and November, 1965, the cost of living increased by nearly another 3 per cent. In <span class="col_1037-1038" refersTo="page_0529"/>other words, in the past two years the cost of living has risen by 7 per cent&#x2014;a dangerous inflationary rate for a country like South Africa which is so dependent on its gold-mining industry. But it is not only the Government&#x2019;s credit policy that is somewhat strange. Its policy in regard to wages, if you can call it that, is even stranger. At the beginning of the last session the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the United Party drew attention to the manner in which the incomes of Government employees have been whittled away by inflation and demanded increased salaries and wages for these people. The Prime Minister refused these requests saying that they were utterly unreasonable. The Minister of Finance himself made no provision for relief for salaried people and wage-earners. The Minister claimed that his budget was a very finely balanced affair and that he had done his best to steer between the Scylla of deflation and the Charybdis of inflation. He dramatically cried out: &#x201C;The United Party is asking me in this budget, which they say is not tough enough to stop inflation, to pump more and more money into the spending-stream. I can almost hear them say: ‘To blazes with inflation because if inflation increase we can always blame it on the Government’.&#x201D; The Minister was adamant that he could not give away more than the meagre concession amounting to R10.600,000 to pensioners. But as the election got nearer and nearer, he apparently forgot more and more of his budget speech because during the past two or three months the Government has made extensive salary concessions to public servants amounting to probably R80,000,000. Government employees deserve these latest increases but they will find that in the coming year they will lose a very large part of these increases as a result of the increased cost of living because of the way in which the increases have been granted. But of course as far as the Minister is concerned the election will be over by then. To prevent these increases from being inflationary they should of course be given at budget time and the Government should have taken the necessary steps to neutralize the inflationary effect of the increases. But the hon. the Minister told us at that time that he could not possibly grant any wages and salary increases at all because it would be too inflationary.</p>

<p>Well, the election is nearer&#x2014; I shall admit that. Inflation will to a large extent erode these salary increases. The cost of living has already increased considerably during the past year and the effect of these increases has not yet been felt. In the absence of strong deflationary steps, these increases can only add fuel to the inflationary forces. The manner and timing of these increases indicates that this Government certainly has no income and wage policy. Wage decisions are made not in the light of economic conditions but of possible electoral gains.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is always pleasant for me to hear the remarks made by hon. members on that side of the House. The Opposition are embarrassed because they are faced with an election which they know they are going to lose, and that is why they are always ready to &#x201C;boo&#x201D; other people and to resort to similar practices. The hon. member who has just sat down tried to give us a new image of the United Party. 1 remember the days when the United Party tried to frustrate all the industrial development in this country. I remember how they opposed Iscor and how they did everything in their power to tell us: &#x201C;You cannot make steel in this country. You must leave it to mother England to supply the fine steel we need.&#x201D; Those same people, who did absolutely nothing in their day to promote industrial development, come along to-day and try to educate this Government which is the father of industrial development in this country. The industrial development in this country first began under the Government of General Hertzog and received a further impetus in 1948. When this Government took over, the industrial turnover amounted to about R500,000,000 while to-day it is about R2,000,000,000. That is why it is strange for me to see that hon. member suddenly standing up and to hear him speaking about industrial development. The policy of the United Party has always been: &#x201C;Feed mother England; starve South Africa.&#x201D; That was always their policy and we always had to feed the mother country. That was what they did all the time, but this side of the House was truly South African and we saw to it that South Africa came first. That was why we started our industrial development and that is why we have brought it to where it is to-day. We are proud of it. The development in the past was concentrated on the gold mines and on agriculture, but the National Party is responsible for the phenomenal development that has taken place in the industrial sphere.</p>

<p>I want to come back now to the question of agriculture. One must always draw a comparison before one can criticize. I want to deal with the policy of the United Party. What did they do? In the first instance, they violated the Marketing Act and replaced it by emergency regulations in 1939. I remember very well the way in which they with their imperial ideas wanted to feed only England at the time and allow South Africa to starve. We remember very well how they closed the agricultural colleges, because one had of course to fight for the &#x201C;Empire&#x201D;! That was what they did. But what else did they do? They treated our poor stock farmers so badly that our herds of stock where struck a mortal blow. Hon. members will remember how they fixed the price of meat. The highest price for mutton was about 7d. or 8d. per lb. The prices were so low that even the National Woolgrowers Association protested against the fixing <span class="col_1039-1040" refersTo="page_0530"/>of those low prices. Mr. Strauss was their important man at the time and it was Arthur Barlow who eventually said: &#x201C;Strauss must go.&#x201D; It was their agricultural policy which drove them into the wilderness. It was the agricultural policy of Strauss and the United Party which swept the platteland so clean of United Party members that the National Party was able to win all the platteland seats, which is the case to-day. Just look at the hon. members sitting on that side of the House to-day. I can, however, pay tribute to one of my old friends there, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. He is the only remaining platteland member on that side because he is the only one who has some knowledge of agriculture. He is the only one remaining because all the others fled to the cities. They were beaten on the platteland as a result of their policy: &#x201C;Strauss must go.&#x201D; They have now embarked upon a sort of vulture policy. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition rose to speak. I really thought that we would hear something about an agricultural policy, a wonderful agricultural policy. But what did we get? We got a vulture policy. The speech of the hon. member for Drakensberg was like the speech of an old vulture sitting on a ridge and looking around to see whether he could not find a lamb whose eyes he could pick out or which he could tear to pieces. They pecked here and there, but we heard no policy from them. Those hon. members have exploited the drought conditions shamefully in order to try to make propaganda. Instead of their making plans and doing something to assist the farmers, they have simply gone around the country inciting the people. The United Party has done nothing to try to relieve the drought conditions. I challenge them to say that they have ever approached the banks for assistance to try to save the farmers. Not one of them has done so. It was hon. members on this side of the House who approached the Reserve Bank and made arrangements with commercial banks for the assistance of the farmers. I want to say here that we are very grateful that the Reserve Bank and other banks have reacted in the way they have. What has the United Party done to assist those people, besides criticizing the Government? We have a policy which we have been following for 18 years. It is a sound policy. We still have the &#x201C;magna charta&#x201D; of the farmers, the Marketing Act, and we have done everything possible at all times to extend its provisions. Those hon. members call it &#x201C;our&#x201D; Act. They violated it in 1939 by means of their emergency regulations. A Select Committee was appointed in 1946 to investigate the matter. I also served on that committee. What was the purpose of the United Party in destroying the Marketing Act? The committee submitted a minority report as well, and when the National Party came into power in 1948, it was the minority report and not the majority report that was adopted. Those hon. members have no right, therefore, to say that they had anything to do with the Marketing Act. [Interjections.] We also cherished great ideals in regard to soil conservation and we have implemented them. We have done more for the conservation of the soil of this country than the United Party has done. What have they done? The first small scheme they launched was for a subsidy of R300 and then they introduced their emergency regulations and closed our agricultural colleges. They neglected the whole question of soil erosion in order to go to war. It was this side of the House whose ideal it was to assist the farmers. Soil conservation has to-day become a national monument. The erosion in certain parts of the country was, however, so bad that we could not resort to soil conservation, but this was the fault of the United Party. This Government has done everything in its power to revitalize the soil of our country, the soil we all love. There is still a great deal of work to be done in this connection and there is one point I want to mention at this stage. We must improve our manpower position in this connection. The Government has so organized things that at Grootfontein, courses which previously took two years to complete can now be completed in one year, but we must see whether we cannot obtain additional staff for this institution. I want to ask the hon. Minister whether he cannot make more use of his erosion committees. These committees consist of people of standing and if they can receive training at the agricultural colleges, it will greatly assist in improving matters.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of water conservation. What did the United Party do in regard to water conservation? From the time they came into power up to 1948 they did absolutely nothing in regard to this matter. All we heard was: &#x201C;We want to see the war through.&#x201D; That was their policy in regard to agriculture. Then this Government came forward with its great undertakings. The mighty Orange River scheme is to-day the finest scheme in the world. The Government is busy with that scheme. What did the Opposition do? Mr. Speaker, in connection with the Orange River scheme we want to thank the hon. Minister of Water Affairs, and particularly the hon. the Prime Minister, for their great foresight in establishing this wonderful scheme. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I shall continue with my speech no matter what hon. members on that side of the House may say. I want to tell them that I was a guest of the American Government. I travelled right through the Tennessee Valley. That was once the poorest part of America but now it is the richest. By the same token, the Orange River will give our country a new lease on life. Every drop of water which falls in this country must be conserved. The hon. the Prime Minister has made a statement in regard to what he is going to do and that is why we say: Leave these matters in the hands of a good farming Government, a Government which will ensure that there is food for its people, unlike the United Party in its day when women had to stand in queues and fainted from hunger. This happened under the policy of the United Party. The world knows this, the farmers know it and all <span class="col_1041-1042" refersTo="page_0531"/>the agitation of hon. members opposite will not help them at all. We stand by the Marketing Act. It is our Act. It is our Magna Charta.</p>

<p>What was the position in regard to maize under the old United Party Government? They allowed the maize to lie about on the stations and rot. They showed us at the time what they thought of us. Maize prices then were the lowest ever, and when, just after the war, the farmers had good crops of maize, the maize was exported. The United Party Government made a profit of £5,000,000 on that maize. What did they do with it? They stole it! When the National Party came into power, Mr. Havenga gave back to the maize farmers the money that remained, in the form of a reserve fund. We want to thank the maize farmers, the Maize Board and the Government for the wonderful system which they have worked out for us under the National Party. We have a wonderful system of grain elevators. There are grain elevators everywhere. How many were there when the United Party was in power? They covered the maize with tarpaulins! Are these the people who say that they want to come back into power? They can forget about it. The farmers remember how the United Party allowed the maize to rot.</p>

<p>What did they do for us in regard to meat? They supplied all the ships with meat. They went so far eventually as to commandeer all the sheep at auctions, just to show their loyalty. But how did they treat their own people? They were put into concentration camps. Their food was sold at low prices and they had to starve. That was the policy of the United Party. Mr. Speaker, the farmers do not forget these things. The farmers may suffer, and they have suffered as a result of prolonged droughts, but they will never forget the policy of the United Party. As I have said, it was a vulture policy.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of agricultural training. Our agricultural training has really flourished. Let us look at Grootfontein, which is to-day one of our fine institutions for agricultural training. There are other large agricultural colleges, one of which is at Potchefstroom, but I want particularly to discuss Grootfontein. Grootfontein fits in with the whole development of the Orange River scheme. The Government was good enough to appropriate R1,000,000 last year for expansion at Grootfontein. Grootfontein is to-day a wonderful institution for the training of farmers and for giving them the knowledge they need. That is why I say that no agricultural training was given under the United Party Government. For some reason or other they closed the agricultural colleges, but since this Government came into power these agricultural colleges have been given a new lease on life. Adequate training is now available there. Hon. members opposite should be the last ones to ask that they be re-accepted on the platteland. They will never be re-accepted on the platteland.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of transport. We have wonderful transport services to-day for which credit must go to our fine railway administration. They have helped us by means of their grain elevators and in the export of our maize. I want to issue one warning to the country. We must never be afraid of surpluses. We did take fright on one occasion but we have learnt that surpluses are always a great asset to a country. They do not constitute a problem. We must therefore never complain if we have surpluses in our country. We must encourage it because those surpluses earn foreign capital for us and we also have sufficient food to feed our own people. There is no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that a country which has no food cannot wage war, but if it has the food, it can do so.</p>

<p>I want to say that although our dairy farmers have experienced setbacks, such as droughts, dairy prices to-day are the highest they have ever been. This Government looks after the dairy farmers. I want to make an appeal to the Government not to be afraid of surpluses should they occur. Money is in circulation to-day, as a result of our industrial development, which enables us to buy many of those products which would not have been purchased in former years. So we must not complain if surpluses occur. We must welcome them. I hope that, with the new policy we are following and the new ideas we have, we will never have occasion to be afraid of surpluses. There are world markets to-day which we have already exploited very successfully.</p>

<p>In connection with agricultural credit I want to say that droughts have taught us that one must consolidate one&#x2019;s debts. We have the Land Bank. It is there for a purpose and it functions very well, but we have found recently that when there are large-scale droughts and people are pressed for money, it is far better to co-ordinate all debts as State debts, and to establish a Department of Agricultural Credit. The Government is occupied with this matter at the moment. We can keep agriculture on a sound basis by means of that system. We shall never allow ourselves to be influenced into saying that because there has been a drought we will vote United Party. The platteland will never again vote United Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Cradock, in his valedictory speech here to-day reminded us very much of the fact that he has not blossomed out in the years since he was in the United Party. It does seem a pity, Sir, that, in those years since he left us, he has not been able to make any further constructive contribution in this House. But we do appreciate the manner in which he has played his role in this House. We wish him a period of happy contentment and good health, and we feel sure that, as he looks back in his years of retirement, he will come to appreciate all the wisdom and the foresight and the good political acumen that came to him as a result of the years he spent in the United Party, and that it has been badly tempered by his sojourn on the other side of the <span class="col_1043-1044" refersTo="page_0532"/>House. It was interesting to listen to the hon. member for Cradock relating all the advances that have taken place in the agricultural field. It was significant that he made no reference whatsoever to any advances in cattle or sheep farming. That was left unsaid, and the hon. member knows that that is the most condemnatory point that this House and this country holds against the Nationalist Party. Possibly in his retirement this hon. member may be able to convert many members on the other side of the House to realize what their correct policy should be to increase the livestock population of South Africa. The hon. member dealt with industrialization of this country, and he spoke most enthusiastically of what has taken place in the industrial world in South Africa. I should like to cross swords with him and ask him if he will come along to the Witwatersrand and make this type of speech to the people there.</p>

<p>I should like to ask him if he will come along to the East Rand and face the public there and tell them what he said to the House, because I can tell him that he will get a vote of no-confidence from the East Rand because of what the Government has done there. This Government has seen fit to deliberately hold back the industrialization of the Witwatersrand. It has been a deliberate policy of this Government ever since 1957, when the present Prime Minister, who was then Minister of Native Affairs, sent a letter to the Boksburg Town Council and then gave the warning that no further industrial townships were to be established on the East Rand. When we warned the public about this danger, they said it was &#x201C;Sap&#x201D; propaganda; but it is true and the chickens are coming home to roost. No further industrial townships are being opened up on the Witwatersrand because the fear exists in the minds of the Government that it will bring an influx of Bantu into that area, because of the shortage of White manpower.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows very well that he is not prepared, because of pressure from the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, to allow any further industrial townships to be opened up on the Witwatersrand. But, Sir, what is more frightening to us&#x2014;and we have to take notice of it&#x2014;is a speech made by the hon. member for Brakpan in this House last year. In that speech he said that any industry on the Witwatersrand, which employs a proportion of more than two to one in Bantu labour, should go to the Border industries. He advocated the policy that, by some form of Government compulsion, these industries should be obliged to go to the Bantu reserves. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to deny and repudiate that contention of the hon. member for Brakpan, because it is something that is of frightening effect to all the people on the East Rand.</p>

<p>If we look at what is happening, what strange anomalies do we find? You find that a National Party controlled town council, such as that of Springs, which has had its applications for industrial townships repeatedly refused, having to resort to the subterfuge of having to make application to the Minister for an industrial township and, instead of the council&#x2019;s minutes reading that the grant concerned is being reserved for &#x201C;industrial purposes&#x201D;, they camouflage it by stating that the grant in question is required for &#x201C;township purposes&#x201D;. The word &#x201C;industrial&#x201D; has to be left out, That, Sir, is a Nationalist Party controlled council which is bumping its head up against the Government&#x2019;s policy, in that it cannot get the assistance and support it requires for the people of the East Rand and. consequently, has to resort to that type of tactics. And not only do they have to do that; but they have to ask me, a United Party member of Parliament, to continue pleading for industrial development and for a fairer share of it for the East Rand. And do not think I am exaggerating! Even the chairman of the Nationalist Party branch in Springs asked me never to give up making these representations, but to drive home my point of view that we should have more industries allocated to Springs. He told me: &#x201C;Ek kan nie hierdie ding teen my Regering doen nie. Jy is die enigste persoon wat dit kan doen.&#x201D; But let me go further, and say that, for the sake of party political advantage to the Nationalist Party, the Nationalist Party controlled council took a resolution immediately they came into power to the effect that I was not to be invited to take part in a single deputation to any minister. They have carried out that resolution, and that in spite of the fact that I am a duly elected representative of the people of Springs and am here to look after their interests in the best possible manner. But I must be boycotted by a Nationalist Party controlled town council, to the extent that I shall not be allowed to take part in any deputation, or from being consulted by a single member of the management committee of the Springs Town Council. Nevertheless, I write to the town council each year to ask them whether there is any matter which, in the interest of Springs, should be brought up in this House, but each time I receive a notification to the <span class="col_1045-1046" refersTo="page_0533"/>effect that there is no matter affecting Springs that need be raised with the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you something about that in a few moments. At present I am still pointing out how petty-minded these people are, and how they put their own personal political interests before the interests of the people of the town. That is all that matters in their outlook: That is typical of the Nationalist Party since it got into power in 1948. The Government at that time did not want White people to come into the country, and only because they wanted the Nationalist Party to retain its position as the party in government. Party political interests were thus put before those of the country! [Interjections.] That is the truth. You sabotaged South Africa&#x2019;s true interests. But you do not want to hear the truth. The Government kept White people out of the country in order to stay in power, and to-day they are having to face up to these problems in order to undo that harm.</p>

<p>There is another matter in regard to which complaints are justified, and that is the treatment by the Government of the mineworkers of South Africa. Throughout the years this Government has been using the mineworker as a political tool. That goes back to the days when the present Minister of Posts and Telegraphs was specially designated by the Broederbond to act as the means of breaking trade unionism in the country. Accordingly he and his lieutenants found their way into the mineworkers&#x2019; union, and set about deliberately to destroy that finely co-ordinated body. That policy has since that time been continued by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, who never wanted to see a true genuine trade union movement develop amongst the miners of the country.</p>

<p>They did that because they knew that if a trade union movement should gather momentum amongst the miners, that would react to the disadvantage of the Nationalist Party because we would then have a movement representing the genuine interests of the workers. It would have been a movement midway between two racialistic parties such as the Nationalist and the United Parties! That would have been in the interests of the worker and therefore it had to be broken by this Government. And broken it was by the present Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister of Economic Affairs! But the time has come where the political loyalty of a party cannot any longer be forced upon these people. They have seen through it. They are no longer prepared to accept the dictum that the only thing that you have to do is to be true to your Government and to your party, even if that is against the true interests of the mineworkers. That is the result of hon. members on that side of the House deliberately and misguidedly using their political influence in the mineworkers&#x2019; union and its affairs. Do you want proof of that, Sir? Why did the Government on two occasions during the past 12 months have to interfere with matters where the employee and employer were busy negotiating their own arrangements? Where else in the world, and in which other industry, have employee and employer managed to come to a satisfactory arrangement, only to find that the Government steps in and throws it overboard? Why did they resort to these extremes? Because if the employee and employer in the mining industry were allowed to negotiate amongst themselves, the Nationalist Party would lose its political influence and control over them. That is why the Government interfered on these two occasions. But now the mineworkers are seeing through it. They are not prepared to take it any longer. I should like to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Mines to take mineworkers&#x2019; affairs out of the political arena, and to allow these people to negotiate amongst themselves and so to reach solutions of those problems which are of a domestic concern to them. They are fully capable of finding these solutions. The Cabinet must not underestimate them by thinking that they do not know what is in their own interests, because they do know.</p>

<p>What the Nationalist Party Cabinet is trying to do, is to unduly exert its political influence. The hon. member for Krugersdorp jumped in at an untimely stage and thwarted an experimental scheme which had been finalized to the satisfaction of the people concerned. Ministers, too, have interfered in this way. That time is now gone. The mining industry is one of the vital industries of this country contributing as it does more than 10 per cent of our gross national revenue. Efforts at influencing the industry politically should therefore be stopped.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note that the wage bill is one of the most important items to-day amongst the cost items of operating a mine, and to-day is already as much as 50 per cent of the cost of production. Since 1955, working costs have increased by 36 per cent, whilst the earnings of White miners have increased by 47.25 per cent and that of the Bantu by 25 per cent. If this trend continues, it may be that in five years&#x2019; time, the percentage for White miners could be 70 per cent, and for Bantu 64 per cent. It must be remembered that there is a fixed price for this commodity. It is a different matter therefore from the usual business practice of adding increases in costs on to the price of an article bought by the public. Here, however, it cannot be added <span class="col_1047-1048" refersTo="page_0534"/>on to the price of gold, because that is fixed. Therefore I think a satisfactory solution should be found to this continuous rise in working costs. In this connection, I should like to point out that too much valuable low grade ore is being left in the earth. I wish to suggest to the Cabinet, that the time has arrived when it is urgently necessary to call a round-table conference of all interested parties&#x2014;employees, employers and the Government&#x2014;in an endeavour to evolve a more satisfactory approach to the whole question of wages, conditions and, in general, everything affecting the mining industry.</p>

<p>I am asked to state what in my opinion these people are entitled to. I will answer that, and will base my answer on personal conversations I have had with miners time and time again. First and foremost, they do not want to work underground all the years of their lives. They would like to be brought back to the surface after a period of 20 to 25 years of working underground. Thereafter they should, at the joint expense of the State and the industry, be trained to become qualified artisans to enable them to go into other spheres of industry. This is an important consideration, especially from the point of view of encouraging White people to go into the mining industry. The Minister has already stated that there is a shortage of 2,000 White workers on the mines, i.e., approximately the same figure as last year. Apparently there has been no improvement since then. We must, therefore, be prepared to make this occupation a more attractive one. One way in which to do this is, as I have suggested, to relieve the mineworker from working underground after he has worked there for a period of 20 to 25 years and to train him as a qualified artisan. Secondly, these people want a five-day week. I think they are entitled to this. In factories and offices, it is felt that it is to the advantage of the staff, as well as the employer to work a five-day week, so why should it be begrudged to the mineworkers, provided arrangements are made to provide for essential work on the sixth day? Thirdly, they want the security and knowledge of being certain of receiving an adequate and satisfactory monthly wage. This business of a miner having to be paid on a daily basis, is a most unsatisfactory one. It is outmoded, and should be replaced by a fixed monthly salary which should be adequate for their living requirements.</p>

<p>But more than anything else, Mr. Speaker, the mineworker is dissatisfied at the Government&#x2019;s handling of pneumoconiosis compensation. This question has been badly mishandled by the Government since 1962. This side of the House warned the Government when it introduced legislation in this connection at that time, that that legislation was in itself unhealthy, un satisfactory and prejudicial to the mineworker and certain groups of sufferers. But we were laughed at, and not only that, but it is recorded in Hansard, we were even accused of being &#x201C;stupid&#x201D;. And yet the Government through that legislation took away from 395 widows, lump-sum payments of R1,150. These have since been paid back with retrospective effect from 1962. As a result of repeated representations from this side of the House. And yet we were being accused of being &#x201C;stupid!&#x201D;. To my mind, however, the present basis of compensation for pneumoconiosis is wrong and should be improved. The present method of certification, for instance, should be replaced by a more satisfactory method of classification. Fifthly what is more important than anything else, is that this Government should concede the demands of the mineworkers&#x2019; union that certification of the diseased should be taken out of the hands of the Department of Mines and be placed in the hands of the Department of Health. As long as the Minister refuses this request, so long will the Cabinet have to face dissatisfaction and unrest. The mineworker will never be convinced that he is receiving a square deal in regard to these examinations. I cannot see any logical reason for the Minister&#x2019;s refusal of this request, unless there are political motives behind this refusal. Furthermore, sixthly, I should like the hon. Minister to tell the miners why he is refusing to grant them the facility of enjoying Republic Day as a paid public holiday, when during the present Session of Parliament, a measure was passed declaring Republic Day to be a paid holiday for all the other trades in South Africa. Why should the miner be excluded? Where is the logic and justice of it? Why this differentiation and discrimination between one group of artisans and the other? I feel it is not too late for a new deal to be given to the miners. Unless this Government shows sincere goodwill towards these people, I am afraid that the present dissatisfaction and unrest will never come to an end. The tragedy of this unrest and dissatisfaction is that the mineworkers themselves declare that it is not directed against their employers, but against other causes. The villain of the piece here is this Cabinet, in taking up its present attitude towards the mineworkers. If you want proof of this just take note of the fact that within the 17 years this Government has been in power, there have been no less than seven Ministers in charge of the Department of Mines, i.e., about two and a half years per Minister. No sooner does a Minister get to know what mining is about, then he is transferred elsewhere. That is the contempt which this Government has for the mining industry. Now they have put in a &#x201C;Kapenaar&#x201D; who admits that he does not know much about mining, but that he is prepared to be guided by the professional men and experts of his Department. In this way we can possibly expect a change for the better. As a matter of fact, we have already seen a bit of a change, but it had to be a &#x201C;Kapenaar&#x201D; to come along <span class="col_1049-1050" refersTo="page_0535"/>and to tell the previous Transvaal Ministers where they had been going wrong.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging asked me about a lottery. Here is another aspect of the dissatisfaction of the people of South Africa with the present Government. They say that the Government will not be allowed any longer to dictate to them what is in their own interests and what is not; what they should do, and what they should not do. So they have taken the initiative. The proof of that is the petition I have here, containing as it does about 20,000 names, two-thirds of which are of people within my constituency. But I have also received representations from all over the country, requesting me to come along and organize petitions elsewhere, but unfortunately I did not have the time to do so.</p>

<p>Here is our policy pamphlet, and this is what it says on this aspect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A State lottery if the people want it.</block>

<p>Therefore, I challenge hon. members on the other side of the House to hold a referendum simultaneously with the forthcoming election so that the public can show whether or not it is in favour of a lottery. Why won’t the Government do that? It will cost them nothing. They talk about the &#x201C;volkswil&#x201D;, but let them test the &#x201C;volkswil&#x201D; in this matter. I will tell you what &#x201C;volkswil&#x201D; is, for instance, in the Free State. I have a letter here from Mr. A. J. Weideman. of 1, Turner Street, Kroonstad. in which he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why leave the Free State out. I can assure you that it is also necessary to put out tables all over the Free State. The result will be very satisfactory.</block>

<p>Here is another letter of a Mr. D. P. Marais of Robertsham in which he states:</p>

<block name="quote">I support the idea of a State lottery and should like to assist by obtaining signatures amongst the Afrikaans-speaking people with the same idea.</block>

<p>May I tell you, Sir, that over 60 per cent of names on the lists I have here are those of Afrikaans-speaking people &#x2014; thousands of whom are Nationalists. Any member on that side of the House can come and inspect these lists. Do hon. members opposite know that at our tables in Springs there were secretaries of two Nationalist Party branches in Springs? They sat there openly, and what is more, some of them are canvassing for me to-day, not as a candidate for the United Party, but because they want a lottery. If this then is the attitude of the public, why is this Government not prepared to test public opinion on this matter in order to find out what the people want? But they shout &#x201C;volkswil&#x201D; only when it suits them: when it dies not, the &#x201C;volkswil&#x201D; is ignored.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions the plight of so many thousands of people in my constituency who to-day are living merely on their old-age pensions. I say &#x201C;thousands&#x201D; because I had the privilege during the last three months of interviewing on an average 47 people per day each Wednesday. until I came down to Parliament.

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING AND OF AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND LAND TENURE</person>:</from>

<p>One can see very clearly that an election will be held in the near future. One can also see that the hon. member who has just spoken finds himself in a terrible dilemma. I want to analyse a few of the things said by the hon. member, He pointed out, <i>inter alia,</i> that the gold price cannot be increased. He continued by saying that it was essential to take certain steps for reducing mining production costs. He then went on and referred to a single item in respect of which production costs should be decreased, namely labour. He gave us the percentages which White and Bantu labour represented in the production costs. Does that mean the old policy of the United Party, namely the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; and the White worker competing with the non-White worker receiving a lower salary? Is that the way in which the hon. member wants to reduce mining production costs? Is that what the hon. member had in mind? He stated that the mining production costs should be reduced and in that connection referred specifically to labour. He also said <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0536"/>that the Government might not interfere in negotiations between the employee and the employer. That means that mines could reduce their production costs by means of salary decreases and the removal of the Colour bar, while the Government may not take any action for the protection of the mine-worker. That is the background against which the hon. member spoke. But the hon. member finds himself in a real dilemma, because he stated immediately afterwards that the mine-worker demanded a monthly salary and the one thing and the other. But the Government may not interfere in those matters, and consequently the mine-worker has to force that from the mine-owners. That is what one gets when someone finds himself in a dilemma at a time when an election is at hand. I do not even want to mention the foolishness of the hon. member&#x2019;s lottery. That policy of a lottery if people want it, is exactly like the United Party&#x2019;s Colour policy in respect of which they say that the guarantee White leadership as long as people want it. But they do not say what people. That is how they leave themselves a loophole; they always add &#x201C;if the people want it&#x201D;.</p>

<p>However, I did not rise in my seat to discuss the Colour policy of the United Party but to discuss agricultural matters. It is strange that the United Party made a whole number of wild allegations in this and in previous debates about agriculture without giving any evidence in support of those allegations. After they were invited by the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) to take part in this debate once more and to furnish their evidence then, they made themselves scarce. They know full well that they cannot furnish that evidence. I want to make an analysis of a few things here in order to put what the Government is doing in its right perspective. It has been alleged that agriculture was sick and that it had not received its rightful share in our economic revival. No evidence has been furnished for that accusation which is still up in the air. We know that several persons are experiencing hard times as a result of the drought. It is easy to suggest here that agriculture is sick and that it has not received its rightful share in our economic revival. But where is the evidence? What is the norm? Allow me to mention a few norms. The first norm I want to apply is the number of liquidations and provisional liquidations occurring in South Africa. Included in the total number of liquidations and provisional liquidations published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> during the period 1 November 1965, to 27 January 1966, are 133 businesses, 25 town-dwellers plus 201 judicial sales and nine farmers. In other words, farmers represented only five per cent of the total number of liquidations during that period. Now I want to ask the hon. member the following question. If a garage or an insurance company’ or any other business undertaking, becomes bankrupt or is liquidated, would one say that things were going badly for the business sector or that things were looking bad in the insurance business ? No, one would not do so. But for the sake of a few votes hon. members on that side are trying to exploit a few unfortunate cases in agriculture by giving out that things are going badly in the country&#x2019;s agricultural industry.</p>

<p>Now, I want to apply another norm, the norm hon. members should apply when dealing with this type of matter. The people in the agricultural industry are subject to the same economic laws as the people in commerce or engaged on various economic developments. The same economic laws apply to all spheres. The only difference is that a security factor applies in the sphere of agriculture which does not apply in the other spheres. Because that security factor creates certain problems, the Government has created special machinery for granting the agricultural industry the necessary assistance in the economic sphere. In that respect one has the Land Bank and now also the Department of Agricultural Credit which replaces the Department of State Advances.</p>

<p>Let us examine the latest figures of the Land Bank. At present the Land Bank holds approximately 25,000 mortgages. The bank admits that there is an increase in arrear instalments, and that debtors are finding it more and more difficult to raise arrear instalments. At the Nylstroom branch of the bank capital redemption and arrear interest increased to 6.9 per cent. At Pietersburg the percentage increased to 5.1 per cent. At Rustenburg the percentage increased to 4.2 per cent. Those areas have been experiencing a severe drought for the past five years. Those areas also suffered severely on account of foot-and-mouth disease. What does the Bank say about these figures? In its report it says [Translation]: &#x201C;The following figures are not an indication of deterioration.&#x201D; The report states that the increase in the number of loans granted is not a sign of deterioration because people use the money they borrow for buying land. In other words the money is used for capital investments. The report continues:</p>

<block name="quote">The number of debtors decreased by about 50 during 1965. but there was an increase in the individual loan amounts. In each case the most important single purpose for which loans were made available was the purchase of land.</block>

<p>In other words, Sir, the loans were made because there is faith in the agricultural industry. At present the Land Bank has an amount of R152,800,000 outstanding in respect of the purchase of land. The document states that these particulars are not a sign of deterioration but of confidence. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the year 1965, despite very unfavourable climatic conditions, arrear interest and capital redemption, in other words, instalments, increased by only .2 <span class="col_1053-1054" refersTo="page_0537"/>per cent from 3.7 per cent to 3.9 per cent of the capital outstanding. On 31.12.1933 &#x2026;</block>

<p>at which time we were experiencing a drought&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; arrear instalments amounted to 4.9 per cent of the capital outstanding at that time.</block>

<p>In other words from 1933 to 1965, despite the number of droughts experienced during that period, there has been an improvement in the position. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This remarkable achievement came about in spite of the fact that the Land Bank exercised no pressure whatsoever on the farmers. As a matter of fact, sales in execution were only resorted to in 46 cases during 1965, mainly as a result of attachment by other creditors. If the stricken areas are not taken into account, arrear instalments for the remainder of the Republic decrease to less than 3 per cent. The statement published above reflects to what extent the position is influenced by the Western and Northern Transvaal.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is what I call a norm. When one makes an accusation, as hon. members on the opposite side have done, one has to have a norm and one has to have evidence. Here is the evidence that things have not gone as badly for the farmers who owe money to the Land Bank as hon. members on that side want to make out. And that despite the drought and other problems with which we had to contend.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is the position as regards the State Advances Recoveries Office? This Government body assists farmers falling into category 3. They are farmers who no longer have credit-worthiness in the eyes of ordinary financial institutions or even in the eyes of the Land Bank. The assistance granted by this office in 1960-’61 amounted to R9,170,000. Less assistance was given each year until an amount of only R1,662,000 was granted in 1964-65. In other words, Mr. Speaker, in 1964-65 is was not necessary to come to the rescue of as many people and to grant as much assistance as in 1960-61, when we came up with the consolidation of debts. The total cost of assistance granted in 1960-61, including assistance in connection with the maintenance of livestock, production loans, foot-and-mouth disease and rations, amount to R11,914.000. In 1964-65 that amount decreased to as little as R5.845,000. It was no longer necessary to spend such large amounts on coming to the rescue of people. Because when we came up with the consolidation of debts in 1960-61 we in fact called a halt, granted the necessary assistance and since that time the position has been improving steadily. As regards the amount paid out as farming advances, only 2.34 per cent has been written off as bad debts since 1935. Does that not constitute an excellent example of the continuous improvement in agriculture in spite of droughts and other national disasters? Are hon. members able to quote better examples? I do not intend analysing the figures in respect of production and stock loans, etc. However, I do want to mention that the total sum spent from Loan and Revenue Accounts recently amounted to R18,782,000. The State Advances Recoveries Office has no fear that that money has been wasted. The office is satisfied that that money is being utilized to good effect in placing farmers who require such assistance on a sound economic basis. In due course those people will become full and equal self-supporting farmers, farmers who cannot be regarded as peasant farmers, farmers who cannot be regarded as debtors.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side say things have gone very badly with out farmers since the National Party has come into power. During that period of 17 years our farmers have been protected by the Marketing Act. During that period 21 different commodities have succeeded in building up a reserve fund of R120,384,000 for the agricultural industry. This fund is in existence to be utilized in case any difficulties should crop up.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is the real position as regards agriculture? What picture dan one draw in spite of droughts, plagues and the pessimism of the United Party? We have to consider the state of our agricultural industry against the background of the economy of South Africa as a whole. It is alleged that agriculture does not receive its rightful share of the economic prosperity in the Republic. Let us compare that position to the position in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>The other day the hon. the Minister of Finance mentioned the increase in the quantity of agricultural products. Consequently I shall not say a great deal about that, but I want to repeat that the gross value of our agricultural products was R376,200,000 in 1947-48. That increased to R980,400,000 in 1964-65. And that despite the droughts. The figure hon. members on the opposite side are fond of quoting&#x2014;and they are likely to do so in the election&#x2014;is the percentage which agricultural income represents of the total income in South Africa. They wrest that percentage from its context.</p>

<p>Let us examine that position closely. In 1947-48 agricultural income represented 16 per cent of the total national income. In 1963-64 that figure decreased to 9 per cent. Now hon. members on the opposite side maintain that agriculture is not sharing in the boom. Why are those hon. members not being politically honest by explaining why there has been such a decrease in the percentage? Sir, in any country where one has industrial development, agriculture&#x2019;s contribution necessarily has to decrease because the industries are contributing more and more to the national income. Let us examine how the percentage has decreased in the older industrial countries.</p>

<p><span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0538"/>In Canada agriculture&#x2019;s contribution was 13.3 per cent in the year 1951-2. In 1961-2 that figure was only 6 per cent. In the Netherlands the figures for the same period were 13.4 per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively. In Australia they were 18.1 per cent and 13.1 per cent respectively. Note how the figure has decreased in those countries. They are older industrial countries. What is the position in the United States of America? America is one of the older industrial countries where the figure should have remained more or less constant, and there the figure has decreased from 5.9 per cent to 4.2 per cent. The figures for Britain were 5.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively. Consequently, we find that the percentage in respect of agriculture has decreased in all of those countries. But will hon. members maintain that things are going badly in agriculture in those countries? No, they do not maintain that that is the position. We must be realistic, and we must realize that, as South Africa is progressing in the field of industry, so agriculture&#x2019;s contribution to the national income will gradually decrease. That simply is unavoidable. That is not a sign of hard times in agriculture. Hon. members who maintain that that is the case are only trying to gain the votes of the uninformed. The figure in respect of our gold mines has decreased as rapidly, but hon. members on the opposite side do not maintain that things are going badly in gold mining in South Africa.</p>

<p>Hon. members also maintained that agriculture was being neglected by means of price manipulation. That is another thing they want to take to the voters. Now, Mr. Speaker, against whom is the accusation of price manipulation made? I shall tell hon. members against whom that accusation is made. They make that accusation against organized agriculture in South Africa. As a result of this Government creating the Marketing Council and 18 control boards, organized agriculture has been given the opportunity of having their representatives on each of those control boards. Prices are not fixed by the hon. the Minister. Prices are fixed by the control boards. Consequently, any accusation of price manipulation is an accusation against the control boards and against the representatives of organized agriculture serving on those boards. And those representatives, Mr. Speaker, are farmers.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side also maintain that members nominated to the control boards by organized agriculture as their representatives, have never admitted to agricultural congresses and to organized agriculture itself that the Government allowed price manipulations which resulted in the farmer not receiving his rightful share.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says I am talking nonsense. When she is no longer a member of this House, she will have to eat her words, and I can assure the hon. member that she may choke on them.</p>

<p>Let us examine what the Government has done to achieve co-operation in this sphere. During the 17 years it has been in power, the Government has done much more than ensuring that its Marketing Council was organized in a way which enabled agriculturists to control and regulate their own affairs. It appointed a Soil Conservation Board. A National Marketing Advisory Council was created. The Consumers&#x2019; Advisory Committee was established. The Government also created various directorates under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. But most important of all, this Government has given the farmer of South Africa an Agricultural Advisory Council. The members of this council were not nominated by the National Party or the Government. This Council is the Executive Committee of the South African Agricultural Union. As an advisory council, this body has the right to request all documents from the various departments. When they have studied those documents, they advise the Government what policy, what changes to existing policy, and what administrative changes they deem necessary in the interest of agriculture in South Africa. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, some members of that council are United Party supporters.</p>

<p>All this means the following, Mr. Speaker: When hon. members on the other side maintain that this Government does not have an agricultural policy, they are saying by implication that the representatives of organized agriculture are too useless to lay down an agricultural policy. They are the people who advise the Government in respect of agricultural matters and policies. Has anybody ever maintained that their advice was not accepted? That their recommendations were not implemented? Sir, the hon. members on the opposite side are not going to get away so easily with that type of accusation. Those hon. members will have to account for the frivolous accusation that the Government does not have a policy to every member of an organized farmers&#x2019; association, to every member of every agricultural union and to every member of the South African Agricultural Union, because the representatives of those bodies lay down policy and advise the Government. That is what those hon. members are saying about agriculture and its representatives. That is the attitude they adopt towards the real mouthpiece of South Africa&#x2019;s farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the Prime Minister said our agricultural industry would be reconstructed. hon. members on the opposite side laughed heartily. Then the United Party suggested their so-called &#x201C;Demobilization Board&#x201D; for the assistance of farmers. But what has the Government done to relieve the position <span class="col_1057-1058" refersTo="page_0539"/>to a certain extent? A new department, namely the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, was created. This Department will have two boards operating under it. It is also going to replace the Fanners&#x2019; Assistance Committees by Credit Committees which will function in every magisterial district. Members of the soil conservation committees will be coopted to those committees. Every farmer with financial problems will be able to approach those committees and his case will be treated individually. I want to mention one or two examples to illustrate what the Government has in mind in this respect. In the district of Marikana&#x2014;that falls in the Brits constituency&#x2014;it was found that 141 morgen were subdivided amongst 41 farmers. Investigations were also conducted in the Northern Transvaal. Studies were made of the disaster area measuring 6.64 million morgen. We found that there were 565 smallholdings. An area of 21,000 morgen of land was subdivided into units smaller than 100 morgen each. Rural slums are created in that way. What did we do? Two senior employees were sent abroad to investigate in what way resettlement work was undertaken in Holland, Switzerland and Germany. Another person was sent to study the socio-economic effects of resettlement work undertaken in Germany, Holland and France. An investigation was conducted subsequently. The Tomlinson Report, which was brought out recently, relates to the investigation conducted in the Northern Transvaal. I do not have the time to read out all the recommendations of that commission. The commission invited all agricultural unions in the Northern Transvaal to give evidence. Before I proceed, I want to mention that the higher subsidy on the transport of livestock and fodder has been approved by the Government. The report also recommended abolishing the condition that livestock had to return in order to qualify for the rebate on the transport of cattle. In other words, when a farmer withdraws his livestock in order to give his land an opportunity to recover, a one-way rebate will be applicable. The Government accepted and implemented each recommendation made by the agricultural unions.</p>

<p>Time will not permit me to say a great deal about what this Government has done in order to improve the staff position, but I, nevertheless, want to quote a few figures. During the past six years the Government has made an amount of R11,414,000 available for the erection of institutions where farmers will be trained. Plans to the value of R12,598,000 have been approved. In respect of Agricultural Technical Services, there is a 35 per cent improvement on the 1948 figure. In 1948 there were only 46 professors in the faculties of Agricultural and Veterinary Services. In addition to their academic duties, they also had to perform administrative work. Consequently, they were not able to devote all their time to their students. And what is the position to-day? There are 64 professors, 92 senior lecturers and 48 lecturers, and those people do no administrative work. They devote all their time to the students and to research.</p>

<p>In 1948 there were two faculties of agriculture in the country. A total number of 479 persons received training at them. At present there are four faculties where 1,094 students are being trained. In 1948 only 30 students were engaged on post-graduate studies. To-day we have 352 doing research work and 189 receiving training in extension work. As regards our veterinary faculty we only had 58 students in 1948. To-day we have 176.</p>

<p>To-day farmers are being trained all over the country, for instance, at Glen, Cedara, Potchefstroom, Grootfontein and Stellenbosch. In 1948 only 304 farmers were trained while at present 662 are trained annually. The number has more than doubled during that short period.</p>

<p>All these particulars prove that the accusations of hon. members on the opposite side, namely, that nothing is being done for our agricultural industry, are devoid of all truth. Those hon. members furnished no evidence in support of their criticism. It is very easy to make accusations, but they are difficult to prove.</p>

<p>Over the past 12 years the Government has spent an amount of R4.402,000 on combating stock diseases, rinderpest, nagana, foot-and-mouth disease, insect plagues, wheat diseases, locusts and game. What is more, Mr. Speaker, that expenditure is not recoverable. It need not be repaid. Thus the Government has come to the assistance of agriculture, because a larger number of risks are attached to agriculture than to an ordinary business. And in the process the Government has not only assisted the farmer, but the country as a whole.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has announced large water schemes. He announced what tremendous areas of land were to be placed under irrigation. He said that our agricultural industry would have to be reconstructed. Only this Government, with the new Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, will be able to place agriculture on a sound basis once more. The Government will have to consolidate uneconomic units&#x2014;not land on which smallholders are farming as hon. members on the opposite side are fond of saying&#x2014;as is now being done in Holland, Germany and America. The farmers concerned will have to be assisted to farm on an economic basis in order to prevent them from becoming peasant farmers&#x2014;as the United Party wants them to be&#x2014;and in order to ensure that they will be intelligent and useful farmers, capable of feeding South Africa in the years to come.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister will forgive me if I do not follow him in the field of agriculture. However, there are one or two thoughts I want to express which have a bearing on what the hon. the Deputy Minister has just said. If the <span class="col_1059-1060" refersTo="page_0540"/>Deputy Minister believes&#x2014;as I and no doubt we all believe&#x2014;that farming is so important to South Africa and that we can overcome the tragedy of the drought, then I say that I, as representative of the Coloured people, am equally entitled to say that the Coloured people of this country are as important to the country as the hon. the Deputy Minister believes the farmers are. Mr. Speaker, without our farming population the Republic will not prosper. But without the Coloured people the country will be ruined.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in America the doctrine of separate but equal treatment was declared illegal in terms of the American Constitution. Because that Constitution says that all Americans are equal irrespective of race, colour or creed. In South Africa a different position obtains. The White man has made the set-up here quite different, and this Government has accepted as its policy that which it boasts incorporates both separate and equal treatment. This Government has boasted to the people of South Africa and to the world that our policy is one of separation but equality. The hon. the Minister may wonder what all this has to do with the budget. Well, Sir, I am going to appeal to the Minister to-day to disgorge some of his surplus millions for the benefit of the Coloured people of this country. Because, Sir, I am hoping to prove and to show that this Government is not living up to its boast. The Government has claimed that a Coloured university has been established in the Western Cape. Coloured schools have been established. They have promised that there will be no inferior education for the Coloured people. They claim that there are separate but equal facilities. They have said over and over again that in all spheres of our existence there shall be separate but equal facilities for the various racial groups.</p>

<p>U.D.I. is on the lips of just about everybody to-day. But the White man of this country also made a unilateral declaration some years ago. How many years ago this declaration was made I do not know. This declaration 1 call U.D.E.S. And the letters stand for a unilateral declaration of economic superiority. And ever since that time the Coloured man has been placed in an inferior economic position, and that unfortunate ratio of discrimination has been maintained ever since.</p>

<p>I believe that the time has arrived when 1 can say to the hon. the Minister of Finance and to the Government that there is no further need for this discrimination. If the Government is sincere in its policy of separate but equal development, then I say that I am entitled today to plead with the hon. the Minister, under several headings which I will mention to the Minister&#x2014;I shall not have the time to mention all of them&#x2014;to go to his colleagues in the Cabinet and say: &#x201C;Here is the money once and for all to remove discrimination in those cases where Coloured people render a service equal to that rendered by their White counterparts.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Take the case of school principals and school teachers, where the Coloured teachers in fact render a greater service than their White counterparts because their classes are bigger; their responsibility has grown. They render this service under the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate educational facilities for the Coloureds, but despite this country&#x2019;s wealth, despite the phenomenal economic growth of which we are so proud and about which we boast to the world, we have not yet removed this cancerous growth in our economic life in South Africa, this cancerous growth of discrimination between the Coloured man and his White counterpart, not on the basis of the service which the Coloured man renders but because of the colour of his skin. I am entitled therefore to ask the Minister of Finance to give the Minister of Coloured Affairs some of his millions; to disgorge it for the benefit of the Coloureds so that they can get equal pay for equal work. Take the case of the Coloured postman who works as hard as the White postman and who renders the same service, and yet as far as his wages are concerned he is discriminated against solely on the basis of colour. Coloured medical men in the service of the Government render the same service as their White counterparts but they receive a different pay. Sir, I say that this is an everlasting disgrace to a country which boasts of its economic growth and of the millions that we have at our disposal. I say, Sir, it is a disgrace that we continually suppress economically a class of people who are partly responsible for the success of this country and who have helped to bring about our phenomenal economic progress. Sir, the hon. the Minister knows that without the Coloureds we would not have had this phenomenal progress. That applies not only to the Coloureds but to the other non-Whites of this country. Sir, you will not allow me to refer to them in this debate but we have on our desks Bills dealing with pensions and other matters and which indicate that we persist in carrying on with this discrimination. Take the question of pensions. I am not going to refer to civil pensions because it may be said that my case is not as good in the case of civil pensions as in the case of military pensions. Let us therefore take the case of military pensions. Why should a Coloured man who went to war and who was maimed for life receive a smaller pension than the White man, who may have been a poor White and whose economic position may have been worse than that of the Coloured man. Why should the White man receive twice as much as the Coloured man? Sir, we do not have to pursue this discriminatory policy. I am not blaming the Government only; it is the White man of this country who is responsible, but this Government is in a position to right a wrong which has existed for many, many years. There is no further reason why we cannot pay people according to the service that they render to the country and not according to the colour of their <span class="col_1061-1062" refersTo="page_0541"/>skin. Sir, that is my appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance. He is the pivot around which this whole thing revolves. If he will give his colleagues the money which they require for this purpose I think we can safely do away with this discrimination.</p>

<p>Let us go a little further into this policy of separate but equal facilities to prove that it is a myth. In every phase of our life the Government has been proud to tell the world about equal facilities. When it came to the the question of an opera house for the City of Cape Town the Government said to the Coloured people, &#x201C;It shall be a White opera house but don’t worry; we will build you an opera house equal to that of the Whites.&#x201D; Similarly in all other matters they say to the Coloured people, &#x201C;we will give you equal facilities; don’t worry about the right to sit in the Houses of Parliament because we are going to give you a parliament of your own; we are going to give votes to all your people throughout the country and we are going to give the vote to the Coloured women.&#x201D; That is the image that the Government holds out to the world but they steadfastly refuse to do away with discrimination in pay, not on the basis of the service that the man renders but on the basis of the colour of his skin. Sir, as long as we are members of this House we on these benches will continue to fight for the removal of this discrimination. This morning&#x2019;s paper is an indication that it is not merely a matter of finance; it is an indication of the irritation which this Government causes the Coloured people. I read in this morning&#x2019;s paper that a certain lady who for years has taught Coloured girls typing in an office in the City of Cape Town has now been told that she can no longer teach Coloured girls in a White area and that if she wants to teach them in a Coloured area then she has to get a permit. Sir, if ever there was a stupid act we have it in this particular case. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister of Planning says: &#x201C;I am not guilty.&#x201D; He is only too happy to say that he is not guilty; I think he is relieved to be able to say it. This is a matter which falls under the Minister of Coloured Affairs who unfortunately is not here, or rather under the Minister of Community Development. Sir, what we on this side plead for is the removal of this petty, irritating nonsense. I want to repeat the old cliche that when it comes to a master/servant relationship it transcends all the apartheid beliefs of the Government. It is in order for a Coloured servant girl to work in your home but when a White person wishes to teach Coloured girls typing in an office in a White area then it becomes wrong. I challenge any hon. member on that side to justify that decision if they can. I challenge any member on that side, including the Ministers, to get up and tell us why a White woman should not be allowed to teach Coloured girls typing because her office happens to be in a White area.</p>

<p>Having listened to the Opposition with mounting surprise and wonderment I feel that they are living in a period of Alice in Wonderland, or should I say Alice in Blunderland? I can only say that it looks as though we have now seen everything. [Interjections.] I am glad to see that the hon. member for Point (Mr. Raw) is here. Sir, we have seen a regular circus here. It could be a Chipperfield circus or even a giraffe circus. The only missing act, as I see it, is that we have not yet seen the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) stand on his head. The United Party has made a complete circle. They have wobbled to the left and they have wobbled to the right. In 1961 their election cry was &#x201C;Eight Whites to represent the Bantu in Parliament for the foreseeable future&#x201D;. This has apparently changed, and it appears that the moment the hon. member for South Coast is in the driving seat. However, the 30 March will tell. He has assumed leadership at least for the election period, because after the election I do not think the United Party will be interested in propagating the policy as put forward by the hon. member for South Coast.

<p>When business was suspended I had just stated that according to a Press report the hon. member for South Coast had stated in an interview that there would be no non-Whites in the Parliament of this country; and there are so many United Party policies that it is really difficult to keep track of them. They make a long line of miserable failures, and their latest policy sounds like the windmill policy. It goes with the winds of change, in any direction, but just where it goes, nobody knows. Mr. Speaker, I think it is a case of the United Party having gone with the wind. Truly, Mr. Speaker, for the United Party&#x2019;s latest windmill policy it is the last days of Pompeii.</p>

<p>Sir, I think it is a great pity indeed that the Opposition has dragged Rhodesia into our affairs. It is a matter which purely concerns Rhodesia and the United Kingdom. I personally took the trouble to go to Rhodesia just after U.D.I. to try to find out things for myself. I talked to responsible people; I talked to the man in the street and I found that support for the South African Government was very evident as well as support for the hon. the Prime Minister. But I have a very interesting cutting here from the <i>Rhodesian Herald</i> dated 30 December 1965. The heading is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s attitude to U.D.I. has increased his political stature.</block>

<p>Sir, what do they say about the United Party and about the Leader of the United Party who appears to have tried hard to out-Smith Smith?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By contrast the United Party Opposition Leader, Sir de Villiers Graaff, has appeared the veriest political opportunist. He jumped on to the UDI band-wagon on the very afternoon of November the 11th with an emotional declaration of support for Smith at a United Party rally, and ever since has appeared to be vote-grubbing at the expense of South Africa&#x2019;s true national interests.</block>

<p>They go on further to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clearly, in the past few difficult weeks Dr. Verwoerd has been speaking for South Africa&#x2014;not to his own political book.</block>

<p>Then under the heading &#x201C;Lost Ground&#x201D; they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand. Sir de Villiers Graaff has lost ground all along the line. His first pro-Smith outburst was unfortunate but could probably have been excused by the fact that he was speaking in the emotional atmosphere of a party rally. But instead of backtracking, he has kept his political neck firmly on the UDI chopping block&#x2026;.<br/>But after Graaff&#x2019;s recent exhibition the United Party can hardly be ranked as an opposition party at all. It too stands for White domination, and if the liberal White voter is going to cast his vote at all it will <span class="col_1065-1066" refersTo="page_0543"/>be for a man who puts South Africa&#x2019;s interests before those of his party&#x2014;and this clearly is Dr. Verwoerd.</block>

<p>And then finally on this subject of Rhodesia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party has fallen sadly away; its leader, never strong, is fast becoming a political laughing stock. The election next year&#x2014;April is still the most favoured month though the Prime Minister refuses to commit himself&#x2014;will almost certainly be a personal triumph for Dr. Verwoerd.</block>

<p>That sums up very clearly the views of the ordinary thinking man in Rhodesia, and I want to leave it at that.</p>

<p>Members of the United Party have so often spoken in bad terms of our call for national unity, but in spite of their attempts to belittle the National Party more and more English-speaking people are joining this party. We stand for national unity in the true sense of the term. I want to say that I personally have never been so happy as I am as a member of the National Party, and I feel it is right that I should pay tribute to my fellow-Afrikaners, particularly to the National Party, because without their steadfast courage, without the political line that they took so many years ago, we would never have been in the safe and secure position in which we are to-day, and as an English-speaking South African from Natal I am happy to be a member of this party It has been proved over the years that the National Party&#x2019;s policy has been right for South Africa, and because of that we live in a Republic to-day which is sovereign and independent. I cannot help wondering where South Africa would have been if the hon. member for South Coast had got his way when he declared that he would contract Natal out of the Republic in 1960. We would now have been faced, particularly in Natal, with death by strangulation. Once again the United Party was completely wrong. Sir, I have represented Pietermaritzburg (City) in this House for nearly five years and I am very happy to say that in the last five years more industries have been established in Pietermaritzburg than over the preceding 15 years. Last year something like R20,000,000 was invested in industries in Pietermaritzburg alone and I want to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs who has been so helpful to Pietermaritzburg and to the Minister of Defence who saw fit to see to it that the Pietermaritzburg aerodrome, which is strategically placed, was re-built. Next year we hope that something like R35,000,000 will be spent in Pietermaritzburg &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Mitchell said his leader&#x2019;s speech at Pietermaritzburg in 1962 &#x2026;</block>

<p>He denied his leader. His leader has said so on more than one occasion, as I can prove from Hansard. In 1964, when I put the question to the hon. member for South Coast&#x2014;and I am pleased to see he has come in now and I hope we will get an answer from him. The Leader of the Opposition stated quite clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have also stated repeatedly that if I had to choose between eight Black representatives in this House and eight Bantustans, I would choose eight Black representatives every time.</block>

<p>That is from Hansard, but the hon. member for South Coast denied his leader. I wonder whom we must believe. Who is right, the hon. member for South Coast or the Leader of the Opposition. I hope that when the hon. member for South Coast can find the time to go to Pietermaritzburg he will quote the right speech and that he will tell the people in Natal where he stands. He will probably have to take another stand! He has often been called &#x201C;the leader of Natal&#x201D;, but I think he has been bleeding Natal. Sir, we are going to have an election and I hope there is another thing the hon. member for South Coast will do, and that is that he will tell the people about the secret report he asked for about his candidate. Captain Bradfield Smith, his bosom friend. Also known as Captain Bra. I think it would be a very good thing if the hon. member for South Coast would go to Pietermaritzburg, <span class="col_1067-1068" refersTo="page_0544"/>but I want him to tell the truth this time.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to waste the time of the House in dealing with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. He has been making statements about events which are a long way from where I am. The only thing that strikes me is that the hon. member objects to the Leader of the Opposition and this side of the House, being interested in what happens in Rhodesia, but he does not even have the courtesy to listen now. What he seems to condone is that he quotes chapter and verse from a leading article in a newspaper in Rhodesia, but I want to know from him whether he approves of comments of that type about the political position in this country and in particular in relation to the Leader of the Opposition? I think that is a matter which requires some explanation.</p>

<p>I want to talk to-day about two matters as they affect the community I represent. The first one is the question of concessions (a) in relation to diamonds and (b) in relation to fish. It has always been a point of interest to me, because of the people I represent, in regard to the granting of the concessions in Namaqualand. You know, of course, Sir, that when the Government decided originally, that there was some prospect of opening these concessions, there were something like 2,000 applicants. Subsequently the hon. the Minister appointed a committee or a commission which went into the matter and they made certain recommendations and the recommendations were made public. Something like 19 places were thrown open to prospecting by certain selected people, but the committee said its task was invidious because the interests of the Coloured community had to be protected and the White people of Namaqualand demanded a share of the profitability of the area, and thirdly, the interests of professional Coloured diggers at Barkly West and in the Transvaal, as well as interests in Namaqualand and Vanrhynsdorp, whose claims were exhausted, had to be considered. The first thing that emerges is, that of these concessions, which were granted over 12 months&#x2019; ago the Minister has said that, in six of the areas concerned up to 31 January, there had been a yield of 4,000 carats to a total value of R99.746. What I want to ask the Minister is this. Does he think it is fair to the Coloured community and that their interests are protected, when their share of the proceeds is a mere 5 per cent, and that the production in the Coloured area yielded 2,462 carats, valued at R69,000, out of the R99,000, which means that the Coloured Development Corporation received only R3,487? I want to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that that is a protection of the interests of the Coloured community in Namaqualand. My information is along the lines that the bulk of the diamonds in the Coloured areas come from Komaggas, which everybody knew had reasonable prospects of producing diamonds. The situation there is this, and what I want to ask the Minister is this. The company which got these concessions in the Coloured areas had made R66,000 in gross takings, whereas the Coloured community through the Coloured Development Corporation got only R3,487. I want to know whether that is a fair split, particularly in view of the fact that the White companies which are working these particular areas are composed of persons, who I do not think have had much experience of the diamond business before. I want to ask the Minister how the 5 per cent was arrived at, when those engaged in Alluvial Diggings know, that very much higher percentages than that are asked for by and paid to the promoters and the owners of diamondiferous land. Here we have a couple of companies, selected companies, one might say, which get preferential treatment, and which are getting these vast sums of money with prospects of more. I would like to ask the Minister what happened to the proposition of the three Coloured diggers, who were selected at Barkly West to prospect one of the farms and, having prospected it, the farm was to be worked by a White company. I have made careful inquiries in regard to this matter, and I can find no indication whatsoever that anything has been done in regard to the prospecting of the farms. But what I have found is that one individual has been canvassing the diggers, particularly in the Barkly West area, and trying to float a company with R1.00 shares, the idea being that the Coloured community would subscribe to the company to prospect this farm. I ask this, because there is a company here that has got a concession on State Land, at 5 per cent. I would like to ask what are the other companies in the other areas paying and I would like the Minister to tell me what he proposes to do with those companies which have not proceeded with the prospecting. Mr. Speaker, may I appeal to you? There is such a noise going on at the back here, that I cannot hear myself speaking.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you Sir. So we get to the position which I inquired into, and I ask. that in view of the fact that these concessions were granted, what accrues to the State as a percentage of the finds, if, and when they are made? I would also like to know how the White people in Namaqualand are going to benefit from this prospecting which is proceeding at certain places only in Namaqualand. I am asked these questions by the Coloured community, when I go about among them. They all want to know from me, how does one go about getting the Government and the Minister to relax and to relent, because this is an occupation, which they understand. and there are many who follow it. and the Minister has steadfastly set his face against giving any concessions to Coloured <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0545"/>persons in the whole of the Namaqualand area. I submit that that is unfair. It is not in line with the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. This looks to me like White development exclusively, and the Coloured community gets nothing. I can assure the Minister that the bona fide registered Coloured diggers are very dissatisfied, and they asked me how it comes about that they are excluded from these opportunities and that others are getting them.</p>

<p>Another thing I should like to ask the Minister to explain whether or not the companies which were granted these concessions were all registered and in operation at the time when the concessions were granted. How many of those were companies that had to be formed, or were in the course of formation, and how many of them have proceeded with the work? And, lastly, have any of those concessionaires attempted in any way to dispose of their concessions to other persons, and what is the attitude of the Minister towards those people when they do that? I ask that, because the Government is very firm in its attitude in regard to the formulae concerning gold mines, which are a national asset, and in regard to diamond mines. If anyone is so lucky as to find a diamond mine, the Government takes a sizable portion of the gross finds, to the order of about 60 per cent, but in the case of alluvial diamonds found on State-owned land, which belongs to the community as a whole, I am curious to know what the Minister expects to get from these people, who are finding diamonds or will find diamonds on these concession areas, and, who are not covered by the five per cent, which is paid to the Coloured Development Corporation in the Coloured areas. That is the first set of questions I wanted to ask the Minister.</p>

<p>The next matter I want to deal with is this question of fish. If ever there was an industry in which the Coloured community share, by virtue of the fact that they constitute almost 100 per cent of the labour force, it is this industry. Here is a case where they ought, in my opinion, to share in it to a far greater extent than they do. In issuing the quotas for fish and lobsters. I asked the Minister of Coloured Affairs a question during last session. and he replied, that the Coloured Development Corporation was getting a quota of 10.000 cases of fish and that he had an arrangement with other companies for the processing and exporting of the fish. During this Session I got the reply that there are five companies which enjoy the Coloured quota and that they have put out 630 units of 20 lbs. of frozen fish and* 1,480 cases of live units. We know, of course, that the business of exporting live units is very lucrative and again I should like to ask the Minister concerned why is it that no Coloured person has had any opportunity of sharing in these concessions. What motivates the Government in allocating these concessions to these companies? These are the questions the people ask me and they tell me that as a member of Parliament I ought to know. But when one examines the various prospectuses of the various companies that enjoy fishing quotas, one finds quite a number of M.P.s figuring there. To me it is strange that these lucrative contracts are awarded, and the question immediately arises on what basis they are allocated, not only in regard to this very small issue in regard to the Coloured Development Corporation but in regard to the lobster quotas on the whole. You see, Sir, it has been suggested by reports in the Press, which the Minister has undoubtedly seen, that this tremendous asset of lobster-fishing and other fish, and fishmeal also&#x2014;we heard talk this morning about sweepstakes, but I might say that a fishing quota is a dead certainty. According to one newspaper, it is tantamount to the right to print money, because these quotas go on. According to the fishing quotas for lobster, 59 companies share the quota, and one wonders whether these people pay anything to the Government, to the Treasury, other than the licence fees for the quotas. And on what basis are these allocations made?</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know, but what strikes one when examining these lists is that one finds some strange things. I have one case in front of me where a man with a factory 600 miles from the sea has a quota, and to my own certain knowledge he cans peaches and asparagus. Let it be admitted that he may have another factory somewhere else. I do not know, but I would like to know on what basis the allocations are made. An ex-member of Parliament&#x2019;s name figures in his own right &#x2026; [Interjection.] As far as I know, there was no fishing business there. He has gone now. Then there is a third one where one finds that a member of the Development Corporation has a quota in his name or in the name of a person, which is exactly the same and with the same initials. Now, the Coloured community and other people also ask me how these concessions are doled out, and I think the time has come when there should be some statement by the Minister on the basis of how it is done. Over the years there has been considerable dissatisfaction&#x2014; I do not want to traverse old ground&#x2014;about the fishing quotas in South West Africa, when two new companies got licences, the one at Walvis Bay and the other at Luderitz, and old-established companies were overlooked. When one looks at the list of shareholders of the successful companies, those who got the shares in the one company, one is surprised at the familiar names that appear. One wonders how one can get into this business. Then there is a third company. The number of shares which had to be allocated to other companies was in excess of one million; I take an interest in this purely from the point of view of the fisherman who catch the fish. They get well paid for it, but they would like to see themselves getting on to the boards of <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0546"/>directors, the people who get the concessions. Now they seem to be faced with this tremendous wall which they cannot pass, and as their representative in Parliament I cannot help them, so I ask the Minister to help me. Let the Minister tell me what I must tell these people so that they can also share in this wealth.</p>

<p>Now we come even closer home. Recently, from Press reports, a very small fishing concern catching lobster was purchased by a big insurance company. Again we find the names of certain Members of Parliament appearing on this, and the statement was made that they hope to get a fishmeal factory. The original company did not have that, according to my information, so one must ask what is happening; how do you go about it? You see, Sir, there are 14 fishmeal factories in the Cape handling 480,000 tons of fish, and there are eight factories in South West doing almost double that amount&#x2014;720,000. In spite of that, another company comes into the picture, and there is talk that the shares which were 50 cents each at that time, would soon rise. Whether they have gone up or not I do not know. But the point I want to make there is that money is being made, not so much in the merchandizing of the fish, but in the merchandizing of shares. I would like the Minister to give us some idea as to what control there is, because this is a national asset. Lobsters are not like taking a few diamonds out of the ground, which you can only find once. The fish breed and, when one sees the tremendous quotas being given to new companies, one immediately wonders, whether the fishing is not being overdone and whether some sort of control should not be applied, and whether or not the fishing companies should not even be controlled directly. Because, to get a fish quota&#x2014;this is what the Coloured men tell me and they should know&#x2014;involves big money, and one often wonders to what extent the Treasury benefits from this enormous amount of money which is being merchandized in the lobster industry.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Another strange thing is this: that one of these quotas was given to a gentleman in Springs. I honestly feel the time has come when the Minister of Finance should look into this matter, because I believe he is losing a very fruitful source of revenue. It seems to me that in the same way that other industries are paying into the Treasury, this is an industry which should be looked at, not so much from the profit angle where the Government taxes the profits in the way of companies&#x2019; tax, but from the procuring angle, when and how the individuals concerned get the quotas, or know that they will be allocated the quotas. That seems to me to be the point. One has to know that there is a definite prospect of getting the quotas; because it is extraordinary that the shares of some of the older companies in the fishing business are not quite so good; they seem to be dropping a bit, but the price of the shares of the newer companies is fantastic. I say with the greatest deference and respect to the Minister that there is a great deal of public disquiet, and it is no use blinking at the fact. What I thought originally was merely a matter concerning the Coloured fishermen, I find now is a matter which goes far beyond that. These people ask me how the White men get these quotas. I want to know how they do get the quotas. I have no fishing quotas, but I must be able to tell these people what the position is when they put these questions to me, because there may be some of them who want to do something about it. I, therefore, feel that the time has come when a great national asset such as we have in the fishing industry, and which, in the opinion of some, is being over-fished to the point where we are going to start running short, should be protected, and I feel that the Minister of Finance should devote some attention to the matter. And I think the Minister of Economic Affairs might also give us an explanation. I was also told&#x2014;I only mention this in passing&#x2014;that an application was made by one of these new companies for an enormous quota of fish and it was granted, and there were objections from other fishing interests, and the quota was withdrawn. Now, if that is not so, I think the Minister might tell us. If he does not know who it is. I will be happy to tell him, but I do not think it is fair to bandy names backwards and forwards across the floor of the House; that is not cricket and one does not do these things. But the fact remains that there are cases which I think should be looked into, and that should be done fairly soon, because it would appear to me that the fishing business is getting into the hands of such an involved group of monopolists, so enmeshed and intertwined, that one does not know who is who. I think it would require an expert of no mean order to unravel all the shareholdings in all these companies. For that reason I make that appeal. I mentioned the case of the Namaqualand diamond concessions to indicate that what the Minister thought was going to happen has not happened, and that what is now happening in the fishing business is creating a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction amongst the Coloured people who are concerned, because that is an industry which, if the Government was sincere in carrying out the policy and the wishes of the Prime Minister, of separate development, then the whole of the fishing business should be in the hands of the Coloured people, because they are the people who catch the fish. My final point is this, that among these quotas I find a company which describes itself as a mining development corporation. How can a mining development corporation get a quota for fish? So I say with the deepest sincerity to the hon. the Prime Minister, who has granted me the courtesy of <span class="col_1073-1074" refersTo="page_0547"/>listening to what I have had to say, that the time has come to look into this question of the granting of the concessions both in regard to diamonds and fish or anything else in regard to which we want to grant concessions, to see that the State gets a fair share of the wealth which belongs to the community, and that we do not have so many individuals making a lot of money out of assets which belongs to the community as a whole.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Seeing that we are approaching the end of the Session, I think the time has come for me to examine two points closely. The first is: what is the character, or the reliability in the political field, of the United Party, of the Opposition? The second is: what is the fundamental difference between the policies of the two major Parties here? I shall deal with both cases in the light of what has become apparant in recent times.</p>

<p>In examining the character and the reliability of the United Party, I want to base my test on facts. I do not want to indulge in mud-slinging as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition recently did in connection with a motion when he spoke about the tarnished reputation of Cabinet Ministers. The mud which he slings I leave to cling to his own person; everybody will surely be able to judge the true value of something like that. I want to look at facts in connection with the nature or the character and the reliability of the United Party.</p>

<p>As an example I want to take the attempts to stir un suspicion among the Whites of South Africa that the present Government wants to take some of the land of the Whites and give it away or hand it over to the Black man. After the propaganda borrowed from the Basutoland Congress Party&#x2014;propaganda which has been used by the Basutoland Congress Party in their elections&#x2014;had miscarried, an accusation was made in connection with something I had allegedly said, and reference was made to a speech which I had made to the Congress of my Party in Pretoria in 1963. Now we must recall that I said the following on that occasion&#x2014;and these are my words in full as subsequently quoted in a pamphlet which was distributed far and wide and was consequently at the disposal of everybody, apart from what appeared in the newspapers. The words which I used there were published in English as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thirdly, wherever it might be necessary we will do what is customary in our country under the 1936 Act. that is, to repurchase or exchange areas now wrongly occupied, in order either to include them in the White areas or in the Black according to where they rightly belong.</block>

<p>The point of view expressed here was used to create the impression that I had said that White territory would be alienated to the High Commission Territories. On that occasion I had spoken about the liberating process in respect of the High Commission Territories, and I had said that if they were guided (like the Transkei and other territories of ours) to freedom under <i>our</i> guardianship, the situation might develop in a different way to that in which it would develop if they were guided to freedom under the guardianship of Britain, for the reason that Britain as a guardian did not have the same facilities at her disposal, in that it was not a neighbour. When dealing with our own Black areas, we operate on the basis of. <i>inter alia,</i> the 1936 Act, in terms of which certain areas were released, and those released areas result in additions being made to our Bantu areas; in other words, White land becomes Black land in terms of legislation passed by the United Party. If the heartlands of the Swazi, or of the Basuto, or of the Tswana, were under our guardianship and they were being guided to independence, then the Tswana areas belonging to us, and also the Swazi areas belonging to us, or the Basuto areas belonging to us, could be guided to independence along with them, and they would therefore receive the benefit of what could be added to their territories in terms of the 1936 Act (the Act of the United Party). Now I am being accused of wanting to give away White land, but all the time it is stated here in clear terms &#x201C;with reference to the Act of 1936.&#x201D; The hon. members, however, went along and took words from a different source. It so happened that within two days after the speech to which I have referred, so many misrepresentations appeared both in the Press supporting the United Party in South Africa and in the British Press in Britian, to the effect that I wanted to annex the High Commission Territories, that I felt obliged to publish a brief summarizing statement on 5th September, 1963, to correct the position. I had made my speech before my Congress on 3rd September. In that short summary I briefly stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thirdly, where desirable, the Republic would be prepared to help the Bantu of these territories to regain, by purchase or exchange, areas at present occupied by Whites.</block>

<p>They seized upon the wording of this summary, although there was the very clearest proof of what that summary of the third point in fact meant in the context of my speech. I therefore want to say here that this is a very clear example of the way in which the United Party, in its propaganda against us, in its fight against us, makes use of facts. It will conceal the true substance if it can only get a chance to employ some trick to make use of certain wordings in order to misrepresent our policy to the public.</p>

<p>In passing I may just say to the hon. member for Natal South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that over the years, when I discussed the way in which Bantu areas and White areas could be associated with one another as development proceeded further and further, I referred to <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0548"/>mutual consultation. When they asked me how that could be achieved, I said that it could, for example, be done in the form of a commonwealth. I gave a further example by referring to the economic markets which have developed in the world. The other day the hon. member made the charge against me here that, after what happened in Nigeria as far as the Commonwealth was concerned, I had suddenly become afraid of the word &#x201C;commonwealth&#x201D; and had therefore substituted the words &#x201C;a consultative political body&#x201D; for it, although I had also said in between, &#x201C;the broader concept was what I used, the other was merely an example.&#x201D; Now, it is interesting enough that in that same speech of 1963, therefore long before the events in Nigeria and the provocation to which Britain and her Commonwealth were subjected there, I said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we were their guides to independence, South Africa would also be able to include the High Commission Territories in future planning on the basis of a common market for White and Black South Africa in cooperation within a consultative political body of free Black and White states.</block>

<p>There you already have the concept of a consultative body. The statement which appeared subsequently, also contained the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it is creating from within its own borders a consultative body dealing with mutual political interests, as well as another co-ordinating body envisaged on the principles of a common market.</block>

<p>The concept which he wants to present here as being a new concept which we are suddenly putting forward now, therefore is the concept on the basis of which we have repeatedly stated our position in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast should remember that I have said over all these years that what will develop here in South Africa in the course of time, will be a method by which the various states developing here will co-operate with another. and that it will be a consultative body in some form or another. I have made it very clear that that will apply to the areas to which we are granting independence, that the leaders of the national councils of the Indians and the Coloured people will sit on that body, and that it may be extended to the High Commission Territories, to neighbouring territories such as Rhodesia, and even Zambia and Malawi and the Portuguese territories, if they want to join. I have said that the various states will retain absolute independence in the political sphere, but that they will come together in that way to discuss their common political and economic interests there. I have also expressed the conviction that because those interests are interwoven, such discussions will lead to better relations.</p>

<p>Now, that is an example of how facts are abused, and the character of a party must be tested on that basis.</p>

<p>Then there is a second test that I want to apply as far as the

reliability of the United Party is concerned, and it is this: how consistent is their attitude, or how do they change their attitude as it suits them? I want to take one of the latest examples of that, namely the relationship to other countries. It will be recalled that over the years the complaint has continually been made against us that we create enmity through tactlessness, through lack of diplomacy, that in that way we create enmity between Britain and us, between the United States and us, between Western nations and us, between the nations at the UNO and us, between the African states and us. That was the standard attack made against us. In the first place we proved that that was not correct, and in the second place we proved that when the interests of South Africa were involved as against those of any of those countries, we would put the interests of South Africa first, even though it would cause repercussions on their part. The United Party nevertheless continued to make that complaint against us. Now the situation in connection with Rhodesia has arisen. In that situation we are trying to maintain our old principles of doing what seems right to us in principle as far as Rhodesia is concerned, but at the same time we are trying to retain the friendship of the other states in so far as it is possible&#x2014; while always maintaining our own interests. But the United Party, which has attacked us to such an extent, were prepared to slap Britain in the face squarely by acting in such a way in the problem which has resulted from Rhodesia&#x2019;s declaration of independence that they would not only make an enemy of Britain, but would also come into conflict with the United States of America, which has to a large extent associated itself with the United Kingdom as an ally. The United Party would, furthermore, have come into conflict with the UNO. which has become involved in the matter through adopting certain resolutions. It would also have come into direct conflict with the African states. The same Party which has over the years been prepared to reproach us for not having enough tact, is the Party which is now suddenly prepared to pick a quarrel with everybody, while one can reach one&#x2019;s objective in a legitimate way. I know that lately, in order to get away from the slap in the face they wanted to give Britain, they are again trying to swing about by saying that they are merely asking us to help to arrange a meeting between the two parties in the dispute, but that has come as an afterthought after they ran into difficulties. I therefore repeat that here we have a flagrant example of <span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0549"/>the way in which the United Party cannot even adopt a consistent attitude as far as its friendship with Britain is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to mention another example of the <i>volte-face</i> which the United Party has made, of its lack of stability. In actual fact it is such a preposterous <i>volte-face</i> that it assumes the character of an immoral action. In this case we are dealing with the United Party&#x2019;s latest statements of colour policy, through the mouth of its leader. We have all these years adopted the attitude, and it has been very clear particularly since we came into power, that the White man should remain in control in our country permanently. The concept that the White man should retain control permanently has been described in various terms: it has been defined as &#x201C;mastership&#x201D; (baasskap); it has been described as &#x201C;supremacy&#x201D;; it has been described as meaning that the White man should retain control over his own country. We have all along consistently adopted the unambiguous attitude that, just as we claim for ourselves the right to retain complete control of our future, so we concede that right to others. Accordingly we have stated explicitly how, for example, we also want to grant the Bantu who are settled in or fit in ethnically with their own areas future development which can lead to their independence. I myself have made the statement (and it was cast in my teeth by the other side of the House) that, just as the White man wants to retain permanent control over himself and his own affairs in his own area, so he is prepared to grant the Bantu control over his own affairs in his own area. But that concept has been attacked. That concept of White control&#x2014;that is all that mastership means&#x2014;has been attacked viciously. The idea of oppression, of hate, of immorality, has been associated with it, and for that reason it has been described as an ugly policy. That idea that the White man should retain control over his nation and his affairs in his own country has been slandered to such an extent that that slander has reverberated throughout the world. Ever since we came into power in 1948 South Africa has been faced with an ever-increasing struggle in the world, and that struggle has been perpetuated by all these statements and all the methods of attack employed by the United Party. Their statements have been quoted; the statements published by their newspapers have been quoted. I am convinced that the struggle at the UNO which has landed South Africa in the difficulties which have arisen has its basis in the United Party&#x2019;s resistance and method of attack against us &#x2026;</p>

<p>The attacks have been directed against our basic policy, namely that the White man should continue to rule this country permanently, in the interest of the Whites, but also in the interests of those people who are at present under the guardianship of the White man. but who will gradually become emancipated at a rate which is in accordance with their own interests. It is therefore perfectly clear that we have stated all along that the White man should rule South Africa permanently, and that statement has been slandered in the world. But now we find that the United Party, after drawing up various constitutions and planning various proposals to no avail, in course of time tried to woo the electorate more and more by saying that it also stood for a White &#x201C;something&#x201D;. That White &#x201C;something&#x201D; it sometimes called &#x201C;leadership&#x201D;. When, however, the people began to realize that leadership, if it was voluntary leadership, if it had to be the choice of the entire population, including the non-Whites, was something that one could not count on, the United Party moved away from what had first been meant by the concept of leadership, and did so by attaching a different meaning to it, by qualifying it. They moved away from the concept of leadership as a result of a voluntary choice to the concept of a leadership which one claims for oneself and which one retains, not only to lead, but (in recent times) also to control. Then leadership (they did not want to use the word &#x201C;supremacy&#x201D; for it yet) meant &#x201C;control&#x201D;. That is the word which they then used for it. It was also &#x201C;control for the foreseeable future&#x201D;; therefore a short period. But now during this Session the concept of &#x201C;leadership&#x201D; has been changed to denote leadership, meaning control by the White man, not as a result of voluntary choice, but by compulsion. What is more, it is no longer &#x201C;for the foreseeable future&#x201D;, but &#x201C;for ever&#x201D;. As a matter of fact, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition sees no time in the future of South Africa when the White man will be able to abandon that leadership. In other words, he, on behalf of the minority of the population, will have to see to it, by compulsion, that he retains that supremacy. That is nothing but &#x201C;mastership&#x201D;. And that is the <i>volte-face</i> which has been made by the United Party. The voters of to-day are expected to believe that the United Party is reliable when they see this <i>volte-face</i> being made before their very eyes in order to arrive at what is now being proclaimed by that Party as its policy!</p>

<p>At the moment I do not want to go into the question as to whether that policy is capable of implementation. I do not want to go into the question as to whether, if they are going to implement all the other little plans that they have, such as granting land ownership to the non-Whites in the locations in the White area of South Africa as well, and economic integration (in the sense in which they use that term), or social integration within the limits they impose upon it&#x2014;a little in some schools, a great deal more in the universities &#x2026;</p>

<p>In certain English church-schools integration is already <span class="col_1079-1080" refersTo="page_0550"/>taking place, and the United Party has not officially declared itself opposed to it. All that I am concerned with is that I do not want to go into the question as to whether, in the light of all their policies of the type mentioned, and also race federation in the political sphere and the kind of Senate they want to constitute, it will be possible in practice to retain that control. I am merely placing my finger on this one clear point, that they have swung round from extreme criticism of White supremacy to displaying a front of advocating permanent White supremacy, by compulsion, over the whole of South Africa. That is a further example on the basis of which the reliability of the Party must be tested.</p>

<p>I want to subject the reliability of that Party to a further test, namely by means of something that was said in this Parliament this morning. Here I am dealing with the tendency on the part of the United Party to take matters which have already been discussed and simply deal with them again suddenly at a later stage as though the other side of the matter had never been put. The example I want to mention is the statement made by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) this morning when he said, &#x201C;Economic integration is taking place here, economic integration is increasing, and that proves that the policy of the Government is absurd and impracticable.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, the question as to what is to be understood by economic integration has been an issue between the Opposition and ourselves ever since 1948. Hon. members who were present here at the time will recall how we drew a clear distinction between real absorption of the Black man by the White man to form a part of the economic community&#x2014;that is to say, in the sense of the Black man as a worker being able to rise to any position, being able to take part in any trade union, of even being able to become the head of any undertaking, even with Whites serving under him, that is to say, integration in every respect&#x2014;and his mere presence as a worker. Such complete absorption was what we called economic integration. We explained how, as far as we were concerned, the mere presence of the Bantu as workers, even when they might be used in various higher grades of work, was not the same. We said that as regards the use of that labour, because we had inherited it from history, we would in fact increase the separation progressively, so that in every sphere, including economic life, the Whites and the non-Whites would not intermingle, would not develop into a unit, in other words, would not become interwoven. This morning the hon. member for Jeppes referred to what the hon. the Minister of Finance said at the time, namely that if one had economic integration (in the United Party sense, of course, that is to say, in the sense of complete intermingling, of admission to all the various fields of work&#x2014;which they were advocating as opposed to our point of view&#x2014;the purchase of property for business purposes as well, admission to trade unions, etc.), political integration and social integration would follow. Now the hon. member for Jeppes has changed that statement so as to mean that the hon. the Minister had said that the presence of increasing numbers of workers led to political integration and social integration. Surely that is something else in respect of which we have always drawn a clear distinction. There is a major difference between the two points of view in regard to the way in which the presence of the Bantu as workers in our country should be dealt with. I say that that is another example of the way in which statements which had previously formed the subject of argument and which they then left alone are suddenly revived by them as though the matter was never discussed. I mention that as a further example of unreliability.</p>

<p>However, I particularly want to deal with the conclusions reached by the hon. member this morning. The position is that members of the Opposition do not take the logical outcome of their point of view and compare it with the logical outcome, as they see it, of our point of view, or the true logical outcome of our point of view. They try to make an attack (and in so doing to create a wrong impression) by simply placing their interpretation on our point of view, without at the same time examining what the effect of their policy must be. We find that the hon. member suggested this morning, &#x201C;If economic integration is taking place and more and more Natives are obtaining employment here, how can you ever hope to retain permanent White political control?&#x201D;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the hon. member&#x2019;s argument was that the fact that more and more Natives were coming in made our policy an absurd one. that it made our policy of apartheid and of White supremacy an absurd one.</p>

<p>Very well, now I ask hon. members: If. in spite of all the separation which we are deliberately trying to bring about (and our intention is in due course to progress to a point at which we shall begin to reduce the numbers of the Bantu substantially and at which increasing territorial separation will be brought about), the presence of the Bantu makes permanent White supremacy impossible, how can the United Party then say that permanent White supremacy is in fact possible if the United Party deliberately wants to allow all the forms of integration to take place? If they want to allow economic integration to take place, with the absorption of the Bantu as a permanent part of the population of the country, if they say that they should be included in the Government of the country&#x2014;by whatever method&#x2014;and if they are prepared to admit them to the universities along with the Whites, how can the United Party, which also wants to have them politically integrated in a race federation, then say, as the hon. the Leader <span class="col_1081-1082" refersTo="page_0551"/>of the Opposition has said, that is can see no time in the future when the White man will not be able to retain or should not retain that supremacy in South Africa? This again shows clearly how unreliable the United Party is in its reasoning. It wants to conceal the logical outcome of its policy by making an attack upon our policy on much weaker grounds than those on which it would have to attack its own point of view.</p>

<p>We therefore come to the conclusion that the United Party is absolutely unreliable, and that is the conclusion that will be reached by the electorate of the country.</p>

<p>That brings me to the second general matter which I should like to discuss, namely: what is the fundamental difference between the United Party and the National Party which is now becoming apparent? It is of course in connection with the colour problem and it is this: the Government&#x2019;s attitude is quite unambiguous, namely that we believe that history has presented us with two facts. The one is that there is a part of our country which indisputably belongs to the White man by reason of his occupation and development thereof, but that there are also other parts of the country where various Bantu nations established themselves and which have throughout history been recognized as belonging to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Historically?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Certain parts which have throughout history been the places where they established themselves and where they are still living to-day. There are parts in which they established themselves in the course of history, but which are no longer in their possession, and therefore those parts are no longer theirs. I am speaking about the result at the end of the historical development, that is to say, the stage we have reached at present. That means that the National Party adopts the attitude that we in South Africa have to deal with a variety of nations which cannot be combined so as to form one nation. They are different in character, they have different origins, they are different in outlook, different in colour and different as far as their standards of civilization are concerned. In other words, in this country we have different nations which are totally different from one another.</p>

<p>But there is also a second fact which has its origin in history. It is that, because the White man has so much initiative and, as a result, so much development has taken place in his inherited domain, the Black people came to work for him and large numbers of them still want to work in his area up to the present day. Furthermore, it is true that as a result of the protection afforded by the Whites and the opportunities of employment provided to the non-Whites by the Whites, they have not perished through famine or through internecine wars, but have greatly increased in number. That, then, is the second inheritance from our history. We accept that in these circumstances we have to try and find the best solution to our problems. The best is to do what has always happened automatically in the history of the world whenever attempts have been made to hold together empires containing various nations which differed from one another. In the end the various nations separated&#x2014;each with its own territory in which it governed alone. In other words, we have to adopt the course adopted in every other part of the world&#x2014;in Europe, in Asia, in South America, and in Africa at the moment. That is that one should recognize the fact that where there are separate nations, they should be separated and should be able to govern themselves if they are to be happy. That is why we as the National Party have unambiguously adopted the attitude that happiness for and good relations among the people of Southern Africa can only be achieved by means of separation in every sphere, <i>inter alia</i> in the political sphere as well. That means that there will be a White nation which can control its own future and affairs, and likewise there will be the various Bantu nations which will have their own territories and will have control over their own people. We accept the consequences of separation. We also accept that it will mean that the Bantu who work here, that is to say, in the White area, will have his citizenship in his own area, as is the position in the case of the Basuto who work here to-day. We therefore have one clear and distinct concept, namely that we are prepared to accept the principle that South Africa is not one country for one nation alone, but, like Europe, contains various nations, and that in due course it will have to be made possible for those nations to govern and develop themselves, within the limits of their potential, in their own territories, which also belongs to them by inheritance.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have dealt with their position many times. I have now stated the point of view of the National Party. Let us contrast it with the point of view of the United Party. Note that it is very clear that the point of view of the National Party is that there are different nations and that each of them will in course of time govern itself separately. In contrast with that the United Party adopts the attitude of &#x201C;one nation, one fatherland, one loyalty&#x201D;. Consequently there will be only one national government. Note that one cannot deduce from that this one nation will permanently delegate its powers to a minority group in its own ranks. After all, it is one nation with one fatherland and one loyalty. In such circumstances one would not by means of any paper policy be able to do anything but allow the entire nation to rule, that nation which has to be loyal to that fatherland. When such a nation exists, it is impossible to accept <span class="col_1083-1084" refersTo="page_0552"/>that one nation will rule in any way other than by means of the decisions given by its majority. Can anyone imagine a position where there will be one nation in South Africa with one loyalty to one fatherland, while only one section of that people will be able to rule for all time? I even want to ask, will that be moral? We have so often been asked whether our policy is a moral one, although we are granting rights to all separately. But now I ask: what the United Party wants to give South Africa, namely, only one father-land for one nation with one loyalty, while only a minority group of that people will rule, is that moral, is that what the world is going to approve? The inevitable outcome of that point of view is that that one nation will not be able to avoid, by means of any paper constitutions, by means of any declarations of policy made by the United Party leaders of to-day, that in course of time&#x2014; how long it may take or how soon it may be is beside the point now&#x2014;they will have to integrate more and more or will have to split apart more and more. If they split apart, they will split in the direction of apartheid, and if they become more and more integrated, they will become one mixed mongrel race under majority rule in South Africa. That is quite inevitable. It is quite inevitable that if one nation is formed here out of Bantu, Whites, Coloured people and Indians, with one father-land and with one loyalty, they will eventually serve together on a basis of equality in one army and in one public service, and that they will want to be educated together by means of one common system of education. Remember: that one nation has one loyalty to a common fatherland, and a fatherland is something which unites and cements together its people, because all are brothers in such a common fatherland. One cannot have one nation with one national loyalty and then say that apartheid is to be applied in the schools or in the universities and that minority is going to rule. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I said that I wanted to point out the clear contrast between the points of view of the two Parties. I have indicated that the Government stands for separation of the races living in this country; I have explained how that separation should be brought about to an increasing extent. With that I contrasted the United Party&#x2019;s point of view of having one nation with one fatherland and one loyalty. The people now have to make a choice, not only on the basis of the sincerity with which views are held or the thoroughness with which policies are stated or of honesty which penetrates to the consequences of those policies, but on the basis of the visible policy of each of the two Parties. On the one hand there is the policy that the entire White section of the population is to become part of a Black-Coloured-Indian-White nations&#x2014;a composite nation which has to swear common allegiance to one common fatherland in which the White group is to see its future as lying in that great process of unification which will be intensified progressively if there is to be true loyalty. On the other hand there is the policy of the National Party. The people will have to choose. I have no doubt that the choice will be unambiguously in favour of separation and the preservation for everyone of that which is his own, instead of in favour of amalgamation and the gradual process which must follow upon that on one foreign people being swallowed up by other foreign peoples, while in the course of decades or centuries to come power will surely and inexorably pass into the hands of the Black majority. That is also what I should like South Africa to realize, namely that the crux of the struggle for survival lies in the choice of either the right of survival of each nation, which will live in increasing separation from the others, or of a mixed nation, that is to say, one nation in one fatherland. The electorate cannot but decide against the bluff of the Leader of the Opposition, who claims that he believes in permanent White leadership, but at the same time adopts a course which makes White leadership absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I had hoped that the hon. the Prime Minister and I would be able to commence this election by finding a measure of agreement on at least one subject. He has complained of the misrepresentation of his policies and of the things which have been said about his policies. But we, Sir, have the same difficulty. We have had it over the years and we have complained of it over the years. We have complained of it in the Press controlled by that side of the House and in some of the newspapers in which the hon. Prime Minister has a great say. We have also complained of the manner in which news is represented and reported over Radio South Africa. I know that the hon. Prime Minister and I are going to spend the next few weeks trying to get a clear understanding amongst the members of the public of what our respective policies are. I am sure, Sir, that the hon. Prime Minister does not want to fight on false premises just as I do not. I should therefore like to suggest to him that the time has come here in South Africa where we should decide to use the means which are being used in most civilized states of the world, namely the radio, to reach the people in their homes. I should therefore like to recommend to the Prime Minister that we make joint representations to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and to the S.A.B.C. for both Parties to be given adequate time during the election.</p>

<p>We experimented with this system about thirteen years ago and the United Party got so much the better of the exchanges that I can understand <span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0553"/>the absence of enthusiasm on that side of the House for a repetition. But I am sure that in view of the complaints the hon. the Prime Minister made to-day he is three-quarters converted to my point of view already. In the last few elections and during the referendum the opportunities given to each party to put its point of view were very limited indeed. I think I am correct in stating that during the last election both the Prime Minister and myself were each accorded only twenty minutes at the end of the campaign. Well, it is very difficult to sum up a campaign, to get rid of all the propaganda innuendos, and to put the policy clearly before the public in such a very brief period of time. Therefore I would suggest to the hon. gentleman that we make joint representations to the S.A.B.C. for the Parties to be given adequate time to deal with their respective policies before the public during the election.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, that what has happened here this afternoon is indicative of the sort of difficulties which we have. We have the hon. Prime Minister complaining that use was not made of a speech which he made to his Congress in 1963 when certain allegations were made on what the policy of his Party was. But those allegations were made on the authority of a publication called <i>Bantu,</i> originally published by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and subsequently taken over by the Ministry of Information. In that publication there is no mention of any limitation on land promised under the 1936 legislation. Here the statement is reflected as being completely unqualified. So if the hon. Prime Minister and I had had our opportunity over Radio South Africa I think there would have been very little difficulty in clearing up misunderstandings of this kind. If the hon. Prime Minister wants to tell us he intended to limit it, then I can only say that here is evidence of incompetence on the part of the members of his Government in allowing a publication of this kind to be given out which shows quite clearly that they are not fit to govern the country. Here is this publication still to this date. Has there ever appeared a denial of it? Has there been at any time a correction?</p>

<p>Whether a summary or not, here is no qualification whatever. Here it stands. I have read it out to the Prime Minister before. But then there is no question about it that there was incompetence on the part of the people concerned. The hon. gentleman has also complained that much was made of the fact that he was no longer talking of a commonwealth to be established with the various sovereign independent Bantu states which he was hoping to see created out of the Bantu reserves but that he was now talking of a consultative body. The hon. gentleman is complaining that in the past he talked of a consultative body and that this therefore was nothing new. But the hon. gentleman will remember clearly that when he first raised this matter in the House and spoke of a possible commonwealth, I challenged him by asking him whether he knew what a commonwealth meant, namely that its members were sovereign independent states in no way subordinate one to the other in any aspect of their internal or external affairs? The hon. Prime Minister then came back at me with words to the effect that the Leader of the Opposition need not think he could frighten him, the Prime Minister, and that that was what he meant.</p>

<p>But is that still what the hon. gentleman means? I believe it is because when he talks about a consultative body or some kind of economic union then that is merely the first step in that direction.</p>

<p>The hon. Prime Minister also accused the United Party of changing its policy and its attitude towards other countries. He referred specifically to the Rhodesian issue and said that the attitude taken up by this side of the House amounted to a slap in the face of Great Britain, the UNO and the Afro-Asian States. He asked: &#x201C;Why do you do that when you can reach your objective in another way.&#x201D; Now these are the important words &#x201C;when you can reach your objective in another way.&#x201D; I think we must learn from the hon. gentleman what his objective is and in what way he is going to reach it. If his objective is to stay out of this thing and that it does not matter what happens to Rhodesia, if he is prepared to see Rhodesia being brought to its knees, if he wants successive generations of South Africans to say that Rhodesia was destroyed and that this Prime Minister bears a large measure of responsibility, then he is correct because then he can achieve his objective in another way. I asked him, first of all, whether he was prepared to use his influence with both the countries concerned in an endeavour to reopen the dialogue between them. But I have had no satisfactory reply yet. To-day I want to go further and want to ask the hon. gentleman whether he is prepared to examine ways and means of helping Rhodesia so that he would know what these means are in the event of the necessity of using them, arising. Because, Sir, there is an extraordinary situation developing in this country, i.e. the Prime Minister is getting support for his policy towards Rhodesia because people believe that while he says he is neutral he is helping Rhodesia under the lap. That is why people are supporting his policy towards Rhodesia. His own supporters feel very strongly on this issue. I believe this story of help is a myth. It is like the help for his Bantustan policy&#x2014;his own supporters vote for the Bantustan policy because they are quite sure that he is never going to give them <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0554"/>independence. The moment they have reason to believe that these Bantustans are going to be independent, then they will think again. The hon. Prime Minister says that we have changed our policies and that we can achieve our objective in another way. I challenge him to say what his objective is and in what way he is going to achieve it, unless his objective is that he does not mind what happens and is prepared to sit still and see chaos being created across his northern border.</p>

<p>There is another person, Mr. Speaker, believing that help is being given. That is why they say these things. But do they really think they can help without the outside world finding out about it? Are they really so naive as to believe that we can do all sorts of things behind the scenes and that the outside world will not know about it? What kind of childish game behind the scenes do they think they are playing? But I will take this matter no further but will leave it here. The hon.

<p>Thirdly the Prime Minister charged us with continually changing our colour policies. Mr. Speaker, it ill becomes that side of the House to accuse others of continually changing their colour policy. Because, after all, look how the colour policies of that side of the House have changed. You and I, Mr. Speaker, can remember when the Coloureds were going to be put on a separate roll and were going to be made second class citizens with limited powers. You and I, Sir, can remember previous Prime Ministers talking of &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; and domination. You and I, Sir, can remember previous Prime Ministers of the Nationalist Party talking about always retaining control over the reserves. You and I can remember the late Dr. Malan talking about a federal relationship between the developed reserves and South Africa. And now we have this Government with its policy of granting these reserves sovereign independence. And it is charging us on this side of the House with having changed our policies! As I said, accusations of this nature come ill from a party which has shilly-shallied and has changed its policies in respect of so many things over the entire period it has been in office.</p>

<speech by="#graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There are so many things, Sir, in respect of which they have changed their policies. And yet they come along and try to accuse us of having changed our policies and telling the public that they should not trust us on that account. But what is the burden of the complaint? It is that the Prime Minister is back where he was during the last session of Parliament trying to describe White leadership with words which I am not prepared to accept as indicating the concept we have in mind. He tried then to suggest it was supremacy, &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; and domination. I explained to him then that White leadership meant White political control. The Prime Minister complains that in the past I have said &#x201C;White political control for the foreseeable future.&#x201D; How far can one see into the future? In a debate we had in this House on one occasion hon. members on the other side interpreted the future as being one generation and that after that there will be Black domination. Now, Mr. Speaker, the position is quite simple. As far as I can see into the future, there will be White leadership. Let. hon. members on the other side say it will be five or ten years or for so long as their imagination may prescribe to them, it is the policy of the United Party that for the foreseeable future there will be White leadership. As a matter of fact, I can see no time in the future when White leadership will not be necessary in South Africa. Where then is the change, Mr. Speaker? We are back again at the old question of the meaning of words.</p>

<p>We have it again when we have to deal with this question of economic integration. According to the Prime Minister a Bantu may work for you, he may work in your factory and do semi-skilled or certain categories of skilled work even, he can work on the Railways and be placed in such a position where you cannot run your Railways without him, he can be so vitally important for your economy that you cannot maintain your economy without his labour, but, according to the Prime Minister, he is not integrated with the economy of South Africa. Well, if that is so, all I can say is that that is a concept of economic integration which is accepted by no English scholar anywhere in the world. Economic integration simply means that labour, capital, initiative, skill and things of that kind are integrated together in order to produce the end-product. Here then we have the labour which is economically integrated. The reason, of course, for this interpretation is the wonderful little theory they had in the past that if you have economic integration it would be followed by social and political integration.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, they have economic integration, but because they want to avoid social and political integration they have to say that economic integration means something entirely different. Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard such nonsense. They have got economic <span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0555"/>integration, and if they still believe that it is not going to lead to political and social integration, then I say they are well on their way and it must be obvious to every student of politics that that is the position. What is happening to-day? More and more jobs are being thrown open in the economy to non-Europeans. The hon. Minister of Labour knows it. He knows that he cannot go on without it and that the economy demands it. He knows that we cannot maintain our rate of growth without it happening. Mr. Speaker, are they going to suggest that that is not integrating labour into our economy? Where is the line to be drawn? This is a most ridiculous performance, merely to try and run away from the logic for which they have stood all these years that economic integration is going to lead to a measure of social and political integration. Now, Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister has dealt with what he referred to as the fundamental differences between the Parties. But he is first trying to create the impression that the public cannot trust the United Party because its policies have changed. What has changed, Sir, is the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s use of words and the meanings he is attaching to them. What is changed is the policies of that side of the House. What has happened all too often is that they have been proved wrong and that they had to retrace their steps. The hon. the Prime Minister proceeded to sum up the essential differences between the United Party and the Nationalist Party. The hon. gentleman, Sir, limits himself to Bantu policy. I should like to use his argument&#x2014;I do not accept the logic of it&#x2014;but I want to use the argument that he has advanced here about the Bantu. He has said that where you have the Bantu who accepts one fatherland and one common loyalty to one State and fall under one central Parliament, then the consequences are going to be inevitably that you will have to share your education with them, you will have to accept them in the army, and that you will have to accept them in the civil service. Now, Mr. Speaker, I say that I do not accept the logic of the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s argument. Now let us apply his policy to the Indians and Coloureds. He accepts them as members of one State, with one common fatherland, South Africa, together with the Europeans. He wants them to have common loyalty to South Africa. Must I now understand. Sir, from the hon. gentleman that this means that in due course they are going to share our schools, that in due course they are going to serve in the army with us and that in due course they are going to be accepted in the civil service? You see, Sir, it is no good using this argument only when it applies to Bantu &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister is trying to split hairs again. He says he is not going to make one nation out of them. Now. Sir, let us put it this way. Are the Coloureds and the Indians going to be South Africans under his policy? Or are they going to be citizens of separate Industans and Colouredstans? You see, Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s whole argument in so far as the Bantu is concerned is that they are not South Africans but citizens of sovereign independent Bantu states. If they are not citizens of independent Bantu states, then they are South Africans. They form part of the South African nation. They are citizens of South Africa. It says so in the South African Citizenship Act which was put on the Statute Book by this Government when it first came into power. If you want to apply that argument then I accept that it is the policy of that Party that the Coloureds and Indians are going to form one nation with the Whites here. They will have a common loyalty to one fatherland. South Africa. They will be controlled by one Parliament. Does that then in effect mean that they are going to share our schools, our army and our civil service? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>You see. Sir, the moment you say that they say &#x201C;of course not&#x201D;. Now, if it is &#x201C;of course not&#x201D; in so far as the Coloureds and Indians are concerned, why should it not be &#x201C;of course not&#x201D; with the Bantu as far as we are concerned? You see the ridiculousness, Mr. Speaker, of trying to apply that sort of argument. The hon. gentleman should know that that need not follow. For 300 years it has not followed. Anybody who says &#x201C;of course&#x201D; has to accept that he will have the Indians and the Coloureds in his schools, and he is going to have them in the army and in the civil service. [Interjections.] Yes, Sir, we had it from the hon. the Minister of Finance not so long ago. speaking of the Coloureds and the Europeans as five million hearts beating as one for South Africa.</p>

<p>You see, Mr. Speaker, this is the sort of argument that does not get us any further at all as to what is the policy for South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister says that we are not prepared to look at the consequences of our policy. Of course we are. What about the consequences of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy? First of all, Sir, if you apply his own logic, his is going to have a mixed State with one nation and one Fatherland, which the Coloureds and Indians will have to share with the Europeans. And they are going to be in the civil service, the army and things of that kind. And they are going to have four-fifths of their labour consisting of Bantu from sovereign independent black states which may be hostile to South Africa. They are going to have eight Cubas carved out of South Africa. And then they talk about looking at the consequences <span class="col_1091-1092" refersTo="page_0556"/>of our policy. Mr. Speaker, if you look at the consequences of the policy of the hon. gentleman opposite you wonder how anybody who has love for South Africa, who believes that Western standards must be maintained here, who believes that the White race has a future on the southern portion of the African continent, I say you wonder how anybody having those sentiments could vote for policies of that kind. Because on their own argument they are going to destroy everything. You see, Sir, when you ask me what the difference is, I would say that the first difference between us that is fundamental is that we stand for White leadership over an undivided South Africa, and that we are going to stop the dangerous policy of dividing South Africa up into sovereign independent Bantu states. We are not going to tolerate the establishment of independent black states on our borders. We want to keep South Africa as one country. It is one country to-day and we mean to keep it so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the childishness of this sort of thing amazes me. I am sorry it was 124 Blacks to one White in Kenya: 97 to one in the Congo and over 400 to one in Tanganyika. And the hon. gentleman tries to compare those countries with South Africa. Here, Sir. we have the maximum of four to one and if this hon. the Prime Minister had the statemanship to keep the Coloureds on his side it would be two and a half to one and he would then have a civilized people maintaining civilized standards here in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, we have had this argument so often that I do not think it is necessary to take it any further.</p>

<p>But I believe that the second fundamental difference between us Sir, is that we in the United Party stand for the maintenance of South Africa&#x2019;s traditional way of life. We stand for the traditional social and residential separation justly maintained.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Since when?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>My friend asks since when. When did we ever depart from it? The United Party always stood for social and residential separation. The foundation of residential separation that exists in South Africa to-day is due to what the United Party did and not this Government. We stand, Sir, for the maintenance of influx control but to be applied in a more reasonable and in a more humane manner. But we want no part in the petty restrictions which cause unhappiness and friction between the races and which has come to be understood as an essential part of the policy of the Government. Mr. Speaker, the fundamental difference is I think too that our policy is the traditional policy of South Africa. The policy on that side of the House is a new-fangled policy they thought out in the last few years and which they are changing every three years to suit themselves and to try and mislead the electorate. But they ignore fundamental differences as well. We are prepared to see the urban Bantu in their own native urban townships become a settled part of the community who will be on our side for the maintenance of law and order and act as a bulwark against communism. They are keeping them as a ruthless proletariat with their interests in foreign states across the boundaries of South Africa. There is, Sir, another difference that arises from this as well. We want to see the Bantu reserves develop to the maximum and we are prepared to see White skill and White initiative employed with this object in view. They talk about developing reserves, but they are not prepared to use the one means which will get these reserves developed at speed, namely the use of private White capital.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I enjoy this, Mr. Speaker. I want to say to the Prime Minister that I am sure he will take up my challenge. I am sure we are both going to approach Radio South Africa so that the public can judge who is slinging mud. Let them judge for themselves. Let them judge who is putting across constructive policies for South Africa. I am prepared to meet the hon. gentleman at any time, Sir, either separately, or in debate. Let us then put our policies before the public. I am sure the public will listen. [Interjections.] I was reading only yesterday reports of what had happened in the United States of America. On the great national occasion something like 83 per cent of the television sets in the State of New York were tuned in to what was being broadcast. If we could have that sort of discussion of the political problems here in South Africa, I believe the interest would be there. I feel sure, Sir, that the Prime Minister would support me in making these representations. I have indicated certain fundamentals and I wish to indicate a fourth fundamental where I think we differ from this Government, and that is we want to see a fair deal for the agricultural community in South Africa. They have been neglected for 18 years by this Government. Their numbers are sadly depleting. Now, speakers on the other side of the House have been using the drought as an excuse to explain the difficulty in which they have landed. Long before there was a drought they were leaving the land in alarming proportions but we have indicated very clearly that we felt that it was vital to have both a long-term and short-term policy to deal with these problems. I cannot tell you, Sir, how happy I was to find, not only the Minister of Agriculture, but also the Minister of Defence a convert to my point of view. In a speech he made earlier in this debate he indicated how sad he was about the position of agriculture in South Africa. He intimated how necessary it was to have a short-term policy to deal with immediate problems and a long-term policy for the rehabilitation of the soil and conservation of water in the future. Mr. Speaker, I have outlined that policy very often in this House. I have outlined the vital necessity of having a planned system of rehabilitation for suffering farmers during droughts. I have asked that it be done on a scale in which the problem was tackled of resettling ex-servicemen on the land after the last war. I pointed out, Sir, that there should be a new agency created, a new agency that would have vast powers to consolidate farmers debts, to arrange for suspension of interest for State loans, and to arrange that those loans could be cancelled in certain cases. This body would have power to arrange for credit to give farmers a start. And I pointed out the vital importance of rehabilitation of soil and the creation of a position where conservation farming was possible for the future. What do we have? I have been taking in this way for a year or two now, Mr. Speaker, but we could not get the Government thoroughly interested.</p>

<p>But let us go on. I think there are other differences between us. There is the difference that the United Party would like to see a stop put to the crippling of family finances by illness which happen so often in South Africa at the present time. We would like to see a State medical aid scheme with a right to call in your own doctor. Mr. Speaker, how <span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0558"/>often have we not pleaded for that and how often have we been told that it was not feasible or possible? And what has happened?</p>

<p>I think there is a further difference between us. It is a difference that has come out during the course of this debate very fully again. And that is that we believe that the Government has been unfair to its own employees in its failure to meet the demands made upon them by rising cost of living and its failure to adjust their salaries timeously to deal with those rising costs of living. We cannot forget. Sir, how we pleaded for rises from time to time. We cannot forget how often we have indicated that the old United Party scheme of cost-of-living allowances adjusted periodically to meet rising living costs was a much fairer basis than that which is being adopted at the present moment. Mr. Speaker, there has been no imagination. There has been economic mismanagement, but there has been no imagination when it came to dealing with matters of this kind.</p>

<p>Then, Sir I think there is a seventh matter on which we differ with the hon. the Prime Minister. We want to see old-age pensions for the people of South Africa without the means test. And that is why we propose a national contributory pension scheme. Year after year we have been told by this Minister of Finance with his large surpluses that he cannot afford a national contributory pension scheme. Mr. Speaker, these are matters that must now come before the public of South Africa. They must decide what it is what they want in this field.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we spoke about television. Time and again we have pleaded with the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to take steps with the view to the introduction of television in South Africa, even if it was close circuit television for use in the schools and in universities for educational purposes as a first step. Sir, why should we be the one civilized Western nation of the world denied television. This is a matter that has been discussed on many occasions. May I say that the United Party will take steps to see that television is made available to the public in the shortest possible time. I believe, Sir, that when that Minister is in his old age he will thank the United Party for the consolation he will get from watching the events of the world on his television set.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is one other matter on which we differ, and that is the question of a lottery, be it State-administered or State-controlled or an examination of the question of premium bonds. That side of the House, Sir, is not prepared to consider it. We on this side of the House has said it is a matter we are prepared to leave to the conscience of members and if the public wants it then it is up to them to see to it that they elect members who are prepared to vote for it in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister asked what the essential differences were between the two Parties. I think I have outlined eight main differences this afternoon and one on which there is common ground, that is that we will not brook interference in the internal affairs of South Africa. Mr. Speaker, I think the essential difference is that we on this side of the House look to the welfare of South Africa first and to party political interests second. If anything was revealed by this debate it is that members on the other side of the House are looking to party political advantage first and the interests of South Africa second. And I believe, Sir, that if the hon. the Prime Minister wishes to dispel that impression that he will support me in an appeal to Radio South Africa. Let us go on the air and let us put to the public directly, with no intermediary, what our policies are. Let us not leave it. Sir, to be interpreted by reporters in newspapers or by reporters over Radio South Africa. Let us go ourselves to the microphone in the headquarters of Radio South Africa and put before the public of South Africa what the policies of the two different Parties entail. I am satisfied, Sir, that if those policies are put and understood that the hon. the Prime Minister will get a very big surprise as to the attitude of the public of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_forestry,_of_bantu_education_and_of_indian_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY, OF BANTU EDUCATION AND OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>It is typical of the United Party and particularly of the Leader of the United Party, that he should testify here with mock piety that his Party puts South Africa first and party political interests second. And that, Mr. Speaker, came just after he had made a speech which teemed with inaccuracies from beginning to end, and which completely repudiated the views he held in the past. In explicitly repudiating on the eve of an election the views he held in the past, he dares to take those words into his mouth and to say that they are putting the interests of South Africa first and not party political interests. His entire view is one of party political interests, party political interests first, adapted to those things which will be best for him for the moment. In the course of my speech I want to point out a few of them. I want to begin, Mr. Speaker, by referring to the quotation he made from <i>Bantu</i> in which he said that the United Party&#x2019;s view in regard to what the Prime Minister was alleged to have said in connection with additions of land to the High Commission Territories, was based on what appeared in <i>Bantu</i> and that in this publication no reference was made to the 1936 legislation. I also obtained a copy of <i>Bantu,</i> the same one he had quoted from. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition quoted the following from page 628&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thirdly, where desirable, the Republic would be prepared to help the Bantu of these Territories to regain, by purchase or exchange, areas at present occupied by Whites.</block>

<p>And on this he based his entire view as if it meant that the Prime Minister was prepared to add to the High Commission Territories, <span class="col_1097-1098" refersTo="page_0559"/>beyond the provisions of the 1936 legislation, territories at present occupied by White people. But, Mr. Speaker, in the same edition of <i>Bantu</i> and in the same article, only two pages back, where the matter is dealt with in greater detail, these words appear on page 626&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thirdly, wherever it might be necessary, we would do what is customary in our country under the 1936 Act, i.e. to re-purchase or exchange areas now wrongly occupied, in order either to include them in the White areas or in the Black, according to where they rightly belong. That, too, would be to the advantage of the Bantu People of the High Commission Territories.</block>

<p>Explicitly referring to the High Commission Territories, the Prime Minister explained here in greater detail that it falls within the restrictions of the 1936 Act. In other words, Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition either did not read all of the article from which he quoted, or else he deliberately tried to mislead the House. Mr. Speaker, I think that such a great deal of wilfulness and dishonourableness on the part of the Leader of the Opposition as regard his conduct towards the hon. the Prime Minister deserves nothing but the contempt of the House and of all of South Africa.</p>

Then he started explaining what &#x201C;foreseeable future&#x201D; actually meant, but all the time he created the impression and made it clear that in as far as he could see the representatives of the Bantu in Parliament, as he would grant it to them, would be Whites. As he sees it, the White man will have to be in control of the whole of South Africa for all time. But, Mr. Speaker, what was his own point of view?</p>

<p>The hon. member explicitly said that he could not see that it could ever be different. Let us now look at the hon. member&#x2019;s own point of view in the past. I want to quote a few examples. I want to quote what he said in this House in 1964, only two years ago. I want to add that he bases his point of view on the fact that it is now the irrevocable point of view of the United Party that the representatives of the Bantu in this House will be Whites. He has apparently been persuaded to that point of view by the hon. member for South Coast. However, what did he say in 1964? In 1964, according to Col. 317/8 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have repeatedly said that it is the policy of the United Party that those representatives will be White, but we realize, and we are not afraid to be attacked in regard to the policy &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was brave at that stage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that we shall not be able to deny them for an indefinite period the right of being represented by their own people.</block>

<p>At that stage, however, the election was still far off. In 1963, according to Hansard, Col. 277, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of our Party is that Natives should be represented by Whites. We realize however, that it is impossible to deprive them of the right of being represented by their own people for all time to come.</block>

<p>However, let us continue. I have referred to this in the past, but for the sake of convenience the hon. member has always ignored it up to now, but to-day I want to refer very explicitly to an article he wrote in the American publication <i>Foreign Affairs,</i> when he wrote about &#x201C;Thoughts on an Alternative Race Policy.&#x201D; In that publication he wrote the following in regard to the Bantu; this is the policy advocated by the United Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be our earnest endeavour to train people in the reservations to accept increased responsibilities so that they may gain experience of modern administration and the ways of democracy.

The important point here is that the United Party is prepared to allow political institutions amongst the Bantu in their areas to develop in a part of South Africa. But that is not all. Then they want to grant them representations here. If one has such political institutions here, if one takes into consideration the trend of their development, then such bodies of local self-government can be nothing but Bantu bodies.</p>

<p>He says that that was the first step, that they will have their own political institutions there, but also representation here. It has been their point of view throughout that their policy was founded on a form of consultation, and in addition to that we should remember that the Bantu will, of course, have and express their desires and needs in this regard. Does he think that it will ever be possible to create a Bantu society to which one grants, in various Bantu territories, powers of self-government by means of bodies to which they elect their own people, and then to expect that they will be satisfied with White representation in this House?

<block name="quote">That is for the future. As an immediate step the United Party will restore the representatives of the Native peoples to the Central Parliament of the country. Parliamentary representation, which had in the past been limited to the Cape Province, will be extended to the whole country.

<p>In this passage there is no mention of guarantees at all. However, let us look at the hon. member&#x2019;s policy in regard to the Coloureds, to whom he also refers in this passage. I find it interesting that at its Congress in Bloemfontein last year, the United Party adopted an altogether new attitude, on the very eve of the election, an attitude which it did not uphold previously, namely that Coloureds, whom they want to re-instate on the common voters&#x2019; roll, will be re-instated on the roll in the case of those people whose names appeared on the roll before 1951, but as regards all Coloureds whose names did not appear on the list before 1951, higher educational and economic qualifications will be required.</p>

<p>However, they do not tell us what those higher qualifications will be. That is a promise which is being held up to the Whites on the eve of the election, namely a measure of protection for the Whites that too many Coloureds will not be placed on the roll, but then they continue to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Higher qualifications for the future Coloured voters on the common roll must be laid down to meet the change in money values and educational facilities. These qualifications must be laid down in consultation with the Coloured leaders.</block>

<p><span class="col_1101-1102" refersTo="page_0561"/>Can the hon. the Leader of the Opposition picture to himself that he has any hope of obtaining the co-operation of the Coloured leaders to lay down higher qualifications?

<p>That is the sort of legalized politics of which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) spoke. They will, of course, ask for lower qualifications, not for higher qualifications, and then he thinks that he will be able to lay down higher qualifications in consultation with them. On the eve of the election he wants to lay down higher qualifications for the Coloureds, but what was his point of view when he wrote this article in that American publication? In this regard I want to quote in reasonably great detail&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An alternative policy must be found. It should be a policy which will retain for the millions of White South Africans their standards and the system of values which they have proudly derived from their Western forefathers. It should at the same time be a policy which will enlist the will to share the fruits of the Western civilization with all those emerging people in our country who are eager to prove their desire to co-operate in retaining the Union of South Africa as a bastion in Africa of the Western way of life. We are persuaded that there is a community of one and a half million non-White people in South Africa who already satisfy this test. It is composed of those of mixed blood in our country, known here as the Cape Coloured people. They have accepted Western standards; they are civilized. The policy of the United Party therefore is that they should in every way be regarded as part of the Western society in South Africa, enjoying the rights to which that status entitles them.</block>

<p>Can you imagine that, Mr. Speaker, that he tells the world that he regards the Coloureds as part of the Western society in South Africa, and that he will grant them all the rights to which that status entitles them. How does he dare to say that and afterwards he comes along saying that Whites above the age of 18 years will have universal suffrage, but as regards the Coloureds, whom, as he maintains form part of the same society, whom he wants to recognize as an integral part of the Western society, he intends laying down higher franchise qualifications. Then he is dishonest, surely.</p>

<p>How can the hon. member tell the world that that is his policy and then not lay down any qualifications for the Whites, but indeed for the Coloureds? He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They should be placed on a common voters&#x2019; roll and be free to nominate and elect their own people to Parliament on that roll.</block>

<p>No mention is made here of any qualifications. But then he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any measure that may be necessary in the economic field to protect the higher standard of living of our civilized people should not apply to them.</block>

<p>In other words, here he tells the world that economic measures for the protection of the higher standard of the Whites should not be applied to the Coloureds; they should be placed on the common voters&#x2019; roll; they should be able to send their own people to Parliament; they should be part of the Western society. That is what he tells the world when an election is not near, but when the election is at hand he says that he intends consulting with the Coloured leaders, and after he has consulted with them he is going to lay down higher qualifications for them.</p>

<p>The Leader of the United Party is the last person who can accuse the National Party of changing its policy. He wants to suggest that the National Party has not always supported the principle that the Bantu Territories should be able to develop to ultimate independence under the policy of the systematic granting of self-government. That has always been our policy. That is the policy we have stated consistently. As far back as 1949 when the hon. the Prime Minister spoke in the Other Place, he stated our policy in this direction, but as far back as 1925, General Hertzog stated this policy as follows (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0562"/>The Native ought to feel at home inside the Native Territory. Therefore, as far as he is concerned, no other restriction ought to apply to him within his Territory than those which are necessary within every well-regulated national unit.</block>

<p>No other restriction than those which are necessary within every well-regulated national unit ought to be applied to the Bantu in the Bantu Territory&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is my aim that in so far as the Native is capable of it, he himself will, in accordance with the requirements of civilization, lay down the rules according to which he will have to adapt himself within his Territory. Yet, not only do I want him to be his own legislator in his own national economy, but also to manage his own administration by means of his own Native resources. Therefore, within the Native Territory there will be opportunities for both the Native politician and the Native official.</block>

<p>Here the policy is stated in clear language, a policy which is still exactly the same as the policy we pursue to-day. But now the hon. member comes along and he maintains that the fact that the Bantu Territories within the borders of the present Republic of South Africa will be able to obtain independence at some stage or other in the future, means that this Government is creating Cubas within our territorial boundaries. Now, I can deal with that provided there is time to do so, but I should just like to point out that the hon. member&#x2019;s policy contemplates the Bantu having to be represented in this Parliament, even if it is only by Whites. Le us assume, for the purposes of this argument, that they will be White representatives. But if the Bantu in South Africa will develop in the direction of communism, they would much rather develop in that direction under that hon. member&#x2019;s policy which does not offer them the opportunities of living out their lives to the full, which places constant restrictions on them in every sphere, particularly in the political sphere, and then they will therefore tend to become communistic. Therefore, if their inclination lies in the communistic direction, they will not move away from communism, but closer to it under the hon. member&#x2019;s policy, and the hon. member&#x2019;s policy grants them representatives in this Parliament, and who will those representatives be? They will be those persons who stand closest to their communistic tendencies. In other words if it were the case, as the hon. member says, namely that the Bantu in South Africa are inclined to communism, which I do not accept, and that we are allegedly founding Cubas in the Republic, then I tell him that through his policy he is bringing communists into this House, and in saying that I am not guessing; I am speaking about something I know. There was a time when we had Native representation in this House and surely we know what kind of representatives they elected then, because that was the policy of the United Party at that time. It was under their policy that representation in this Parliament was granted to the Bantu, a policy which is similar to the one they now want to pursue, and then they brought communists to this House. When we introduced legislation and measures to rid this House of communists, hon members on that side still pleaded that Mr. Sam Kahn should retain his seat here after he had admitted that he was a Communist. I repeat: the United Party&#x2019;s policy creates the opportunity for communists to sit in the Parliament of South Africa. Mr. Speaker, it is true then that the National Party&#x2019;s policy holds that danger? It may possibly develop in that direction, but if it develops in that direction communism would at least not be in our midst; we would not have that danger in our ranks; it would then be on our borders and then one can deal with it as one deals with an enemy, but I do not think that it will be the case.</p>

<p>That hon. member&#x2019;s ignorance is so infinite that one cannot speak to him about borders. I do not think that the possibility that the Bantu can at some stage or other be granted independence in his own territory in South Africa, need exactly imply the danger of communism. In actual fact I think that it is a possible method of keeping the Bantu of South Africa away from communism, because it affords him the opportunity of realizing his own national self-consciousness; because it affords him the opportunity of realizing his national ideals.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it may be Black nationalism. Hon. members on the opposite side use the other countries of Africa as examples to corroborate their argument that independent Black states would supposedly become communistic, but hon. members must remember that in those other territories peoples have not been liberated as we intend doing here in South Africa. Over there territories were liberated and in them various population groups were thrown together, and as a result of the conflict which developed amongst them, as a result of the fact that there was no feeling of national bonds in those territories, unrest and difficulties resulted; for that reason chaos resulted on which communism has grown. Another important difference is this: in the other territories in Africa the cosmopolitan countries destroyed the natural authority of the chief and the headman, who used to be the traditional ruler of the Bantu community, before they liberated those territories. In other words, they destroyed the natural anchors which the community had against communism and disloyalty, before they granted them self-government. Then they granted them a form <span class="col_1105-1106" refersTo="page_0563"/>of government which did not develop out of their ranks and which was not adapted to their circumstances. We act differently. The self-government we grant the Bantu in his territory is based on the traditional characteristics of Bantu tribal customs and the peculiarities of their own population groups, and they are adapted to modern requirements and from that basis they are developed. In other words, the circumstances which prevail here are totally different from the circumstances which prevail there.</p>

<p>Allow me to mention another reason for not believing that these territories run that risk, and that is the important consideration of the close economic ties of those territories with the Republic of South Africa. In other countries of Africa, in their process of being liberated, there was no such close economic ties with their parent country, the country under the supervision of which they had developed. Indeed there were, as a result of historic considerations, economic ties, but they were purely for historic considerations; they were not for considerations of contiguity and necessity: Let me take an example, namely Nigeria. What does it matter to Nigeria whether it has economic alliances with Britain or with Russia or with China? They are all equally distant from her; all of them can grant Nigeria economic aid which she may possibly need. Therefore there were no economically essential ties between Nigeria and Britain. It is a totally different matter with the Bantu territories on our borders in Southern Africa. For various reasons they are economically so intertwined with us and so closely connected with us that they will have to seek economic friendship with the Republic, and for that reason it will be in their interests to keep communism away from them. It is for that reason that I am not afraid that strong communistic development will easily take place in the High Commission Territories. Common sense will triumph amongst the Bantu there.</p>

<p>Yes, but they will not gain the upper hand. Even among the Whites of South Africa there are people who have strong communistic inclinations. Therefore one cannot stop communism, but in general I believe that common sense amongst the majority of the Bantu will triumph in those territories. For that reason I maintain that the policy of the National Party is really a guarantee against the growth of communism in those territories; it is a guarantee for the continued existence and the safety of the White man in South Africa.</p>

<p>I am really astonished that the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs, following upon what several members on that side and also the hon. the Prime Minister have said, still wants to make the assertion that it is this side of the House which has changed its policy and that the Nationalist Party, the governing Party, has not changed its policy since it came into office. He said that since 1949 the present Prime Minister had begun to intimate in the debates that what they intended was total independence and self-government for the Bantu areas. I also want to quote a few passages from Hansard. Furthermore, I want to read a few quotations to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On 1 May 1951, Dr. Verwoerd, as Minister of Native Affairs in Dr. Malan&#x2019;s Cabinet, gave the following clear reply &#x2026;</block>

<p>It deals with the Bantustans&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it goes without saying that White South Africa must remain as guardian over them. It goes without saying that when we speak about the right to self-government of the Natives in those areas (the Bantu areas) we do not mean that South Africa is going to excise large pieces of the country&#x2019;s territory and turn them into detached independent states.</block>

<p>That was in 1951. I can proceed and read the same thing from Hansard. Let me quote what the Prime Minister said on 11 April 1961, according to col. 4306&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Seeing that we want to retain our own country for ourselves and we also appreciate that they want theirs and seeing that we want to develop those areas for them, can you not understand that we shall bring discrimination to an end by coming together and consulting at a high level on a basis of equality, of equal human dignity through the establishment, for example, of a commonwealth conference of our own.</block>

<p>But let me quote further from the mouthpiece of the Nationalist Party. This leading article goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nege, tien gebeurtenisvolle jare later praat dr. Verwoerd as Eerste Minister oor dieselfde saak as volg: &#x2026; „Ek voorsien die ontwikkeling van ’n statebond van Suid-Afrika waarin die blanke staat en die swart state met mekaar kan saamwerk &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

Let me tell the Minister that if this Party comes into office&#x2014; and it will not be long before that happens&#x2014; the Transkei will not develop any further along the road to self-government as it is doing at the moment. And that is the policy of the United Party, that such a reserve will develop to a certain extent only, but that as far as its defence, its finance, its transport and its national services are concerned, it will not obtain independence. When it has developed as far as the Transkei has now developed, it will obtain representation in this House and we have said what kind of representation that will be. We have said it will be White representation. [Interjection.] We have said White representation in this House, and I can imagine, if that is the position under which the Transkei must be governed to-day, whom they would have sent to this House. [Interjections.] The Minister of Bantu Education went further. He spoke about these areas which have to be created and which have to obtain as much self-government as possible, and which must be represented in this House, and he insinuated that it would be Black representation, and then he asked further for how long there would be White representatives? Who can predict what will happen a hundred years from now? Is there anyone in this House who is so foolish as to predict what will happen in a hundred years&#x2019; time. There is not one such person. Is there someone who can predict what will happen fifty years from now? If we look back over our shoulders to a period fifty years ago, we would never have thought that we could have come as far as we have to-day. that there would be a government of farmers pleading for the establishment of independent black states. Could anyone have thought this twenty years ago? But here we have the protagonists of the Black man to-day, the most liberalist Government in the whole wide world, and they are talking about nations here in the Republic. The hon. the Prime Minister calls them nations, but they are not really nations as such. These territories of our country are not being given to nations. He calls them Bantustans; they are not nations, they are not even being given to races, but to national groups. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We said it repeatedly. The fact remains that it is not a question of the United Party suddenly revealing itself as the protector of the Whites in South Africa. It is the course the Nationalist Party has taken which has established the objective which we shall have to maintain, and if the Whites in South Africa are to be preserved as one unit then it is the United Party who will have to do so, because those people have neglected their duties to the Whites.</p>

<p><span class="col_1109-1110" refersTo="page_0565"/>I had hoped I would find time to discuss agricultural matters, but my time is running out. In the time remaining to me I want to confine myself to agriculture, because I have not yet had an opportunity of talking about that subject in this debate. I cannot deal with all the aspects of our agriculture, but I want to limit myself more specifically to animal husbandry. Before coming to that, however, I just want to point out that the import figures for agriculural products over the past six months, as recently furnished to me by the Minister, are almost 15,000,000 pounds of butter and 3,350,000 pounds of cheese. In addition to that we are importing 1,750,000 bags of mealies, and although the Minister said that it is not expected that it will be necessary to import any more mealies, it was nevertheless stated by responsible bodies that it might be necessary to import 10,000,000 bags of mealies.</p>

<p>We hope it will not be necessary to import again. I have already mentioned dairy products, and now I want to deal with meat, and want to mention the following figures. In 1964, during the last six months, from July to December, 452,000 cattle were slaughtered in this country in the controlled areas, and in the six months of 1965 570,000 cattle were slaughtered. In other words, the number of cattle additional to the number slaughtered during the previous period of six months was 120,000. As far as sheep are concerned the position is almost worse, because in 1964 it was 1,790,000 and in 1965 it was 2,105,000. That is over 300,000 additional sheep. As far as pigs were concerned the position was almost the same. There is no Minister of Agriculture present at the moment. I want to put a question to the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, he who has said repeatedly that things are going very well with the farmers. He read out so many statistics to-day in order to show how well things were going with the farmers that it sounded almost like a machine gun. They are no longer borrowing money from the Land Bank, they are no longer going bankrupt and they are just as rich as they have always been. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I did not want to appeal to you, but I cannot hear myself speaking. I am asking the Deputy Minister whether he is convinced that the country has so many extra cattle that we could afford to slaughter 120,000 additional cattle, and more than 300,000 additional sheep? No, he will not say, because he is just as convinced as I am that the people were slaughtering up their cattle because the drought was ruining them and they were being forced to send the cattle to the controlled markets. I want to lay this accusation squarely at the door of the only Minister of Agriculture present here to-day, that the Government&#x2019;s treatment of the farmers during the drought was one of the most disgraceful things this country has ever experienced and I want to support that accusation.</p>

<p>Fodder subsidies, etc., are all very well, but where is the master

plan to protect livestock against a drought which we have been struggling for three to five years now to get the Minister to accept? I myself have been pleading here since 1961 for the establishment of a fodder bank. What happened? In 1965 the Transvaal Agricultural Union asked for people from the army to cut grass along the national roads and the railways. In 1964 I raised a plea and said that this country has great reserves of roughage and I even mentioned the chaff which was lying rotting on the land in the winter rainfall areas, whereupon many members on the opposite side said I was talking rubbish <i>(kaf).</i> Subsequently that chaff became so valuable that people were ordering it from far and wide at 30c a bale and adding molasses to it in order to keep the animals alive. But what did the Government do? Let me mention an example. I want to talk about what a neighbouring state did during the terrible drought which affected them too, and when I am talking about a neighbouring state I am talking about a neighbouring state the Government of which we do not want to recognize because we are too afraid to do so. But what did this neighbouring state do? I want to mention this to show what is meant by planning in times of drought. They announced more than two months ago that in large areas which they regarded as being drought-stricken areas they would buy up the cattle at fixed prices; and what were those prices? They announced these prices beforehand. They said they would pay 72s. 6d. per hundred lbs. live weight for year-old calves. The Government would buy up the cattle. For two year old cattle the price was 67s. 6d., and for three year old cattle they would pay 62s. 6d. They would remove all the animals themselves. They advised the farmers to sell the cattle in order to rehabilitate the veld. They sent a representative from the cold-storage plant, one representative from the Government and one from the farmers, who placed the cattle on the scales on the farmer&#x2019;s farm. They encouraged the farmers to send the cattle to areas where there was sufficient grass so that the animals could stay alive and so that the farmer could rehabilitate his veld. At the moment they are moving 200,000 cattle across the Limpopo River, and they are moving 1,000 cattle per day in trucks and a 1,000 on the hoof. This is how they have planned. Not content with going so far, they went even further. They said to the farmer whose cattle they were buying up: When you restock your farm with cattle we will subsidize you to the extent of between £5. 10s. to £3. 10s. an animal, depending upon the age. They are selling the purchased animals to those people who can take them at the purchase price plus 17s. a head for administration, and when these <span class="col_1111-1112" refersTo="page_0566"/>cattle are sold again the farmer pays the capital plus 4 per cent interest. That is planning. I was there 14 days ago and I sold half of my cattle to the Government under that scheme because it is a safe one. Not only do I get my money from the Government and not only are the animals safely off the farm, but when I buy them back one day I am subsidized. We are always being asked where the United Party&#x2019;s policy is. Whenever we pleaded for fodder banks and for the preservation of our breeding stock, our requests are never complied with. What is it the hon. the Minister of Agriculture told me last year when I reminded him of the scheme I had recommended in 1964? We had warned that there should be planning as the drought was becoming heavier and heavier. The Minister said: Suppose for a moment the hon. member was a sheep farmer. This was after I had told him about that scheme under which the stock are taken away to areas where grass is available, the man is financed there so that he can buy the sheep and it is made possible for him to do so by charging a low rate of interest, thus preventing the people from slaughtering their breeding stock. He then said: Suppose for a moment the hon. member was a sheep farmer in the Karroo, it was dry on his farm and his animals were dying from the drought; what would he do? He said that the Government would then be lending money to other people to buy up the sheep so that there would not be too many sheep on the farm. He said it would be a short-sighted policy: But how else must the animals in the drought areas be saved? What did the Minister do? He spoke about fodder subsidies and railway subsidies. The Agricultural Unions and Vleissentraal had to place hundreds of officials at the disposal of the farmers to go round frantically loking for veld and finding out where the livestock could be moved to. Municipalities even offered grazing in heartwater areas where one did not dare send cattle and in their ignorance the people sent the cattle there because they were at their wit&#x2019;s end under this Government in the drought. I am not taking advantage of the situation. These are not election speeches. We have been experiencing these drought conditions for three years now, but the hon. the Minister does not want to respond to any suggested method of taking preventive action against the drought. But now, at this late stage, at the end of this short session, an agricultural finance bill is being brought forward which will not even be passed in time. I ask you, Sir, whether this is the way in which to take care of and rehabilitate the farmer? And then the hon. the Prime Minister talks about the farmers in that emotional tone of voice which he used the other day, and the Minister of Defence reveals himself as the patron of agriculture. Those were all election speeches. This is their policy to save agriculture</p>

<p>I have very little time left, but I want to deal with one other aspect. I want to proceed to a point which I made last year and the year before, and that is in connection with the areas of the Ciskei and the Transkei, and the lack of clarity on the part of this Government in regard to this matter. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>I am talking about the lack of demarcation lines between those two areas which are growing nearer and nearer to one another. We do not know whether the two lines of demarcation of the Corridor will not eventually merge. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Somerset-East said last year that 72,000 morgen of land still remained to be disposed of, but it is compensatory land and will be done on an exchange basis. But in some places the Corridor is already eight miles wide. Sir, the voters of East London have a major suspicion that they will later have to become the White island in a Black sea. The voters of East London and King William&#x2019;s Town and of those areas which are being pinched together between the pressure of a Ciskei which still has to be declared and a Transkei which has already been declared&#x2014;not one of which have a boundary&#x2014;are beginning to regard the behaviour of the Government very sceptically. In reply to two questions of mine last year it was said that the Government hopes to maintain the Corridor there. Is it the Government&#x2019;s intention to do so? If it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to maintain the Corridor, it is high time the Government tells us where the boundaries of the Corridor are. Then we will know whether it is being maintained or not. [Interjection.] I know very well what is going on there. The Minister knows that I have already come to see him in his office about that matter. But I want to give the hon. the Minister the assurance that if this Government does not want to give clarity in regard to this matter of where the boundary lines between the existing Bantustans, of the Transkei and the Ciskei, are&#x2014;and land still remains to be purchased, and this must happen in the natural way, so that they do not grow away from one another &#x2026; [Interjection.] But the Minister will not reply. I repeat that as long as this Government tries to throw dust in the eyes of the voters of the country, (a) in regard to the establishment of the Bantustans and their independence, and (b) in regard to where their boundaries are, the voters will not follow blindly after the Government. I predict the time; I see it coming. There is only dissatisfaction in the country districts in regard to the agricultural policy, because the Government has no agricultural policy and that is why agriculture is in such a sorry state. This is something which developed slowly over a long period of time. Just as the farmers are not as solidly behind the Government as they were a few years ago, so too the people are not solidly behind this Government in regard to this Bantustan policy. They do not believe that story anymore.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one is sorely tempted to take part in the general debate, particularly after the interesting and very illuminating speech by the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. However, I have a duty to perform and before I can indulge myself I shall have to dispose of the financial case that has been put up in this debate, because after all, this is supposed to be chiefly a financial debate. But I am afraid that the financial debate from the Opposition side has been particularly thin, more so even than in the past. There were a few questions put to me to which I shall reply in due course. There were a few rather infantile calculations made about the state of the Fiscus in the course of the next year, and then we had a very spirited attack, a spirited attempt to denigrate the economy of South Africa. Those are really the three main ingredients I have to deal with. Now, I must confess that I really expected something much more impressive, both as regards criticism and as regards constructive financial thinking from the Opposition on the eve of an election. I say this particularly because they have been very vocal in their criticisms outside this House. There were quite a number of criticisms which were levelled at the policies we have followed in the past 12 months, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition showed himself as one of the financial experts on the opposite side of the House. Perhaps I shall have time to explain the rudiments of public finance to him.</p>

<p>I now come, in the first place, to the calculations of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) who, I think, was joined by the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin). They calculated that in the course of the next financial year I would have to tax the country to the extent of R220.000.000. Well, that is a very excellent exercise, but it is more designed for the nursery than for the debating Chamber, and I will tell hon. members why I am not prepared to take part in this little exercise. After all, in dealing with matters of this nature there are so many incalculable factors that angels fear to tread on this particular field. Therefore hon. members must pardon me if I do not take part in this exercise of estimating what the degree of taxation or the surplus or the deficit will be in the course of the next year.</p>

<p>There is, however, one point I should like to stress. The hon. member for Constantia based his little exercise on two premises. The one is that because in the Part Appropriation provision was made for seven months of last year plus 5f per cent, he assumed that that meant there was going to be an increase of 5| per cent in expenditure. That is the one premise in which he is wrong. The other premise was that income would remain static in the coming year; there would be no increase in income tax in the next year. Now he says that if the expenditure is up by 5| per cent and the income is the same or perhaps a little down, then there must be a deficit at the end of the year. As far as this premise is concerned, there is one little point that the hon. member for Constantia overlooked, and that is the fact that he has not taken into account the potential productive capacity which has been caused by the large imports of capital goods in the past two years particularly. These imports of capital goods have been one of the reasons for the disequilibrium in our balance of payments on current account, but at the same time they have increased our total productive capacity, because all those capital goods which were imported during the last two years must come into use from now on and in the future. In other words, there is an increase in the productive capacity because there has been this tremendous importation of capital goods in the last two years. That is the point that the hon. member overlooked altogether. Because, if there is increased productive capacity and increased productivity, then incomes and income tax cannot remain stationary, and therefore his premise has no foundation at all. That is all I want to say about this particular point.</p>

<p>Hon. members on that side also asked me why I did not introduce a budget before the election. An hon. member himself gave the reply, because he said I did not dare to do it. I think again that the hon. member is rather in a hurry. Because, Sir, I think it would be very unfair of me if I were to introduce a budget at this stage and thereby bind the hands of the incoming Government. The new Government would be morally bound by my budget, and that is not fair, Mr. Speaker. And unless the Opposition is completely without hope as far as the outcome of the election is concerned, they should be glad that I have not introduced a budget, so that they can have a free hand.</p>

<p>But there is a further reason why I have not introduced a budget. This Parliamentary Session ends in the course of this week. There has not been time for me to have done what has been suggested by hon. members on that side. But even if the Session did not end this week, if there is an election on 30 March it would still have been impossible for me to do it.</p>

<p>I wish to remind hon. members on that side that in 1948 we had an election much later in the year, namely on 26 May, almost two months later than the election this year. The Government of the time did not introduce a budget, and I&#x2014;in Opposition, of course&#x2014; queried the Government&#x2019;s action and asked why they did not at least inform the House what they intended doing in the way of taxation relief or improvement of social services. I wanted to know why the printed estimates of expenditure&#x2014;at least&#x2014;were not available. I think my criticism was fair, because the election was only in May of that year. The same criticism cannot be levelled at the Government <span class="col_1115-1116" refersTo="page_0568"/>this year, viz., that we cannot oblige with either of these alternatives mentioned by me at the time. I have, however, announced certain concessions which would normally have been included in the budget. Before Parliament is dissolved the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions is going to introduce his Pensions Bill. That Bill provides for relief for pensioners to the extent of R6,158,000.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is the last person in the world to talk about vote-catching. For the last 12 hours I have been listening to the most blatant attempts to catch votes by hon. members on that side, efforts which are rather unsuccessful though. My criticism in 1948 cannot be laid at my door now because I have indicated what relief the Government is prepared to give.</p>

<p>There is another matter which is, strictly speaking, not part of the budget. I refer namely to relief granted to civil servants, a matter to which I shall refer by and by.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, before I deal in more detail with various matters raised by hon. members, I will give replies to various questions put to me. The hon. member asked how much short-term capital has entered the country; under what conditions; and what benefit does the country derive from such capital. The figures at my disposal are, of course, only preliminary figures. Well, plus-minus R100,000,000 in short-term capital entered the country in 1965. The money entered the country under varying conditions. A portion of the money is trade credit. Some short-term capital in practice remains a long time and is of lasting benefit. The balance of the money helps to tide the country over temporary difficulties, as happened in this case.</p>

<p>The second question was whether the control of transfer of dividends by subsidiaries of foreign companies was having the desired effect. Mr. Speaker, the principle is that dividends should be paid from current profits and not out of proceeds of local borrowing&#x2014;this was always our Exchange Control policy. To finance transfer of dividends subsidiaries may. however, borrow locally up to 25 per cent of effective investment.</p>

<p>The following question was whether the practice of importing capital goods on export credit was growing, and thus relieving the balance of payments. The answer is: Yes, export credits for several million rand have been obtained for capital goods. This does not imply that permits are automatically given when credits are available.</p>

<p>Then I was asked whether capital is entering South Africa for investment in gold mining shares. Mr. Speaker, the answer here is: Yes, but purchase of shares is largely with &#x201C;blocked rand&#x201D;, that is, proceeds of investment by another foreigner.</p>

<p>An hon. member wanted to know from me how much our food imports will cost in the coming year. I am afraid I cannot say at this stage. My figures are that we will import about 2,000,000 bags of maize, 50,000 tons of wheat and 3,350 tons of butter. These items have already been ordered, but further imports depend on the weather.</p>

<p>I was also asked how much salary increases would cost the State. The answer is as follows: About R23,000,000 per annum for the Public Service. R35.000,000 for the Railways, R19,000,000 for Provinces and R2,000,000 for the Universities. This makes a total of round about R80,000,000. I think the hon. member for Jeppes was more or less correct.</p>

<p>Another question was how much new money did the Exchequer raise from internal loans in 1965-66. The reply is R15,000,000 nett so far, but the loan of the 15th February is still to come.</p>

<p>An hon. member wanted to know how much was raised through tax-free bonds in 1965-6. The figure is R9,500,000 so far.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown also had many questions to ask. He asked me, firstly, when will the time be ripe for foreign loans. The answer is it is impossible to say. Factors making conditions difficult I have already described in my opening speech. The type of loan very popular on the European market at the present time is not a Government loan but a corporation loan coupled with conversion rights.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me whether I envisage forced loans from insurance companies. Well, I want to repeat what I said on a previous occasion. I prefer to retain the present more flexible system and I want to retain it for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The next question put to me by the hon. member was whether I have given an assurance to insurance companies that claims from Rhodesia will be paid without exchange restrictions. The answer is as follows: South African insurance companies operating in Rhodesia will almost certainly maintain assets in Rhodesia sufficient to meet claims. That is either because the law compels them to do so, or because sound insurance practice demands it. In the case of South Africa the law demands it. But if a company in South Africa issues a policy in a foreign currency and premiums are received in that currency, the claim may also be paid in that currency.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown was not behind in asking questions. He asked me, e.g. what will the tendency of foreign reserves be. Well, there are many uncertain factors. I need not dilate on them. There are the effects of the drought, the inflow of capital, and many other factors. We hope to build up our reserves gradually over the year. I think I have dealt with all the questions put to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, whilst I have just been dealing with questions asked by the hon. member for Parktown, I wish to refer briefly to his suggestion to the effect that all newly married couples should be granted a sort of tax honey <span class="col_1117-1118" refersTo="page_0569"/>moon for the first few years of their married life. That was his one suggestion. The other suggestion was that for the first child born within three years after the marriage a rebate of R240 should be granted. It is not an abatement but a rebate on the actual amount of tax. It is not an abatement on the taxable income. I have had this proposal investigated. Before I deal with the results of the investigation, I shall like to mention that the hon. member is also one of those who remarked upon the tremendous expected shortage of money. Yet now he comes along and wishes to increase the shortage further! Because, Sir, if his suggestion is accepted, it will cost the State a lot of money. Let us take the lowest assumption. Let us deal with a couple enjoying a joint income of say R2,400 per annum. It would cost the Government R5,700,000 in the first year. R11,400,000 in the second year and R17,100,000 in the third year. This would be rather a risky gamble, and in any case it would be quite ineffective as well. The hon. member is very much mistaken if he thinks relief such as he has suggested will be of any worth-while assistance to a couple wishing to buy their own house. Taking the figure I have given as a basis, the most that will be gained by the couple will be about 8 per cent of the purchase price of a house for a couple in this income group. We have done something more realistic. Last year we reduced the transfer duty on property. If the purchase price is less than R5.000 then two-thirds of the duty is rebated and only one-third is payable. If the value of the property is between R5,000 and R10,000, one-half of the duty is rebated. If the purchase price is between R10,000 and R15,000, one-third of the duty is rebated.</p>

<p>Now I come to the second proposal of the hon. member. He suggested a rebate of R240 for the first child. If a couple have children as soon as possible after marriage and after the first few years they cease having any more children. this proposal would have some merit. But we much prefer to see couples having larger families, and therefore a greater rebate is granted for the third and subsequent children. The hon. member prefers to have a high rate or rebate for the first child. Well, let us see what his proposal means. If a rebate of R240 were to be paid for the first child born during the first three years of the marriage, then until the child reaches the age of 18 years the parents would have to earn more than R3.866 per annum before they become liable for any tax. That would be the position if they had only the one child. If a second child were to be bom during the three-year period, the parents would enjoy a tax holiday for 18 years as long as their income does not exceed R5.670 per annum.</p>

<p>Now, both these proposals apply irrespective of whether the couple is rich or poor. The millionaire&#x2019;s son or daughter will also share in this relief. And, Sir, I hesitate to think what the result will be and how much it will cost the country if couples were to follow the. advice of the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The sum involved would be astronomical. The rebates which are granted at the present time encourage larger families because the amount of the rebate for the third and subsequent children is R39 instead of R34.</p>

<p>The hon. member is in favour of earlier but smaller families. Well, I am not in favour of that. Under the circumstances. Sir, I regret we will have to reject his proposals.</p>

<p>I will now deal with the hon. member for Jeppes. I have already remarked upon his spirited attempt to denigrate the economy of South Africa, and it is my experience&#x2014;and I think that of most hon. members of this House&#x2014;that the hon. member for Jeppes is never more eloquent than when he is attacking the economy of South Africa! The hon. member took exception because I referred in my introductory speech to the &#x201C;phenomenal&#x201D; growth of our economy in the last five years. He said I was wrong in my description. He quoted figures to prove his point. Well, I talked about the gross national product and the growth rate on that. He quoted other figures. But I will make use of his figures too. He made his comparison on the basis of the real income <i>per capita.</i> And, Sir, he selected his years carefully. I shall refer to the years 1960-3. Mr. Speaker, before dealing with these figures I want to refer to something contained in the economic bulletin of the Netherlands Bank of South Africa Limited, of which the hon. member is the chairman. Under the heading of &#x201C;Main Topics&#x201D; the following appears&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s gross national product rose from R6,681.000.000 to R7.417,000,000 or by If per cent during 1964.. After allowing for price increases, the rise was 71 per cent in real terms. By any standard this is a remarkable achievement.</block>

<p>Mr. A. B. Dickman, Assistant Manager of Union Acceptances, wrote something on this subject in the Bankers&#x2019; Journal of August, 1965. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This recent rate of growth is very high indeed, and is also exceptional by world standards.</block>

<p>But the hon. member for Jeppes does not want to face the fact that our economy has been expanding considerably. He cannot get himself to admit that South Africa has been experiencing a phenomenal growth in this respect. Mr. Chairman. I think the hon. member suffers from some form of split personality, some kind of dual personality. And at times there must be a tremendous struggle inside him when Frans the economist has to battle with Frans the politician. It really is a pity, Mr. Speaker, because the hon. member would make a very sound contribution if he only introduced the economic part of his personality into the debates in this House. From the political point of view, does the <span class="col_1119-1120" refersTo="page_0570"/>hon. member really think that by decrying South Africa and derogating from her economy he will obtain any votes for his party? I think his conduct is economically unsound and politically senseless. And I think Frans the politician should talk to himself and see that this sort of thing does not happen again.</p>

<p>I wish to draw the attention of the hon. member particularly to the South African and Australian figures. But the hon. member would rather not see these figures. I think it hurts his political soul to have to take notice of anything like this. He would much rather prefer to see figures illustrating South Africa&#x2019;s decline.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pinetown suggested that in my next Budget I should assume the role of the dancer in the Dance of the Seven Veils. Well, Sir, I really do not fancy myself very much in that role. But the hon. member has given me a very good idea. Because, Sir, I have been thinking of myself as Snow White in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. And I have been wondering which dwarf should be portrayed by the hon. member for Pinetown. I considered the various dwarfs. Hon. members will remember Bashful. Well, I thought Bashful would be more appropriately portrayed by the hon. member for Natal South Coast! Why, the hon. member is even blushing from sheer bashfulness! There were other dwarfs. I thought of Happy and Sneezy and Sleepy and Doc. But I think Doc&#x2019;s role is the prerogative of the hon. Leader of the Opposition. Well, I rejected all these names in turn, except for two, namely Dopey and Grumpy. Now I offer the hon. member the choice of either of these roles in my cast for next year!</p>

<p>There has been a lot of criticism of this side of the House,

especially outside the House, and more especially on the part of the hon. Leader of the Opposition. He complained that increased public expenditure is one of the main causes of our inflationary position. He argued that, on the one hand, we have been organizing a credit squeeze whilst on the other hand the State has been spending hand over fist. 1 will deal with his criticism to a certain extent, because I do not think there is any need for me to go into it very fully. First of all, Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to hon. members that, when we talk of public spending, public capital expenditure, we are talking not only of State expenditure but also of spending undertaken by public corporations, by the provincial administrations, and by municipalities. They are all included in this term. The money spent by the Central Government is only 43 per cent of total public capital expenditure. For the 12 months which ended in June of last year the gross private fixed investment was R980,000,000. while gross public fixed investment was R520,000,000. Now, the major portion of this 43 per cent is used for building up what we call the infrastructure of our economy. It is expenditure asked for by and in the interest of the private sector. And, Mr. Speaker, if we do not build up this infra-structure, then there can be no growth in our economy. It must be obvious to hon. members that this is one of our prime necessities, and we cannot dream of curtailing or even postponing this expenditure when there is a need for it. Of this public expenditure 70 per cent goes towards improving the infra-structure of our economy. Social services receive 9 per cent. The public corporations, such as Iscor, Sasol and Foskor, receive 13 per cent. Eight per cent is spent on public buildings and other smaller works. Hon. members will see that the expenditure here, although large, is necessary. We cannot stint on that. Housing is one of those things which is part of the infra-structure. We experience a shortage of manpower which we are trying to meet by getting more immigrants into the country. But if you want immigrants, you must have housing for them. I think about R43,000,000 was spent on housing last year. This is now the type of criticism which we get. It is perfectly true that, where the State spends, it is putting that money into the spending stream. That is perfectly true, but what about the private sector? The money put into circulation by this sector was much more than that of the public sector, the one being R980,000,000, the other R520,000,000. When we come to consumption expenditure, we will find that private consumption is more than R5,000,000.000 whilst the current expenditure of the Government and public bodies is R980,000,000. During the period June 1964 to June 1965 the rate of expenditure by the Government and public bodies was R80,000,000 higher than that for the previous 12 months. As against this, private fixed investment was R190,000,000 up on the previous year, whilst for private consumption it was R419,000,000 up on the previous year in comparison with R97,000,000 as current expenditure for Government and public bodies. Hon. members accordingly will see firstly that the volume of money being put into the spending <span class="col_1121-1122" refersTo="page_0571"/>stream by the public bodies, in relation to what the private sector is doing is not so much and secondly what the Government is being attacked for is only 43 per cent of what the public sector is putting in; and thirdly, that 70 per cent of that 43 per cent is essential expenditure. That then was one of the arguments.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppe mentioned another one. He said that we were financing our expenditure in an inflationary way. He said we had been drawing down our balances at the Reserve Bank. That is so. We have been drawing these down and in November we actually went into the red. What the hon. member did not take into account, however, was that from 1 April to 30 November last year out of the expenditure of the State R147,000,000 was spent overseas and, naturally, this money was therefore not put into the spending stream and is consequently not inflationary. I agree we could have made it deflationary by collecting that amount from the public and then by sending it overseas. It is very much the same thing as when we have loans overseas. When we bring those loans from overseas here and put the money into the spending stream here, then it will be inflationary; but if you use those loans to pay for what you have bought overseas, then it does not come into the spending stream here. We might have taken it out of the spending stream in order to pay those accounts but that would then have been deflationary and that we do not want.</p>

<p>There is another point which was raised during the debate, a point on which the attitude of the United Party is somewhat ambiguous. This point is whether our steps to curb inflation have been either too feeble and too late or too drastic. I have here the Star of 10 November 1965. in which it is stated that these steps are too feeble and too late. In the same issue, however, the Leader of the Opposition described them as being &#x201C;drastic curbs&#x201D;. Some hon. members went so far as to say that we brought our economy to a standstill. So I do not know exactly what is the attitude of the Opposition in this regard. Are we being attacked for being too drastic or are we being attacked for not being drastic enough? But let me accent from the present debate that the latter is the case. Now let me say in this regard that the moment we considered there was some danger&#x2014;and that was already at the beginning of 1964&#x2014;we applied the brakes very gently and resorted to moral suasion. We could afford to do that because our reserves were high. We were then in a position where we need not have panicked. We we-e not tempted to halt our economy altogether. to grind it to a standstill. That was so because we had taken sufficient steps beforehand. The crisis was not such that it was necessary for us at that stage to take any further steps. But that is not all. We have tried to maintain a lower rate of growth, but a rate of growth nevertheless. We did not switch from an inflationary to a deflationary policy. It may be that to a certain extent we did not anticipate that our productive urge, our economic urge, was so strong and would last for so long. But after all. the best proof of the pudding lies in the eating. We have seen that we have been more successful in halting inflation than other countries. We are not out of the woods yet but, at any rate, we can already see the light at the end of the tunnel. For that reason we can afford to pump in this R80,000.000 in the form of increases in salaries and wages. Had we, however, followed the advice of hon. members opposite last year at a time when the inflationary graph was still going up, if we had followed that advice and granted these increases then, I wonder where we would have been standing to-day? Now these increases have been brought in at a point of time where we at least can see the turning point ahead. In many cases, in fact, the rate of growth has already turned downwards. We were therefore in the fortunate position to be able to afford to do now what we could not do a year ago.</p>

<p>I still have some time at my disposal and should like to react to the debate in general. I have listened with great interest to what the hon. Leader of the Opposition had to say this afternoon. He reiterated here this afternoon. that this party&#x2019;s policy was White political control over the whole of South Africa for the forseeable future. These are brave words. The first question I should like to ask is how you are going to maintain White political control for the foreseeable future? Is it going to be by force? Leadership implies the free choice of those who are being led and it implies the right of those who are bring led to kick out their leaders, in the same way as the member&#x2019;s predecessor was kicked out. That is what leadership entails. If it is the intention to maintain White leadership by force if necessary, then it is a pipe dream to talk as if it were something praticable and realistic. In regard to the phrase &#x201C;for the foreseeable future&#x201D;, it all depends on how shortsighted the Leader of the Opposition is. If he is myopic in his vision of these things, then the &#x201C;foreseeable future&#x201D; can be next year, or in five years. That depends on his degree of shortsightedness. The Leader of the Opposition has already been quoted as having said in an article on race federation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am often asked whether each race will be represented in the central Parliament by its own people. The answer is that the present United Party policy provides that the representatives in the central Parliament will be Whites or Coloureds&#x2026;.</block>

<p>So it is no longer only White political central, but White and Coloured. He went on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I had more than once told my party&#x2019;s conferences that the right to represent their own people cannot be withheld indefinitely.</block>

<p>This point has been made very forcibly by the Minister of Bantu Education.</p>

<p><span class="col_1123-1124" refersTo="page_0572"/>There is one point on which the hon. member has been fairly consistent. This afternoon he came with a speech which we have heard every time before an election since 1948. Look at what he has promised here: old age pensions without the means test is one of them. I have here a list of motions introduced by the Opposition since 1961 on this question of old-age pensions, but not in a single one of them has the United Party gone so far as to ask for the complete abolition of the means test. What they were prepared to ask up till now was only a relaxation of the means test. I wonder whether they have calculated what the expenditure is going to be should the means test be abolished. The hon. Leader of the Opposition has a precedent for the making of promises, because his predecessor became known as &#x201C;Koos Promise&#x201D; afterwards. The hon. Leader now comes and promises a State lottery, television, as well as a number of other things. But this has been the same story before every election since 1948. After the elections it was also the same story, although a little bit different. In 1948 Gen. Smuts said that the United Party had reached rock-bottom. It could not go further down. In 1953 Mr. Strauss said the same. In 1958 the present Leader of the Opposition said the same. But, in spite of that, they continued to go down. In 1961 they went down lower than rock-bottom and, as I was listening to the Leader of the Opposition to-day, I could understand why they have lost and have lost consistently since 1948. There is no disputing that there is one policy which has counted consistently against them since 1948, i.e. the colour question. But to-day, with Gadarene obstinacy, he is clinging to the same policy &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; but the result is going to be the same again this time. The hon. member has been wrong so often that he can no longer distinguish between right and wrong. Look at all the major issues we have had to face during the past 20 years. In regard to all these issues, the attitude of the United Party was wrong. They were wrong about a republic. When a republic was established they said they would work for our re-entry into the Commonwealth. Wrong again! When we came with decimalization, they were against it and fought it tooth and nail. Wrong again! When we had to fight inflation they came with the suggestion that more money should be pumped into the spending stream, which would have fed the flames of inflation higher. So they were wrong again. Last year we heard a lot about Parity and about the negligence of the Minister and of his officials, in the same way as they were fighting for a trial for 90-day detainees. I said to them that they must wait until the commission had reported. But they were prepared to fling as much mud as possible, but now that the commission&#x2019;s report has appeared, they are silent. The hon. Leader of the Opposition for the moment forgot one of the first principles of his profession. When we had our balance of payments crisis in 1961 what did hon. members on the other side say? They said never again would we get capital again into the country. The hon. member for Kensington even broke into verse and recited the song of Humpty Dumpty sitting on a wall, and falling off without a chance of being put together again. He became lyrical because it was against South Africa. That, Sir, is the besetting sin of the Opposition: they are simply chronically incapable of thinking, acting and speaking South African. They have continually to find something wrong with South Africa. They were wrong again by refusing to give their support to measures against sabotage and violence in South Africa. They were wrong in continuing to oppose Bantu homelands and separate freedoms for them. Unless they give up the idea of fighting that, there will only be one fate for them in an election. We have already fought three, four elections on this issue. When we wanted to give the South African citizen the right to call himself a South African citizen, they fought it tooth and nail. Wrong again! In fact, on every major issue in South Africa during the past 20 years the attitude of the United Party was wrong! Now they are trying to make a turn to the right, but in that they will find that they are wrong again!</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>

<p>As I have already said more than once, the circumstances of pensioners are continually being reviewed. This has been the procedure over the past years. I have stated on many occasions, and I say again, that those circumstances are never static. Changes are continually taking place. Where possible, and as far as it has been able to do so, the Government has almost each year made concessions over the past years. These concessions have always more than kept pace with fluctuating economic conditions and the rising cost of living and further increases are being granted this year.</p>

<p>The main aim of this Bill is to give effect to concessions to war, civil and social pensioners, concessions which have already been announced and which must be embodied in legislation. Hon. members have been furnished with a memorandum on the Bill. This memorandum contains all the proposals embodied in the Bill, and I trust that hon. members, particularly those who have a special interest in pension matters&#x2014;and I am sure that almost all hon. members are interested in these matters&#x2014; have read it carefully. It is not my intention therefore to give a long exposition of the various provisions of the Bill, although there are a few matters to which I should like to refer briefly.</p>

<p>Last year the bonuses payable to war pensioners were consolidated with their pensions and allowances. Provision was also made for an increase, from 1 April 1966, in basic war pensions and allowances, but not in supplementary or alternative pensions. It appears now that war pensioners, who are also in receipt of supplementary or alternative pensions, will receive no or only slight benefit from the <span class="col_1127-1128" refersTo="page_0574"/>increases. Provision is therefore being made in Clauses 2, 3 and 9 for an increase in this type of pension. The bonus which is at present payable to certain civil pensioners is also being increased, and the necessary provision is made in Clause 7.</p>

<p>In his Budget Speech for 1965, the hon. the Minister of Finance announced that an investigation would be made into the possibility of granting war veterans&#x2019; pensions to persons who were members of the protesting burger forces in 1914, on the same basis as those granted to persons who were members of the Government armed forces. Clause 11 amends the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; so as to include these persons as well. This amendment will come into operation with effect from 1 October 1966.</p>

<p>Clause 13 makes provision for the payment of a bonus to certain social pensioners and beneficiaries. As I have already announced, these bonuses will be payable with effect from 1 April 1966, at R2 per month per White person. No bonus will be paid in the case of war veterans but for the sake of convenience the additional amount which they are receiving will be increased. At present this amount is R96 per annum in the case of White war veterans and will be increased to R120 per annum with effect from 1 April 1966.</p>

<p>In the case of Coloured and Indian war veterans, the additional amount is being increased from R48 to R54 per annum, and the necessary provision is made in Clause 12.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened with interest to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introduction to the second reading of this Bill and there are various aspects that we on this side of the House wish to deal with. At the outset I should like to say that we on this side, in considering the provisions of this Bill, whereby increases are granted to certain pensioners and whereby benefits are extended to certain pensioners. intend supporting the second reading of the Bill. We realize that this is an unusual step that is being taken, in view of the fact that normally increases in social pensions are announced by the Minister of Finance in the Budget Speech and a Bill of this nature is introduced towards the end of a normal session of Parliament. In this particular instance, this Bill has been introduced to grant certain increases to certain pensioners, and we feel that in many instances these increases are negligible when compared with the decreases in the purchasing power of money at the present time. We have to consider certain aspects and I believe that an important aspect is the increase in living costs and the costs of the necessities of life, which have brought about a tremendous strain on the very limited amounts that are made available to our social pensioners in particular. When the hon. the Minister made a statement in December outlining the proposed increases in pensions, he referred to the fact that cognizance had been taken of the increase in the cost of living. However, Mr. Speaker, we must remember that these increases are indeed very small. In fact, last year only R1 per month was granted to social pensioners from 1 October 1965. It is true that the means test was relaxed to a certain extent. We welcomed that relaxation in the means test. It is a matter which we on this side of the House have raised for many years. The position is that many of these social pensioners who are entirely dependent upon their social pensions as a means of existence have really had very poor consideration from the Government, as far as the spiralling costs during the last two years are concerned. Normally, Sir, the increase in pension is given from 1 April of each year. Last year those persons who are fully dependent upon their pensions, and who were receiving the maximum pension, received an increase of R1 on 1 October. Many of them did not receive an increase in 1964. In terms of a system adopted then, which made provision for a special allowance, an additional amount was paid only to the neediest of the needy, as they were termed at that time. Many of them who did not receive an increase in 1964 received an increase only in 1963. The R2.50 increase that was granted to the neediest of the needy in 1963 was merely extended in 1964 to the other social pensioners that had not received that increase. We can see therefore that the pensioner who is entirely dependent upon his pension as a means of livelihood has indeed been waiting a very long time to receive an increase. This Bill now grants that pensioner an increase of R2 per month from 1 April 1966. We feel that with the tremendous increase in the cost of living and the increases that have been granted to other persons, this is a very small sum. We feel that an increase of at least R5 per month would have been more like justice to this group of deserving people. [Interjections.] It is all very well for groans to come from the other side, but they would perhaps be interested to know that recently a survey which was carried out in the Durban area by the University of Natal showed that over 60 per cent of the pensioners that were interviewed in that area alone were entirely dependent upon their pensions as a means of livelihood and a means of existence. It also showed that the position of these people has deteriorated to an alarming extent during the past two years. With the increased cost of accommodation, food and clothing, these people are having to economize&#x2014;many of them having to economize on food since that is their only source of economy. I feel that while this increase will be most welcome indeed to the social pensioners, it is inadequate and still means that our rate of pension lags a long way behind the needs of these people to maintain a reasonable existence. Many of them, I believe, would not be able to exist without the valuable assistance of various welfare organizations. The system to be adopted in paying this increased pension is, in terms of <span class="col_1129-1130" refersTo="page_0575"/>Clause 13 to be on the basis of a bonus of R24 per annum&#x2014;that is, R2 per month. It is to be classified as a bonus. The Pension Laws Amendment Act, 1965, consolidated the various amounts payable in addition to the basic pension and this did in fact bring about a raising of the ceilings of the means test. However, with the system which is to be adopted now, we find that the bonus system will, of course, grant the increase of R2 per month but will not have the effect of raising the ceiling of the means test. I believe it would have been preferable for the hon. the Minister to be prepared to grant an increase of R2 per month and that R2 per month should be paid purely on the basis of the rate of the pension. If that had been the case, it would mean a very small relaxation of the means test. We know, Sir. that the means test is based on the rate of pension. The income value of a pensioner&#x2019;s assets is taken into account and we know that there are certain ceiling figures&#x2014;the present ceiling being R504 per annum for a single person, i.e. R42 per month. Thereafter, if the pensioner does not have assets exceeding R2,400, he qualifies for a minimum pension of R2 per month. Having the increase as part of the pension would mean that an extra R24 per annum would be allowed as far as income is concerned. It would then move into another bracket and the existing pensioners would all receive an increase of R2 per month which in effect this Bill is giving as a bonus. But the important fact is the method by which this change is being introduced. I believe it would have been far better if the hon. the Minister had increased the rate of pension by R2 per month, thereby bringing about a small relaxation of the means test. It would not be a great sacrifice and at the same time it would bring into the scope of a social pension those people who have made provision for their old age but who find that they have not made sufficient provision owing to the decrease in the purchasing power of the money they have set aside for the twilight of their lives. I believe that this would have been a far better way for the Minister to have brought about this increase in the rate of pension.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while dealing with this question of the manner of the increase, it is important to note that in reply to questions which I put to the hon. the Minister last week, he gave certain figures indicating the increase in the total number of pensioners. These figures show that in actual fact there has not been a great increase in the number of pensioners in spite of the relaxation of the means test. We find that at 30 September 1965, the total number of White pensioners&#x2014;and I am dealing specifically with the case of the White pensioner because that is the only group of persons affected by last year&#x2019;s legislation which brought about a relaxation of the means test&#x2014;had not increased appreciably. The number of old age pensioners as at 31 January 1966&#x2014;after this period of three months during which many people would have made application and would now be entitled to a pension&#x2014;had increased from 84,916 to 88,154, an increase of 3,238 pensioners. As far as the war veteran&#x2019;s pension is concerned, the method that I have suggested the Minister should adopt, namely to increase the rate of pension and not merely to pay a bonus, would also bring into effect a small relaxation of the means test as far as the war veterans are concerned, as well as the war veterans over 70 years of age who are subject to the relaxed means test. However, the figures show that in spite of the relaxation of the means test last year, at 30 September, 1965, which was prior to the new means test, there were 19,843 war veteran pensioners. By 31 January 1966, this figure had in fact declined to 19,714. There were therefore 129 fewer war veteran pensioners after the relaxation of the means test. It would therefore appear that in spite of the relaxation of the means test last year, it has not had a great effect as regards the number of pensioners in the category of old-age pensioners and war veteran pensioners. My submission is, Mr. Speaker, that the Minister could quite easily have taken this opportunity of being a little more lenient by raising the means test very slightly by increasing the rate of pension rather than adopting this system of paying a bonus.</p>

<p>I should like to deal briefly with the other provisions of this Bill. The first portion of the Bill deals with improvements for the military pensioner and we on this side of the House welcome these improvements. In fact we raised this matter last year when the Pension Laws Amendment Bill, 1965, was under discussion and pointed out the fact that many of these pensioners would in fact receive virtually no increase at all and would receive no supplementary allowance at all. It is pleasing to find that that particular aspect has now been rectified in the Bill now before the House.</p>

<p>Another important aspect which one must consider is the manner in which other sections of the community are being dealt with in terms of the Bill as far as these increases are concerned. We come to a section which deals with the war veterans and an increase of R2 per month has been granted on the basis that the war veteran who receives an extra R96 per annum, will in future receive an extra R120 per annum, that is, as far as the White war veteran is concerned. However, the ratio which has always been applied in the past, has been that the Coloured and Indian pensioner receives one half of what the White pensioner receives. In this Bill, however, the additional pension of the Coloured and Indian war veteran is increased from R48 per annum to R54 per annum. He will therefore only receive an increase of 50 cents per month, and not an increase of R1 which would be one half of the increase of R2 per month which has been granted to the White war veteran. This does appear to be inconsistent with the normal practice of the past in paying these pensions on a ratio basis. It would be appreciated if the hon. the Minister would give an explanation <span class="col_1131-1132" refersTo="page_0576"/>as to why it has been deemed necessary not to abide by that ratio. This is similar to the question I dealt with earlier with regard to the bonus of R24 per annum which is to be paid. It is significant that this amount is only applicable to White social pensioners. In introducing this Bill the hon. the Minister did not give an indication as to the reason why it is deemed necessary that only the White social pensioner should receive the extra amount provided for in this Bill.</p>

<p>There are various items concerning pensioners which we on this side of the House were hoping would receive some consideration from the hon. the Minister. We feel that there is a very strong case indeed to be made out for various other improvements to our existing pension laws. The position of war veterans is a matter which has been raised in this House on numerous occasions. We have made representations in this House and also directly to the hon. the Minister with a view to trying to improve the position as far as our war veterans are concerned. Firstly, there is a small group of persons who performed full-time service who do not receive the benefit of a war veteran&#x2019;s pension in terms of the Principal Act. I am referring to the persons who took part in the Bumbata rebellion of 1906, also known as the Zulu rebellion. I know that representations have been made to the Minister on several occasions and by various organizations to take these people into account. There are provisions in our laws whereby people who served prior to this rebellion and also people who served after the rebellion do have the benefit of a war veteran&#x2019;s pension. We know of some cases where for various reasons some of these people were only able to serve in that rebellion and are therefore not entitled to any other benefits which war veterans serving in subsequent wars have enjoyed. Only a very small number of persons is involved and it seems a pity that the hon. the Minister does not take the opportunity to make some benefit available to these pioneers of South Africa.</p>

<p>Another aspect concerning war veteran pensions is the question of the war veterans of the 1914-1918 war. We know that provision is made in our pension laws for the exemption from the means test as far as those persons who performed full-time service in the Anglo-Boer War are concerned. The number of persons who enjoy that privilege is diminishing rapidly and indeed at present that number must be very small. We on this side of the House believe that the time has come for the Government to consider enabling the war veterans of the First World War to enjoy the exemption from the means test as far as their war veterans pension is concerned. We believe that that time has arrived and it is a great pity that the hon. the Minister did not see his way clear to make provision for due consideration to be given to these people who played a major role in the history of South Africa.</p>

<p>There are certain other aspects of the Bill on which we should like to comment at the Committee Stage. There are various groups of pensioners who are looking forward to the increase that will be coming their way. As far as military pensioners are concerned, the effective date is 1 October 1966 and I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, will give us some indication as to the reason why it is not possible for these people to be granted alleviation as from 1 April 1966 instead of 1 October 1966.</p>

<p>As far as the civil pensioners are concerned, we know that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst them. We feel that an injustice is being done to them so far as the payment of their temporary allowance is concerned. We know that the provision of a minimum civil pension precludes a number of people and their wives from qualifying for a social pension. We know that if they could qualify for a social pension they could delay their applications and enjoy the extra supplementary allowance and also become entitled to receive the extra R10 per month by way of an attendant&#x2019;s allowance should they require assistance in case of ill-health or disability. It is felt that it is to their disadvantage to be precluded from drawing the minimum social pension, which they would be entitled to do if the Minister did not fix the minimum pension just above the means test ceiling to qualify for a social pension.</p>

<p>Similarly there are people who feel that the present practice of withdrawing the temporary allowance when they obtain employment outside the Government Service discriminates against them. They feel that they are rendering a service to the country in view of the manpower shortage; that they are making a contribution to the economy of the country and yet they are dealt with on a different basis when it comes to the payment of the temporary allowance.</p>

<p>Then there are also those persons who feel that if the Government is unable to assist them by allowing them to retain their temporary allowance by ignoring the remuneration they receive in the private sector, the Government should at least raise the means limit which is applicable to the payment of temporary allowances. Sir, these are matters which affect a large number of people. We know that there will be numbers of people who will be disappointed at the increases which are being provided for in this Bill. There are those people who naturally welcome some alleviation from their financial plight. I feel that this would have been a wonderful opportunity for the Minister to grant more relief to a number of these people who have to struggle under extreme difficulties to meet the increased cost of living. It is felt that many of these people who have made a major contribution to the growth of this country and who have played a major role in the history of this country should receive more sympathetic consideration <span class="col_1133-1134" refersTo="page_0577"/>from the Government and we hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to afford greater relief to some of these people. I believe and we on this side of the House believe that these people deserve far more from the Government than they receive at the moment.</p>

<p>Whereas I again want to say something in connection with this Bill to-night I feel that it is a fine opportunity, since this is probably the last piece of legislation which the present Minister will pilot through this House, and while we are dealing here with legislation which makes provision for increasing the pensions of certain groups of pensioners, to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister. We regard this measure as further fruits of his labours over the years to increase the pensions of the various groups from time to time, and that is why we would like to avail ourselves of this opportunity of conveying our deep gratitude and appreciation to the Minister for what he has done during the time he has acted as Minister. The hon. the Minister has been associated with a department which deals with people and their requirements. And the technical knowledge which is needed for that post withall, I think that the highest qualification is not so much knowledge but a warm heart for the lot of one&#x2019;s fellow creature. Everyone who knows the Minister knows that that is one of his fine qualities and that is why we and the whole country, as well as the pensioners which are being discussed here to-night, want to convey our gratitude and appreciation to the Minister. During the time he has acted as Minister he has proved that he was not only a champion of the pensioners but that he had the interests of all who came under the care of his Department at heart. We think, for example, of the important investigations which the Minister initiated, such as the investigations by the Piek Commission and by the Brummer Commission; we think of important legislation such as the Child Act of 1960, and the important piece of legislation of 1965 dealing with the Welfare Board. While wishing the Minister a pleasant retirement we also want to express the hope that for many years to come he shall see how the little trees he has planted yield very good fruits in our national life.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with a piece of legislation which makes provision for increased pensions, and we have listened to what the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) has had to say here. But we also know that this is one of the matters which he is continually raising here. There are two things for which he is always pleading: The one is an increase in the pension, and the other is the relaxing of the means test. During the debate which preceded this one, he even went so far as to plead that the means test should be abolished altogether; that there should not be anything like a means test at all. I just want to say that if we take a look at the record of this</p>

<p>Government since 1948 up till the present moment, then I think it has nothing to feel ashamed of when it goes to the country and has to look the pensioners in the eye. In 1947 the basic pension being given to pensioners was R120 per year. In 1966, with this increase which is now going to be granted, it is going up to R360 per year&#x2014;an increase of 180 per cent. We know that people are saying, as the hon. member for Umbilo has also said here, that the cost of living has risen tremendously and that money no longer has the value it had before. But I say that pensions have been increased by 180 per cent, while the cost-of-living index during the same period rose by 71 per cent. That is why I say that our pensioners, although the cost of living is high, are better off to-day than they were in the days when the party on that side of the House still formed the Government of this country. But the same applies to the relaxing of the means test. One must remember that when one relaxes the means test, more and more people come into consideration for pensions. Let us just take a look at what the relaxing of the means test implies. The hon. member referred to the relaxation which came into operation with effect from 1 October 1965. I just want to quote a few examples. The means plus pension limit was increased from R324 to R528. The second concession was that a person could still qualify for the full pension if he possessed assets to the value of R5,600, while the previous figure had been R2,400. In the third place there was an increase in the free income limit from R180 to R192. The hon. member for Umbilo now says that the nett result of all this was 4,000 additional pensioners. But it was only in October month, a few months ago, that that came into operation. I think that if the hon. member for Umbilo had taken the trouble to go and talk to the heads of the Department he would have heard that there is now a continual stream of applications coming in. Within a few short months the number has already increased by 4,000. We must remember that every concession made means that a very much greater amount has to be placed on the Estimates. An increase of one rand for a pensioner, in the case of Whites only, means an increase of R2,000,000 on the Estimates. If non-Whites were included, too, that amount would have to be at least doubled. In other words, an additional R4,000,000 per year would have to be placed on the Estimates. We know that an increase of R1 per month means very little for a pensioner. The hon. member for Umbilo is known for continually criticizing the pensions received by our people. He expressed himself in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 17 November 1965, where he said that the pensions which were being given to people were &#x201C;hopelessly inadequate&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The Hon. member on the opposite side there say it is correct. Let us just consider for a moment <span class="col_1135-1136" refersTo="page_0578"/>how unrealistic the Opposition is in their approach. If the present pensions are &#x201C;hopelessly inadequate&#x201D;, then I would very much like to know what they envisage. If one argues that the present pension is &#x201C;hopelessly inadequate&#x201D;, then it would be ridiculous to say to the pensioner: &#x201C;The pension your are receiving is hopelessly inadequate, but here is an extra R3 or R5 for you.&#x201D; If you speak in terms of &#x201C;hopelessly inadequate&#x201D;, then you must, if you want to deal justly with that pensioner and remain true to your word, give that man at least R10 or more extra. Calculate that in terms of the figure I mentioned and you will see to what a great height the expenditure will then soar. We must also remember that the United Party continually wants the means test to be relaxed. They talk about the total abolishing of the means test.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not under discussion at the moment. I wish we could have a debate on that matter. The hon. member wants a total abolishing or a drastic relaxation of the means test, but hon. members on that side do not calculate the costs. I just want to mention the following example: In 1965-6 the means test for the veterans of the Second Boer War was abolished. The Government thought at that time that it was going to cost us about R100,000 more, but when it came into operation what did the Government find? They had thought that those people were practically all deceased, but to the Government&#x2019;s surprise they found that the abolishing of the means test for that small group of people required an additional expenditure, not of R100,000 as the Government had calculated, but R2,028,000. If you do away with the means test, with a view to a contributory pension scheme or for any reason whatsoever, then I say&#x2014;and you must remember that hon. members on that side are pleading for the establishment of a compulsory contributory scheme for everybody, White and Black&#x2014;that this country will never be able to bear the costs of such a scheme. This Government, with the sensible policy which it has followed, has made it possible for regular increases to be granted to our pensioners from time to time. The Minister is in a position to-day to testify to the number of elderly people from whom he is continually receiving letters of appreciation for what the Government has done. If the Government were to take the reckless course which they are pleading for, and were, with a lavish hand, to make drastic increases in the pensions and relax the means test considerably or do away with it entirely, then you would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg, and it would mean the greatest hardship for our elderly people and pensioners. That is why I say that we are grateful for the concessions which are being made here, and we believe that the Government will always continue to an increasing extent, as it has done in the past and as its record proves, to look after the requirements of our elderly people and pensioners from all the various groups, and to grant them adequate pensions from time to time.</p>

I have never listened to a sillier argument, because after all, pensioners, whether they be social pensioners, war veterans or blind persons in receipt of pensions, are people of an age, who should be looked after whatever the cost to the State. It is true that we on this side of the House maintain that there should be a contributory pension fund; then all these problems would be resolved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that, Sir. I rise to my feet because I feel that in all the discussions we have had in the past week or two, the question of the coming election has been uppermost in the thoughts of the hon. gentlemen on the other side, even to the point, that when legislation of this kind is introduced, we find that there is discrimination against the Coloureds, and the Indians, who depend upon our bounty and goodwill, for whatever is going to come to them through the generosity of the Government and of Parliament, which votes the money. In Clause 12, in which the War Veterans Pension Act is amended, we find ourselves in the situation of being asked to agree to an increase in the pension awarded to a White war veteran, from R96 to R124 per annum, which means that these people will be getting an extra R2 per month. With that I have no quarrel. But Coloured persons and Indians, who have been getting R4 per month are being discriminated against, by having their pension increased to only R4.50, an increase of 50 cents. Sir, I would say that hon. members on the Government side should be heartily ashamed of themselves to be a party to a proposition, where persons who have fought in wars in the defence of this country, Coloureds and Indians, find to-day that they are going to get an increase of 50 cents whereas their White colleagues will receive an increase of R2. Then in Clause 13, we find that there is an even greater discrepancy, which provides <span class="col_1137-1138" refersTo="page_0579"/>that as from 1 April 1966, every White person;&#x2014;what a tragic thing to introduce into legislation&#x2014;to whom a pension has been granted, under the Old Age Pensions Act or the Blind Persons Act, or to whom a grant has been made under the Disability Grants Act, shall be paid a bonus at the rate of R24 per annum. What happens to the man who is blind or disabled, whom is Coloured or who is Indian? I have heard the hon. the Minister say that the standards of the Whites and the non-Whites are different. I often wonder whether standards of disability are different, depending on whether you are Coloured, Indian or White. I often wonder whether the world, as it appears to a man who is blind, whether he be Coloured or Indian, is any different from the blind world of the White man who is going to get a special concession? I say quite frankly to the Minister and all hon. members opposite, that they should hang their heads in shame. [Interjections.] We are talking about pensioners, about people who have got to the end of their lives, people who are disabled and afflicted. We who sit here are whole, in all respects; we have our vision, we have our abilities and our capabilities. These hon. members opposite can sit there, and jeer and sneer, and interject because I plead the cause of the Coloured man and of the Indian. I say that the greatest tragedy of this fact that people who are disabled, people who are old and decrepit, people who have come to the end of their useful lives, people who are afflicted with the terrible affliction of blindness, people who cannot see what is going on around them, are dependent upon the State, upon the Government, to make available to them the necessities of life by paying them a few miserable rands and cents, and that, if they are Coloureds or Indians they do not get the pension, which is given to their White counterparts. I do not wish to detract in any way from what the White man gets; good luck to him. He was born with a white skin. It is not his fault that he was born with a white skin. He wakes up one day, looks in the mirror and finds that his skin is white Sir, I say that hon. members opposite haven’t got a leg to stand on. I say that they cannot justify the discrimination in all legislation of this sort against the Coloured man and the Indian. The Coloureds and the Indians are with us. If you are going to increase pensions let it be on a percentage basis, but do not let us use the term contained in this Clause, a term which gives offence to so many people: &#x201C;every White pensioner&#x201D;.</p>

The Coloured war veterans, disabled and blind persons, however, will not participate in the election and that is why the Government feels that it can ignore them; that is why the Government is able to say to every White pensioner, &#x201C;We will do this for you&#x201D; and to every Coloured or Indian pensioner, &#x201C;We will increase your pension by a lesser amount&#x201D;.

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down made the insinuation here that the pensioners of South Africa would vote for their personal gain for the sake of a pension. I want to reject that statement with the contempt it deserves, because the pensioners of South Africa vote on principles. They do not vote for a pension or for increased pensions. If it were the idea of the United Party that they would be able to buy votes from people with pensions, and by pleading for the abolition of the means test, as the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) did, or by pleading that everybody should receive a pension, we say that we would have nothing to do with a system in terms of which votes could be bought in such a manner.</p>

<p>The previous speaker also made the statement that the non-Whites were discriminated against as far as increased pensions were concerned, because they would receive an increase of 50c, while the Whites would receive R2. As far as I know, the hon. member is still a member of the United Party. Is that the type of statement his party makes, that they do not not want any further differentiation to be made between the Whites and non-Whites? Will hon. members of the United Party now go and tell the people in the country, as they have done in the past, that we are doing too much for the non-Whites in this country? I want to ask the hon. member specifically whether he will have it that no differentiation be made? No, he will not answer: he will not answer. He is sitting there giggling with&#x2014;I almost say&#x2014;Katie of Wynberg; I mean the hon. member for Wynberg <span class="col_1139-1140" refersTo="page_0580"/>(Mrs. Taylor).

<p>I am sorry that some people are exploiting thus the difference that is made between Whites and non-Whites, as the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) has just done. Let us once and for all face the fact that the non-Whites in South Africa have a much lower standard of living than the Whites, and that the difference we are making as far as pensions are concerned is justified. Does the hon. member realize that if the non-White pensioner were paid the same pension paid to the White pensioner, the amount paid to the non-White would, in fact, be much more than the wages paid to certain non-White labourers in this country? That would create a state of total disorder in South Africa. Those arguments simply do not apply, because they do not face up to the facts.</p>

<p>Actually, I am rising to-night to express my gratitude and appreciation for the fact that the burghers who protested in 1914 will now be enabled to qualify as war veterans in terms of this Act. I think it is a debt of honour we are paying them to-night, and I am voting for it more than wholeheartedly, because they fought for the ideal of which we are reaping the fruits to-day, and that is the Republic of South Africa. They fought for that ideal with profound convictions and this is a debt we have to pay them. I am grateful that it is this Minister who is piloting this piece of legislation through the House. He has told me more than once of the great impression it made on him when he accompanied General De Wet to a meeting, on which occasion General De Wet addressed, at Lindley, the burghers from a light wagon when they took up arms in 1914. I am grateful for this legislation. I want to praise him for this legislation, and I want to tell the Minister that he has built himself a monument to-night, which will be there for many, many years to come.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has followed the typical tactics of his party by trying to smear and to create a false impression of a plea made in all sincerity and in all honesty from this side of he House. That hon. member knows very well that under the United Party, and adopted and followed by this Government, a formula was laid down known as the 4-2-1 Formula, 4 for the Whites. 2 for the Coloureds and 1 for the Bantu. That member ought to know it. and every time that pensions or allowances were increased that ratio was maintained. What the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) complained about was that the ratio is abandoned in Clause 12. That hon. member tries to make political capital out of a plea for the maintenance of a principle which that Government has always followed, and the hon. member for Karoo, as a Coloureds&#x2019; Representative, pleaded for the maintenance of that principle, but the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) tries to turn it into a political debate. He knows perfectly well that this side of the House has always adopted a responsible attitude in this regard. [Interjections.] He knows that this side of the House has always fought for fairness and justice, but because there is an election coming that hon. member gets up to make a political speech and says pensioners do not vote for a pension. I hope he will instruct his party&#x2019;s canvassers not to go to pensioners and say: &#x201C;As julle nie Nat. stem nie, verloor julle jul pensioene.&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to support the plea of the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) for the recognition as war veterans for the Bambata Rebellion soldiers. I do not know whether the Minister is aware that those who served in the Bambata Rebellion are recognized as having served in a campaign. They were awarded a campaign medal. My father was one who wore that medal. It was recognized militarily as an active service campaign for which a military medal was awarded, and the 1906 medal was worn with pride by those who fought in that campaign, as a symbol of having fought in an active service campaign, such as any soldier fights in any war. I hope the Minister will give very serious attention to the plea of the hon. member for Umbilo, because I believe that those people who fought for the maintenance of the way of life in South Africa, for which we fight to-day, should also be recognized by this Government as having served South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_1141-1142" refersTo="page_0581"/>I also want to support his plea that the means test be removed for the group for which he pleaded. We have listened in this House for two days, from the Minister of Finance to the humblest back-bencher, to speech after speech praising the fantastic development of South Africa&#x2019;s wealth, the fantastic increase in our national income. We have heard how rich we are and how wonderfully this Government has governed South Africa economically. We have heard of the profits ad the surpluses we have had, and I believe that this debate, or any pensions debate, is not the occasion to do what the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter) did, to quote streams of statistics to show how well off the pensioners are. I am not interested in statistics; I am interested in people, in human beings. I have said before, and I say again, that I do not give two hoots what they got in &#x201C;nineteen-voetsek&#x201D; or in 1922; I am interested in how a pensioner can live in 1966, now. Any member on that side of the House will know how difficult it is to make ends meet, particularly in the cities, to-day. I ask the Minister of Housing whether he can stand up to-night and say that his Department can guarantee 100 rooms or flats in any city in South Africa at a rental of under R30 a month.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill provides R2 a month increase on the day after the election. I want to ask the Minister, who is a sincere man who is concerned with the welfare of the people, whether he really understands how impossible it is for an old-age pensioner to live on the amount which this Bill provides. If one thinks of the aged, they are not as we are, young people who can make their own entertainment. They are people whose greatest problem is loneliness. They require things which other people do not often require. To them the radio, for instance, is an important aid in their loneliness. Reading matter is important to them, and so is visiting. Their health is important to them. They have to have special diets. They have to travel. One thing of which I am proud, and I believe everyone in this House is proud, is the pride of our South African citizens. They do not want charity. The last thing a pensioner will do is to beg for charity, and there are many people living and suffering today because they are too proud to go to welfare organizations for help. They say this is what the Government gives them and they try to struggle through on that amount because they will not assault their own pride by asking for help. The hon. member for Umbilo correctly said that many people could not exist without the help of voluntary welfare organizations and that many thousands are too proud to ask for assistance. I believe that in a country such as ours, with our wealth and natural resources, we could do better than this Bill does for our aged, for people who have served our country their whole lives. I would like to see a minimum pension of at least R40 a month, and I would like to see in addition a contrary pension scheme, which I cannot discuss now. [Interjections.] I would like to see as well&#x2014;and this is a matter on which I feel very strongly indeed&#x2014;that pensioners who obtain short-term employment should not be penalized by losing these few rand which the Bill gives him. I accept that in the case of a person working full time, as long as there is a means test&#x2014;and I think the means test should go as soon as possible&#x2014;but whilst it is this Government&#x2019;s policy to maintain a means test I believe that a person who works for a short period of three months or less should not be penalized by doing that work. Many people take short-term jobs over Christmas.</p>

<p>I am dealing with the means test which is affected by this Bill in that pensioners are given an allowance instead of an increase in the basic pension, and therefore they still fall under the existing means test, and I am asking for a relaxation of it to assist them to meet the difficulties with which they are faced because of the minimal amount which the Government is prepared to grant them by way of pensions. I am trying to find other ways of assisting them to meet their problems. I believe that this is the time when the Government should come out and say: We are no longer going to treat this as a statistical problem; we will treat these people with sympathy and we will give them the practical aid which goes with it, and we will give them real help and not just this paltry increase of R2 a month.</p>

<p>There is a well-known saying that a criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has returned to-night to the scene of his original attack. I do not want to say that he is a criminal; I am not even insinuating it. I am merely making use of this idiom. He came forward here with the argument that some of us would tell our canvassers they must tell the pensioners to vote Nationalist or they would lose their pensions. [Interjections.] That is what the hon. member insinuated. I just want to say that it is quite likely that the hon. member is returning like a criminal to the scene of his crime, as his conscience is troubling him for having made such insinuations in the past.</p>

<p><span class="col_1143-1144" refersTo="page_0582"/>But I want to mention another point. The hon. member will not get past that so easily either. The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) is the only member of the United Party in this House who is not going to fight an election in March because he represents a Coloured constituency. That is why he was able to stand up in this House to-night and let his tongue run away with him by using a certain term, and he said it very clearly, the hon. member for Durban (Point) cannot reason it away; I gather that he has unfortunately to fight an election and a very difficult election at that. The hon. member for Karoo said: &#x201C;Every White person,&#x201D; and then he said by means of an interjection: &#x201C;It is a disgrace that there should be something like this in the legislation;&#x201D; he then proceeded with his argument. In other words, I deduced from what the hon. member for Karoo, who is a member of the United Party caucus, said that he and that party are opposed, in pension legislation or any legislation, to a distinction being made between Whites and non-Whites.</p>

<p>He did not raise that objection because the basic ratio of four-two-one has been changed. He very clearly made the insinuation of &#x201C;every White person&#x201D;, and the interjection which he then made was that it was a disgrace that there should be something like that in the legislation. He is confirming it now; he is nodding his head affirmatively. This means one thing to me, and now I am asking the hon. member and the United Party whether we may proceed and proclaim from the platforms in the country that the United Party is not prepared in future, in pension legislation, to make any distinction between White and non-White pensions?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>Is it nonsense? Then you must tell it to that hon. member because it was his argument and he is a member of your caucus. The hon. member for Point now wants to protect the hon. member for Karoo. I just want to add that if it should be true I immediately want to lay the complaint at the door of that party, arising from this point of view of &#x201C;only for White persons&#x201D; and the objection which the hon. member for Karoo has against it, and I want to ask them whether that is their policy, and I am making the deduction that there should never be any discrimination against non-Whites in legislation. I then want to ask them where the policy of their party in regard to that matter is? But I shall let the matter rest there. I feel that I have brought the point home and I am convinced that we shall be able to use it in the election; I shall use it very readily as there has been no denial.</p>

<p>The other accusation coming from the Opposition side, also from the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield), the only man on that side for whom I have respect because he does know something about pensions&#x2014;the others only babble after him&#x2014;was in connection with the means test. His attitude to-night was once again that we should relax the means test considerably, but the hon. member will never get around to telling us how far the means test should be relaxed. He will not dare do so. He merely says it should be relaxed considerably. Now I want to ask in all sincerity, and I shall ask any impartial person to be the judge of this matter: That relaxation of the means test which was announced in October 1964, and for which this legislation once more makes provision, i.e. the position where a man had previously possessed assets to the value of R2,400 and was able to obtain a full pension, and which was then relaxed so that a man could possess assets totalling R5,600 in the form of property or cash and could nevertheless qualify for a pension&#x2014;a relaxation of the limit from R2,400 to R5.600 &#x2014;is that not a considerable relaxation? Or how relaxed does the hon. member want it to be? As relaxed as his party&#x2019;s attitude? No, it was a considerable relaxation. The means plus pension limit was raised from R324 to R528. Is that not a considerable relaxation of the means test? Do they want it to be relaxed even further? But it is strange that while they are pleading for all these things, they are still pleading for the reduction of taxes. They say we are over-taxing the public.</p>

<p>I want to raise the following argument. At last, after a struggle lasting many years, we have now ascertained from the Opposition what amount they think sufficient for a pension. The hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned the amount; he spoke about a minimum amount of R40 per month. I accept that he is once more talking about the pensions of Whites. The Coloureds and the Indians must then receive R20 per month and the Bantu R10 per month, according to their own formula of 4-2-1. That will mean, based on a rapid calculation, that those increases they are asking for will cost an additional amount of R40,000,000 per year. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Sir, women do sometimes lead one astray, in the political sphere at least. I say that what the hon. member is now pleading for is an increase of at least R40,000.000 a year, but despite that the Opposition say we should reduce taxation.</p>

<p>I want to return to another point of view which was also expressed by the hon. member <span class="col_1145-1146" refersTo="page_0583"/>for Durban (Point). To-night he was exceptionally uncommunicative in respect of the protesting citizens. I have intentionally waited until after he has spoken before I broached the matter so as to afford him the opportunity of objecting to it, or of expressing a sober opinion on the matter. I want to do this because the hon. member for Durban (Point) made an interjection last year when I was pleading before the Minister for the protesting citizens, the rebels of 1914, and to-night I want to bring it home to him again. He asked whether Goldreich was also a protesting citizen. Goldreich is now being compared to a Jopie Fourie, a Christian de Wet, a General de la Rey and a General Beyers. Goldreich is being mentioned in the same category as the heroes of the Afrikaner nation, and to-night the hon. member did not have the courage to deny that those people, the protesting citizens, deserve a pension because they fought for an ideal in which our people believed, an ideal whereof we are plucking the fruits to-night&#x2014; for they were the precursors of the Republic of South Africa. But those people have been compared to people like Goldreich and Wolpe, saboteurs who have fled the country.</p>

<p>That is an absolute misrepresentation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member stated that case by implication and I just want to tell him that the Republic of South Africa is taking cognisance of his attitude. In addition, 1 want to tell the Minister at once that I thank him very sincerely on behalf of those citizens. I have received numerous letters as a result of the fact that I took up the matter in the House of Assembly. I have a whole list of names of people who will qualify for the pension and I shall furnish it to the Department. On behalf of all those protesting citizens, the rebels of 1914. I want to thank the Minister and the Government for their wisdom in acknowledging the service of those men, so that those veterans who had been forgotten for many years are no longer forgotten but are acknowledged by the State. I just want to plead for one other thing, and I know the Minister will consider it sympathetically. I do not know what the financial implications may be, but I see that the Act only comes into operation for them with effect from 1 October 1966. In view of the fact that the Minister of Finance anticipated it last year, these citizens expected that if it were to happen it could perhaps come into effect from October 1965. If the Minister could do something about that, I would appreciate it very much.</p>

<p>We are convinced that it is necessary to give pensions to old people. We would very much like to give more, but the Government is in a position of responsibility towards all its taxpayers, and we are not selling the pensioners short. The figures mentioned by the hon. member for Kimberley (South) indicated that our pensioners, in relation to the United Party policy, are a hundred times better off. I want to conclude with the thought that we, as a party, shall continue to act responsibly towards all our pensioners and will not make promises which we know beforehand we shall not be able to carry into effect, as the Opposition does.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I am in the fortunate position to-night that as member of the House of Assembly I do not have to make a speech on behalf of myself or on behalf of a party I represent which has to have any bearing on the forthcoming general election. The simple fact of the matter is that we have had many speeches in this House, in the no-confidence debate and in the Estimates debate which has just been concluded, dealing with important national matters, and one sat here wondering sometimes whether they were really genuine or whether they could be attributed to the election which lies ahead of us. But I am in the position that I do not have to take any notice of it. All that I am concerned about is the people I represent.</p>

<p>Now, since I became a Coloured representative in this House eight years ago I have never missed an opportunity of bringing it to the notice of this House, whenever it was necessary or whenever it was possible, that our position in South Africa is that the Coloureds are not being dealt with fairly when it comes to allowances or pensions. This has gone so far that I have made a study of it. Certain proportional figures were mentioned here to-night, but the hon. the Minister will bear out my testimony when I say that I went to him in 1960, saw him privately in his office, and pointed out that at the time old-age pensions, etc., were introduced, they were introduced on what is known as the 12-6-5-2, basis, i.e. 12 points for a White person, six points for a Coloured person, five points for an Indian, and two points for a Bantu. The hon. members for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) and Karoo (Mr. Eden) made certain assertions to-night, but I do not think their facts are quite correct, for since those pensions were introduced increases have been granted from time to time, under this Government and also under the previous Government. What happened was that the White&#x2019;s pensions were always increased to such an extent that they did not keep pace with the basis on which the Coloured&#x2019;s pensions were calculated. In 1960 I went to the present Minister, discussed the matter with him and the Minister saw my point, and I am glad that in 1961, when I had opposition in my constituency, it became known that as a result of my representation the Government had seen their way clear that year to increase Coloured pensions by R3 to restore the balance, so as to maintain the 12-6 basis. Since then it has always been my attitude that if we take into consideration the fact that the Coloureds have the same potential background and, to a great extent, the same origins as well as the same potential capacity <span class="col_1147-1148" refersTo="page_0584"/>as the Whites provided they are afforded the same educational and economic opportunities, we must take it into consideration that the Coloureds do not eat mealie porridge. They do not cook the head of an ox for their families each week. They eat the same food as the Whites and they wear the same clothes. If Coloureds reach the same economic and educational level as Whites, then their homes and their lives are appointed in such a way that they are in reality on the same level as Whites. Mr. Speaker, since the balance of the 12-6 basis was restored, I have continually been pleading for a better adjustment since the Coloureds cannot live on the half of what the Whites need to live on. I did that with due consideration for the potential of the Coloured when they could afford it and were educationally capable of doing so. That is why I am making another appeal to the hon. Minister now to reconsider the position of the Coloureds when he comes forward with another amendment to the Pensions Act. If we, since the 12-6 basis was restored in 1961, have not yet been able to improve upon this basis, then we must in any case not change that basis now to the detriment of the Coloureds. Let us always bear in mind that when this basis was originally established in 1928, it was accepted that the Coloureds were entitled to at least the half of the standard of living of the Whites and were capable of achieving half of what the Whites were capable of achieving. Let us at least retain that basis. If the pension of the Whites is increased by R2 per month, let the Coloured also obtain an increase of R1, and not only of 50c.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a specific problem has made itself apparent time and time again over the years, and I would like to bring it to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I am referring to the means test. I do not want to say very much in regard to this aspect, neither do I want to take up too much of the time of the House &#x2026;</p>

<p>Perhaps I did not express myself correctly, Mr. Speaker. Actually I do not want to talk about the means test. Mr. Speaker, the means test is applied even in cases where a change is made in the pensioner&#x2019;s pension. I do not want to go into that at the moment. Mr. Speaker, when a pension is being considered, one is dealing with two extremes. On the one hand we have the person who, although he was able to make provision for his old age, nevertheless neglected to make the necessary provision. He receives an old age pension. He is obliged to live in a sub-economic house. And this house has to be provided by the Government. On the other hand we have the case of the sensible person who over the years, has saved and when he qualifies for old age pension he has his own little nook with his own roof over his head. And because he lived sparingly and made provision for the lean years he is penalized in respect of the receipt of an old age pension. But he cannot eat his little nook and he cannot sell his house for then he would not have a roof over his head. I want to make an appeal to the hon. Minister, in respect of both Whites and Coloureds &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. This hon. Minister deserved to be praised for paying an additional R3 to the Coloured in 1961, whereby the balance was restored. But I want to emphasize once again that the standard of living of the Coloureds is not merely half as much as that of the Whites. We must try and improve it, if we thought in 1928 that it was, in fact, half as much. Where we are now dealing with a Bill in this connection. I am, in all sincerity making an earnest plea to the Minister that, if he cannot improve the position of the Coloureds, he must see to it that the 12-6 basis is maintained. I hope and trust that my appeal will not fall on deaf ears.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do agree with one or two members on that side of the House when they say that the pensioner is grateful for whatever extra allowance is granted to him by the Government. The pensioner get so little that, no matter how small the crumb dropped from the table of this very wealthy country of ours, he must be grateful even for that little bit. But I do believe that the hon. the Minister has had an opportunity to do something much more satisfactory, to do something very much better, during the last few years when he has been so highly praised for what he has done in this regard. Hon. members on that side have asked what amount should be paid to the pensioner. Well. Sir. there is a very simple formula for the hon. the Minister to follow. And that is to try and keep himself informed of the rise in the cost of living and of the standard of living at which he expects people in this category to live. Most of these old-age pensioners have absolutely nothing at all and are completely dependent on this pension for their livelihood. But they are also affected by the rising cost of living. They are obliged to find money with which to pay for their housing. They have to pay for their food. Because, much as the State desires to assist in the way of old-age homes and other forms of accommodation for our old people, up to now we have only been able to provide 5 per cent of the accommodation required for our old folk throughout the country who find themselves homeless and unable to afford the high rentals being charged. I do not believe that any person, be he the hon. the Minister or anybody else, can claim to have accomplished his life&#x2019;s work and created a monument to himself, when in fact that person has not achieved what he could have achieved, bearing in mind the present economic condition of our country.</p>

<p>I must admit, Sir, to a certain measure of sympathy towards the hon. the Minister. Because he unfortunately is hide-bound by a policy, a system, which seems to haunt his party. And that is that when you have to help people who have not, you do not help them adequately but you do it virtually in the form of a dole. You hand out a gift. There is a sub-conscious sense of a desire to be charitable, of a propensity only to give something if it is cloaked in this extraordinary mystic veil of charity. Nowadays, Mr. Speaker, the term charity is forgotten. We talk of welfare, of health, of assistance, to those who need it. We do not talk about charity to the have-nots. That is why I say I think the Minister deserves our sympathy, because he is part of a system of thinking which permeates the whole outlook of the present Government.</p>

<p>This country is not only riding on the wave of great prosperity, but we also have a tremendous amount of latent economic wealth, as has been said here over and over again during the past few weeks. This country will continue to move ahead, despite this or any other government. Surely we should keep abreast of developments in other countries in the world. There are other countries who are similarly situated to us. And although they are probably not as wealthy as we are, they provide their pensioners with an amount, annually or monthly or weekly, depending on the method of payment, which is adequate for their requirements and in keeping with their standard of living. I can point to a country like Australia where they try and keep abreast of a minimum salary as one of their bases. Pensions are adjusted to that particular system and to that particular standard. If one looks at pensions paid in England or America or certain countries in Europe, one finds a much more enlightened approach to this particular subject. We find in this country that when pensions are increased there is a feeling that concessions are being granted to people who have not. But in certain countries governments have toppled because of the problems connected with the care of the have-nots; the care of people who require hospitalization and medical care or any other assistance. It has become an important feature in the practical programme in other countries. The hon. the Minister has been abroad and he knows that in the U.S.A, a few years ago the question of medical care was one of the most important issues in the presidential election. In Belgium the Government has fallen because of dissatisfaction amongst the medical profession arising out of problems connected with hospitalization. In all countries of the world this whole question has become an important and a vital one. And the way to deal with the problem is not to arbitrarily add a certain sum to pensions already being paid. This addition to the old-age pensions has been described as sufficient to buy a daily newspaper for a year. And so much fuss has been made here to-night of the increases to pensioners!</p>

<p>We should like the hon. the Minister to explain to us how he can regard his attitude as being one of service when he has made this very small increase. Why has the Minister not directed his Department to adopt a much more modern approach to the whole question of pensions? We do not have many pensioners in this country. I think there are at the moment only approximately 100,000 or <span class="col_1151-1152" refersTo="page_0586"/>120,000 White pensioners in the country. That is not such a large figure. And if we take into consideration the number of pensioners in other groups it also is not a large number. What is an increase of R4,000,000 per year, Sir, an increase that has been so highly lauded by the hon. member for Kimberley (South)? The hon. member is interested in welfare work. He pays much attention to the unfortunate have-nots in his community. And yet he comes along here piously and acclaims the fact that this small concession has been made.</p>

<p>As I said, Sir, the people who receive these pensions are grateful. But surely the hon. the Minister knows that they cannot live on this small pension. The cost of living is spiralling in every field, not only in the field of food and clothing. Transport expenses are rising. Recreational amenities cost more by the day. Present circumstances demand much more than a small increase given, in my view, in an arbitrary manner.</p>

<p>Now there has been some criticism of what the United Party did in 1948. But I cannot accept&#x2014;and I do not think that any reasonable, thinking person can accept&#x2014;that any hon. member on that side of the House is serious when making such allegations. We have merely to look at our budget, our capital investments, our balance of payments, and taking a cross-view of the South African economy to decide that the present situation bears no relation to that existing in 1948. The changes have not come about because of a change of Government in that year. Oh no. The whole world has had its economy reshaped over the last 15 or 20 years. Other countries are also enjoying prosperity, even though they have changed governments on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House appreciate the importance of making some concessions to the pensioners. But we feel the approach to the whole matter has not been a sound one. And I think the hon. the Minister owes an explanation to the House. I do not want the Minister to think that we regard him as a hardhearted person, a pharoah who refuses to take his hand off his heart. We appreciate that he is hide-bound by the form of thinking on that side of the House. But if he can break through, if he can even at this late stage give the House some indication that he himself is convinced that a much more modern and sound approach should be made; if he states that he is satisfied that our pleadings are not uncalled-for; if he knows that when we refer to an inadequate sum we do not imply thereby that the hon. the Minister has completely failed; then we on this side of the House will feel we have achieved something. We feel, Sir, that the hon. the Minister has failed to appreciate that this sum of money, large as it may seem compared to sums granted 15 or 20 years ago, is to-day completely inadequate to meet the demands that are being made on the ordinary individual, and more so the pensioner, to keep body and soul together and to provide the necessities of life as is required in modern society.</p>

<p>That is the plea we make to the hon. the Minister, and we sincerely hope that he will respond and give us something in his reply which will perhaps give more hope to the pensioner, maybe not for to-day but at least for the future.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am surprised at the speeches made by hon. members opposite in this debate. Before saying something about the subject now before us, I would like to refresh the memories of hon. members opposite on one or two points. In 1948 pensioners received R10 per month, as compared with the R29 they are receiving to-day. That represents an increase of virtually 290 per cent. Hon. members do not appreciate this increase. On the contrary, they criticize the fact that it is not an even larger one. I am convinced that every pensioer in South Africa who depends on his pension for a living is very grateful for any increase, however small it may be. They are deeply grateful because the Government has looked after them once again and has granted this increase of R2. Every one of us would naturally have liked to see a larger increase. However we should take the circumstances into account. Further concessions have been granted. The limit of assets has been increased from R2,400 to R5.600. Hon. members on this side have pleaded for this concession, and we know that many people who did not qualify for pensions previously will now qualify. All the concessions which pensioners have recently been granted are of exceptional value.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my indignation at the criticism voiced by that side because a group of people of 1914 will now qualify as well, people whom they compare with listed communists and whom they place in the same category. That is something the people outside should keep in mind. Hon. members have mentioned these people in the same breath as they mentioned Goldreich, who is one of those whose sole aim it is to destroy our country and who are regarded as extreme communists. That is something hon. members opposite should not have done, and I can assure them that those people who took part in the 1914 Rebellion will not feel very happy about the fact that they are grouped with communists by those hon. members.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side are deeply grateful for the fact that that group of people will also qualify for pensions now. There are not many of them left. They sacrificed everything for their beloved country&#x2014;South Africa&#x2014;and we are grateful that this legislation also enables them to draw pensions.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in view of the turn this debate has taken, I am really sorry <span class="col_1153-1154" refersTo="page_0587"/>that I have to make my final speech on this subject now. I think I may rightly say without any fear of contradiction from any side of this House that as regards pensions, I have done my utmost for the under-privileged section of our population since 1958, and as regards social welfare, I have done so since 1954. I may also claim that I have never made a political issue of those matters. I have taken this House into my confidence time and again. I have invited hon. members to visit me in my office. I said to them: &#x201C;Come to my office, the door is open to you. Come to the Department, the offices are open to you. Come and tell us about your problems. Come with your suggestions. Give us an opportunity of examining those matters so as to enable me to know how you feel about those matters when they are raised in this House.&#x201D; But I have been greatly disappointed. Since 1965&#x2014;since the end of last year&#x2019;s session&#x2014;I cannot recall a single member from that side visiting me in my office.</p>

<p>We addressed letters to you.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but my invitations were so personal, so friendly. I am very unassuming but I am also very friendly. If I am incorrect in my recollections then I ask you to forgive me. What I can recall very clearly is that the executive committee of the B.E.S.L. visited me and also my predecessor. They requested an interview with me. I consented and invited them to have tea with me. They came and they told me that the purpose of the visit was to have a friendly conversation and to express their gratitude for what I have done for the ex-volunteers and their gratitude for the sound relationship existing between me and the B.E.S.L. Our conversation lasted approximately an hour. It was pleasant to meet those people. They did not want to discuss problems. They merely wanted to express their gratitude.</p>

<p>It is such a natural thing that we should have sound relations in this country in that respect. Over the period of 11 years which I have been in charge of this portfolio, I have pleaded for a sound relationship for here we are dealing with people and human relationships. That relationship does not merely exist between the Government and the public or between a party and its supporters. That relationship exists between the people. It is the attitude of one person towards another. Over the years I have pleaded that we in South Africa should jointly accept the responsibility of caring for the under-privileged in our country. I visited eight countries in Europe in order to make a study of their systems. Various systems are followed, but not one is a model system. There are few systems on the Continent which really provide for the needs of the poor. In practically every country one finds supplementary systems and in Britain, for example, the system is not merely based on a &#x201C;means test&#x201D; but also on a &#x201C;needs test&#x201D;. People who drop out, for whatever reason, need the support of the State, the church and the social institutions in our country. I have always pleaded that our basis should be co-operation amongst the State, the church and the community.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to lecture on morals, Mr. Speaker, but I think that I deserve some appreciation from both sides of this House for the basis I have laid down in that respect. I expected at least that now that I am appearing for the last time in this House in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>Because it is not becoming. I have never drawn politics into those matters. And the hon. member knows that. And now the hon. member holds that against me!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, figures speak the truth, and I now want to mention a few truths. I want to refer to the increase in this Vote since the year 1959-60. In that year the figure was R1,811,000. In 1960-61 it was R2,325,000. In 1961-62 it was R2,860,000. In 1962-63 it was R3,854,000. In 1963-64 it was R6,301,000. In 1964-65 there was an increase of nearly R3,500,000. Last year it was R8,648,000. I announced at an early stage that I was not returning to Parliament something which hon. members possibly did not expect. I feel quite happy that I am able to add the amount of R6,155,000 this year, after last year&#x2019;s large amount. I do not want to make a comparison with what happened in 1948 as times and values have changed in the meantime, but it is nevertheless interesting to note that total expenditure on this service amounted to R16,931,000 in 1947-’48. I am making this comparison really for the sake of showing that we have in fact made progress, and what is more, remarkable progress. We have improved relationships, we have created a better disposition, also as regards the various sides of this House. Now it is my wish that that goodwill will be preserved for the future, also when I am no longer here.</p>

<p>The hon. member should not interrupt me. This will be my last Parliamentary session and therefore I shall never again be able to interrupt that hon. member. And now I want to refer to one or two inconsistencies which were revealed in the course of this debate. There we have the Coloured Representatives. One of them rose in his seat and pleaded for an equal basis for our social pensions with regard to all groups.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>You are quite wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member did plead for that. In the process of doing so he used language I have never used in this House and which I shall not use to-night either. Another Coloured Representative rose in his seat and said a change in the ratio was made in 1961, something which he said I was instrumental in doing. Coloureds and Indians were placed on an equal basis as a result of that change. At first he pleaded that I should retain that basis, but before he was through he requested me to raise the ratio from 6:3 to 6:4. Hon. members are fully aware that I have never adopted an unfeeling attitude towards those matters. I proved that once more in 1961. But let me say at this stage that because of the very fact that there is such a great deal of scheming in connection with that matter, I have referred the entire matter as regards Coloureds, Indians and the Bantu back to my Department for investigation. At present they are engaged on that. They now have to try and find an agreed uniform basis. It will be a very good thing if they can succeed in doing so.</p>

<p>There is one general statement which was made during this debate which I want to refute. Since the time social pensions were introduced, it has never been the intention of any government to make that pension absolutely sufficient for the receiver of the pension to exist on. In Holland, where they also have those schemes, I asked them what they did if a person did not make his small contribution to the pension he received. Their reply was that the State would make a contribution in a case like that. When I asked them who contributed in the case of a work-shy man, they replied that the State also contributed in such case. Our system in South Africa is more sound for two reasons. In the first instance it remains those people&#x2019;s responsibility to make a contribution themselves in order to provide for their old-age. The State and the taxpayers do not have to make provision for everything. It is a psychologically sound system. In addition we have the system of welfare organizations of which more than 2,000 are registered. The hon. member for Florida (Mr. H. Miller) spoke here about the isolation of those people and said that they did not want to go to a welfare organization to beg for a contribution. But nobody has ever asked them to go and beg for a contribution. I have said in this House that those pensions were a right, a right laid down in the legislation of this House. Consequently they are not alms being distributed. That is what I have always maintained and what I am still maintaining. Consequently it is not always necessary or right for them themselves to go and ask for what they regard as alms. The other section of society, the church bodies, welfare organizations and those who have a love for their fellow-man, should visit those people and relieve their loneliness. It is not necessary for them to sit in their loneliness with only a radio and a few books. It is absolutely essential that we should have a spirit of helpfulness in society so that the under-privileged, those who suffer and are lonely, can be visited and helped.</p>

<p>It is an excellent thing in society that we still find welfare organizations and people with good hearts, hearts that bleed for those people, people who visit them not merely to give them a few pence, or to tell them that they can apply for a pension, but to meet them and to keep them company.</p>

<p>It has once more been said during this debate this evening that I should change the system. But for the reasons I have mentioned I am in favour of that system. I think they are all sound reasons and South Africa will definitely be that much poorer if we have to abandon that system one day. Naturally, everybody cannot always agree about the details of the concessions made. One is aware of that. I can understand that individual members will differ. That being the case, we cannot expect that the wishes of each one should be granted.</p>

<p>I shall have the matter re-investigated. Now I have reached the stage where I want to express my thanks for the voices of appreciation which came from both sides of the House for what I have tried to bring about, however poor those efforts might have been. To hon. members on this side of the House I want to express my special thanks and appreciation for the gratitude they have shown me, and I want to thank them for the support given me over the years when I came up with proposals which to my mind were based on the right principles. When there were members who became irritable about these matters, I too became irritable. But when hon. members approached those matters in the right spirit, in a spirit of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you, then it was appreciated by all. I particularly want to express my gratitude to the entire House for its support in the awarding of pensions to the protesting citizens of the 1914 Rebellion. There have been many struggles in the history of our country. Nations are not born without struggle <span class="col_1157-1158" refersTo="page_0589"/>and conflict. We too had that in South Africa. Although we have gone through that period, we still carry along with us a common feeling, a feeling of joint and uniform citizenship. The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) (Mr. Oldfield) put questions to me in connection with the veterans of the 1914-18 War. He asked whether those people could be placed on the same basis as that on which the veterans of the Second Anglo-Boer War were placed. To do that would be very expensive at this stage, and consequently the Government did not see its way clear to do so now. But that matter, as other matters, will present itself from time to time and will be examined in the light of new circumstances each time.</p>

<p>The intention is that the same procedure has to be followed as that followed in the case of persons who took part in the Second Anglo-Boer War. Under the circumstances each application will have to be accompanied by an affidavit from a person who took part in the Rebellion with the applicant. I expect that we shall come across many difficulties in this connection. The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. C. P. Mulder) asked me whether it would not be possible to grant pensions with retrospective effect. I do not think that that is possible. Provision has been made in this Bill that any person with retrospective effect will have to wait until 1 October. Experience has taught us that the administration of that type of pension is very difficult. Every application has to be checked vary carefully in order to see that legislation is applied correctly.</p>

<p>Now. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank you for your patience from the Chair with an impossible character such as myself&#x2014;someone who quarrelled a great deal. Even on occasions tonight. Sir, you were ready to remind me that I should not pay any attention to those matters to which I ought to pay no attention. I also want to express my thanks to the staff of Parliament. On behalf of all members of this House I cannot refrain from expressing our gratitude to the officials of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and to all those concerned in ensuring that the administration and the functions of the Department run as smoothly as possible.

<p><b>(Second Reading)</b></p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>

<p>Public prospecting for base minerals on State land in the Cape Province takes place in terms of prospecting licences under the old Cape &#x201C;Mineral Law Amendment Act&#x201D; (No. 16 of 1907), and that by means of pegging off prospecting areas of which the maximum extent is 1,000 acres or approximately 473 morgen. Numerous such areas have been pegged off on areas such as Steinkopf-Concordia, Komaggas, the Richtersveld, Pella, Vioolsdrift South and the Olifant&#x2019;s River Settlement in the North-Western Cape, and some of the claims so pegged off have led to valuable discoveries of base minerals. However, parts of some of the said areas are diamondiferous as well, and accordingly, after an investigation by a committee, prospecting rights for precious stones in these areas have recently been granted to certain bodies in order that the precious stones potential may be investigated thoroughly.</p>

<p>However, the said Act No. 16 of 1907 which from the nature of the case is very much outdated, contains provisions which place a total prohibition on prospecting for base minerals on land on which prospecting rights for precious stones already exist. In terms of the Precious Stones Act of 1964, the formal negotiation of prospecting leases for precious stones on the areas in question will therefore bring prospecting for base minerals in such areas to a standstill. Seeing that such a state of affairs will not be in the interests of the country and is also unnecessary, it is now contemplated to establish means which will permit of the simultaneous prospecting for both base minerals and precious stones in such areas.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of the Bill purports to enable the <i>bona fide</i> prospector for base minerals to continue his prospecting activities for base minerals by means of a mutual agreement with the prospector for precious stones, and to appeal to the Minister if the prospector for precious stones should withhold his permission in an unreasonable manner. In terms of the proposed provisions both parties will be given the opportunity of putting their case and the Minister may make his permission subject to conditions, so that it ought to be possible to arrange matters in such a manner that both parties will be able to continue their prospecting work without hampering each other&#x2019;s activities unnecessarily. The question may perhaps be asked why this legislation is introduced at this stage instead of waiting for a consolidation of the legal provisions in regard to mining rights. The commission which investigates this matter has not yet submitted their report, and after it has done so, legislation will still have to be piloted through. For almost 40 years all State land has been closed as regards prospecting for precious stones. Owing to amendments to diamond legislation in 1960, 1963 and 1964, it has indeed become possible to prospect on State land, and as a result of that the possibility of conflicting interests has arisen. Prospecting leases for <span class="col_1159-1160" refersTo="page_0590"/>precious stones are ready for signature so that the parties concerned may proceed with their prospecting. For that reason the Government feels that it is advisable to right the matter at this stage so that, when the leases are issued, it may not bring prospecting for base minerals to a standstill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill follows the same pattern as other legislation on mining subjects introduced over the past few years, in that it is being introduced very hurriedly at the end of a session. Last year and the year before I complained to the Minister that it was grossly unfair to bring in this type of legislation at the end of a session. The more so this Session which is a short Session and during which we virtually had no time to go into the Bill thoroughly. What does this Bill entail? According to the Minister&#x2019;s remarks it would appear that there are vast tracks of land owned by the State on which prospecting is being carried out by* base mineral prospectors. During the course of time it was found that this land was diamondiferous and thereupon licences were taken out by prospectors to prospect for diamonds. But when diamonds were found, a prohibition was placed on the prospecting for base minerals, with the result that the base mineral prospectors were handicapped in their work, and large tracks of land could no longer be worked by them. The Minister knows, as we all know, that once a prospector is licensed to prospect and discovers what he thinks is a payable proposition, it is automatic for him to receive a licence or permission to work the base metals he has discovered. Further he is given an area of land 1,000 acres in extent.</p>

<p>On the face of it it would appear that things were going along quite satisfactorily since 1907 until 1966. Now the Minister comes along in great haste and requires us to pass a Bill here which is going to grant permission to the base metal prospector to carry on his work if he can come to an agreement with the prospector who has a diamond licence, or with those people who are taking diamonds out of this State-owned land. If the prospector for base metals can come to an agreement with the diamond man then he will be all right and both of them can then proceed, on the same piece of ground almost, to work their claims&#x2014;the one looking for diamonds and the other one for base metals. This they can do at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a clause in this Bill which is identical to one in the Mineral Rights Bill which is now being investigated by a commission. The Minister shall probably have to wait at the most the best part of the year before that Mining Rights Bill becomes law. Now I want to ask what can then the reason be for the haste with this Bill? Has the Minister had any representations from groups of people that he should go ahead with this Bill? Has he discussed this Bill with anybody?</p>

<p>Has he discussed it with any large group of people or with individuals? What pressure is being brought to bear, if any, to push this Bill through to-night? Is there a group of people who have formed themselves into a company already and which requires this prohibition to be lifted immediately? The Minister has not given us any reply to these questions. The only thing he said was that this Bill would permit people to get on with their prospecting. That will allow the people concerned to make a living. But they are making a living now.</p>

<p>I, for one, cannot agree that this niece of legislation is a matter of urgency and that it can be adopted without further opportunities of study. I ask that this Bill be held back until we have been able to listen and consider the opinions of interested people. These things we, on this side of the House, feel we are entitled to, before we can come to a conclusion on this Bill. Perhaps the Minister will ask one of the speakers on his side of the House to tell us who wants this Bill rushed through. Perhaps the hon. the Minister himself will tell us when he replies. The Minister must realize however that we shall have to wait only another five months before the Mineral Rights Bill will be before Parliament. He also knows, as well as I do, that most of the contents of that Bill will be agreed to by the commissioners. Surely then there must be some other explanation for this Bill than the one he gave us to-night.</p>

<p>In the circumstances we on this side of the House cannot support the Minister&#x2019;s intention to rush through this piece of legislation. We on this side will accordingly vote against it. But the Minister must remember that we do not only vote against the Bill. At the same time we are protesting at the manner in which this legislation has been introduced. We ask that ample time be given to this side of the House to study bills coming from the Department of Mines in order to consult with other interested parties. In conclusion I want to say that the manner in which this Bill has been introduced here to-night deserves no support at all.</p>

<p>If the hon. member had ever been in Namaqualand, he would not have been as suspicious of a purely innocent piece of legislation such as this. This is a piece of legislation which has been necessitated by circumstances. This Bill contains nothing which is complicated and its only object is to supply a deficiency in the existing legislation. For that reason I fail to see why the hon. the Minister cannot proceed with it now. Hon. members should realize that under present circumstances a large group of people are being inconvenienced. This legislation is going to solve a great problem.</p>
