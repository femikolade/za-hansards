<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The income tax proposals before us to-day under Paragraph 1 is a lengthy schedule which will be included in the Bill. It is our contention that it is time that the Minister gave consideration to the fundamental basis of taxation and that is that as far as possible taxes should be borne evenly by the various members of the community, depending on their capacity to bear the taxes. If the Minister studies this schedule he will find that the income tax rates have the effect of placing an undue burden on the middle-income groups instead of having the effect of a gradual increase. If the rates of tax were plotted on a graph, it would show an unfair load, particularly in respect of those in the income brackets from R6,000 to R8,000 or R8,500 per annum, and I would ask the Minister, in considering these rates, whether his Department has given this matter any consideration, or whether it is possible that the adjustment to renew this unfair burden will be considered in future taxation proposals.</p>

<p>In the present taxation proposals before us, under the heading of income tax rates, it does have the effect of inflicting a heavier burden on this particular group. There is a gradual increase in the lower income groups from those who pay nothing up to the level of R6,000 and there is this undue burden up to R8.500 and thereafter there is a gradual increase for those in the high income groups. It is my contention that consideration should be given to this matter and I should like to hear from the Minister whether he has given this matter consideration and whether there are any prospects of being able to solve the problem, because as it stands now it constitutes an undue burden on those persons.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown is referring to what is popularly known as the bulge in the curve, which is a direct result of the old supertax. When we changed over and abolished the supertax, this was one of the legacies. I have already on two occasions tried to flatten out that bulge, and in both cases it called for a considerable sacrifice of income. I am always seeing whether there is any opportunity of completing the process which I began in trying to flatten out that bulge, and whenever the opportunity presents itself I am sure we shall continue in our endeavour to make the bulge even instead of letting it bulge out as at present.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to join in this Battle of the Bulge. I think this is the third occasion on which we have had from the hon. the Minister of Finance an acceptance of the fact that he would like to have this bulge ironed out but he seems to find it impossible to do so. In his reply to the Budget debate last year, the hon. the Minister told us of the differences in the rates of taxation applying to the lower income groups and the taxation applying to the higher income groups up to R6,000. He told us last year, as he has again told us to-day, that this is a legacy that we have from the old supertax. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have already on two occasions tried to reduce the bulge but it is still there, and because of that it means that the persons in that category will naturally have a much bigger direct benefit than those in the category where they only have to pay 7 per cent to 10 per cent.</block>

<p>I think this matter is far too serious for the hon. the Minister to tell us each year that he is trying to iron out this bulge. Surely there must be something he can do about it because what is the factual position&#x003F; On the incremental rate of tax between R3,000 and R4,000, the taxpayer pays R90 on the additional R1,000; from R4,000 to R5,000 he pays R94 on the additional R1,000 and then suddenly from R5,000 to R6,000 he pays R200 on the extra R1,000, and from R6,000 to R7,000 he pays an extra R290 on the extra R1,000. Sir, I do not think it is a question of finding the right occasion to iron out this bulge. I think that what the hon. the Minister has to do is to get down to it with his Department and find a formula whereby he can iron out the bulge. It is accepted generally that this bulge is unfair to those taxpayers who fall in the R5,000-R7,000 income bracket. I want to ask the Minister to see whether he cannot during the recess&#x2014;because he obviously cannot do it now&#x2014;find a formula which will get rid of this unfair imposition of a higher rate of tax on this particular group.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is very clear that if the hon. the Minister wants to iron out this so-called bulge in a logical way, he will have to increase the taxation on the income groups below R6,000 considerably, which we certainly do not want to do, because in spite of the interjection that was made here while the hon. member for Pinetown was speaking, namely that this Government, was a Government for the rich people, we should not like to introduce a considerable increase in the taxation of the first five categories from R1,000 to R5,000, and that is in actual fact the only logical solution to the problem of ironing out that bulge, because beyond the R6,000 notch and up to the R8,000 notch one still gets the rapid increase that one gets in that bracket. The first increase from R90 to approximately R200 when one comes to the R6,000 notch, one gets as a result of the fact that we do not want to tax the lower income groups heavily.</p>

<p>If one looks at the percentages which the taxes represent of the taxpayers&#x2019; income, one finds that the percentages start with 1 per cent at R1,600; then they increase to 2 per cent, 3 per cent, 4 per cent, 6 per cent, 8 per cent, eleven per cent and when one gets to R6,000 there is a sudden jump to 18 per cent. Beyond that the percentage continues to increase rapidly, very rapidly in fact, but that is only because the taxation in respect of the first few categories from R1,000 to R6,000 is so particularly low. Surely the Opposition does not want us to tax the R1,000 to R6,000 income groups much more heavily&#x003F;</p>

<p>I should like to refer to sub-paragraph (c) and especially the proviso at the top of page 290. I have referred on many previous occasions to this discriminatory taxation on gold mining companies and gold mining shareholders. Sir, in these proposals the Minister has made the position even more complicated than it already was. We know that we have this formula: <i>y</i> &#x003D; 60;360/<i>X</i> we know that that is not an equitable form of taxation. It is not equitable as between a commercial company and a gold mining company. We now find that the Minister, in dealing with gold mining companies, has reached this stage: In the first place, when they have worked out their gold mining profits at the end of the financial year, they first have as a partner the hon. the Minister representing the Government, because of the lease. The Government is, of course, a big shareholder in any gold mine. That is the first; then the Government comes along with a discriminatory tax; it is discriminatory because it differs from the form of tax for any commercial company.</p>

<p>The second burden the company has to bear, the second tax, is this tax which is determined in accordance with the formula <i>y &#x003D;</i>60-360/<i>X</i>,and then after that tax has been deducted, the shareholders receive their dividends, and then the Minister comes along and taxes the shareholders&#x2019; dividends as part of their income; that is the third tax, and now the hon. the Minister has introduced a fourth. He is not satisfied with the complications that we already have; he now says: &#x201C;You will pay an extra 5 per cent, in addition to this formula.&#x201D; Sir, that is quite out of touch with the formula. I think the I time has arrived when the hon. the Minister <span class="col_3685-3686" refersTo="page_0422"/>should say: &#x201C;I am going to abandon this 5 per cent.&#x201D; Let us try to get together with the mining industry and see if we cannot get a rational form of taxation. Of course, I know what the argument is; everybody knows that it is argued that the gold mines are mines which exploit the patrimony of South Africa; that this wealth belongs to the country. I agree with all that.</p>

<p>The same is true of diamond mining. That wealth belongs to the country and the mining company is given the right to work the mine, but then the Government comes in with its lease and says, &#x201C;because you have that right you will have to pay for exploiting the patrimony of South Africa in accordance with this lease&#x201D;. Sir, why should we have this complicated taxation&#x003F; I appeal to the hon. the Minister to say: &#x201C;I am not going to complicate the position further; I am not going to impose this 5 per cent.&#x201D; That was his attitude last year. Why change his attitude this year when costs have increased&#x003F; You cannot increase the price of your product in gold mining. The hon. the Minister raises the price of petrol; his colleague, the Minister of Transport, raises the cost of transport, and now the hon. the Minister comes along and says, &#x201C;We are going to tax you further although you cannot raise the price of your product.&#x201D; Sir, I think it is inequitable.</p>

<p>In connection with this question of the ironing out of the bulge, I want to point out that to come along with this proposal this year is in fact to do so at the most inopportune time, because if that is done, as the Opposition apparently wants it to be done, it will result in a tremendous loss of revenue from taxation. I want to point out to the Opposition that these taxation proposals flow from a Budget which forms part of a four-point plan for combating the threat of inflation in South Africa. It would certainly be very unwise on the part of the hon. the Minister to iron out this bulge this year. I am not saying that there is not sufficient merit in the suggestion that that should be done, but even if there is sufficient merit in it to justify that being done, then this year of all years will definitely be the wrong year in which to do it, because it will mean a very heavy loss of revenue. As regards the interjection that has been made, namely that the taxation proposals favour the richer people, I just want to point out that in spite of the need for financing that we have this year, the scales we have before us are exactly the same as those of last year. Under the scales we are considering now, not one single person in South Africa who did not pay income tax last year will pay income tax this year; and in terms of these clauses&#x2014;look at paragraph (g) for example&#x2014;not one single person will become subject to the loan levy who would not have been subject to it last year as well. I think that from the point of view of the ordinary taxpayer there is a very great deal of merit in these proposals.</p>

<p>Let us just consider what the position is in the case of the less well-to-do people at the bottom end of the curve. In order to make it possible to view this matter in its correct perspective, particularly in view of the interjection that came from the Opposition side, I should like to mention the income tax to be paid according to these scales by people who fall in this lowest group here. A husband and wife with a taxable income of R2,000 and with two children&#x2014;incidentally, that is after deduction of the rebates, which we are not discussing to-day&#x2014;will, according to this scale, as compared with last year&#x2019;s scale, and with the withdrawal of the 5 per cent rebate which we had last year, pay 6c per month more in tax. It was in this connection that the hon. the Minister said that he wanted to spread the burden over as many people as possible; everybody had to make his contribution. These people with a taxable income of R2,000 and two children will pay 6c per month more.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>Not less, though.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is 6c, and over the year it will be 70c. People with an income of R2,000 and with three or, of course, four children will not have to pay any income tax. People with an income of R3,000 and two children will, as a result of the 5 per cent rebate falling away, pay 40c per month more this year. That is the contribution to be made by them in terms of these proposals. People with an income of R3,000 and three children will pay 23c per month more, and with four children 7c per month more. I want to deal with only one further group of people under these scales, namely those with a taxable income of R4,000. As a result of the 5 per cent rebate falling away, a person with a taxable income of R4,000 and two children will pay 75c per month more, with three children 6c per month more and with four children 4c per month more. That is the contribution they are being asked to make. I just want to place the matter in the correct perspective, and I want to say that the less well-to-do people are not prejudiced in any way by the proposals before us.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Kensington is concerned, I do want him to be more explicit. Could it be that the hon. member wants to plead outright that gold mines should be treated like ordinary companies under our tax legislation&#x003F;</p>

<p>If the mine is a failure, this will be of no use to it. It will not be paying any tax. Sir, I do not think the gold mines have anything to complain about. They are being treated very well. If we take the average that a gold mine pays over the years from the day it starts operating until the day it liquidates itself and realizes all its equipment, then I think that over the years it will fall far below the minimum of 30 or 33&#x00BD; per cent, which is what our company tax is to-day. The hon. member now comes along and says that we are adding an extra 5 per cent this year as far as the gold mines are concerned. That is quite correct. But again I refer to what was said by the hon. the Minister, namely that he wanted to spread the burden as widely as possible. Must the individual make a larger contribution, even if it is only a small amount; must the ordinary company make a larger contribution now; must the diamond mines and the other mines make their contributions, but does the hon. member for Kensington now want the gold mines as such not to make their contribution to this Budget as it has been prepared and with the object it has in view&#x003F; I think the hon. member is wrong, both in respect of the entire structure of the tax on gold mines, which in my opinion is quite fair and which I do not think even the Chamber of Mines would like to see changed, and in respect of this additional 5 per cent which the gold mines, together with the rest of our population, are being called upon to bear.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I had not intended to come into this debate, but when my hon. colleague, the member for Pinetown, spoke, I thought that we like the Government side had turned into a rich man&#x2019;s party, but on giving it a little bit of thought, Sir, I realized that the hon. member for Pinetown was quite correct, as the hon. member for Queenstown has admitted. You see, we have become accustomed to deal in pounds, shillings and pence. Now we have switched and we people who have all our lives dealt in pounds, shillings and pence, we in terms of a 6,000 income are inclined to associate that with &#x00A3;6,000, and I thought we had become a rich man&#x2019;s party too. But the hon. member for Pinetown is talking about a R6,000 income. Sir, when you adapt yourself to that thinking, that is the income of the average person to-day, because if they have less than that, they find difficulty in existing, and the man below that, the man with whom the hon. member for Queenstown has dealt, experiences trouble to-day when he has a family. He should not really pay much income tax at all. The hon. member for Queenstown said that it was just a small increase. Sir, such a man should not have his tax increased at all, because with the depreciating value of our money under this Government, the man earning less than R6,000 a year is finding the greatest difficulty, I can assure you, in keeping up the standard of living to which he has become accustomed. So I must add my plea to that of the hon. member for Pinetown and ask the hon. the Minister to look seriously into this bulge. This is the person, the middle income person, call him the white collar worker, call him what you like, but I would say to-day that it includes many pensioners too who have spread their investment wisely, who have worked hard and saved hard&#x2014;this R6,000 a year income includes many of those people. The hon. Minister is now spreading his net and is depending upon those middle income people, the salt of South Africa, to meet his increased tax demands, to meet his increased expenditure demands. Sir, this is a matter of extreme urgency; it is not a matter for the hon. the Minister to stand up and say: &#x201C;Over the course of some time&#x201D;. He hopes to straighten out the bulge; but he naturally accepts first of all that he is over-taxing that group, that there is a bulge, and that he has got to straighten it out. But he is not prepared to straighten it out as quickly as he should. I think this hon. Minister should take steps immediately to do away with this problem so that taxation can be spread fairly and evenly.</p>

<p>It is a known fact and I think it is accepted throughout South Africa that during the term of office of this Government the richer people have become richer, and the poorer people have become poorer, and I believe that this hon. Minister must spread his net in the richer group and not in the poorer group so that the increased tax demands on Defence because of the inefficiency of this Government, because it fails to come to peace with the rest of the world &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, the point I am dealing with is this. This income scale is drawn up in such a way that the poor man will not be taxed. Every one of us must have a certain income to pay one&#x2019;s house rent and to provide for one&#x2019;s daily needs. Surely it is quite obvious that up to R5,000 one cannot require such a person to pay too large an amount in taxation, and beyond that the curve can go very high. If we look at the table, we find that a man who has four children pays R210 on R5,000. If he has an income of R6,000, he pays R420, and if he has an income of R10,000, he pays R1,816. It goes much higher than that still. If a man earns R20,000, he has to pay R6,436 in tax.</p>

<p>If the other companies have to pay the levy and we are satisfied with that, we also have to be satisfied with the gold mines having to pay it. We should not demand less of them. I just want to point out to the hon. member that, according to the White Paper that was issued along with the Budget Speech, the tax paid by the gold mines for the year 1965 amounted to R72,589,000. That represented 37 per cent of the net profit they had made. I think that if those gold mines can pay an amount such as that, they are certainly not starving. Just compare this position with that of the manufacturing industry and of other companies. They only paid R46,000,000, in spite of the fact that manufacturing industry makes a much larger contribution to the national product than the gold mines do. We may therefore see that this tax paid by the gold mines is a very fair one. The other companies are not being over-taxed; the taxation is fair and they are able to bear it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think we want to get this question of the bulge very clear. All we are asking for&#x2014;and this is something with which the hon. the Minister agrees &#x2014;is that this bulge should be ironed out. The hon. member for Paarl is quite wrong when he says that the only way in which you can do it is by adding tax to the lower income groups below the bulge. There are dozens of ways it can be done. You can give up the tax which the Government is taking. This we will support. If the Minister says he is going to reduce the tax we will support him. He can increase the lower income groups&#x2019; tax and we will probably oppose it. He can increase the higher income groups&#x2019; tax&#x2014;we will probably oppose that too. There are a hundred different computations and permutations whereby this bulge can be removed.</p>

<p>All we are saying to the Minister is please do not delay any longer. Work out a formula of how to remove the bulge. When you bring it to the House we will vote for it if we agree with your method, and we will vote against it if we disagree with your method. That is all we are saying.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the other side talked about the spread of the increased taxation this year, and amongst other sections mentioned has been that of the company. You will remember, Mr. Chairman, that last year our company tax was increased by 5 per cent of the tax paid. We objected to it last year. This year it has been increased by 3-j per cent&#x2014;that is, the actual tax, not of the tax paid&#x2014;so that the tax is now 33&#x00BE; per cent and not 30 per cent.</p>

<p>Now, I find it difficult to understand why the Minister&#x2014;like unfortunately so many other Ministers of Finance throughout the world&#x2014;singles out the company as an entity for increased taxation. There can only be one reason that I can see, and that is that it is the easiest unit to tax more heavily, because they are limited in number and they are not the broad bulk of the population. So you <span class="col_3691-3692" refersTo="page_0425"/>do limit the area of protest. I said in this House before, and I repeat again, that a company is merely a group of persons. It is true that it has an identity and an entity in law. But in practice and in effect it consists of its shareholders. So that when you increase the taxation of a company you automatically increase the taxation of that company&#x2019;s shareholders. Why is this group of persons being singled out&#x003F; If tax has to be imposed to a greater extent than in any previous year, why is it that time and time again the company is singled out for increased taxation&#x003F; In other words, through the company a limited number of taxpayers is singled out. I believe it to be unfair. I know that in many countries when they are short of funds or they have to balance their budget, the first thing they do is to increase the tax on companies. The Minister has told us that many companies in many parts of the world pay higher rates of company tax. In most countries there are, of course, different facets to the picture. Some of the taxes are grossed up in the hands of the recipient on a sort of apportionment basis. There are different methods. But the basic principle of increasing taxes of companies and leaving all other taxpayers alone I believe to be wrong. I do not believe that the incidence is fairly spread. I should like the Minister to tell us what is the basic principle behind the increase in taxes for companies.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to raise under Head 1 of the taxation proposals the question of the whole basis of the P.A.Y.E. tables for working married women. I have them with me here on my desk&#x2014;they are extremely relevant to this discussion. May I say that thousands of women in the middle-income and lower-income groups are very much affected by these tables in South Africa to-day. I wish to make it clear from the start that I consider it extraordinarily shortsighted of this Minister that he should choose to overtax these working married women as he does at the present time. I am quite aware that the final income-tax position is adjusted. We know that. It is adjusted in terms of rebates or further payment when the joint income of a married couple is finally assessed. But the absurdity of the whole situation is that although married working women are taxed at source&#x2014; and here are the tables to prove it&#x2014;it is done at double the rate of anybody else. They are taxed at twice the rate, Sir. In fact the ridiculous part is that although we are taxed at twice the rate, we have no status in law as taxpayers at all.

<p>Of course we do. We are taxed at source before the income-tax authorities have any idea whatsoever what one&#x2019;s husband&#x2019;s income is.

They are arbitrary, and I maintain, with respect to the hon. the Minister, that they are discriminatory as well. He may dislike my getting up and saying this. It is the second time I have said it, but I intend to say it every session until something is done.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the point of the matter is simply this. These P.A.Y.E. tables for working married women are drawn up before the Income-Tax Department knows whether your husband is a ganger on the railways or a millionaire; it makes no difference. And having taxed us at source&#x2014;and this happens in many cases in the world to-day&#x2014;if a married woman goes out to work because her husband is, for example, a pensioner, an invalid or retired, and the income she earns is greater than his, if there is any rebate on her earnings, it is paid to her husband and not to her.

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s reply was totally inadequate &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, my last point is simply this&#x2014;and maybe you will rule me out of order on this point. There are complaints from one end of the country to the other about the need for all of us to help the country&#x2019;s development by coming back into the labour market part-time or full-time. We hear this from almost every Government Department, from all over the place, as the Minister knows perfectly well. And yet a woman has to resign from the public service on marriage. She has to resign as a teacher on marriage, and so this ridiculous situation goes on. I suggested to the hon. the Minister in 1965 that he might do well to go and have a talk to the economic adviser to the late Prime Minister, Dr. Riekert, who I think will probably put him rather more effectively into the picture &#x2026;</p>

<p>I accept your ruling, Sir, but I do think, with respect, that I might be allowed to quote this one quotation on tax structure, which is strictly relevant to these proposals, namely the statement made by Dr. Riekert, who was economic adviser to the late Prime Minister. He was making a speech to the Institute of Professional Management in Pretoria in March, 1965, and this is what he said (Hansard Vol. 15, Col. 8167)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do suggest therefore &#x2026; that the tax structure (must) be reviewed in order to enable married women to retain a larger share of their earnings. As the present tax structure is &#x2026; prohibitive &#x2026; it is very likely that revenue losses to the State will be small, and probably more than offset by the resultant increase in the gross national product.</block>

<p>On that note I end, Sir, and I advise the hon. the Minister to have a chat with Dr. Riekert as soon as he can.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members on the Government side have come to the defence of the hon. the Minister and tried to suggest that the problem does not exist. The Minister has, however, conceded that this problem does exist and that there are difficulties in removing it. Let me give an illustration from the tax tables. A married person with an income of R5,000 per annum pays a tax of R408. If he moves to the next group, namely R6,000, his tax goes up from R408 to R608, plus 29 per cent of any amount in <span class="col_3695-3696" refersTo="page_0427"/>excess of R6,000. In the bracket immediately below that, the additional percentage is 20 per cent. Starting at the lowest rung, it is 7 per cent from R600 to R1,000, 8 per cent from R1.000 to R1,200, again 8 per cent from R1,200 to R2,400, 9 per cent on anything over R3,000, 10 per cent on anything over R4,600, 20 per cent in excess of R5,000, and 29 per cent on anything in excess of R6,000. That is a big jump. You can understand the position of a man such as a builder&#x2019;s foreman having an income of R5,000 per annum, and whose wife goes out to work and earns R1,000 per annum. Instead of paying R408 he now moves on to the next bracket, namely R608. So of his wife&#x2019;s additional R1,000 R200 goes in additional taxation. The jump from R5,000 to R6.000 is the big jump. It continues right through the brackets until between R8,000 and R9,000. The Minister has conceded that that bulge is there. He has said that he cannot remove the bulge because it would mean a surrender of too much revenue. But I suggest that it is time the hon. the Minister reviewed the whole matter. It is a legacy from the days of super-tax. But I suggest that as the Minister admits the bulge exists he should realize that a bulge is not healthy&#x2014;the Minister ought to know that&#x2014;and he should do what he can to remove the bulge.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinetown has chosen a very unfortunate example. He said that if a building foreman earned R5,000 and his wife R1,000. he would now have to pay R608 in tax instead of R408. Has the hon. member forgotten that the hon. the Minister of Finance made a concession last year to the married woman who is in employment&#x003F; In actual fact the tax of the two together is, in that case, not calculated on an income of R6,000, but only on R5,000 plus half of the wife&#x2019;s income. In such a case, therefore, the tax is calculated on R5,500. The example chosen by the hon. member for Pine-town was therefore a very unfortunate one, in that it was devoid of all truth.</p>

<p>Surely it was perfectly clear that she was all along discussing the principle of the taxation of married women. That is definitely not relevant here. Then, on top of that, her colleague the hon. member for Pinetown came along and chose a bad example to support her. I repeat that the man who has an income of R5,000 and whose wife earns R1,000 does not pay on R6,000, but only at the rate applicable to R5,500.</p>

<p>I should like to address myself to the hon. the Minister now. As he has told us that he wants to iron out this bulge, I want to ask that the progression from one category of &#x201C;taxable income&#x201D; to the next should at the same time be made uniform. According to the present table the first category starts at R600, the second at R1,000, the third at R1,200 with an increase of only R200, the fourth at R2,400 with an increase of R1.200, the fifth at R3,000 with an increase of only R600, the sixth also R600 higher, and the seventh, again, R400 higher. I want to ask very respectfully that the increases from one category to the next should be made uniform. In that case fewer anomalies will arise.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite accurate to say that there is a bulge. It is also academically correct to say that it ought to be removed. But I have had precious little assistance from hon. members on the opposite side as to how it is to be done. All that I have been told is that there are numerous permutations and commutations in which it can be brought about. However, the hon. member was not so lavish in his solutions. He did not venture to mention one single solution that he would suggest for this bulge. In fact there are not so many permutations and commutations which can be applied in a case like this. I want to say that there are only a few of them. The first is that I may decide to rob Peter to pay Paul. I may decide that I will reduce the bulge by increasing the taxation of the lower income group. However, I do not want to do that. I do not know whether the hon. members opposite want to do that; therefore that is out of the question. I can also decide to reduce the bulge by increasing the taxation of the upper income group. However, I do not want to kill initiative. [Interjections.] Will any hon. member propose this&#x003F; In certain respects our income tax in respect of the higher income groups is already the same and higher than in England. So what are we left with&#x003F; We have to find the money to flatten out the bulge. We can only find it by taxing something else.</p>

<p>Now what suggestions are the Opposition making as to what we should tax to make up for this amount&#x003F; I have already said that since I took over this portfolio, whenever it was possible to spare the necessary money to bring about the flattening, I have done so. The last occasion was in 1964 or 1965 and I did it at a cost of R2,000,000. Is this now the time when we are taxing to come with a reduction of taxation which could only be affected in practice, if we want to be realistic, by increasing other taxation in addition to what we have already done&#x003F; Hon. members will see that it is totally unrealistic, particularly at this time. I have said it time and again and I have acted up to it too. When I became Minister of Finance this bulge was much more prominent than it is to-day. I have done something to flatten it out. I will continue flattening it out, <span class="col_3697-3698" refersTo="page_0428"/>but I am not going to do it at the expense of the lower-income groups and I am not going to kill initiative in the higher-income groups, by making them pay for this. Therefore, I have sympathy with what the hon. members say; it is an eyesore. I have always said that my five-year plan for taxation provides that ultimately&#x2014;as soon as the opportunity arises &#x2014;we must try and flatten out the bulge. It is therefore not a question of the intent not being there; the fact is that the means are not there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington has brought up the question of the gold-mining taxation. This year it is in particular directed to the 5 per cent surcharge which the gold mines have to pay. This was the first increase in very many years. It has already been remarked that in preparing this Budget&#x2014;and I made it very plain in my Budget speech&#x2014; the idea as far as taxation was concerned was to spread the burden over as wide a field as possible so that no individual or single group will have to pay too much. That is one of the reasons why this time I have roped in, in a very modest way, the gold-mining industry. I will show the House how modest it is. As far as the gold-mining companies in the higher brackets are concerned, it means an extra 2.8 cents per rand. That is all that it means in the higher groups. It is not something that is going to break them and it is only on their profits. It is not part of their working costs; it is a tax on their profits. Hon. members should remember that if there is one sector of our economy which should be particularly interested in combating inflation, it is the gold-mining industry. All we are doing, and we have had no objections from them, is to ask them to make a modest contribution in the battle against inflation which is also to a large extent their battle.</p>

<p>Then there is the hon. member for Wynberg, who has made an appeal to me. I do not know whether it is <i>ad hominem,</i> or whether it is <i>ex femina,</i> but she has pleaded for the working married women. The late Senator Langenhoven once said, when somebody was very nasty to him, &#x201C;I do not know why this man is nasty to me, because after all, I&#x2019;ve never done him a favour.&#x201D; I broke new ground and I brought relief to the working married women. That was the first time it was done in this country, and all the thanks I get is what the hon. member for Wynberg has given me. That is why I spoke about potential liability and said that the potential liability of the hon. member for Wynberg was almost incalculable. We have done something towards solving this problem. It is a matter in regard to which time will show what more we can do, or whether the money would not be better spent on better projects for the relief of taxation. I am thinking here particularly of whether the money should not be spent on pensioners. It is a question of priority. But they have taken their place in the queue and they must await their turn.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened to the Minister with interest and it became obvious that his five-year plan would not be taken a stage further during the 1966-7 financial year, and there seems to be no effort to iron out the bulge, and it appears that the major burden will still be carried by the middle-income groups. There are certain aspects regarding the income-tax tables which I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister and on which I want to ask for further information. The first is the question of the application of these tables and the relationship with the schedules for the collection of this taxation. We believe that the administrative side for the collection of taxation has been to the mutual benefit of both the taxpayer and the discus. However, the administrative difficulty in applying these tables and these schedules in the collection of this taxation is an important matter. Therefore we would like to know about the adjustment of the schedules to ensure that at the end of the financial year the taxpayer will not be called upon to pay one large lump sum after receiving his assessment. In other words, the relationship between the provisions of these tables and the collection of the taxation in terms of the schedules by means of P.A.Y.E. is important. I want to mention this point and the effects of these provisions, because it appears that there is the administrative difficulty where a person who is receiving income from two sources, and P.A.Y.E. deductions are made separately from both those sources, that when the final assessment is made some of these people, due to the combination of these two sources of income, are placed in a higher bracket.</p>

<p>Sir, if you do not wish me to discuss the administrative effect of these tables and its adverse effect on these people, I should like to refer to another point. That is in connection with the taxable income shown in the schedules and to show that there are certain groups of persons who, due to the interpretation of the Minister, will move into the next bracket of taxable income. I want to refer to a particular case to illustrate this point. It is the case of a person receiving a pension of R1,013 per annum as a civil pension and is also receiving what was previously a war veteran&#x2019;s pension of R38 a month which was non-taxable. In terms of the ruling by the Department, it has now become taxable, and it means that that R38 a month or R456 per annum&#x2014;it means that that person, instead of <span class="col_3699-3700" refersTo="page_0429"/>falling under the rate applicable to the people earning R1,000 to R1,200, who in terms of the table have to pay R64 plus 8 per cent, will now move into the next bracket of R1,200 to R2,400 due to the fact that this additional amount of R456 is now taken into account and tax has to be paid on it. I hope the Minister will give some indication as to how these people can be assisted who in the past received that amount of money on a non-taxable basis but who now are being called upon to pay a considerable amount of extra taxation because that R456 now becomes taxable and brings them into a higher rate of taxation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister explained in his speech that the object of this increase from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in respect of the export of diamonds was to afford the domestic diamond cutting works an opportunity of making some progress. But until one makes it at least 50 per cent it cannot be effective and it cannot achieve that object, because for that purpose 15 per cent means nothing. Let me explain what I mean. If you export a rough diamond, an uncut diamond, and you yourself buy it on the other side, as happens on a large scale, the seller will in the first place try to keep the price of the diamond as low as possible because he himself will be buying it on the other side. In the second place he will try to keep the price of the diamond as low as possible because then he will pay less tax. The figures indicate that in 1964 uncut diamonds to the value of R74,000,000 and cut diamonds to the value of R20,900,000 were exported.</p>

<p>It is generally known&#x2014;one need not be an expert to know it&#x2014;that an uncut diamond to the value of, say, R1,000 is worth R3,000 after it has been cut. In other words, it is worth three times as much. I therefore feel that the Treasury is being cheated very badly here; I think that the Treasury loses at least R168,000,000 per year as a result of this ineffective tax. Accordingly I want to suggest that the question of the taxation on the export of uncut diamonds should be reviewed with a <span class="col_3701-3702" refersTo="page_0430"/>view to introducing a more effective tax so that one may in the first place assist the domestic diamond cutting industry and in the second place prevent the man who exports the diamond at the lowest price that he possibly can&#x2014;and he may be the largest producer&#x2014; from buying it at the lowest price overseas and then reaping all the benefits, and robbing the Treasury in that way. Mr. Chairman, this is not something new; it is something which has been going on for years. I raised this very matter here in 1937, when it was still in its initial stages. Instead of the interests of the Treasury being better protected as far as this source of revenue is concerned, the position is deteriorating from year to year. In my mind a tremendous future awaits our diamond cutting industry, but as long as this state of affairs prevails this tax will, in my opinion, not be effective, and therefore I want to make representations for this tax to be reviewed as soon as possible for the reasons I have just mentioned here.</p>

If he wants me to increase it still further, then I just want to tell him that I have never yet had a request from anybody for taxation to be increased even more. To a large extent this tax is one for which I am responsible, and its object is this: Just as one protects one&#x2019;s industries by means of customs tariffs, so this was an attempt to protect our domestic cutting industry. Our domestic cutting industry had a 10 per cent protection and it has now been increased to 15 per cent. But this tax, like all other forms of taxation, is not necessarily the final one. We may perhaps decrease it or we may perhaps increase it, but I can give the hon. member the assurance that we shall give attention to all these problems from time to time.</p>

</ol>

<p>The Customs and Excise taxation proposals embody a variety of items. The notice of taxation proposals tabled on the 17th August contained proposals in respect of increased and new duties on the so-called conventional necessities and on non-essential or luxury imported goods. The majority of these goods are obtained locally in adequate supply and satisfactory standard. The increased duties which are imposed for fiscal reasons and for the purpose of curbing the inflationary tendency are spread over a wide field so as not to place too heavy a burden on any particular section of the buying public.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry to say that I cannot agree in the slightest with the effects which the hon. the Minister suggests will flow from these duties. He maintains that they apply to conventional necessities and luxury imported goods and that they are spread over a wide field. I submit that in point of fact the Minister has selected as his victims two particular fields of our society. He has selected the young family man setting up a home and the working man as his victims for the carrying of this burden of additional taxation. No one objects to the principle, which has been accepted throughout the ages, of using customs and excise duties to raise revenue; that is accepted. I do not intend to deal with the first group at this stage, although I hope that I will be able to come back to it later, and that is the increased duties on the basic essentials of the young family man. Even the duties on the components which make up these basic essentials in the setting up of a home are being increased. What about the policy of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration who has pleaded for more babies&#x003F; Here we find that the duties are being increased on perambulators, toys, refrigerators and all the labour-saving devices, all the things which are needed to reduce labour and to enable the housewife to do her job so that she can have a family. Sir, I want to deal rather with the burden which is being placed on the poor man and on his pleasures. In particular I want to deal with what is accepted throughout the civilized world as the basic pleasure of the poor man and that is his beer. I want to say here categorically that the Minister is flying in the face of the declared policy of his Government and of the new Prime Minister. He is proposing taxation here which is designed and deliberately designed to upset a pattern for which his own Prime Minister pleaded so earnestly and so seriously in this House a year or two ago.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to item 104 (10). I am objecting to two things in regard to this item; one is the excessive increase in excise on beer&#x2014;I am not going to argue about the customs duty&#x2014;and the second, perhaps the more dangerous one from the long-term point of view of industry generally, is the discriminatory and punitive nature of this particular excise duty. Never in the history of South Africa have we had a Minister of Finance who has selected a single firm for punitive taxation. Here we have an item upon which a discriminatory and punitive tax, based on the volume of production, is being imposed, and the result of this is that one individual company in the whole of South Africa is being made to pay a tax which no other like firm producing a like product is required to pay.</p>

<p>I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that he owes industry in South Africa a clear and unequivocal statement to-day. He must either <span class="col_3729-3730" refersTo="page_0444"/>say, Mr. Chairman, that this discriminatory tax, based on volume of production, is a policy which he intends to apply to other items of taxation, such as, say, cigarettes, or that it is not a general policy but an isolated individual case where he is imposing a discriminatory tax in an isolated individual instance. If it is the first, then he must tell us whether he intends in fact to apply it to cigarettes, and whether a company like Rembrandt or U.T.C. is going to be selected and taxed differently from other tobacco companies. If it is the second, i.e. that this is an isolated case, then he must tell us what court of justice has sat over an individual company and selected it to be punished by the Minister of Finance with a punishment imposed on no other person who has perpetrated the crime of making beer.</p>

<p>I am not going to advertise any brand. That is a matter of opinion. But it is a fact that it is the most popular and that indicates what is thought of the beer. The Minister is now punishing firstly the beer drinker and secondly an individual company, and in order to record our complete disagreement with this policy of discrimination, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In paragraph (2), to omit tariff item 104.10.20 of the proposed rate of duty and to substitute the following item:</block>

<block name="quote">.20 Of a specific gravity 74c 59c before fermentation per gal. per gal. exceeding 1040&#x00B0; but not exceeding 1050&#x00B0;</block>

<p>I move this in order to pinpoint our opposition to the discrimination in the first instance. The fact that I have accepted as the figure the proposed excise and customs duty on the minimum produced quantity which the Minister has laid down does not indicate that we accept that taxation. I believe that that duty in itself is too high, and if time permits I shall show why. But in order not to cloud the issue between the general increase and this fundamental question of punitive taxation, I move this particular amendment to highlight the punitive aspect of these proposed provisions so that we can get down to the details of that one particular item.</p>

<p>But over and above the punitive aspects against one company look what it means to our industry. Let me put it to the Minister: What firm is now going to aim for efficiency and bulk production in the face of this sort of taxation&#x003F; The whole object of this tax system is to say to the manufacturer: Produce small, because as soon as you get big I am going to punish you. I have taken the trouble to check certain figures and the company which is going to be affected by this has only increased its price at source of beer over the last 40 years by 16 per cent. Now what company, what manufacturer of what single item in South Africa, can claim to have only raised the price at source by 16 per cent over the last 40 years&#x003F; And the reason that it was possible was that this particular industry went in for mechanization, went in for modern methods, went in for bulk production, and by efficiency and streamlining was able to maintain the price of the poor man&#x2019;s champagne, the poor man&#x2019;s drink, at a level which he could afford, and it did it by bulk production and by efficient production. But this sort of tax forces any industrialist now to fear bulk production and efficiency. If he is going to face the prospect of a punitive tax if he brings his production above a certain level, then it is far better for him to be inefficient and to produce a lower volume to avoid that punitive taxation.

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) really tried to drag in the young family man by the head and shoulders here this afternoon. I do not think the hon. member could have been very serious. The hon. member mentioned the average increase of 10 per cent in the duty on imported goods, and those goods include only two items which he was able to use in support of his argument, namely, in the first place, dolls, and, in the second place, perambulators. The hon. member must really have had a very poor case if he had to drag in the young married man with a family in order to throw suspicion on this measure by mentioning dolls and perambulators, which he may just as well buy in South Africa.</p>

<p>I should be glad if the hon. member would come back to that, so that he can give us the entire long list of commodities in respect of which the young family man is affected to such an extent that his standard of living will suffer. On the contrary, as far as this increase in the import duties on foreign goods is concerned, I want to express the hope that South African industry will derive the fullest benefit from it.</p>

<p>I now come to the second point raised by the hon. member, namely the matter of beer, and I feel that we must discuss this matter of beer this afternoon, because I think the Opposition have helped, and have also helped the Press, to give the country a completely distorted impression of what was being proposed here and of what the Minister was doing. Sources of additional taxation were sought. Very well. An attempt was made to spread the taxation as much as possible. Very well. The duty on spirits has been increased. That will mean an increase of 1c per tot over the bar-counter.

It was said here again this afternoon. The hon. member&#x2019;s words were, &#x201C;One single firm has been selected&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, not one single firm has been selected.

<p>Hon. members may laugh, but this is a tax on breweries and not a tax on companies. Surely we agree about that as well. We are still coming to the effect, but surely we agree as far as this is concerned&#x003F; The tax must be 23c, because hon. members over there said so themselves. We agree that it is a tax on breweries. But the country has been given to understand that it is aimed at one company specifically.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it has been stated here this afternoon, and it has also been stated very emphatically in the country, that this is a penalty that has been imposed on &#x201C;efficiency and bulk production&#x201D;. It has been suggested that it is a tax on efficiency. Mr. Chairman, since when is volume of production synonymous with efficiency&#x003F; I want to say to you, Sir, that a small undertaking can be as efficient as a large one. One cannot deny that. The economists are sitting over there. A small undertaking can be as efficient within its framework as a large one within its framework. But now I want to take the hon. members further. If the small undertaking and the large undertaking are equally efficient, then the position as far as the large undertaking is concerned is that, as a result of the fact that it produces an enormous quantity, its unit costs are lower than those of the small undertaking. We are still in agreement up to that point. And now we come to the rising scale&#x2014;not the sliding scale, but the rising scale. Sir, if a large undertaking which produces 12,500,000 gallons, that is to say, five times as much as the one on the bottom scale which produces 2,500,000, is not so efficient that it can bear the extra 6 cents on account of the reduction of its unit costs, then it is not efficient. [Laughter.] The hon. the Minister calculated that that would mean an increase of 1.91 cents on a pint of beer. In other words, there would still be a margin of .1 cent on 2 cents, because the intention was that the price of beer could be increased by 2 cents per pint. Sir, all the breweries producing up to 5.000,000 gallons (if one looks at the table) could have managed on an increase of 2 cents. The smallest ones would have made an extra profit, and the others could have managed on an increase of 2 cents a pint, and from there upwards, with the increased turnover and the same efficiency, they could have taken it from their profits as requested by the Minister in his Budget speech. But what did they do then&#x003F; This is the third point in regard to which they have brought the country under a completely false impression, and the Opposition is aiding and abetting them. Sir, if one takes the maximum excise duty, what is the position&#x003F; I am told that there are 12 beer pints to a gallon. That is to say, there is an increase of 6 cents. If that is imposed throughout on everything, it means a half cent on a pint. And if one adds the half cent on a pint to 1.91 cents, one arrives at 2.41 cents, and if the price of beer had been increased by 24&#x00BD; cents a pint in South Africa, these people, whoever they may be&#x2014;both large and small undertakings&#x2014;would have recovered the extra amount in excise duty from the man drinking the beer, this &#x201C;working man&#x201D; about whom the hon. member feels so concerned. But what do they do now&#x003F; They go along and they increase the price of a pint of beer in South Africa by 3 cents, and they say, &#x201C;The Government is to blame for it.&#x201D; I say that is a disgrace, and I say that the Press of South Africa should tell the working man that it is not this Government that is to blame for that, and that the Opposition should stop bringing the working man under the impression that this Government is to blame for the fact that he now has to pay 3 cents more for a pint of beer.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am extremely sorry for the hon. member for Queenstown. I have always enjoyed listening to his speeches in this House, but when he has a hopeless cause I am afraid it makes him talk nonsense, because what he said this afternoon was nonsense. He said this was a tax on breweries. Well, it is not a tax on breweries. A tax means something out of profits. This is a penalty on breweries, or a brewery. In terms of the legislation we have before us it only applies to breweries, but it establishes a precedent from which it can flow from breweries to all sorts of other activities. The hon. member then says that size of production is no criterion of efficiency. I agree with him. Very often it is not. But the hon. member will also agree, I am sure, that you do not penalize efficiency through size, which is what this is doing. You may have a small company that is efficient. That is fine. But <span class="col_3733-3734" refersTo="page_0446"/>because it grows through efficiency, are you going to penalize that company&#x003F; Because that is what the hon. members are asking us to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I had hoped that before this debate commenced, the hon. the Minister would intervene and tell us that he had decided to scrap this particular proposal in regard to beer. Because no proposal for as long as I can remember has had so much criticism as this proposal of the hon. the Minister. Every businessman, every columnist, every organization, every newspaper has condemned this proposal from beginning to end. I only want to quote one, Mr. Chairman, and that is the opinion of a financial paper which is well known as a supporter of the Government, the <i>Financial Gazette.</i> It is probably the first time in months that it has criticized the Government. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The chairman of S.A. Breweries made a justified attack on the way in which the Budget increase in beer duties was graded, so that the larger breweries pay additional duties.</block>

<block name="quote">Brewing is an industry in which size is related directly to efficiency&#x2014;the bigger the brewery, the lower the post. The new tax must militate against efficiency.</block>

<block name="quote">If the Government is concerned with the structure of the industry, in the way it is dominated by one group, it should take other corrective measures. It is not the function of an excise duty to attack a monopolistic position.</block>

<block name="quote">In our view the tax proposed is wrong in principle and worse in practice.</block>

<block name="quote">We hope that in the approaching detailed consideration of the Budget measures, Dr. D&#x00F6;nges will see the force of these arguments and amend his proposals.</block>

<p>What is the Minister trying to do&#x003F; What is the purpose behind it&#x003F; He has asked us in this House now to vote for or against these measures, and before we do so, I want the hon. the Minister to tell us what is the purpose of this particular proposal. Is it as the hon. member for Queenstown says merely a method of getting additional income&#x003F; Is it a method of trying to stop a monopoly&#x003F; What is the hon. the Minister trying to do&#x003F; We asked him during the Budget debate, but he did not reply to us. We told him in the Budget debate that he was denying an organization the benefits of efficiency and productivity and putting a premium on inefficiency and stagnation. We told him that what he was trying to do was intolerable in a free country with free private enterprise. What is the hon. the Minister trying to achieve&#x003F; I hope he will tell us so that we will know how to deal with this matter. Because, Mr. Chairman, growth in our economy is to a large extent dependent on rationalization through growth, through mergers, or through acquisitions, and if the hon. the Minister is going to persist with this measure he is going to do dreadful harm to the future economy of this country, because no industrialist, no investor, will dare in future to try and build a strong, efficient structure because he will have over his head the precedent that the hon. the Minister is setting to-day by the introduction of this penalty on large-scale beer production. He is denying everything we are trying to do in this country as a result of this type of legislation. He is going to discourage investment, he is spreading apprehension amongst business people and he is removing from business the essential that we require in this country and that is incentive to produce more economically and in greater quantities. I have said in this House before, and I say it again, it is time the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economic Affairs got together to decide what they want this country to do, because each time one gets up he contradicts the other. Now it is the Minister of Finance contradicting the Minister of Economic Affairs. Last month it was just vice versa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown talked about the attitude of this party since the Budget debate as being a scandal. But if there ever was a scandal in regard to taxation in this country then it is this discrimination between beer and beer. And what is more, there is a double discrimination here because it is not only a discrimination between beer and beer but also between beer and wine. That does not come very well from a Minister of Finance coming from the Western Province. That is what is happening. We have over the years been asked in this House to encourage consumption of light liquor, beer and wine, and not to drink spirits. We heard the Minister of Justice telling us that but now we get this excessive taxation on beer. And what is the taxation on wine which is much more potent and contains far more alcohol than beer&#x003F; Beer contains only 4.3 per cent alcohol whereas an ordinary natural wine contains alcohol to the extent of from 10 to 12 per cent. We do not want young people to drink wine if they can drink beer. I think it is scandalous that we should have this discrimination. This is what has happened over the last ten years: Taxation on beer per bottle has gone up from 5.2c to 13.3c, i.e. by 8c, while the taxation on a bottle of wine has gone up from nothing ten years ago to 1c to-day. I think it is scandalous. Talking about scandals, as the hon. member for Queenstown did, this is a scandal. But what is even more serious to-day is this discrimination between one company and another&#x2014;because this comes down to taxation of one company, having several breweries. I can praise the hon. member for Queenstown for trying to be loyal to the <span class="col_3735-3736" refersTo="page_0447"/>Minister of Finance now that he is in a jam, because the whole country realizes this is an injustice. Are we now going to say to a company, a company which has built up its industry, that it is now going to be taxed differently per bottle of beer than the other company&#x003F; He has to compete in the market and he has to sell his bottle of beer against the bottle of beer from the other brewery. He cannot pass on this taxation. If we tax cigarettes or liquor we know that the vendor will pass that taxation on to the consumer. But this particular company cannot pass it on. They cannot do it because they have to compete in the market with the other man. We know that the S.A. Breweries has been taxed differently from the other breweries. I may say that there probably are many hon. members here who have an interest in S.A.Breweries. The ordinary investor in South Africa has an interest in S.A. Breweries. It is a blue chip. Any man who has an interest in a pension fund has an interest in S.A.Breweries. Practically every pension fund and every trust investment has a parcel of S.A. Breweries shares. They take it as a blue chip; they take it as sound as a Government investment. The whole country is now being told that if you invest in that company you are going to be taxed differently. I certainly hope that even at this late hour the hon. the Minister of Finance will realize that this is an injustice. It is a rank injustice to one company and people are asking whether this is going to be extended. Is this going to be extended now to cigarette companies as well&#x003F; Are we now also going to say to large cigarette companies that they are going to be taxed differently from the small company&#x003F; Are we going to do that&#x003F; Are we going to extend it to other producers&#x003F; If a man produces more than his competitor should he be subjected to a higher scale of taxation&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, I think this is a rank injustice and I hope the hon. the Minister is going to put it right.</p>

<p>There is so much misunderstanding and there are so many misrepresentations in regard to this particular duty that it is about time that I tried to point out to people who get so hot under the collar that it is not the idea here at all to impose a penalty on some company or other. That is not the intention at all. When I began with the duty on beer, I had the position in the two main beer-drinking countries investigated. I went to investigate the position in Germany and in Austria as far as duty was concerned. Let me tell hon. members what I found. In Germany they make four different kinds of beer of varying strengths. The basic duties differ, but thereafter they follow the same pattern. Up to a certain production of one of these kinds of beer for instance a basic duty is paid&#x2014;in this case 6 D.M. per hectolitre. As the production increases, the duty increases to a maximum of 7.5 D.M. per hectolitre. In other words, there is a difference of 25 per cent between the producer who comes in at the bottom of the sliding scale and the one who is above the maximum. In this country the difference is only 8&#x00BE; per cent, as compared with 25 per cent in Germany. In Austria the same principle applies, although it is applied in a different way. There they have a fixed duty, while the smallest producer gets a rebate of 40 per cent as compared with the large producer. I am introducing only 81 per cent here. Now I have to hear what a criminal I am, that it is a scandal, and so forth. Hon. members do not have the faintest idea what they are talking about. What is so strange about my accepting and applying this principle in South Africa as well, and what is more, in such a lenient way&#x003F; But even in this country this is not an entirely unknown principle. I want to remind the hon. member for Kensington of the fact that the tax paid by the smaller gold mines is quite different from the one paid by the large ones. The formula is different, not the total tax. If a gold mine has an income of R40,000, the formula is <i>y &#x003D;</i>20 &#x00D7; 1&#x2014;6/<i>X</i> if it is R50,000, the formula is y &#x003D; 24; and if it is R140,000, the formula is y &#x003D; 60. To have a sliding scale on the basis of size is therefore not an unknown principle. Now, hon. members will be right in saying that the one is on taxable income and the other on production. But do hon. members realize that if I had made this scale applicable to taxable income, it would have been much more disadvantageous to any large company than it is in the case of the basis which I have adopted here now&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let us consider the other aspect now. Hon. members allege that this is aimed against S.A. Breweries. According to my information this company in 1965 had seven factories, seven breweries which fell under it. This company to-day produces 90 per cent of the total quantity of beer produced in the country. But that is not my fault.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>It is their efficiency.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Two of these factories are at the lowest point on this scale, namely on the 74 cent scale, and four are on the 75 cent scale, while only one is on the 80 cent scale. Mention has been made of efficiency. It is true that you can produce at a lower-price the larger your production is, but if you produce a commodity such as beer and you want to distribute it throughout South Africa, you cannot have one central factory for the purpose. Then you must do what has been done by S.A. Breweries, that is to say, you must have a distribution of factories. And they receive the benefit of that. Then they receive the benefit of the duty. If one effects all the economies one can by means of efficiency at a large central brewery such as at Isando and one has to pay the transportation costs to Cape Town, one will not have a great deal left on one&#x2019;s proportionally greater profits as compared with a smaller brewery. That is why these people decided to have several breweries. That is why they have breweries in Pietermaritzburg, in Port Elizabeth, <span class="col_3737-3738" refersTo="page_0448"/>in Durban, in Cape Town, and in Braamfontein, and then there is the large one at Isando. All that we have done here is to say that this is a basis that we can apply here. It is simply because of the size of that company that one of its seven breweries falls in the maximum scale. If any other company passes the 2,500,000-gallon mark, it will also go to the second rung of the scale, and so forth. If you control 90 per cent of the production, it is inevitable that you will be liable to more tax than is the case with a smaller company.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member will also get an opportunity to speak. Any other company will be in precisely the same position if it has the same production. This is not a case of one particular company being selected to be penalized in a particular way. It is not a question of our trying to combat a monopoly in this way. There are other ways of doing that. Another large company is coming into being, but it will also be liable to this duty if its production merits it. It will not be able to avoid it. What we actually want to do, and that is also what is being done in Germany and Austria, is to give the smaller breweries some encouragement so that they may continue. That is the explanation of what has been presented here as being a sinister plot against one particular company.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has brought forward an argument which, I am sure, he knows is fallacious. Surely he is aware that what is behind the Germans&#x2019; system is not a discriminatory taxation system but a protection of the traditional small town brewer. There you have hundreds upon hundreds of these small brewers&#x2014;traditional family occupations which have gone on for generation after generation. Have we such a situation in South Africa&#x003F; The Minister cannot pretend that we have that sort of situation here. The two systems are completely different and the circumstances are different. Firstly, you do not have one standard price, one standard selling price. There a brewer if his costs are more can charge more. Here in South Africa we have a standard selling price. The Minister knows as well as anybody else that the object of an excise duty is twofold: To raise revenue and also to influence the habits of those people using that particular item. Here the hon. the Minister is attacking a product and the maker of that product and secondly the habit, whilst trying to hide behind the fallacious argument that it is done in Germany and in Austria. But is it done in America&#x003F; Is it done in Great Britain&#x003F; Is it being done in any other country&#x003F; It is only being done in the two countries where you have the traditional family brewer, where you have the small town brewer and where you also have your large regional industrial firms. But in every other country of the world each firm is treated on its merits.</p>

<p>The Minister has avoided replying to the simple question which we put to him. We asked him whether this was an isolated instance affecting beer only or did he intend applying it also to other products&#x003F; I challenge the hon. the Minister to answer this question with a direct reply. Is this an isolated instance, is it only one tax of its kind or does the Minister intend applying this principle of taxation to other industries&#x003F; I hope the hon. the Minister will give us a clear answer to this specific and unequivocal question so that industrialists shall know. There is a great difference between protecting an existing industry and trying to encourage an industry. What encouragement does the hon. the Minister imagine this tax is going to be for the new Whitbread Brewery which is now going to look at the position and say that they must make sure that they do not produce more than 2,500,000 gallons&#x003F; The moment they get to that peak of efficiency in one factory they are going to be punished. Therefore they will have to scatter their efforts. But the hon. the Deputy Minister for Bantu Development is shouting for mechanization and improvement of efficiency in order to avoid having to use large labour units. Surely, the bigger your industry is, the more you can mechanize and the more you can do away with labour&#x003F;</p>

<p>Here then is another aspect which is in direct conflict with Government policy. Encouragement of bulk beer production with the resultant efficiency caused by automation and mechanization is being condemned by the hon. the Ministe". He wants to say to the breweries: Go back to the ox-wagon days; go and get a lot of Bantu labour; do not think in terms of mechanization; mill the hops with your feet, otherwise you might produce too much; wash the bottles with a brush; do not get a machine. No, let us not have this sort of nonsense. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s discriminatory tax is not going to encourage a single brewer to come out here. And it is certainly not going to create the sort of position you have in Germany or Austria.</p>

<p>But the other aspect is an even more serious one. And that is what this is going to do to the drinking pattern of South Africa, a drinking pattern which this House debated at length when the hon. the Prime Minister and the vast majority of Government members accented that South Africa should change its pattern of drinking from hard tack to soft tack, namely to lower-alcohol-content drinks. The hon. the Minister has accepted the principle in this very tax. He has three grades according to the strength of malt liquor. The stronger it is, the higher the tax. He accepts that principle. But when it comes to the real issue of low-alcohol-content beer versus high-alcohol-content spirits, then he abandons the principle.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is on the strength. It is on the specific gravity, a specific gravity variation. It is tied up with the strength. The principle is also accepted with natural and fortified wines. There is a higher taxation on the fortified wines with a higher alcohol content than on the natural wines. And what does it boil down to if you work it out in drinks as opposed to gallons&#x003F; In the case of beer you drink a reputed pint whereas in the case of spirits you have a tot&#x2014;20 to the bottle. Working it on 12 beers&#x2014;reputed pints&#x2014;per gallon and 20 tots per bottle of spirits, six bottles per gallon, that is 120 tots per gallon, you find then that beer has been taxed as follows:1956, 2.6 cents, 1958, 3.3 cents, 1962, 4.3 cents and now 6.7 cents, whereas spirits are taxed to-day at 5 cents per drink. In other words beer is actually taxed higher than spirits per drink. Already the trend is immediately turning back from beer drinking to hard liquor.</p>

<p>I have here the report of the Department of Justice for 1965. It devotes pages and pages to the progress made in regard to Bantu liquor consumption in South Africa. It points out how beer drinking has increased during the first half of 1965&#x2014;the last statistics&#x2014;over 1964, namely by 134 per cent. In other words the pattern desired by the Government is coming about. Drinking is switching from hard tack to the lower-alcohol-content drinks&#x2014; namely beer and natural wines. Now the Minister by this punitive tax on beer is going to force the whole trend back again. Spirit consumption amongst the Bantu increased by 29 per cent. What is this going to do to it&#x003F; And I am not now dealing with Bantu beer&#x2014;the traditional Kaffir beer. That is another matter we will deal with. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this tirade by the hon. Opposition is going rather too far now. Before I deal with the hon. member for Durban, I should like to refer to a most execrable statement made here by my good friend, the hon. member for Kensington. I have great regard for the hon. member for Kensington, but to lay it at the door of the hon. the Minister of Finance that he is discriminating in favour of wine because he is a Minister with a constituency in the Western Province, is going just too far. [Interjections.] Surely the hon. the Minister of Finance stated explicitly that he expected R10.500.000 from his increased excise duty on beer over a full year, but that at the same time he was taxing the product of his constituency to an amount of R10,000.000 per year. And then the hon. member for Kensington alleges that he is discriminating against beer because he represents a Western Province constituency.</p>

<p>But surely it is a product of the Western Province, of the constituency of the hon. the Minister. And I want to emphasize that very strongly. It is an insinuation against the hon. the Minister of Finance that his high integrity certainly does not warrant. Another thing bothering me this afternoon in the arguments of the hon. Opposition is that they launched a campaign against the big man, the rich man, under the previous Vote debated here. It was said repeatedly that this Government was a rich man&#x2019;s Government. The hon. member for Umlazi said:&#x201C;This hon.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Paarl. who has just sat down, claims that we had been pleading for the small man, the ordinary man, and here we are, he says, talking about the big man who is made to pay a little more on big beer production. I would point out to the hon. member for Paarl that the increase in excise duties on beer amounted to some 50 per cent, which is substantially higher than increases imposed on other alcoholic drinks. Surely the hon. member for Paarl will concede that beer and not spirits is the normal drink of the ordinary man. And it should remain so. In fact, under this Budget the taxation is putting up the price to such an extent that it is in some instances more expensive than certain other alcoholic drinks.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to this taxation on production. The hon. member for Paarl suggested that the big breweries just have to pay a little more. He is quite wrong in suggesting that it is just a little more. The amount involved in duty based on production will <span class="col_3741-3742" refersTo="page_0450"/>come to R1,500,000 a year from the S.A. Breweries alone, that one company alone. There is another aspect of this which is of course far more important, and that is the principle of the whole thing. It is on the basis of the principle that we are very concerned, because it affects industrialists generally. It is generally accepted that taxation should be based on valid economic principles, but up to now the hon. the Minister of Finance has failed to tell this House what the underlying principle of this form of taxation is. In trying to justify it, all he has said is that it is applied in two countries, West Germany and Austria. That is the only way in which he has tried to justify it, but that is no justification at all. He must tell the House and the country what the underlying principle of this form of taxation is. He must also tell the House and the country whether the Government is now accepting as a principle of taxation &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, perhaps the Minister will allow me to address you on this point. He refused to allow me to put a question to him a moment ago, but perhaps he will let me talk now that I am on my feet. [Interjection.] The matter becomes one of considerable importance because in the speech of the hon. member for Queenstown he said that if a business with higher production cannot bear higher taxation, then it is not efficient. That is what the hon. member said, and he now shakes his head. This is the acceptance of the principle that the Government will tax higher production in order to obtain its taxes, and this is something which industrialists want to know unequivocally. It is something which affects them very seriously, and up to now we have not had an unequivocal statement in this regard from the Minister. We have now had the statement from the hon. member for Queenstown, who holds an important position on the Government side as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and one must therefore take very seriously what he says in this regard. If this is in fact the Government&#x2019;s policy, the Minister should say so. If not, he should say that the hon. member for Queenstown is incorrect, because this goes very deep. We in this country are anxious to encourage outside capital to invest here. We have not got to the stage yet where we do not want this capital; we still encourage it and outside investors also will be perturbed if it is accepted as a principle that when their production gets to a certain stage they make themselves liable for an added tax. It has been pointed out by certain members on this side of the House, and particularly by the hon. member for Point, that this goes against Government policy as elaborated by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, because it undoubtedly affects the promotion of labour-intensive operations.</p>

<p>Then I will not elaborate on it, but will go on to another point. In view of what has been said by the Minister and by the hon. member for Queenstown, it now appears to us that this tax on production is regarded as a method of getting further revenue, which is to say, as a new form of taxation. What effect has this had on the particular brewery which is affected&#x003F; The only one affected at this stage is the S.A. Breweries. It has resulted in a drop in the shares of that company from 800 cents to 700 cents, which is a capital loss to a South African-based company, and that is the alarming part of it. There was a capital loss of some R10,000,000 on the 11,000,000 shares in the hands of shareholders, and 70 per cent of the equity capital and 100 per cent of the loan capital in this company are held by South Africans.

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>I will not keep the Committee long, but I have to refer to two matters. The first relates to what was said by the hon. member for Kensington. I used the word &#x201C;disgrace&#x201D; but what did I say&#x003F; I said that if all the beer produced in South Africa were produced at the very highest scale, with the premium of 6 cents a gallon, then the breweries or the beer companies of South Africa could sell the beer to the consumers at 2.41 cents a pint. But they have gone and increased the price throughout South Africa by 3 cents a pint, and then they claim that the Government is to blame for the fact that the price has increased by 3 cents. I said it was disgraceful that they should blame the Government for that. And then I said that the Opposition should guard against confirming that impression in the country. Those were my words and I repeat them. What the hon. member for Durban (Musgrave) has now said, was to attach a significance to my words that I really do not deserve, and that I did not intend either. I shall tell you what I said. The Minister has a Budget which he has to finance in a non-inflationary way, and he considered where he could get the money and how he could distribute the burden most evenly over the population, and he decided that beer should make its contribution.</p>

<p><span class="col_3743-3744" refersTo="page_0451"/>He then said that of the nine breweries in South Africa there were eight who could bear this basic increase of 23 cents, and who could then raise the price of their beer by 2 cents a pint. That was the Minister&#x2019;s sole intention. Now there is one brewery that handles this enormous volume, and because it handles such a large volume its unit cost should be so low&#x2014; if its efficiency is on a par with that of the smaller breweries, and I presume it is&#x2014;that it should be able to absorb from its profits this additional levy imposed for fiscal purposes, and not for economic purposes. That was all I said, and that it can do that, is borne out by the fact that the hon. member for Kensington told us what a &#x201C;blue chip&#x201D; it actually was. But it is going to become even bluer, because it is now going to take more than a half-cent a pint from the public which it does not deserve and which it does not hand over to the Government. I still maintain that this fiscal measure is correct, and that this rising scale is quite correct from a fiscal point of view.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>My reference to the hon. the Minister of Finance and to the Western Province was this: He knows that in this appeal which was made that we should encourage people to drink light liquor, the tax on wine in the Western Province was reduced during his r&#x00E9;gime from 2&#x00BD; cents to 1 cent. We all supported that. That was the appeal which was made to us. I want to make it perfectly clear that there was no unfavourable personal suggestion which concerned the hon. the Minister. If the Minister feels it does I want to say right away that that never occurred to me. But he is familiar with the wine industry in the Western Province. I should like to ask the Minister of Finance and the hon. member for Paarl whether they would be in favour of taxing the K.W.V. at a different rate from the small producer of wine, because that is the same thing. Should the small producer of wine have to pay a lower tax on wine or brandy per bottle because one producer is bigger than another&#x003F; That is all I wanted to say on this.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another item. I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In paragraph (2) to omit tariff items 105.05 and 105.10.</block>

<p>That is the item dealing with the tax on petrol, the 1-cent tax. The Minister, in introducing this tax, justified it in this way. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is also fair, when the railway-user has to pay a higher tariff, that the road-user should also make a slightly higher contribution to the State. I propose an increase of 1 cent per gallon in the present customs and excise duties on petrol and on diesel oil used in road vehicles.</block>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s justification for imposing this tax was that the Minister of Transport had raised not only passenger fares but freight as well, with the result that the man living in the interior had to pay a cent more for petrol because of the increased rail tariff. Then the Minister of Finance came along and used that increase to justify another increase. That is what I felt was unfair, and therefore I wish to move this amendment.</p>

<p>There is one point which has arisen from the speech of the hon. member for Queenstown which I think must be dealt with very clearly. The hon. member said that the increase in the tax was in fact only 1 cent a bottle. Is that correct&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is right; it is almost 2 cents. But of course he is taking it on the minimum quantity. The duty was 51 cents and it is now 80 cents in the maximum bracket per gallon, which is certainly more than 1.9, because 1.9 cents is the lowest. But what the hon. member did not tell the House is that the price of beer from the breweries is 5.41 cents per reputed pint bottle. This Minister takes 6.67 cents duty on a bottle of beer. In other words, more than 100 per cent on the basic cost of a beer is added by the Minister. The brewery charges 5.41 cents, and the Minister takes 6.67 cents on a bottle. That means that out of every bottle of beer that every South African drinks, the Minister takes 35 per cent. Over one-third of every 19 cents that every South African pays for his beer goes to the Minister in tax. Surely that is an unwarranted burden on a group which can least afford to buy the other luxury drinks. I do not think any Government member will argue with me when I say that beer is the working man&#x2019;s drink. This is the working man&#x2019;s drink which he enjoys when he comes home to relax.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Any one of us who has young sons would surely prefer to see them having a glass of beer than a couple of brandies. This criminal taxation on the lowest alcoholic-content drink is going to drive them to take the drink which gives them more kick per cent which they pay. That is the ultimate thing. It will force them away from beer, and I have seen it with the young people already. Youngsters who used to take a beer now take a Vodka or something else. That is happening; it is not driving them to wine; it is driving them to spirits. This hon. member says we are trying to tell the people that it is the Government&#x2019;s fault but that it is not the Government&#x2019;s fault that beer has gone up so much. He says it is the grabbing breweries and those who sell the stuff. He knows perfectly well however, that in every industry profit is calculated on a percentage basis so that when you put a cent or 2 cents on to the original cost the wholesaler takes his profit as a percentage on the increased cost which he pays to the wholesaler. That is standard trade practice. If the Minister puts 2 cents on to the price of a bottle of beer, he knows the minute <span class="col_3745-3746" refersTo="page_0452"/>he does it that the consumer will have to pay at least 3 cents more. The Minister knows that immediately he puts a cent on to the price of something on which there is a 50 per cent profit margin it will cost H cents more to the user. If he puts on 2 cents there will be a 3 cent increase, because every business works that way. Thus out of the 19 cents that a person pays for his beer, the breweries are getting 29 per cent, the Minister is getting 35 per cent, and the trade gets just over 35 per cent. So the Minister and the seller are taking over two-thirds, and the brewer the smallest portion of the cost.</p>

<p>Yet the one who gets the least out of that bottle of beer, the one who gets least of the three people who profit from it, is the one who is now being discriminated against by way of taxation. It is not even as though the Minister has justified it. I pointed out that the increase in the price of beer has been 16 per cent over 40 years. Is that a reason for saying that they must now be penalized&#x003F; The argument of the hon. member for Queenstown is that because he has a higher production the big man or the big brewery will have a lower unit cost. Is that a new principle in economics&#x003F; Must we tell industry in South Africa that they must not increase their volume because if they do their unit cost will be less and therefore their taxation will be higher&#x003F; That is the simple issue which the Government now has to clarify. Is the hon. member for Queenstown&#x2019;s interpretation the one which industry must now place on this taxation&#x003F; Will this now be the approach towards the taxation of all companies in South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>I said that if I had time I would deal with the other group of the victims of these proposals, namely the small family man, on which I was challenged. I did not say it was a major issue, but I said it was significant that items affecting the home of the young family man had been selected for increased taxation. Let us take a refrigerator. Refrigerators are made in South Africa, but the Minister has now put a tax on the components and the spare parts which make up that refrigerator, so that the price of the local refrigerator must go up as well. Whilst we are dealing with this I want to ask the Minister whether he is now going to put a discriminatory tax on Fuchsware if they should produce more than a certain number of stoves, or on any other producer of electrical appliances&#x003F; According to the hon. member for Queenstown, this is not going to affect the cost of living of the family man. The family man does not matter. As long as the Minister can get his money he does not care whom he gets it from, and because the working man is the easiest target he is the man who is being hit. Take a little piffling thing like toys. Is it that the Minister has forgotten what childhood is like&#x003F; What difference does the tax on toys make to the economy of the country&#x003F; But it makes a big difference to the little kids, with money becoming worth less and less. These are the things I pointed to as being an indication of the lack of thought the Minister has given to the people who are going to be the victims of this taxation. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I wish to deal with a few new points that have been raised here, but before doing so, I want to reply to the hon. member for Durban (Point), who has just resumed his seat. He challenged me to say whether this form of taxation was going to be an isolated occurrence or whether I was going to apply it in other respects as well. I cannot imagine that anyone who has any knowledge of parliamentary procedure&#x2014; perhaps the hon. member does not know much about it&#x2014;and of the functions and responsibilities of a Minister of Finance would ask him whether or not he was going to apply a certain taxation principle in the future. There have been Ministers who have lost their position as Minister of Finance for less than that, and however much I may appreciate the curiosity of the hon. member for Durban (Point) and however strong the temptation may be to satisfy his curiosity, I am afraid that my position does not allow me to do so. In any case, it is a principle that is not contained in this proposal. We are concerned with a specific proposal here and that is what we have to deal with.</p>

<p>Then there is another point that I have not yet dealt with. Remarks have been made here about the increase in the duty on various groups of liquor, such as on spirits, on brandy, on beer, and on fortified wines. Hon. members of the Opposition have suggested that the increase in the duty on beer is proportionately much larger than in the case of other kinds of liquor. But I have had a list drawn up, and if one looks at the position since 1948, one finds that the percentage increases in the duty in respect of all these groups is very much the same; there is not much difference, but what may in fact give a wrong impression is the fact that in 1958 the duty on spirits, brandy, was doubled. The duty was doubled from 32 to 64 cents per quart, per one-sixth of a gallon, while in the case of fortified wine we had a similar double increase in 1962, but in the case of beer we have never had a double increase, and consequently hon. members do not get the true picture if they compare the increases in duty as from a certain date. As I have said, the percentage increases in the duty on all three groups are very much the same. Hon. members may also work it out for themselves, but I assure them that the percentage increases from 1948 up to and including this increase are very much the same. In fact, that is also the reply to the argument that, through the increased duty on beer, we are encouraging people to go back to hard liquor. If the percentage increase is not higher, then that argument is unfounded.</p>

<p>The argument has also been used that the value of the shares of S.A. Breweries has greatly depreciated and that that is attributable to this duty. I am absolutely certain, also as a result of what was said by the hon. member for Durban (Point), that this duty will be recovered in full from the consumer and that S.A. Breweries is not going to lose anything, even if one takes into account the extra six cents a gallon which they have to pay in the case of one of their factories. They only have to pay an average of 77&#x00BD; cents. They have increased the price to the consumer more than is justified by the increases in duty, and therefore I say that S.A. Breweries is not going to lose anything on this. I am aware of the fact that the prices of the shares of S.A. Breweries dropped appreciably at a certain stage, but I think that happened because there had been a misrepresentation. The general impression was that this highest duty would be applicable to all the breweries of S.A. Breweries. I do not know whether they then realized that the average in the case of all seven breweries of S.A. Breweries was not 80 cents, but 77&#x00BD; cents.</p>

<p>Those were the two new points raised by hon. members.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member switched over to petrol and other oils. I do not really know what case he wanted to make out in that regard. and perhaps I should first give the Opposition an opportunity of explaining to me what case they want to make out in this regard. I said that this was a duty that one did not like to impose, but that this duty formed an integral part of the general picture which I painted in my Budget speech. If the request is therefore merely that I should abandon this duty, then I cannot accede to it.</p>

<p>I agree. This is a direct tax on the Bantu people. They are the only ones who are going to be affected by this iniquitous tax, and, in fact, that is also the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention. I say further that it is unfair because this is a tax on what the Bantu people consider to be a food. They do not drink Bantu beer as we would drink a bottle of beer in a pub or in our lounges at home, as an intoxicating beverage. This is part of their subsistence; to them it is a food. Sir, it is common knowledge among nutritionists that kaffircorn malt has a very high nutritional value; it has a high percentage of Vitamin B.l. A shortage of this vitamin causes pellagra which is a deficiency disease, and at his time when the fight against malnutrition, and particularly, the fight against deficiency diseases, is one of the foremost fights that we have, not only in this country, but throughout the world, this hon. Minister introduces this iniquitous tax to tax the food of the Bantu people. The primary way in which the Bantu peoples consume this very nutritious product, this very necessary vitamin, is in the form of Bantu beer, and let me say here and now that those who believe that it is only the husband who gets this Bantu beer are wrong.

<p>The amendment of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) covers not only kaffircorn malt but &#x201C;lemonade, flavoured spa waters and flavoured aerated waters&#x201D; (item 22.02). We feel that this tax should go as well. Either this item is a luxury or a necessity and if it is a luxury I fail to see the necessity for price control, and if it is not a luxury, if it is a necessity, and there has to be price control, then there is no justification for the tax. What I am very concerned about is the manner in which the Minister is going to administer this tax. This item refers to &#x201C;lemonade, flavoured spa waters and flavoured aerated waters, other non-alcoholic beverages (excluding fruit and vegetable juices falling within heading No. 20.07)&#x201D;. I want to know how the Minister&#x2019;s Department is going to ascertain the proportion of fruit and vegetable juices in the bottle. I submit that it is impossible by chemical analysis to determine that more than 5 per cent or 5 per cent has been added to the bottle. The Minister is going to find it impossible to administer this tax. He is going to have great difficulty in administering it. It is going to involve a large inspectorate, which he does not employ at present, and I submit that for all practical purposes the Minister will have to remove this tax, just as he had to remove a similar tax in previous years. This tax is not warranted and it places an undue hardship on the lower income groups. It has already led to a considerable amount of controversy. Both the retail trade, the manufacturers and the wholesalers are at odds as to the profit margin and as to how the price is to be determined, and while this Minister is not concerned with price control he is concerned with the administration of this tax. It is his duty to collect it and to collect it efficiently. I submit that the Minister has not got an earthly hope of determining the amount of fruit juices in a bottle of aerated water, and I challenge him to produce anyone in his Department or in the C.S.I.R. who can actually say that a bottle contains a certain proportion of fruit juices. For that reason I regard this tax as wholly impracticable and therefore it should be scrapped.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support strongly the plea of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) with reference to kaffircorn. I think the imposition of this duty will have a serious effect on the health of that large number of people who rely almost entirely for their vitamins upon malted kaffircorn in particular. In the long run the Minister will find, if he could analyse it, although that would be difficult, that the amount of money that has to be spent in dealing with tuberculosis amongst the Bantu, one of the few groups of our population where tuberculosis is uncontrolled and is actually spreading, exceeds the amount that he collects by way of this tax. I have not looked at the figures recently but I think there are perhaps more than 10,000,000 Bantu who are hospitalized and supported by the State, and if the Minister takes away from the Bantu the main source of vitamin B.1, not only will the disease spread more widely than it is doing at the moment, but we will arrive at the point where the Minister, through the Department of Health, will be paying out money to supply these ill people with pills made from kaffircorn or some other source of vitamin B, which is so important. Not only will the deficiency disease of beriberi make its appearance again but, as I say, the other serious diseases will be deleteriously affected, and he will be collecting with the one hand and spending with the other. He will find that he is spending more than he is getting back and that his physically weakened labour force is no longer of the value that it used to be.</p>

<p>I want to refer also to item 98.15, &#x201C;Vacuum flasks and other vacuum vessels, complete with cases; parts thereof (excluding glass inners)&#x201D;, where the present duty of 20 per cent is to be increased to 30 per cent. I think the Minister is under the impression that vacuum flasks are used for picnicking or by the working man taking his hot or his cold drink to work. One of the biggest users of vacuum flasks is the medical profession. I understand that surgical instruments are exempt from taxation; that has been so for a long time. Vacuum flasks and cold and/or hot vessels are used to a great extent in the transportation of blood. If the Minister persists in imposing this tax he will be partly responsible if there is a shortage of blood or if blood goes bad. These utensils are used largely for carrying vaccines and sera and blood about the country. It is a stand-by, for instance, in the Government&#x2019;s policy of treating poliomyelitis. I feel that the hon. the Minister should reclassify vacuum flasks or he should make some exception in order to save the country from these two disasters which he is helping to produce.</p>

<p>The Opposition&#x2019;s inability to understand the taxation proposals we are dealing with here, remains as incomprehensible as their ability to give people outside an incorrect and distorted version of facts. I am saying that with reference to item 22.02 and with reference to certain suggestions made earlier on in this House by hon. members on that side of the House to the effect that the profitability of the products concerned would be considerably affected by these new taxation proposals. To be specific, it has been suggested that the profit on a particular container of cool drinks has decreased to 11.6 per cent. That was said on the assumption that both, the container and the bottle Were included in the <span class="col_3751-3752" refersTo="page_0455"/>purchase price of the product. Mr. Chairman, that is an untruth. One does not buy a container and a bottle and then sell only the contents of the bottle. One returns the container and the bottle to the manufacturer and sells the contents of the bottle, and the profit on that is 25 per cent. The profit in the case of other types of containers amounts to 60 per cent to 85 per cent. That is a fact that was not mentioned by hon. members on that side of the House, but in this regard it was spread abroad from this House that these taxation proposals would impose a glaring injustice on certain sections of the public, namely the trade. In order to put the record straight, I want to say that those profit margins vary between 25 per cent and 85 per cent gross, and I am certain that many hon. members of this House would be very grateful if they could trade at that percentage of profit. I am sure that if hon. members of the Opposition cannot trade at that percentage, they should not be in trade.</p>

<p>Mention was made here of the necessity of cool drinks and it was implied that cool drinks were only mineral water products that were being sold in glass bottles, ready for use. Mr. Chairman, that is not the case either. Fruit juices and fruit-based cool drinks as well as cool drink extracts are excluded; that is to say, all products which are capable of dilution. It has already been said that the hon. the Minister had a definite object with this Budget, and that was to Budget on a non-inflationary basis and to combat inflation, and he said&#x2014;and he was quite right, and no one can deny that&#x2014; that in order to be able to combat inflation successfully it had to be attacked on a broad front. That is what the hon. the Minister has done, and that is what hon. members on that side of the House refuse to accept. Therefore I must accept that they want inflation to be encouraged. [Laughter.] That hon. member is laughing now, but his laughter will die away soon. The fact of the matter is that the hon. the Minister made appeals to the entire nation from time to time that they should save, as spending would have an adverse effect in this case, but the people did not do that; consequently the hon. the Minister had to announce these measures.</p>

<p>To come back to cool drinks: If by way of comparison one considers the price of cool drink extracts, if hon. members of the Opposition want to accept that cool drinks are not a luxury item, but one of the necessaries of life, then hon. members can buy cool drink extracts and prepare cool drinks there from, and then the cost per cool drink will work out at 1 cent to 1 cent, as compared with the price of 6 cents per cool drink if the price of the bottle is not taken into account. Here we therefore have an excellent example of how savings can be effected if the people of South Africa, particularly the young people, really mean to save. The hon. member for Durban (Point), who dragged in the young family man and the working man by the head and shoulders here this afternoon, is unfortunately not present at the moment, but hon. members on that side submitted pleas here this afternoon on behalf of the working man, who, according to them, earns R6,000 a year. But if that is the case, if the working man earns between R4,000 and R6,000 a year, as was stated here this afternoon by hon. members on that side of the House, and if the young family man and the working man find it difficult to pay &#x00BD; cent a bottle more for their cool drinks, then they should save, and if they have to drink cool drinks, if cold water cannot serve the same purpose, they should buy cool drink extract or fruit juices in respect of which there is no increase in duty.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by saying that the arguments advanced by hon. members on that side in my opinion did not deal with the merits of the taxation proposals. It seems to me as though they conjure up these arguments in the hope that the Press will spread them abroad, with the emphasis on the notion that hon. members on that side of the House are the people who have to watch over the interests of the poor man, the worker and the young married man.</p>

<p>We have had a very interesting afternoon here. We have listened here to the contradictory remarks made by the hon. the Minister. He said that he did not want to kill initiative at the top level, but he promptly does that by imposing this discriminatory tax on beer. I think the case made on this side of the House in respect of both Bantu beer and ordinary beer, is a sound case and I do not think that the Government side has been able to put up a very satisfactory answer. As a matter of fact it has been rather amusing to hear hon. members opposite defending the Minister&#x2019;s proposals to increase taxation. This would have been very interesting before the election. However, their stories are on record and they can be used.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to refer to item 84.11.15 and the other items down to item 84.15.50, dealing with refrigerators. The hon. member for Durban (Point) did say that this was a taxation on the average working man, the family man. For the information of the hon. member for Wonderboom I should like to point out that we on this side are interested&#x2019; in the working man, in the family man, and we should like him to know through the Press what we are doing for him in this House. I think it is well that he should know. We have not had one speech from the opposite side defending the working man.</p>

<p>I should like to know from the hon. Minister whether in putting this extra 10 per cent taxation on refrigerators, he does it to gain revenue or to protect an industry. Industries <span class="col_3753-3754" refersTo="page_0456"/>are to-day being protected by import control but here, too, we seek protection for them by levying an extra 10 per cen on excise duty. We on this side feel that if the manufacturer who is going to get the benefit of the 10 per cent from the Minister should pass it on to the buyer, we would be very happy, but I am sure hon. members will find, if they go out to buy a refrigerator to-morrow, that they have to pay as much for it as before. We must be very careful in this country. Let us protect our industries but do not let us wrap them up in cotton wool. This looks like what the Minister is doing here. It is a discriminatory tax against the imported article. I notice that a levy of 25 per cent is also going to be levied on sealed units for refrigerators, and further on that not only is the sealed unit taxed but also the parts. This to me is being done not so much to obtain revenue as to protect an industry.</p>

<p>Then we come to electric light bulbs. The Minister may say that the amount of extra taxation he is levying on electric light bulbs for motor-cars is small. On certain bulbs which we obtain from the United Kingdom free, we now have to pay a levy of from 5 to 10 per cent. No doubt the hon. member for Queenstown will get up and work it out to see what it amounts to. It may work out at i cent a bulb, but nevertheless it is extra taxation and as such adds to the cost of living. Hon. members were rather amused by our attitude to the taxation on toys. But are these duties which are going to be levied on toys being levied for the purpose of protecting an industry or for the purpose of curbing inflation&#x003F; Or is the Minister trying to do both these things&#x003F; I do not know why this matter is not left to the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs, who will protect industries in South Africa against unfair competition from overseas. Why does the hon. the Minister of Finance now have to assist him&#x003F; If you look at the new taxes it looks very much as if the hon. the Minister is now trying to protect industry in South Africa. I am all for having industries in this country but do not let us have an industry which is completely uneconomic. It must be able to stand on its own feet. These extra taxes on toys and other items all add to the cost of living. While the Minister on the one hand is trying to get the public to save, on the other hand throughout these taxation proposals he is killing initiative at the top. He is killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. That is what he is doing. We must be very careful how we proceed in regard to taxation measures.</p>

<p>I should like to support other hon. members here in their objection to the taxation on mineral waters. Taxation on mineral waters is an unheard-of thing. Whoever thought of taxing mineral waters&#x003F; This is a tax which I think the hon. the Minister should eliminate. He should accept the motion which we proposed here this afternoon. The revenue which will be derived from such a tax will be insufficient to meet administrative costs. That is how ridiculous it is. If you work out the salaries of the inspectors who have to walk around and check, upon the various mineral water factories, you will find that it is more than what is derived from the taxation. The Minister cannot tell us to-day what it is going to cost him to supervise the collection of this tax. And who is it affecting&#x003F; The children and the parents who have to pay. If the hon. the Minister wants to curb inflation by means of taxation, he should look very hard at these items he proposes to tax. It is a ridiculous thing to tax a refrigerator. It is not a luxury. What is he going to get from the tax on electric light bulbs&#x003F; Admittedly we have factories here in the country but let us make these factories competitive. Do not let the public, who have to buy these items, have to pay extra in order to maintain these factories. We have heard that when these items of taxation were worked out, it was done on a haphazard basis, but I do not think so. Industries and others make approaches to the Minister and we have what we see here to-day. We have been told that we must curb spending. I can tell the hon. the Minister that the working man has no money to save. The hon. the Minister would be shocked at the amount of debt that is being created to-day by buy-aid and other societies. He will be shocked to find out how the working man of to-day lives. If the hon. the Minister thinks that the working man can still save, he is mistaken. These levies are only going to add to the hardships of the average man.</p>

<p>I think at this stage I should give an impression of what the hon. Opposition is asking for here. They are arguing for the taxation to be reduced to an amount of R8,700,000 for the remaining part of the year, that is to say, from now to the end of February, 1967. In my Budget speech I made it very clear that when we originally announced the four-point plan against inflation, the fourth part of the plan would include measures of a fiscal nature. Naturally a Minister does not like to increase taxation, and therefore I fought it out with my financial experts that they should see to it that additional taxation was restricted to the absolutely essential minimum. After we had seen to it that that was done, hon. members now come along here and try to reduce the additional taxation further by approximately 14 per cent. That would of course create an impossible situation, and hon. members&#x2019; attitude in this regard can only spring from their inability to appreciate the seriousness of the effort we are making.</p>

<p>In most cases these attacks were directed against indirect taxation. In this connection I should like to point out to hon. members that in actual fact our indirect taxation is lower than our direct taxation. In some other countries of the world the reverse is the case. At any rate, there are few other countries whose indirect taxation is lower than their direct taxation. In Canada, in <span class="col_3755-3756" refersTo="page_0457"/>any case, it is certainly more. In most cases it is half of it approximately. In this country, however, our indirect taxation is less than half of our total taxation. Our indirect taxation, expressed as a percentage of our national product, is only 8.9 per cent. In the United Kingdom the percentage is 16.8, in Canada 19.3, in the U.S.A. 11.5 and in France 23.5. It is therefore not true that we are imposing a heavy burden on the taxpayers of South Africa by way of indirect taxation. Here we have endeavoured to propose increases as far as both direct and indirect taxation are concerned with the object of strengthening us in our struggle against inflation. If hon. members now want to reduce these additional taxes by R8,700,000, they will be weakening the effectiveness of the effort we are making in this regard.</p>

<p>I now come to a few of the individual items which have been attacked here. In the first place there is the duty on petrol. I said at the time that the duty on petrol was one that I did not like imposing. I felt, however, that it would be perfectly fair, if the railway user had to pay more for his transport, that the motorcar user should also be asked to contribute his share. We know that millions of gallons are used up for mere pleasure trips every year. If this consumption can be reduced in some way or other, it will serve a very useful purpose. But let me give hon. members some idea of how modest the increase in the duty on petrol is in actual fact. I pointed out on a previous occasion that in a case where a person used 30 gallons a month he could use 29 gallons in future in order to have the same total expenditure. That is therefore a reduction of only one-thirtieth. I therefore do not think that this is a serious matter. Hon. members may say that it is going to affect all forms of production, and so forth. But here too I think there is a misunderstanding. A large quantity of the diesel oil and kerosene consumed is consumed on farms and in industry. This consumption has been exempted from the increased duty, i.e. the consumption in the very industries that are very sensitive to an increased cost structure. Those are the reasons why we have said that we should in this way obtain a certain amount by way of duty on petrol.</p>

<p>Another matter that has been raised here, relates to the duty on kaffircorn malt. I have already indicated that there will be a rebate in respect of malt which is used for the manufacture of foodstuffs, such as breakfast foods. We seriously considered imposing the duty on the final product, i.e. on Bantu beer itself, but then we found that 23 per cent of the total production of malt was all that was used for the manufacture of beer by the municipalities. The remainder, except for the percentage used for the manufacture of foodstuffs, is used by private breweries. If the duty is imposed on the final product, it will not bring in anything. It will only be taken from the Bantu who buys beer at the municipal beer-house. That is why we said that we would investigate this matter. In reply to the complaint made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) to the effect that the poor Bantu will now have to pay, I just want to tell him that, as we are spreading this tax burden, it is no more than fair that the Bantu should also pay some small portion of it. It is a very small portion. If one wants to draw a comparison, it will cost him about two-thirds of a cent per gallon. That is not much. Where it is obtained from the municipal breweries, it is probably not impossible that they will be able to bear a large part of that cost themselves. I am aware of arguments that were not used here. I have had interviews with deputations and I have told them that I could not do anything about the matter now. We shall have to see whether their fears are realized. At this stage we are not in a position to withdraw this provision. We shall of course have to take all these taxes into review when we come to my next Budget. And that time is not so far away any more. In the meantime we have to accept the present position. I shall pay attention to all the numerous arguments which they have submitted to me. Then we can see whether this particular duty on malt can assume a better form, or whether there is some alternative form which can be used to obtain the same amount from it. But we cannot do that now. One of the difficulties that every Minister of Finance is faced with is that in considering his taxes he cannot consult beforehand with the people he wants to tax. He cannot do that. But we are nevertheless aware of the fact that this is a matter which should receive our closest attention in the future, not for the reason advanced by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District), but for the reason I have mentioned, namely that it may have an effect on the primary producer of kaffircorn. We shall pay attention to that.</p>

<p>A few small points have been raised in regard to duty, such as in connection with thermos flasks and refrigerators. As far as thermos flasks are concerned, the position is that approximately 610,000 units are imported annually. The extra duty expected to be derived there from during this financial year is R22.000. One may therefore work out that it is a ridiculously small average per unit that is being added here. 610,000 units are imported and the only additional amount we get in tax is R35.000 annually. As regards the refrigerators and many other items as well&#x2014;as mentioned by the hon. member for Salt River&#x2014;the fact of the matter is simply that these are articles which are produced here in South Africa. We have expressly told the Department of Commerce and Industries to see to it that the cost of the various locally manufactured articles which are now being taxed here is not pushed up as a result of these increases in the duty on imported goods. To some extent these increases are protective as well, but we do not want them to make use of this to increase the prices. We want to wean them a little from importing all these items and make them more accustomed to buying the South African product.</p>

<p><span class="col_3757-3758" refersTo="page_0458"/>Then there is only one matter remaining, namely the duty on cool drinks. The main argument against it is that it will be impracticable. We shall not be able to apply it. I am afraid that I cannot agree with that argument. I have to allow myself to be led by my advisers, of course, but they have had discussions with the Association of Cool Drink Manufacturers and the latter have promised their co-operation. I therefore do not think that it is impossible to apply it. As regards the point which the hon. member raised in connection with the percentage, I just want to tell him that the excise duty is on all lemonade and mineral waters marketed in closed bottles or containers and ready for drinking without dilution. That is what we understand by that. In consultation with the Association of Cool Drink Manufacturers and the S.A.B.S. we shall now lay down a minimum percentage of fruit juice which must form the base of the mineral waters in order to exclude them from the excise duty we are now imposing. I therefore think that the argument that we are going to experience difficulties in that regard is unfounded. To a certain extent this is much easier to administer than many similar taxes, because in actual fact there are only a small number of factories outside controlled areas and it is a very well organized industry. I therefore do not think that we shall experience all those difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think those are the points that were raised here in regard to the taxes that were suggested should be done away with.</p>

<p>If it is the endeavour to curb inflation, the reply remains the same, namely that this side of the House has provided sufficient proof that in one case it is discriminatory taxation and in the other case, even if it is only 23 per cent of the malt as stated by the hon. the Minister, it will affect the food supplies of the Bantu&#x2014;I nearly said existence, because it will also affect the raising of his child, and so forth.</p>

<p>It is a matter which causes me concern, Sir, because if he cannot collect the tax, he will increase it still further in the next Budget. It is a cause of concern to all of us. I just want to deal with one point, and the Minister&#x2019;s remark has now brought me to it. He says he would like to spread the tax, even so as to include the Bantu with his food. Does the Minister think that the Bantu does not pay any of these increases in duty&#x003F; Surely he pays many of them, almost on every item, because he is also the consumer.</p>

<p>In any case, I want to deal with something which has not yet been touched upon here. It appears on page 294, item 58.01 and particularly 01.10, and it relates to the duty on woollen carpets or on floor coverings of wool and of fine animal hair. I want to make a special appeal to the Minister, and I want to motivate my appeal. I want to say that the producers in a number of countries are spending millions of rands at this stage. I shall quote the figures:</p>

<p>More than R20,000,000 is being spent internationally to promote wool and its consumption. In spite of that the consumption is decreasing and the market is declining. I have no objection to the Minister&#x2019;s collecting money on carpets other than woollen carpets, but I want to make a special appeal to him. Seeing that this country does not produce enough woollen carpets, seeing that we have no or very little carpet wool in the country and consequently have to import it, and seeing that the woollen carpet is in any case a much more expensive carpet than other kinds of carpets, but is much more durable and is something we should all like to have. I want to make a special appeal to the Minister to reconsider this particular increase of 10 per cent in the duty on woollen carpets. I do not know what <span class="col_3759-3760" refersTo="page_0459"/>amount will be involved, but it cannot be such an enormous amount that it should be necessary for the Minister, by increasing the duty on woollen carpets, to cause a drop in the sales of the commodity and further to depress both the market, which is already showing a declining tendency, and the industry, which finds itself in difficulties and is spending millions of its own funds to promote sales.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have been waiting for the Deputy Ministers of Bantu Affairs to take part in this debate. The thing that amazes me is that we have attacked taxation on malt used for making Bantu beer without reply. When this matter was raised in the Budget debate and the taxation was accepted we heard from both the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister that this tax was not going to affect the Bantu at all. I would remind you, Sir, that when I raised this question the Minister of Bantu Administration&#x2014;who is not here this afternoon, so he cannot take part in the debate, though I see his Deputy is here&#x2014;said, when I complained that the Bantu is going to pay more for his beer because there is a higher taxation on his beer, which is also a food, that they would not be allowed to increase the price of Bantu beer. I then said: &#x201C;Why not&#x003F;&#x201D; and the Minister said, &#x201C;I will not allow it.&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;The Minister talks in ignorance.&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I have to fix the price of beer.&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;What is the Minister talking about&#x003F; Who fixes the price of beer made in the kraals&#x003F;&#x201D; The Minister, his colleague and all the others here laughed and said that it is not made in the kraals.

<block name="quote">But does not the hon. member know how much beer one can make from a pound&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member where does the profit on beer go&#x003F;</block>

<p>Now I want to ask him where the profit on beer goes&#x003F; The impression given by the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister and by all hon. members opposite to the House that night was that the Bantu were not going to pay anything more for their beer and that the profits made by the beer-halls would be less, but that would not affect the Bantu at all because in any event the profits went for the general welfare of the Bantu. Well, do they suggest that all the taxes we pay do not go for our welfare as well&#x003F; Of course they must ultimately get some benefit, but the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and the hon. the Deputy Minister misled their own members in voting for this measure because they believed that the Bantu would not pay any more for their beer. I say that the Cabinet did not realize what was involved in this tax which was imposed, and that is why the hon. the Minister of Finance is going to do away with this tax next year. He does not want to admit now that he was wrong and withdraw the tax, so he says we must wait until next year and he will consider it then. Perhaps his successor might do it next year. It is amazing to me how much difference of opinion there is and how much confusion there is amongst the members of the Cabinet. The Minister has another tax here. The direct tax on Bantu beer affects the Bantu more than anyone else. There are some White people who drink Bantu beer, but it does not affect the White man much.</p>

<p>But there is another tax here which does not affect the Bantu but which affects the other groups, the Whites and the Coloureds, and that is this tax on prams. The average Bantu does not use a pram. Their babies are carried on the back. This tax is in opposition to the plea made by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. He asked the whole country to celebrate the five years of the Republic by increasing the size of our families. What encouragement does this Minister give to that plea made by his colleague&#x003F; It seems to me <span class="col_3761-3762" refersTo="page_0460"/>that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is absent to-day on purpose because everything he stands for is going wrong here. He does not want the Bantu to pay more for their beer, but we find now that they will pay more; he encourages the White people to have more babies, but here we find that this Minister of Finance taxes prams; he says that if we want babies and want to push them in prams we must pay more, but if we carry them on our backs like the Bantu that is fine. One of the hon. members earlier said that the United Party should not attack this Budget as they do because we give the impression to the outside world that this Budget is against the interests of the poor man. But if we attack the Budget because it is against the rich man, then they will say that that will be said abroad and the world will be given the impression that this is not a country for capitalists in which to invest. Sir, they do not want us to attack the Budget at all. Now we must keep quiet, because they know that everything we say can be justified.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister the question of the foot-and-mouth disease measures which are applicable to South West Africa. I want to say at once that I represent a constituency which may be regarded as the one producing the largest number of beef car cases in the whole of the Republic of South Africa and South West Africa, namely more than 300,000 in a normal year, and which comprises the districts of Gobabis and Okahandja, and parts of the districts of Windhoek and Otjiwarongo. I am raising this matter because that part of the district of Gobabis which falls in the eastern side of my constituency is one of the areas of South West Africa which has suffered most severely in the past six to seven years as a result of foot-and-mouth disease and also as a result of protracted droughts.</p>

<p><span class="col_3763-3764" refersTo="page_0461"/>I want to say immediately that we gratefully accept all the steps taken by the South West Administration to relieve the emergency suffered by those farmers. In fact, if one wants to be responsible, one must heartily welcome all the stock disease control measures which are applicable there. We as stock farmers realize full well that if we want to stabilize our cattle farming, we have to take proper precautionary measures against foot-and-mouth disease and other stock diseases which may break out. We also realize that that eastern part of South West Africa is particularly susceptible to all kinds of stock diseases, firstly because it adjoins Botswana, where the control measures are not very strict, and secondly, because of the large numbers of game to be found in that area. But the objection raised by the farmers in my constituency against the strict control measures applied by the veterinary services in the Republic relates to the measure of discrimination applied in respect of the farmers in South West Africa and the farmers in the Republic along the Botswana border in parts of the Cape Province and the Transvaal. There are various measures which are applied more strictly in South West Africa than in the corresponding areas in the Republic which border on Botswana. I must say at once that the trade between South West Africa and Botswana is to-day limited virtually to the importation of cream from the vicinity of Ghanzi to South West Africa, and besides, that is subject to strict measures, namely, weekly confirmation of the fact that it comes from a free area where there is no foot-and-mouth disease and that it is transported only on road motor buses of the S.A. Railways. In other words, it is done under strict supervision, while we find that on the Transvaal and Cape side of Botswana there is a free trade in cattle and other products on both the controlled and the uncontrolled markets.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to mention three instances of measures which are applied much more strictly to South West Africa than to the corresponding areas on the other side of Botswana. I mention for example the so-called belt areas. By &#x201C;belt areas&#x201D; we understand the parts which fall in those border areas. On the Republic side of Botswana these belt farms consist of three to five farms which vary from 2,000 to 5,000 morgen in extent. But what is the position in South West Africa&#x003F; There the belt area extends over five farms of up to hectares in extent. The result is that along the eastern border of South West alone there are 160 belt farms, with an average size of 10,000 hectares, which therefore extend over an enormous area. These particular belt farms are subject to strict control measures which place a particular burden on the farming community. These measures have resulted in the property market as far as these farms are concerned virtually coming to a standstill. No one wants to buy a farm that falls in the belt area. But those farmers have their own particular problems as well. For example, they have the problem of obtaining credit. No bank likes to give credit to a farmer whose farm falls in a belt area, because the farmer cannot readily convert his assets into money. In other words, as far as the provision of credit is concerned, a greater burden is imposed on the belt areas. Consider the question of inspections as well.</p>

<p>In the Republic there are inspections of the belt farms once every 14 days; in South West Africa there used to be inspections once every seven days. Recently during the drought the period between inspections was extended to 14 days. In addition an 80 per cent inspection of the animals is required to be carried out. That results in the veld being very badly trampled, because the animals have to be collected on the farm from a large area. That also goes hand in hand with increased labour costs and various other costs. One must take into account the fact that the belt farms of South West Africa extend over a large area and that it is difficult to collect the animals. Consider the question of quarantine as well. The quarantine requirements laid down are so strict that quarantine facilities are virtually unobtainable to-day, as no one in those drought-stricken areas is keen to make available grazing land for that purpose. In addition it is expensive; it sometimes costs as much as R1.25 per head of cattle per three weeks, which means enormous expenditure for such a farmer.</p>

<p>In addition there are other disadvantages involved. For instance, it is not easy to arrange auction sales. In other words, the farmers simply have to accept the prices they are offered by private buyers. I am only mentioning this to emphasize the fact that the farmers in South West Africa who fall in those belt areas are subject to particular hardships which influence their entire future in the farming industry. Of course, the main question asked by them is how long it is still going to continue. It may still continue for years. The farmers in those areas are all farmers who are farming virtually on the outposts of South West Africa. They are mostly beginners. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Middelland will excuse me if I do not follow him in the particular argument used by him about his own particular local problem. I would like first to refer to what was said last night by the hon. member for Standerton who does not seem to be here at the moment. If I followed his line of thought correctly&#x2014;and I think I did&#x2014;he touched upon a rather unusual subject when he said that land was becoming very scarce indeed, in fact so much so that we might perhaps one day run the danger of no longer being able to afford to have cemeteries and that that land might have to come under the plough. Sir. I hope that hon. member will not expect me to follow him into the graveyard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton, at the very end of his speech, also referred briefly to the need for extra pineapple research in the Eastern Cape and there I do want to support <span class="col_3765-3766" refersTo="page_0462"/>him because this is something for which we have been pleading for a great number of years, and the overwhelming proportion of our pineapple-growing industry is situated there. In particular I hope that the hon. the Minister will give attention to the problem of proper staffing of the pineapple research station at Fort Grey, i.e. the Collondale research station near East London, which has been very well laid out and where there are excellent modern buildings and extremely good laboratories but where there has been a chronic shortage of personnel.</p>

<p>In particular I hope that the pineapple extension officer will not be lost to the Department. I understand that that officer is at the moment undergoing further training. People concerned with the pineapple industry pressed for many years for this post to be created, and the post was recently filled. Thirdly, J would like to refer to the need to increase the size, in order to make it more effective, of the pineapple research station at Bathurst which will be used for, among other things, research into the cultivation of pineapples not merely as a crop in a system of mono-culture, which has so often been the case in the past, but also as a crop in a proper rotational system, bringing in the animal factor, amongst other things.</p>

<p>Sir, the particular subject that I want to deal with this evening is one which is of interest not only to that part of the country referred to by the hon. member for Standerton, but it is of interest to the whole of the agricultural industry. It is one which appears every year on the congress agenda of virtually every agricultural union in this country, and that is the question of veterinary services and in particular the question of the training of veterinarians and, above all, the question as to whether a second faculty of veterinary science is not desirable. We have something like 160 qualified veterinarians in the service of the State at the moment, and in addition to that there are on the register some 426 private veterinarians. That does not mean to say that all those 426 private veterinarians are engaged in what we would normally regard as private practice. Some of them are engaged by institutions such as municipalities, and I think there are also cases where, although they may still be on the register and may be regarded as private practitioners, they in fact do very little veterinary practise. They may be people who have gone farming and the only time they practise is on those rare occasions when they help out their friends or perhaps do something for their own animals.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of State veterinary services, it would appear from an answer given by the hon. the Minister earlier this Session, that there are not many vacancies in the Division of Veterinary Field Services as far as veterinarians are concerned. But the point is that our veterinary resources are so thinly stretched that where vacancies do occur it places a very heavy burden indeed upon the remaining veterinarians who have to do the work in those areas where there are vacancies. If a vacancy occurs in an area where the normal establishment is one veterinarian, then the veterinarians in the surrounding areas have to do the work. That may also be the case where there is more than one veterinarian stationed in a particular centre and where one vacancy occurs. I want to illustrate that by explaining what happened in my own area some while ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned for dinner I was dealing with the question of State veterinary services. Although there may not be many vacancies for State veterinarians in the Division of Veterinary Field Services, yet when vacancies do occur our existing State veterinarians are so thinly spread over the country that a very serious problem is created. Before I go any further I would like to pay tribute to the State veterinarians who to my mind probably set an example to many other countries in the world by their devotion to duty and their efficiency. When these vacancies do occur, as was the position in my area until about a month ago when a second veterinarian was appointed to fill the vacant post, the remaining veterinarians have to do more than work overtime in order to cope with the work. In my area the senior State veterinarian had to cope with no less than seven magisterial districts with a cattle population of approximately 145,000 and a small stock and horse population of approximately 1,704,000. As the hon. the Minister knows, even though perhaps he may not agree with me entirely, that is to my mind the best stud-raising area in the Republic.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. member was a stud breeder of great repute and I will not argue with him. Let us say that it is one of the best stud-raising areas in the Republic. But apart from that the area has also experienced a serious outbreak of rabies during the course of which 7.000 dogs had to be inoculated against the disease. There is also a local problem, namely tuberculosis in kudu which spread the disease amongst cattle and are a serious threat to the stud herds in the area. There is also a chinchilla observation post there. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow up the speech made by that hon. member. I should like to sneak on a matter of basic importance to-night, i.e. stock breeding production in South Africa, and in particular the adequate production of edible animal products. I do not want to sneak about wool, but about the two basic edible products of our animals, i.e. meat production and milk <span class="col_3767-3768" refersTo="page_0463"/>production. The future protein supplies of our nation depend on these two products, and it is absolutely essential that more should be produced in future and that we should be able to produce it in adequate quantities. The physical geography of South Africa has resulted in the present position in respect of stock farming in South Africa. Up to 1939 we could produce more by means of more animals, but since 1939 the stock numbers in South Africa have remained more or less constant, and we have produced more by means of a higher yield per animal and also a higher yield per morgen. That should be our basic premise for future production. From time to time hon. members on the opposite side bring it to the attention of the House that our stock numbers remain constant. That is not at issue; we should think along the lines of a higher yield per animal and a higher yield per morgen or per unit of land.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>That demonstrates the ignorance of that hon. member in respect of stock. How are we to increase the stock numbers&#x003F; Must we overgraze our land&#x003F; Must we keep more animals on our land and get a lower yield&#x003F; I just want to tell that hon. member that in 1948 we slaughtered approximately 1,000,000 head of cattle out of a stock of approximately 12,000,000. In 1965 we slaughtered approximately 2,000,000 head of cattle out of a stock of approximately 12,000,000. If the hon. member looked at the total yield in terms of pounds or tons of meat produced, he would see that we had virtually doubled the yield. If we have regard to the two basic aspects of production stimulation, and not only to numerical increases, we would even double this yield. Then it will no longer be feared that we shall not be able to produce enough milk and meat in this country. In future South Africa will then become an exporting country as regards meat, as well as being able to supply our country with meat. But then we should have regard to the two basic principles.</p>

<p>I do not want to discuss marketing and prices to-night, because those are not at issue in this regard, but I want to discuss two aspects that do relate to this debate. In order to obtain a higher yield, the genetic constitution of the animal that has to yield the products should have a potential enabling it to produce the maximum, and that animal&#x2019;s feeding should be increased to the maximum in order that the high potential inherent in its genetic constitution could be realized to the maximum. We must therefore have regard to these two aspects. The feeding aspect is of basic importance, and there is a very good English proverb in this regard: &#x201C;The breeding of cattle is half the feeding thereof.&#x201D; It is important that even if one has animals with the very best genetic constitution and the highest potential, but one fails to feed those animals properly, one cannot achieve the optimum production, and it is therefore essential that we should devote the utmost attention to the feeding aspect. If we consider the quantity of meat lost in this country every year as a result of loss of weight during our winter months, we realize that if we could only eliminate that, we should be able to produce much more meat in future. If we take it that every animal loses 100 lbs. during the winter months, and we see that in terms of the 12,000,000 animals, then it equals thousands of pounds, and it is therefore important that we should devote the utmost attention to that aspect. The other aspect which should receive our attention is the breeding of stock&#x2014;to breed and to select our animals in order to obtain the maximum yield. I see hazards in our present method of stock breeding, a method on which our future milk and meat production depends. At present, if we breed animals for specific characteristics we select with a view to those, and it then takes three or more generations to fix in such an animal the characteristics with a view to which we select. At present there are cattle breeds bred for specific purposes. Firstly, to produce meat, and secondly to produce milk. These breeds have been selected and built up over the years. We now find that in South Africa virtually all the cattle breeds one can imagine, occur. I think there are more or less 25 breeds of cattle in South Africa. Every time we hear of a new breed of cattle, we import it regardless of whether or not it is suited to our conditions. Higher production can be obtained by means of breeding and selection within the same breed, and by thus fixing the desired characteristics, but what is done at present&#x003F; The new scientific approach is cross-breeding, namely to cross two pure strains in order to obtain the optimum production. I have no objection to that, but we should emphasize that cross-breeding should not be carried to extremes. Previously there was cross-breeding of two pure strains, and to-day we even have the triangle crossbreeding recommended by some of the officers of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. And this cross-breeding is being developed more and more. I want to ask to-night whether we are not mongrelizing our cattle. Are we not perhaps mongrelizing that inherent genetic constitution for which pure strains of animals were bred over the years&#x003F; We may derive a short-term benefit in the first generation, but instead of the first generation being marketed, it forms the major part of our cattle stock, and these so-called nondescript cattle are now becoming the majority in this country. It is therefore essential that in future we should take note of that, and that we should afford some protection to the breeders who breed these animals for us, and that there should be uniformity in the extension work in respect of milk and meat production. We should not cross-breed our beef cattle with our dairy cattle. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the serious approach adopted by this House to the concept of soil conservation was <span class="col_3769-3770" refersTo="page_0464"/>clearly reflected by various hon. members who took part in this debate. If we consider the scope of this problem and we see what is said in the annual report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, in the opening paragraph on this question, then one is in full agreement. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although a tremendous amount of work still has to be done before soil reclamation and conservation will have attained the extent and speed which will make it possible for the soil and veld deterioration to be checked on a nation-wide basis, good progress has nevertheless been made annually.</block>

<p>It gives rise to concern that after 20 years it should still be said that this process of veld deterioration has been checked, and that despite all the good work done by the Department and the wonderful efforts of our farming community to achieve that object. One wonders whether this process should not be carried further. I am convinced that soil conservation is no longer the task merely of the farmer and the people directly involved in the problem. In the introduction to the report of the Soil Conservation Board we see the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board has realized once again that all facets of soil and water conservation are matters of real national interest closely affecting every inhabitant of the Republic. The destruction and deterioration of these vitally important resources indeed endangers the future of the country as a whole. The protection of the soil is not the responsibility merely of the farming community and of the State, but of the entire population. Our youth particularly should be imbued and inspired with love of the soil and everything associated with it; without such love there cannot really be any true patriotism.</block>

<p>We are aware of the fact that the Department is working industriously to draw the youth into this programme of soil conservation. We are aware of the Land Service movement, but we ask that more should be done in that respect and that our youth organizations, such as the Voortrekkers, the Boy Scouts and others, should be drawn into the soil conservation movement.</p>

<p>Soil conservation is no longer merely a physical process of filling up ditches, erecting fences and building dams. It is much more. It requires a certain code of conduct, a specific approach and a specific attitude towards the soil. In other words, what it actually amounts to is a specific outlook in respect of our soil. If one bears in mind that the soil is not ours to do with as we wish, but that we are merely holding it in trust for posterity, one becomes truly aware of the tremendous responsibility resting on this generation, to conserve the soil in such a way that it will be an asset and not a burden to posterity. As we are called upon to defend our country on the battlefields, as we are called upon to defend our national heritage against the intrusion of alien ideologies, each of us is also called upon to do our share in the conservation of our soil. All possible means must be employed irt this regard, and I therefore plead that this idea of soil conservation should also be brought home to our youth and that, if necessary, it should even be included in our school syllabus. Unabashed and without making any apology, I want to say that we should indoctrinate our youth with this concept of soil conservation. In saying that I am merely attaching the common meaning to the word &#x201C;indoctrinate&#x201D;. [Interjections.] I am making no apologies for the fact that I am using the word &#x201C;indoctrinate&#x201D;, because the matter affects our existence and our survival on this soil in the highest degree.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, has it not also become time to draw in our non-White labourers on the farms as far as this soil conservation work is concerned&#x003F; They are the people who wander about on the farms; they are the people who trample out footpaths; they are the people who eradicate the natural vegetation for firewood; they may perhaps be the first to spot the minute beginnings of erosion on our land. Has it not become time for us to give them very elementary lectures to make them aware of this concept of soil conservation&#x003F; Has it not become time to use simple cartoon strips to bring it home to these non-White labourers that there is such a thing as soil conservation, so that they may warn their employers if the first signs appear&#x003F; They should also understand why certain soil conservation jobs are carried out on those farms. I think we may fruitfully draw those people into the programme of soil conservation. Finally I should like to bring a matter to the attention of the Minister, namely the procedure followed in the prosecution of people who do not comply with the requirements of the Soil Conservation Act. Far be it from me to suggest that the concept of soil conservation should be implemented by means of court orders and criminal actions. I do not think the solution to the problem should be sought along those lines. Unfortunately there are some, however, those who are recalcitrant, who must be forced by means of the Act to carry out soil conservation. It is encouraging to read the following in the annual report of the Soil Conservation Board&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As may be seen from Table 4 considerably more prosecutions were instituted during the past year than during the previous year; namely 20 as against 10. Some cases are still pending, but five have already been successfully disposed of.</block>

<p>If I consider that there are more than 900 committees, it appears to me as though this number of prosecutions was somewhat low. In my view there is a very sound reason for that. In practice one finds that the committees have to submit those cases to the public prosecutor, and that they are also responsible for handling a case during the proceedings of the court. Many of those people experience practical problems in carrying out those tasks. Firstly, good friends of theirs are frequently <span class="col_3771-3772" refersTo="page_0465"/>involved; relatives may perhaps be involved. To obviate these difficulties there should be a stage in the entire process when the officials of the Department&#x2014;and specifically its technical personnel&#x2014;should take over the matter, so that these technical personnel will then be responsible for handling the case in court, rather than the members of the district committee involved.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we cannot be thankful enough for the work done by those district committees. We should rather adopt the premise that the work should be positively directed towards soil conservation, and that the court proceedings should be left in the hands of the technical personnel, i.e. in the hands of people who are not as directly involved in the community as the members of the district committee. I want to bring one further matter, which is perhaps of a more local nature, to the attention of the Minister. We expect that we shall receive the water of the Orange River in the Fish River Valley within four or five years. In that area the Department of Land Tenure owns a considerable deal of land which is bought from farmers as uneconomic units. We want to ask whether it is not possible, before the scheme is completed, to establish experiment stations in the three climatic regions of the Fish River Valley in order to conduct experiments with the type of crops that can be grown there when water arrives. Mr. Chairman, until now that valley has been used exclusively for growing lucerne. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope at a later stage to deal with the suggestion by the hon. member for Cradock which I support that there should be an experimental station for the Fish River Valley. I also hope to deal at a later stage with the point raised by the hon. member for Karas about production per annum. I was dealing with the question of the shortage of State veterinarians. We also have a very serious shortage&#x2014;in fact an even more serious shortage&#x2014;of veterinarians in private practice. Of the 426 veterinarians on the register as private veterinarians in our country, approximately two-thirds practise in the cities. One cannot blame them for this, because they find practice more remunerative and their work easier in the cities. But there they are disparagingly referred to sometimes as cat and dog doctors. However, the point is that they are not available to the farming community. The fact that one has to get a private veterinarian. particularly if one is a stud farmer with valuable animals, over a distance of 40 or 50 or 60 miles or more in itself pushes up the cost of veterinary services to the agricultural producer to a tremendous amount. Mr. Chairman, we in this country are paying a terrible price for the toll which stock diseases take of our animal livestock. In the year 1959-60 some 364.000 cattle died of stock diseases and approximately 1,283,000 sheep and goats. That excludes the figure for other farming livestock such as horses and pigs and so on. At a very conservative estimate it amounts to over R20,000,000 per annum. It also excludes the losses where animals became sick and subsequently recovered. It also excludes the question of these so-called erosion diseases and also diseases like tuberculosis and vibrio.</p>

<p>There has been a certain degree of improvement as regards this question of the training of veterinarians, the intake at Onderstepoort, for example, having been raised a few years ago from 30 to 45. Mr. Chairman, we should certainly not be misled by that fact, i.e. the intake having been raised from 30 to 45, to think that we are going to have 45 freshly-trained veterinarians turned out by Onderstepoort every year. In an answer to a question by the hon. member for East London (City) earlier this Session, the hon. the Minister revealed that the output from Onderstepoort of trained veterinarians was as follows: 23 in 1963, 33 in 1964, and 23 again in 1965. Dr. H. P. Steyn, the chairman of the South African Veterinary Medical Association, when he opened the congress of the Eastern Province branch of that association during August, said that 20 per cent of the students failed to qualify at Onderstepoort, and of those who do qualify a high percentage do not practise in this country.</p>

<p>With men retiring, leaving the country and dying, he continued, there is an annual wastage of about 13 men. If we take the average output at Onderstepoort&#x2014;it is fairly high, namely about 30&#x2014;we find that the number of veterinarians is being increased by only 17 per year. In the meantime, however, the numbers of sheep have increased exceedingly rapidly over the last few years. According to the South African Wool Board, they have increased from 39.000,000 in 1963 to 43,500,000 in 1966. On the other hand, our cattle population is static. I think that it is common cause that we will have to increase that cattle population very rapidly if we are to feed the growing numbers of our people adequately.</p>

<p>The advent of the Orange River project will mean a great increase in the numbers of stock in our country. Because of those two reasons alone, we will need more veterinarians, over and above the present number. Dr. Steyn has said that we can expect to have about 685 veterinarians&#x2014;I take it that he refers to private veterinarians&#x2014;in 1985. But he has estimated the required number at double that amount, namely 1,370. This high figure is still not even as high as some other authorities have estimated. For example Dr. Stampa, the chief of the Veterinary Field Research Station of the West German chemical firm Farben-fabriken-Bayer A.G., at Grahamstown&#x2014;not just for South Africa, but also for the whole of Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the part of the Far East in the Southern Hemisphere&#x2014;has estimated this figure in respect of the number of veterinarians needed at 1,500. He has based his estimate on the numbers they have in West Germany itself. There, although their pig population is two to three times that of the Southern African pig <span class="col_3773-3774" refersTo="page_0466"/>population, their cattle population is approximately the same and their sheep population is only one-tenth of ours. They also have virtually no goats at all, while we have a very large goat population: Whereas we have approximately 426 veterinarians, in West Germany they have no fewer than 8,700 veterinarians. The effect of this, and of other factors as well, I will admit, namely climatic factors, is that they are able to operate at a much higher level of efficiency.</p>

<p>In regard to the point raised by the hon. member for Karas, the number of calves they raise is very much higher in West Germany than it is in our country. It is not only West Germany which has taken adequate steps to ensure a sufficient number of veterinarians. Other countries like Australia are aware of this danger. Australia is planning to double its number of veterinarians within ten years. We need these veterinarians not only to cope with our increasing stock numbers, but we also need them very urgently in order to bring our production costs down in those sections of the agricultural industry where prices are not rising. I refer particularly to the wool industry where prices have gone up and down, but in 1964 were actually lower than they were in 1948. In that regard the farmer&#x2019;s only salvation, if he is going to continue to make a reasonable living out of his farming enterprise, is to cut his costs. It is essential that he should have adequate veterinary services available to him.</p>

<p>The question arises whether the present veterinary faculties can cope with the need for more veterinarians. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor took up a fairly strong attitude in regard to this matter. He said that Onderstepoort could be expanded still more. The Minister&#x2019;s predecessor in this House represents the constituency of Oudtshoorn which is noted for ostriches. The ostrich is a bird which, when it does not want to see what is going on around it, hides its head in the sand. I hope the present Minister is going to keep an open mind in regard to this matter and that he will be prepared to be guided by expert opinion. We welcome the fact, as stated in a reply by the hon. the Minister, that the Dean of the faculty of Veterinary Science at Pretoria has appointed a study committee to determine the Republic&#x2019;s needs for veterinarians as well as the number of students to be admitted annually to Onderstepoort. I hope that when he replies the hon. the Minister will give us more details of that committee. I think that this is a matter of more importance than merely the appointment of a committee by the Dean of the particular faculty. It is a matter which concerns the whole of the country. None the less, I say that we welcome it. Is it not perhaps that we need a completely new faculty&#x003F; There are strong reasons in favour of pleading for a separate faculty of veterinary science. Onderstepoort was originally founded to find the answer to the horse sickness problem. It found the answer. The veterinarians turned out by Onderstepoort and the research work that is done there have very rightly become world famous. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to make some observations on the stock-carrying capacity and its improvement as regards regions in the north-western Free State and related intensive Highveld sowing regions. In my view it is most essential that the stock-carrying capacity in these regions should be increased, because grain farmers are experiencing great difficulties there. Strengthening the stock factor is most important with a view to introducing greater stability in farming in these regions. In my view this is also in the interests of the country, because the rainfall in these regions is more normal than in the Bushveld regions, for example, where large stretches of land had to be withdrawn from grazing. As far as grazing is concerned, it is essential that the stock factor should be strengthened in order to balance the national position. Amongst other things, two measures should be taken in order to achieve this object. Our natural veld grazing should be improved. Unfortunately it so happens that at present red dust storms occur in the north-western Free State every day. The tragedy is that most of this dust does not come from our fields, but from the bare veld. The primary causes of the dust storms on the veld are droughts and termites. I do not want to discuss termites at length, but I want to say that the spraying which is done at present is not the final solution. I want to plead for a crash programme of concentrated research in this regard. I also want to plead that we should relinquish the fixed idea that there should be financing only if we have a country-wide pest. We should also introduce the concept of a regional pest. Maximum financing and subsidizing should be provided for regional pests, too.</p>

<p>Something which in my view is receiving very little attention is the question of fertilizing the veld. Little is done in this regard. I remember the results of a certain series of experiments which were published and which were most discouraging. But is that adequate reason to surrender&#x003F; In a moment I shall mention certain results from Australia which in my view suggest that we should give more consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>There is the further question of growing fodder crops on dry land. Here I want to plead for more intensive research into drought resistant green feed types and leguminous fodder. It may sound rather theoretical to suggest that we should devote further intensive research to this matter, but I should like to quote what Dr. K. van der Walt of Onderstepoort said recently with reference to his visit to Australia. He made the following statement in a paper which he read before the 60th Scientific Conference of the S.A. Veterinary Medical Society under the title &#x201C;Pasture improvement&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For a comparatively small research investment on pasture improvement, the re-suits <span class="col_3775-3776" refersTo="page_0467"/>have so far contributed;, an extra 30,0,000 sheep to the total population, i.e; more than 50 per cent of the overall increase, In addition, it is estimated that the nitrogen fixed by legumes annually amounts to A&#x00A3;1,600,000,000 worth of fertilizer, and an average increase of five bushels of wheat per acre has also resulted from increased soil fertility.</block>

<p>This learned gentleman also made the interesting statement that they had found a largely unknown and insignificant leguminous plant called notononis in the veld in the vicinity of Worcester. Because they had discovered the right rhizobium in Australia with which to graft this leguminous plant, they changed this insignificant and unknown leguminous plant into an excellent legume which is producing wonderful results in Australia. I admit, Sir, that in certain regions of Australia the veld and climatic conditions are better than here, but large stretches of land there are similar to ours as regards climatic and evaporation conditions, winter conditions, etc. In view of the fact that they have achieved such tremendous successes in these two fields, it is in my view a matter of urgent necessity that we should give further attention to this matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Sir, I want to endorse a further plea made by Dr. Van der Walt in this paper. In view of the research conducted into the improvement of grazing and stock in both countries, he advocated the exchange of more post-graduate students between Australia and South Africa. By doing so we may best exchange valuable information through channels which will be quite inexpensive for both countries.</p>

<from>*Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. P. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>A great deal can be said about agriculture and a great deal has been said. Although some of the hon. members painted a very sombre picture of agriculture, it also has an attractive side. If one looks at the rain and one breathes that delightful scent and one looks at the earth, at the golden grain and at the heavy burden of the vine, and if one looks at the frisky stock, one is inclined to become lyrical and then one should like to sing the praises of those scenes in poetic language, the language which the hon. member for Waterberg can employ so skilfully and masterfully. But what is the real position&#x003F; Let me put it this way. In reality a severe struggle for the survival of a large section of our nation lies behind those scenes. It is not a struggle against the Government, nor is it a struggle of the individual. It is a struggle between the farmer and science, on the one side, and the mighty elements of nature on the other, and this is where the State can and should help. But in the midst of all the representations we have made here, we have lost sight of one aspect, which is the following. I should like to express my sincere gratitude to the remembrance of the late Dr. Verwoerd for the commission of inquiry which he appointed to investigate all facets of farming.</p>

<p>We as farmers are grateful for that, and we expect a great deal of that commission.</p>

<p>As farmers, we have to maintain a certain standard of living, and we can do so only on soil which is well-preserved. A great deal was said about soil conservation to-night, and even during previous debates. I want to endorse all of that and associate myself with it. We plead for more knowledge and more extension work, etc., but even if we have all those things, there are further means which we should make available to the farmer to enable him to carry out that soil conservation work. Allow me to make a few observations, not in opposition to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy, but observations which may perhaps make a contribution to the further planning of agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>It may be a tall order, but I feel that with a view to the future the solution will be cheaper power for agriculture in South Africa. It will also be the key to all the industrial development in this country. What I mean by cheaper power is not merely fixed power such as coal, but electric power and electronic power, and even atomic power can be harnessed for the purposes of agriculture. Agriculture has more problems than any other industry in the country, and we therefore need sound knowledge and determination to make agriculture hold its own in our country. If we want to apply soil conservation in the true sense of the word, we must do so mainly by mechanical means, and for that we need cheap power. The burdens that are resting on agriculture even now are so severe that under the present circumstances a farmer cannot carry out his soil conservation works or projects whilst bearing other burdens as well. If we enable him to do so by making cheaper implements and power available to him, he can make better use of his opportunities.</p>

<p>Let us consider just one aspect of soil conservation, namely irrigation. A great deal of the land under irrigation at present slopes so badly that one cannot allow flow irrigation, because the top soil would wash away and only the sterile soil would remain. The only way to irrigate such land is by means of sprinkler irrigation, but the present system of mechanical power makes sprinkler irrigation far too expensive, and it is therefore the duty of the State to see to it that our farmers get cheaper power. It is well known that agriculture cannot compete with the State or with industry or with commerce in the labour market, and in time to come we as farmers will be compelled to mechanize as far as possible, and in order to do so we must have cheaper power. The next point is better planning. If we want to plan a farm, we should not merely consider the possible farming potential of that land, but there must also be further investigation, and planning should be undertaken on that basis. We should also consider the geographic situation of that land and we should consider the topographic character, or the character of the soil, and we should also consider its hydrological composition. We <span class="col_3777-3778" refersTo="page_0468"/>should consider the condition of that land, not only for the present, but with a view to times of great droughts such as the one we are experiencing at present, and droughts will come again. Allow me to quote what an Australian Minister said about droughts&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The two great buffers against drought are irrigation and conservation, and I suppose we can say that of-these irrigation is of first importance. While there are, I know, many producers who cannot draw forth sufficient water to irrigate their properties, there are others who are not making full use of the adequate water and other resources they have available. The No. 2 buffer is conservation and it can be said that conservation forms a two-pronged defence against drought, for by conserving moisture in the soil the producer ensures plant growth when rain is scarce, and by conserving fodder he provides feed for livestock when paddocks are bare.</block>

<p>This is merely a wise man saying what may be done. [Interjections.] This fodder-bank business reminds one of the old days when the Opposition was always saying:</p>

<p>&#x201C;Buy British to help the Empire.&#x201D; They will persist with these fodder banks, but they themselves do not understand it at all. I could reply to that at length, but that would take up my precious time. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>In my view there is a further measure we should take in order to promote agriculture, and that is to provide better labour. In the past the farmer had to rely on the poorest labour in the country. All the good labourers on the farms moved away to the mines and the industries because they could earn more there, and perhaps because these could offer them more amusements. The labourers were inclined to move to the cities where they were told and perhaps also shown such fine things. Now we are stuck with the Mantatis, as this hon. member calls them, who are absolutely hopeless. I feel that some system or other should be introduced to enable us to train our labourers so that they will be more productive, in order that the farmer may get along with fewer labourers. If he has cheap power and has mechanized and has better labour, the farmer will not apply to the Minister every so often for higher prices for his produce, because then his production costs will be lower and he will be a greater asset to the economy of South Africa.</p>

<p>I come to the end of my story. [Interjection.] Surely we should pay tribute for what has been done for us. I know the Opposition does not like that. In the short while I have been involved in politics I have noticed that whenever one gets up and pays tribute to the Government or to the officials who have rendered good services, the Opposition does not like that.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When the hon. member for Lydenburg was speaking here, I counted the benches three times to see whether he had not moved two places. He spoke the language of the Opposition in regard to the better planning which was necessary in agriculture, and he must excuse me, but I am j; going to agree with him. But I cannot devote i any more time to him since my time is too valuable.</p>

<p>When this Vote was put last night, I started talking about the sheep and wool industry, and I should like to continue with that to-night. The Minister himself is a wool farmer and knows what drought is, and for that reason it is easier to talk to him in this regard. I want to repeat in brief what I said the other night, namely that in two countries we know of they succeeded in almost doubling their wool production over the past decade, whereas ours remained static. I should like to adopt the following approach to the matter, namely that the only way in which we can hold up wool to the world and encourage its consumption, is to produce a percentage which is relatively-speaking not less than our present production. At this stage our wool production in respect of clothing fibres meets only between 10 and 11 per cent of the world&#x2019;s requirements. If the other countries could succeed in increasing their production to such an extent, it is our duty to increase production in this country to such an extent that in time to come our production of clothing fibres will not merely represent a minimal percentage. and so that we may not be forgotten in the great international market. It is in fact for that cardinal reason, i.e. the international market, that it is so necessary to increase wool production in this country. The other day I saw in a newspaper that on the occasion of opening a conference the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing said that he wanted to encourage the farmers to produce more wool per unit. I want to react to that by saying that it is only possible if one gives the animal good food. I should like to deal with that at a later stage, and then I want to say that if it was possible for Australia to increase their foreign exchange from R300,000,000 to R600,000,000 over a decade, and if it was possible in the case of New Zealand to increase it from R100,000,000 to R200,000,000, then it ought to be possible to do something about our wool production in order to increase it from the average R100,000,000, where it has stood for a period of years, to an earning of more foreign exchange, because it is a valuable product from which many of the country&#x2019;s farmers are making a livelihood, the sheep and wool industry. What methods can we apply in order to increase the production of wool&#x003F; The hon. member for Albany has repeatedly spoken about veterinary services. I want to say that we should start with the health of the livestock and see whether we cannot combat diseases more effectively. That will be one method by which we can increase wool production in that we shall then have more animals. I do not want to say much more about that since <span class="col_3779-3780" refersTo="page_0469"/>a great deal has already been said about veterinary services, but I should like to ask the Minister whether the statement made by one of his senior officials at the opening of the Agricultural Congress of the Cape Province, is correct. Dr. Du Plessis pointed out that only 6.4 per cent professional posts were vacant at present, whereas no vacancies existed for veterinary surgeons. If we have reached the stage where there are no longer any vacancies for veterinary surgeons in our public service, whilst the ratio between our veterinary surgeons and our stock population is as poor as it is at present, I do not know. I do not want to blame the State for that, but the position is that the ratio between our veterinary surgeons and our stock population is very poor, even with our small neighbouring states. Far more veterinary surgeons ought to be appointed, if we can obtain their services. The position is that in regard to many diseases such as pulpy kidney, tribulosis and so many others sufficient research has not even been carried out as yet, but the Minister is aware of the damage this is causing to our livestock. He knows how scarce veterinary surgeons are and how few of them are available when there is a sudden outbreak of stock disease. I mention this as one method by which we can increase our wool production.</p>

<p>As a second point I want to mention the improvement of our grazing, and I want to follow up the point made by the hon. member for Kroonstad. He spoke about crops on dry land. I want to speak about its other aspect, and that is crops which are suitable for high rainfall regions. I want to tell the Minister that a virtual miracle has taken place in the region extending from Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass to Mossel Bay. It is no use telling the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing that in those regions where grazing is good and where rotation grazing is applied on lucerne, wheat and lupin lands, the production per unit has increased and that on an average those farmers are getting 16 pounds of wool from ewes and lambs and 23 pounds from wethers. I do not think that sheep are capable of yielding more wool; I do not think that one can expect more wool from a sheep. But then I want to tell the Minister that the position becomes worse north of that point, i.e. Mossel Bay. Up to Mossel Bay improved grazing is good, but from there up to the Transkei, including the entire Drakensberg mountain range practically nothing has been done in that regard. The Minister can go and have a look at the wonderful experiments they have carried out at Dohne in regard to the cultivation of lucerne, but the way it is done at state institutions was too expensive for the farmer, but we shall know how to adjust it to our circumstances. But, do you know. Sir, that from Alexandria up to the Transkei and in the direction of Elliot and Maclear there are very few cultivated lucerne lands&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to plead with the Minister that he should instruct his extension officers to encourage people to increase the production of this earner of foreign exchange, wool, by encouraging these people to improve grazing conditions in order that the veld may carry more sheep so that the sheep they have may yield more wool. Then we shall also be in a position, in the not too distant future, where we may boast of having increased our wool clip from 1,000,000 bales to 2,000,000 bales.</p>

<p>I know what can be achieved by means of improved grazing because I have seen its effects in so many countries and in our own country as well. We have seen that in countries with an average rainfall of 30 inches the carrying capacity per morgen increased from 2 morgen to 12 morgen in respect of varieties of clover grass, clover roughage and lucerne&#x2014; and all my life, I have advocated the cultivation of lucerne since it has always yielded the highest production per morgen. But I shall leave that matter to the State, its research officers and its extension officers so that they may carry out research with a view to determining the best grazing for our higher rainfall regions, which are hundreds and thousands of morgen in extent.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Albany said here in connection with a very important matter. I am grateful that he spoke in that direction for now I need not reply to what he had said and can say something more in connection with the shortage of veterinary surgeons we are experiencing at present. What is even more important, however, is the shortage of veterinary surgeons we are going to experience towards the end of this century, and I am glad that it is possible for me to express a few ideas on this matter to-night. I just want to subscribe to what the hon. member said in connection with this shortage and I want to do so on the basis of an address by Professor Grosskopf to the S.A. Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns. If we make a comparison we find that 3,684 veterinary surgeons in France are expected to care for 5,400 head of large stock and 4,820 head of small stock each. In Canada, which is perhaps comparable with us, 1,600 veterinary surgeons have to care for 6,000 head of large stock and just under 4,000 head of small stock. But in South Africa we have the position that 400 veterinary surgeons have to care for 30,000 head of laree stock and 110,000 head of small stock. We appreciate the contribution these people have made. We are highly appreciative that they have enabled us to achieve what we have achieved in the field of animal husbandry, but it is very clear to us that we shall have to make provision in the near future for improving our training facilities for veterinary surgeons so that we may be able to supply the demands which will be made on this profession towards the end of the century. I just want to tell the hon. the Minister that on the basis of the 45 students who can be enrolled at present, we shall only have 1,000 veterinary surgeons at our disposal towards the end of this century. If we increase this <span class="col_3781-3782" refersTo="page_0470"/>number to 70, as the previous Minister once announced, we shall have a mere 1,400 veterinary surgeons only at the end of the century. With the information at our disposal&#x2014;I do not wish to elaborate on this for I do not have the time to do so&#x2014;we shall need at least twice that number.</p>

<p>This brings me to an important opinion I want to advance and bring to the notice of the Minister. We want to plead with the hon. the Minister and every organization concerned in this matter to accept these opinions in the spirit in which they are given. Right at the outset we want to speak very highly of and refer with appreciation to what Onderstepoort has done both as research institute and as training centre. In doing so we realize that this, coming from us, does not really mean much for we know that Onderstepoort is a world famous institution. However, we have been thinking whether the time has not arrived for us to give consideration to establishing a second training centre in the Republic. We want to make it quite clear that we want to retain Onderstepoort as a research institute in its present form, but, for a number of reasons we want to give, we want to make a serious plea to the Minister whether we should not consider the establishment of a second training centre. One of the most important reasons is the following. We have made an extract and once again we want to plead that this should be accepted in the spirit in which it is given. We have made an extract and because I do not want to bore you, I am merely going to say that of the number of 255 veterinary surgeons who have been trained since 1957, 62 per cent came from the Transvaal, 4 per cent from the Orange Free State, 19 per cent from the Cape Province, 4 per cent from Natal, 3 per cent from South West Africa and 6 per cent from Rhodesia. But what does not seem quite right to me from a practical point of view is the following fact and to me it is quite clear why this is so for it is true that a training institution draws its students from the vicinity in which it is situated. This fact simply is, with every respect to these students, that <i>44</i> per cent of this number of 255 students who eventually qualified, came from the Johannesburg-Pretoria area. In other words, they were students who were drawn from the tarred roads of our metropolitan areas, people &#x2014;and once again J am saying this with the greatest respect because we do not want to offend anyone&#x2014;who do not understand the position of the stock farmer as the hon. member for Albany, the Minister and others amongst us do and who do not have that feeling for the task they have to perform. I believe this to be one of the reasons why we sneak of cat and dog doctors. We do not hold it against those people because we must all make a living, but we are saying that if we can also have a training centre somewhere else, with the full co-operation of the existing institution. we shall draw students from other vicinities, from the rural areas as well. I just want to make it quite clear to the hon. the Minister that it is not my intention at all to advise him where this second training centre should be situated, apart from saying that such a training centre should be established at a university having a faculty of agriculture. For this reason I feel at liberty to say that if it is humanly possible it should be established at the University of the Orange Free State. However, we do not want to say too much in this connection because if my telling the Minister where it should be established should harm the cause, I want no part of it. Therefore I say that if that place is not acceptable, I may confidently recommend the University of Stellenbosch because these two institutions do have the necessary faculties of agriculture as well as the necessary clinical material. I am one of those who believes that one cannot create clinical material but at both these institutions&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Stellenbosch will agree with me that the Orange Free State is leading with a short-head&#x2014;we have an abundance of clinical material, with special reference to the sheep population surrounding these institutions, which is not available at other existing institutions at present.

<p>Where the hon. member for Smithfield spoke of the large number of veterinary surgeons who came from the tarred roads of the cities, I, as a representative of the tarred roads, make bold to participate in this debate.</p>

<p>The biggest asset of a country is its soil and the biggest asset of a nation is its growing youth. A nation which does not give attention to these two principal components is doomed to erosion. Various hon. members here said a good deal about soil erosion and soil conservation. Especially lately, during these times in which our country is being devastated by the worst drought in our memory, we have all come to an increased realization of this threat to our country. We have also come to realize that the soil does not belong to those who make a living from it only, but to all of us. Therefore the soil does not belong to the farmer only, but also to the city-dweller. Last year we knelt down in prayer together because we realized that our soil did not merely feed the farmer but also the city-dweller. For this reason the conservation of our soil is of as much importance to the city-dweller as to the farmer. The view has been expressed here very clearly that a more intensive effort should be made to conserve our soil. I should like to quote from <i>Georganiseerde Landbou</i> what the Cape Agricultural Union advocated in this connection (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An ardent plea for the promotion of the land service movement was made at the congress of the Cape Agricultural Union by certain members, and Dr. S. J. du Plessis of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services said in reply to representations that everything possible was being done to reach the young people.</block>

<p><span class="col_3783-3784" refersTo="page_0471"/>Mr. Chairman, we have come to realize that our soil cannot be replaced. I should like to quote certain examples. In times when things are going well and we have an average rainfall, 400,000,000 tons of our best soil are washed away annually either to the sea or to man-made storage dams. We know how great the danger is of our dams silting up. A few years ago already the Vaal Dam had 45,000 morgen feet of silt. Lake Arthur, in the immediate vicinity of which I grew up, is silted up. We cannot replace our soil but we can retain it. We are all aware that we are dependent on our soil and I now come to the second component I have mentioned, namely our youth. We are all aware that erosion is taking place on a large scale. Fifty years ago the land service idea was born from the necessity of combining the two components I have mentioned, namely the soil and the youth, to achieve a nation-building ideal. For this reason the land service movement is endeavouring to teach the youth the right attitude towards the soil and the conservation of our natural resources and also to guard against the spiritual erosion of our youth. What is the aim of the land service movement&#x003F; Its aim is not only to create a love for the soil amongst the youth but also to promote a love for labour amongst the youth. I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, that the youth are more prepared to-day than ever before to serve their country. Yesterday I had the privilege of being present at a land service camp attended by 500 youths. They are prepared to work and they are also aware of the erosion of our soil. They also realize that the soil we are leaving to them, they will have to leave to their children. For this reason I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that we should give all possible assistance and every encouragement to this land service movement, whereby, on the one hand, we can help and guide the youth and, on the other hand, make contribution to retaining our soil for ourselves and for future generations.</p>

<p>If ever there was any reason for indoctrination, to which the hon. member for Cradock referred a short while ago, there is reason now to start indoctrinating certain members of the Opposition so that they may start loving our soil.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the point I was making. What we want to do for the youth is only that which they themselves would like to do; they would like to work; they would like to co-operate; they would like to be together; they would like to relax and most important of all, they would like to do something they know they can do. They are already inspired with the idea that the soil belongs to them and that they have to leave it to future generations. Therefore we must give them that opportunity by extending these land service camps; not only through developing the camping idea but through developing the entire idea that soil erosion must be arrested. The youth would like to assist in arresting it and under the guidance of adults they can try to avert this danger. The youth, too, would like to make a real, productive contribution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield, the previous speaker, stressed the importance of having more veterinary surgeons. Where we are shortly embarking on the fine Orange River Scheme, I should like to advance the following opinion. Will our children, who will one day inherit this scheme, not have cause to reproach us that the dam wall needs to be heightened by them because the dam has silted up&#x003F; Is it not a fine idea that we should mobilize our youth even now and that they should receive the specific instruction to see to it that this beautiful dam does not become a white elephant in 50 or 100 years&#x2019; time&#x003F; They would like to make their contribution so as to ensure that that does not happen.</p>

<p>I would like to say how pleased I am that so many hon. members have taken the opportunity in this debate to emphasize the important role that soil conservation must play in our present-day approach to matters appertaining to agriculture. I would particularly like to associate myself with the hon. member for Cradock. Many of the views that he expressed here are, I think, extremely sound, and I would say that many of those views are views which have often been expressed here by this side of the House. I would also like to endorse the views expressed by the hon. member for Brentwood. I think he has raised an important point here in pleading that we should educate not only our youth but our entire population to realize the importance of soil conservation in this country. I believe that not only is it an important duty of the State but I would say that it is an extremely important duty of the Press to take up this matter in the best way possible. Obviously soil conservation is not a very exciting subject, and I personally feel that the Press is not playing its full part in getting across to the public how serious this question of soil erosion is in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, earlier in this debate my colleague, the hon. member for Gardens, said that we should declare war on soil erosion. I could not agree with him more. I believe this is a matter of such urgency that the term &#x201C;declaring war&#x201D; is absolutely appropriate. I think this is a pertinent time in our history to ask ourselves whether we are winning the battle against soil erosion. In trying to decide this issue there are two ways of looking at this problem. First of all we can study the information available to us in all the very excellent reports that we get from the Department of Agriculture, from the Soil Conservation Board, and I hasten to say that those reports are very excellent. I think they give a very excellent outline of all the activities of the many facets of technical research that is being so ably undertaken in this country. I think it is clear from those reports that the authorities who are concerned with research problems in the field of agriculture <span class="col_3785-3786" refersTo="page_0472"/>are realizing the main problems that confront us in this particular field of winning the battle against soil erosion. Obviously the authorities are fully aware of the magnitude of the task. I think they are also aware, as indicated in the latest reports, that there are certain very real shortcomings, and they have high-lighted those shortcomings. I think they also realize that unless we are able to get the full co-operation of the entire farming community in this country, we cannot succeed in calling a halt to the process of soil erosion in this country. They realize more and more that they have to place the greatest trust in the farmers through the various soil conservation district committees. I think they are beginning to realize that unless those people are given posts of responsibility in this great battle, success will never come our way. We are impressed by the fact, which emerges from these reports, that there are some 800 soil conservation districts proclaimed in this country at this stage, and that there are some 34,000 farm plans already completed, but I do not think we should allow these figures to delude us when we draw our final conclusions. What we want is the implementation of farm plans; not farms which are planned, but plans implemented. I think in that respect we are falling far short. I think we are impressed too with the extent to which the State is aiding the farmer by way of subsidies and rebates.</p>

<p>I do not think that we can plead from this side of the House that anything more should be done in that respect. We are left with a fairly impressive picture when we read these reports and see what is being done, but I believe that there is a more practical angle to this whole matter. I believe that as practical farmers we must take a look at this situation; we must do a trip through the country, whether it be by car or in an aeroplane, and then I think we will see a rather dismal picture. The picture that we will see is one of a countryside being rapidly denuded of its vegetation. This vegetation is becoming more and more sparse year after year. Not only is our vegetation becoming more and more sparse but the nature of the vegetation is changing each year. I think many of the older members here will remember the days in the Free State when you had the rolling plains of &#x201C;rooigras&#x201D;, and as you approach Bloemfontein to-day it is a sad and sorry sight to see what encroachment the &#x201C;bitterbossie&#x201D; has made; to see how much of the &#x201C;rooigras&#x201D; has disappeared and to what extent its place is being taken by &#x201C;steekgras&#x201D; and other less useful varieties of grasses. We see too a great deal of sheet erosion and in many of the valleys we see the soil-destroying donga erosion going on unimpeded. I think this picture is one that disappoints one. I believe that some 20 years ago a debate like the very one that we are having here to-night, took place here. As a result of the debate the Soil Conservation Act was passed. I believe that at that time hon. members in this House took a resolution that they would roll up their sleeves and fight this cancer in our agricultural life, but to-day, 20 years later, we must come to the conclusion that we are not winning the battle against soil erosion. Surely there must be something wrong somewhere, and I believe that it is our duty to look into this matter and see where the fault really lies.</p>

<p>In spite of all that is being done, I say that our battle, our campaign, against soil erosion, is being misdirected. We must look into this matter and find out where the fault really lies. I believe that it is not right just to be critical without offering some concrete suggestion to rectify the situation, and the first suggestion I want to offer this evening is this: I believe that many of our efforts in the field of soil conservation are being bogged down by our allowing red tape to invade the technical service division.</p>

<p>Far too much work is being done in offices. I believe that if the well-trained men we have at our disposal could forsake the offices and go out into the countryside and do the job, the results would be far more effective. Sir, I am not speaking from ignorance. I know of many cases where farmers have asked to have their farms planned and where they have had to wait for three years before the plans have been completed and before they have been given the all-clear to carry on with the job. I believe that somehow or other that red tape must be eliminated and the sooner we can do it the better. I believe that it would be a good thing ultimately if all our work could be committed to paper, if the plans of each particular farm could be kept and filed away, if records could be kept and filed, but at the present stage we have not got the manpower to do it.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>It is not an everyday occurrence, Mr. Chairman, that one is afforded the opportunity of addressing this House in the presence of an hon. Deputy Minister and I thank you for this opportunity.</p>

<p>It was with great pleasure that I listened here to-night to the hon. members for Albany and Smithfield, who were in complete agreement in their pleas for additional facilities for the training of veterinary surgeons. Three years ago I made a similar plea here but I did so more specifically in respect of the southern part of the country. I prefer not to link the name of a certain university to this matter now, but in pursuance of what the hon. member for Smith-field said to-night, I once again want to draw attention to the fact that there are two determining factors affecting the establishment of a faculty of veterinary science, namely, in the first place, available clinical material and, in the second place, existing university facilities. I just want to point out that the Western Cape, as regards sheep, is the most densely populated area of the country, especially the grain-farming districts of the Swartland; that some of the major wool-producing districts in the country <span class="col_3787-3788" refersTo="page_0473"/>are to be found in the immediate vicinity of the Western Cape, districts such as Calvinia and others; that some of the largest stud farms for dairy cattle are to be found in the Boland; that milk production is taking place on a large scale in areas surrounding the city; that the poultry industry is developing on a tremendous scale in the Western Cape, that the University of Stellenbosch has the oldest faculty of agriculture in the country and that an additional course, namely animal physiology, is going to be introduced next year. In other words, all facilities are available there and if hon. members agree with me and if the hon. the Minister also agrees with me, then I can have no doubt about where that faculty should be established. A year or more ago the association of veterinary surgeons held its congress in Cape Town and I had the privilege of taking those delegates on a bus tour of the Western Cape, and to-night I should have liked to read to you from the letters I received from some of the delegates, even including professors at Onderstepoort, about the impression the animal factor in the Western Cape made on them.</p>

<p>But to-night I should like to speak about something else, namely the complaint one so often hears about there being too few agricultural extension and research officers. It is said that that is the reason why things are not going as is to be desired in our farming industry. The agricultural extension and research officer can never take over the farmer&#x2019;s task as entrepreneur&#x2014;they can only assist the farmer to make a success of his undertaking&#x2014; and even if there were sufficient extension officers and research officers, their success would depend on the extent to which their work can be brought home to the individual farmer. At present our farmers have to produce on a highly competitive level and I want to go as far as saying that under present circumstances no farmer can afford to operate without the assistance of science, of the research officer and of the extension officer, but the measure of success we shall achieve with the services rendered by these people does not only depend on the Department and its research officers and extension officers, but also on the farmer himself. It has struck me that a fairly dark picture was presented recently about the measure of success being achieved in reaching the farmer through extension services and bringing home to him the results of research. This became evident from a speech made by Prof. Kolbe of the University of Pretoria on the use made by farmers of these services which are at their disposal. He made a survey in 24 districts which concerned 1,500 farmers and came to the following conclusions. More than 70 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s farmers had no knowledge or understanding of an extension officer&#x2019;s work. In knowledge tests on specific practices, such as agronomy for instance, the average percentage was 50 per cent and on mixed farming the average percentage was 40 per cent only. As regards the level of education of that test group, it was shown that only 35 per cent proceeded beyond Standard VIII and that approximately 7 percent only had studied at a university or college; 87 per cent of that test group had not attended any short course in agriculture during the past five years; 38 per cent had not come into contact with an extension officer during the past year; 64 per cent of them had not come into contact with a research officer during that period. It was also evident from the survey that very little time was spent at agricultural meetings on disseminating knowledge of specific agricultural matters and that the farmer&#x2019;s main source of information was his fellow farmer and it also appeared that only 10 per cent of the farmers in that test group was under 30 years of age. In other words, the majority of our farmers is over the age of 30 years. In addition it appeared from the survey that farmers spent very little time on reading. He conceded. however, that in this respect our farmers did not compare unfavourably with farmers in other countries and even with our town-dwellers. In order to overcome these problems, which perhaps do present a dark picture, certain corrective measures are required which must come from the part of the farmer, the part of organized agriculture and from the part of the Department. In the first place I believe that it is necessary to create good relations amongst our farmers and our extension officers and research officers and to inspire the farmer to have confidence in them. Farmers must be made to realize that under present circumstances they can make no progress at all if they do not want to place their trust in the work done by our research officers. In the second place functions of farmers&#x2019; associations and farmers&#x2019; days should be presented more attractively. In this connection I should like to mention as an example the annual farmers&#x2019; day held by the Fruit Research Institute on the experimental farm Bien Donn&#x00E9;. Farmers from all over the country can come to see, apart from the practical things which are presented, how a farmers&#x2019; day should be organized so as to really stimulate the interest of farmers. It is the task of organized agriculture to make agricultural functions and farmers&#x2019; days, where knowledge is to be imparted to the farmer, attractive. They may perhaps do so unobtrusively by giving the necessary guidance as to how such functions should be made attractive. I believe that such functions should not only be an occasion for farmers to air their complaints but should be an opportunity for exchanging information. I believe that enough variety and additional attractions should be arranged at such functions so as to attract our farmers to attend and to bring them into contact with our research officers. I also feel that our departmental agricultural magazines, our technical magazines, may be presented in a more popular form and that the co-operation with public agricultural magazines should be good at all times. If one considers how popular the <i>Landbouweekblad</i> and the <i>Farmer's Weekly</i> have become even in urban areas amongst town-dwellers who yearn for the rural areas and the soil, one realizes in what a popular fashion these magazines present their case. I believe that the radio may also be put to <span class="col_3789-3790" refersTo="page_0474"/>better use, especially by choosing a better time for agricultural programmes. I think most farmers are already at work at half past one or older farmers are having their afternoon rest. I think that the Department is sincere in its desire to bring home to our farmers the work it is doing. Proof of this is to be found in the special attention which is being given to extension courses to train our extension officers for their task and also in the establishment of an institute of agricultural extension. I believe that our research officers should come into personal, direct contact with the farmer more often, and I believe that as regards them a little more attention should be given to the method of imparting their knowledge to the farmer.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a proverb which says, &#x201C;Tell me who your friends are and I shall tell you who you are&#x201D;. That is why I want to remain to-night in the good company of all the hon. members who have discussed the soil conservation question during this debate. Conservation of the soil restores that which has already been destroyed. It is not only our bounden duty, it is a positive deed, and investment for the future, a remunerative investment for posterity. But I do not want to dwell to-night on the normal, known causes of soil destruction or erosion. We know the effects of long-drawn out droughts, of wind and weather, of injudicious farming methods. We know the effects of ex-ploitational farming on the soil. We also know what the effect is of the condition of the soil in or the topography of our country where inclines, which make for washaways, etc., are always present.</p>

<p>To-night I want to emphasize another cause and also bring to the attention of the hon. Minister the increasing process of surface destruction which is being caused by the increasing mining activities in the rural areas where fluorspar, manganese, chrome, diamonds, an-dalusite and other low-grade ores are being exploited. We find striking examples of that in the Western Transvaal and also among the West Coast of the Cape. It immediately places one in the field of the area of contact between mining and agriculture. In this area of contact there has to be clashes, clashes between the interests of the farmer and the interests of the company. That is so because they are title holders to the same piece of land. We have the surface owner of the surface area between the four corner-beacons of his farm and the mining company, or other contract and servitude holders of the subterranean rights between those same four corner-beacons. The latter is obliged to enter and cross that surface area belonging to the farmer in order to get to his property to exercise his rights there and reach his minerals. I have already submitted a reasoned memorandum on this problem to the Departments of Mines, Agricultural Services and also of Planning. I have learnt that discussions on a high level of the principles and recommendations which I set out therein have taken place. But, Sir, there cannot be any further delay with such a pressing matter. I therefore want to bring it to the attention of the hon. the Minister by means of a number of pertinent questions.</p>

<p>My first question to the hon. the Minister is: What responsibility is vested in the companies and other owners of subterranean rights in respect of surface protection and soil restoration, seen from a soil conservation point of view&#x003F; My second question is: Is it the duty of the surface owner to restore the abandoned excavations after the mining company has ceased operations and made its departure&#x003F; My third question is: Is it the duty of the State, by means of its soil conservation department, to follow in the wake of mining companies and rehabilitate the badly-damaged surface area of the farms&#x003F; Fourthly: If mining companies do not want to undertake soil restoration on their own accord, is it not time they were compelled by means of legislation to accept co-responsibility in that respect&#x003F; My last question is: Must a farm which has, on account of mining activities on its surface depreciated to such an extent in value, be written off agriculturally because there is nobody who is really responsible for the restoration of its surface area&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mining, Mr. Chairman, is a transient asset. Sooner or later a mine becomes worked out. The soil is a permanent and eternal asset. The soil is national property&#x2014;it is a national heritage.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Chairman, I am discussing the erosion of the land. I quote, with respect, from a speech made by the hon. Minister Haak, the Minister of Mines, in respect of this matter. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are continually depriving our earth of its riches and I often wonder whether we are in other ways creating sufficient permanent assets to compensate for that. That applies particularly to the mining industry. We are defacing our country side and leaving unsightly empty holes and gravel heaps behind. That is why I believe that the mining industry has a duty to compensate by creating permanent assets &#x2026; There is sometimes the tendency to apply wasteful exploitation without duly considering where it is all leading to.</block>

<p>My case is supported by the fact that even the hon. the Minister of Mines realizes this problem. I am, therefore, making an appeal to the hon. the Minister to come forward with legislation as soon as possible by means of which mining companies and subterranean title holders will be made co-responsible for soil restoration&#x2014;or at least for that erosion for which they are responsible.</p>

As you know, these bushes, particularly the quick-sickness bush in the Klipveld region have taken the highest toll ever. That is why we should like to know whether any progress has been made in regard to the preparation of preventatives or remedies in respect of the poisoning of our herds of cattle, our cattle, sheep and small stock, etc., in that regard.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for South Coast touched upon a few very interesting matters last night, and because I knew that he had to go away I did not reply to them last night. He spoke about treating plants and animals with radio isotopes for the purpose of developing new types or species. Now I may just say that we in South Africa are, of course, very aware of the progress which can be made with that method. We have Dr. Marais who may practically be regarded as a world authority in that field. He is very actively engaged in that. A while back I visited at the Research Institute at Stellenbosch myself where I saw how researches were being made into plant nutrition by means of this method. It is tremendously interesting. I really think that if I am here next year&#x2014;all of us for that matter&#x2014;I must try and find an opportunity of inviting Members of Parliament to go and pay a visit to that institute. It is tremendously interesting. We in South Africa are also trying to develop all kinds of plants by means of this treatment. Here at Langgewens they are now carrying out experiments and in the same way we are carrying out experiments in other parts of the country. I give the hon. member for South Coast the assurance that our research workers are giving their full attention to that method, that they are acquainted with the method and that they are employing it. Recently we sent another official to Australia who went to study further in that direction and he also obtained further information there. We are very actively engaged in that. It is a very interesting direction.</p>

I may just say that a considerable amount has been done in that regard as well and that plans are pending. I may also say that I myself as Minister am not very taken up with the idea.</p>

<p>The other night the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) asked me whether my new scheme in regard to veld reclamation will be a success. At this stage it is very difficult for me to say.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. But first I just want to say this. I told the farmers in the western Transvaal: &#x201C;Really, I think our farmers must now decide whether they want to farm or whether they want to keep a &#x2018;zoo&#x2019;.&#x201D; The danger in regard to this undertaking is going to be concentration of wild life as soon as that veld begins to become rehabilitated again. I do not know how we are going to fence in those concentrations of wild life. No fencing stops them; there is no fencing of a quality good enough to stop them. I am afraid that we are undertaking an expensive business here, and the reason why we are not going to be able to make a success of it&#x2014;if it is a failure&#x2014;will be the wild life.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made the point that what we are paying out is not enough. The farmer cannot afford to withdraw animals. Now I may just say this, Mr. Chairman. We based our calculations on an average of eight morgen per stock unit. There are regions where it will go up to 12 and there are regions where it will come down to five. But R4 per stock unit per eight morgen represents a high income. I feel convinced that much of that land could not in recent years even carry one animal per 20 morgen. But now these farmers are being helped tremendously by this scheme. In the position they are in to-day they cannot even carry one animal per 20 morgen. But we shall bring them back to where they were, or rather we shall try to do so.</p>

<p>Yes. I received the figures this afternoon. We have already received 1,000 applications from farmers who want to participate in this scheme. If you were to ask me what percentage of the farmers in the area that is, I would not be able to say.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) has asked that diagnostic laboratories be established in his area. I may just say that there is in fact a laboratory there, but not in the same measure as we already have in other places in the country. We are engaged in planning for a full-scale diagnostic laboratory there. I think the building plans have already been drawn up.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Humansdorp said there was an experimental farm at Langkloof, and he asked me how it was possible, in view of the fact that the experimental farm there is so important, that we have R3,500 less in the Estimates for the experimental farm than we had last year. I may just say that we had to purchase certain implements for the experimental farm last year. It is not a recurring item and that is why there is less this year on the Estimates. The reason is not that we are going to do less work there. The hon. member also raised the point that we must have more research in respect of the utilization of water. That is true, and we are engaged in research in regard to the utilization of water. We cannot afford our precious water in this country being utilized in a way which is not absolutely efficient. That research is being carried out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and many other hon. members&#x2014;on this as well as that side of the House&#x2014;made strong pleas in regard to veld conservation. I think hon. members will forgive me if I do not reply to them individually, but discuss veld conservation with them as a group. One thing is very certain. It can be deduced from the debate here to-day that this House feels very concerned about veld destruction and deterioration in South Africa. I feel the same way. If there is one matter which really needs our attention in the field of agriculture it is the conservation of our soil. The Government is aware of that and so am I. We have a group of officials who are also aware of that. Our officials are so aware of it that they are finding it difficult to maintain the peace amongst themselves in respect of what is the most important work in that regard. All of them are aware of the fact that veld conservation in South Africa ought to receive top priority. But that is what it has. We have assigned some of our best trained officials in South Africa, some of our most single-minded officials to agricultural research and veld conservation. We can do nothing more in that direction. We do not have the manpower to make more people available for that. Take these other pleas for more veterinary surgeons. We would all like to see more veterinary surgeons in South Africa. But we must remember that South Africa has a population of slightly more than 3,000,000, who have to render professional services in that direction to 14,000,000 or 15,000,000 people. We do not therefore have the wide choice other countries and other nations have. That is why we have to get along with smaller numbers in this country. Nevertheless we have performed miracles. Onderstepoort has done work in various directions which has astounded the world. Recently we had the case of an official from South Africa whom America borrowed from us for a year in order to go and give classes in regard to the cultivation of potatoes. In this way we are doing good work in every field of agricultural and medical research. We are performing miracles in this country. Hon. members have mentioned what other countries require, but I do not think hon. members have taken into account the quality of the people we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>No, we still have seven vacant posts. But we admit that if we could <span class="col_3795-3796" refersTo="page_0477"/>get more veterinary surgeons, more posts could be created. I myself live in a region where we need more of those people&#x2014;such as the hon. member for Smithfield pleaded for. I think we need more of them all over the country. But it is of no avail creating posts if one does not have the officials to fill them. We have expanded the training facilities for veterinary surgeons and I hope that we will shortly be getting more of them. The hon. member for Smithfield made out a strong case for a second training centre for veterinary surgeons. I cannot agree with him there. We have a restriction on capital in South Africa. We cannot complete certain agricultural buildings quickly enough. That is so. But room is now available at Onderstepoort which is an excellent institution. Let us expand as much as possible there. That will be the quickest way of getting more veterinary surgeons. The hon. members for Stellenbosch and Smithfield have already argued about where it should be established. I therefore think that it should rather remain at Onderstepoort.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wolmaransstad made what I think was a good speech last night. He pointed out how essential it was in the training of our youth to cause them to take an interest in agriculture&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Brentwood also did so&#x2014;and he made a good speech indicating how we should encourage our people to take an interest in those matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal also pleaded for a research station. In addition he pointed out the dangers constituted by the encroachment of the Karoo bush in his constituency. That is why he asked me whether we should not also incorporate that area in the areas where stock withdrawal is taking place for the sake of restoring the soil. No, Mr. Chairman, that we cannot do. This stock withdrawal scheme was simply and solely established for *those drought disaster areas where it will not be possible to rehabilitate the veld with proper farming methods. But in those places where it will still be possible to rehabilitate the veld by means of proper farming methods we will not introduce a scheme of this nature.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland made a serious plea in regard to foot-and-mouth regulations in South-West Africa. I am very well aware of the fact that those restrictions must irritate farmers, but for agriculture in South Africa, and therefore for our entire economy, foot-and-mouth disease is such a grave danger that all measures which can possibly be taken to protect our country against it, must be taken. That is in fact what we are busy doing. The hon. member also alleged that we were discriminating against the farmers in South-West Africa. He alleged that the farmers of South-West Africa bordering on Botswana are treated differently than farmers from the Republic also bordering on Botswana. What must be borne in mind here is just that those South-West African farmers border on the danger zones in Botswana while the farmers in the Republic bordering on Botswana farm adjacent to a territory which has been cleaned up by that country itself. That is why access is easier here than on the South-West African side. But I want to give the assurance that I cannot allow the regulations in regard to foot-and-mouth disease to be relaxed to such an extent that it is going to constitute a future danger for the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany has pleaded for a pineapple research station and for additional veterinary services. He also referred to the number of veterinary surgeons in West Germany. I admit that they have more of them than we have, but then it must also be borne in mind that West Germany is a much older country and a much more advanced one than South Africa is at the moment. I give the hon. member the assurance, however, that we are doing our level best to train as many as possible of these people. Those whom we have are doing wonderful work for the general welfare of our country. As far as pineapple research is concerned, I understand that there is one near East London.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karas made an interesting speech on cattle breeding and meat production. I find myself in difficulties when I have to reply to such a learned speech. However, I just want to inform the hon. member that we in the Department are also in fact carrying out tests in that direction. The other day for example I was at Irene where a number of these tests are being carried out. I want to agree with the hon. member that systematic cross-breeding will not help our stock in South Africa along, but will destroy it.</p>

<p>I also want to agree with the hon. member that we already have far too many breeds in South Africa. I cannot see why we cannot farm with Afrikaner cattle and why there should also be Frieslands [Laughter.] But the position is that we already have too many different kinds of breeds in South Africa, nevertheless it is very difficult not to allow a farmer to import pure bred cattle, particularly if he thinks that that particular breed will thrive in his region. But I want to ask my people to be very careful as far as cross-breeding is concerned. In South Africa we have our own native cattle breeds. In fact, we have all the known breeds here. But as long as we sell the first crossing, everything goes well. When we come to the triple cross-breeding, however, even an expert cannot make a success of it. If an expert cannot make a success of it, how can an ordinary farmer make a success of it&#x003F; We must be very careful here. The hon. member for Cradock pleaded for soil conservation and asked that we must see to it that our soil is preserved for future generations. He said that the prosecutions for disregarding soil conservation <span class="col_3797-3798" refersTo="page_0478"/>regulations look rather ineffectual to him. I want to repeat the request I made last night, i.e. whether we are also going to prosecute farmers, in view of the times in which we are living&#x003F; I have travelled the length and breadth of our country. With the exception perhaps of the Western Cape and the coastal strip, in what other region can the farmer maintain farm planning and soil conservation as it ought to be done&#x003F; My farms are well and conveniently planned, but during the drought last year f could not adhere to my farm planning or grazing system. The drought made it simply impossible. At this stage we may not even think of prosecuting people. On the contrary, f think it is our duty to treat our farmers as kindly as possible in these times. In fact, how our farmers in large parts of our country remain undiscouraged is beyond me. I take off my hat to them.</p>

<p>Recently I visited three regions which have been the most badly stricken by drought. The other day I visited the region near the Orange River where I had to negotiate with those people in order to take more of their life-giving water away from them by means of restrictions. Nevertheless they accepted it quite cheerfully. They realize the seriousness of the problem. Here and there there may be one who is complaining, but that is only natural. I also visited the Northern Transvaal and return as one inspired after I had seen what courage those people still have after six years of drought. We must remember that it was only a few years ago that they had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease there. As a result of that their farms were overstocked. After that the drought came. But they accept their position cheerfully. I really do not know where they get the courage from. All that I can do is to admire them for that. What we can do is to treat them with as much sympathy as possible. I am not saying that the hon. member pleaded for legal proceedings to be instituted. As I see it, he pleaded for the law to be enforced. I agree with him on that point. The law must be enforced and it will in fact be enforced if the times are favourable for that being done.</p>

<p>Quite a lot was said about the termite plague. The other day I visited the faculty of agriculture at the University at Bloemfontein where I had gone to investigate the research which they are doing in regard to the combating of termites. I found it very interesting. However, they have not yet progressed far enough for them to produce any practical results. Dieldrin is the only spray there is. Requests were again made here this afternoon for this plague to be declared a national plague. But that we cannot do. What the hon. member for Standerton had to say about this subject was very interesting. He pointed out that the reason for this plague growing worse was the fact that we are wiping out our bird life. At this stage we cannot make use of Dieldrin as a spray in an attempt on the part of the State to stamp out these termites. We do not know as yet what the results of the large-scale use of Dieldrin would be. Much research in this regard must still be done. I just want to say that if the use of Dieldrin is going to be the cause of our bird life, which is the natural enemy of termites, being exterminated, then it is not going to be a worth-while undertaking. Over the past 25 years I have not allowed a single crow to be shot on my farm. I protect the crows with all the precautionary measures at my disposal, precisely because they are the natural enemies of the termites. If we are now, through the use of this spray, going to exterminate the natural enemies of the termite then we would be doing South Africa more harm. Because the Government is not prepared to make use of this spray I am not prepared either to declare this particular plague a national plague. I observed how methods were being sought which could be utilized so that termite families would exterminate themselves because they are inimical to one another. When I was driving away I said to myself that I would never be a research worker. I find that it is too much of a slow job. I would not be able to stick it out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico asked what progress has been made in regard to quick-sickness. The hon. member saw me a couple of months ago. We then instructed an entire team of scientists to tackle this plant. However, this is a difficult plant to deal with. It grows periodically, something which makes research difficult. A team of six or seven scientists are at present engaged in research in regard to this plant. However we shall do our best.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I intended before the Minister was due to reply to the debate, to suggest one or two ways which would assist us in this serious problem of soil erosion. I already made the point that too much of our manpower engaged in this battle was being bogged down in offices having to do clerical work whereas they should be out on the farms in the countryside doing the job which is so urgently required there. I wonder how many manhours in the soil conservation section of the department are taken up by clerical work, the drawing up of detailed maps and conservation plans, filing them away and refiling them. That must take up a tremendous amount of time. What we really need are fences, weirs and dams on the farms so that we could arrest this process of the washing away of our precious soil. I believe the department itself realizes the urgency of this problem. I say they must get rid of the red tape. As a matter of fact, I notice from the department&#x2019;s reports that the officials themselves feel that the administration can be streamlined. I myself believe that there is a great deal of room for streamlining the administration. <span class="col_3799-3800" refersTo="page_0479"/>I am sure that if that is done on a practical basis our efforts to combat soil erosion can be made much more successful.</p>

<p>Then I think a great deal more use can be made of our experienced farmers. There are hundreds of farmers throughout South Africa who are fully capable of playing a leading part in fighting soil erosion in this country. I think we should waste no further time in making use of the services of these people at this very moment. Furthermore, they should be adequately remunerated for it. We cannot expect them to do this merely for the love of the soil. I say, therefore, that a plan must be devised whereby full use can be made of the services of these farmers. It has been proved by many farmers in this country that soil erosion can be arrested in spite of droughts. Here I think in particular of a farm in the Uitenhage district belonging to a Mr. M. Daniels. His farm stands out like an oasis in that area and affords adequate proof that where the proper methods are applied, whether there be droughts or not, farms can be reclaimed. If one farmer can do this, surely other farmers can do so too. Go to the Free State and have a look at the farm of Mr. Len Howell at Springfontein. There you will see rooigras waving as it used to wave in the olden days. He also has proved that by applying proper conservation methods, the encroachment of the desert can be brought to a stop. If he can do it in the Free State, other farmers there can do it too. Take the case of Mr. Trollip in the Middelburg district. Here again by the application of sound methods of farming he has shown to all the farmers in the area how to set about recovering those grasses which were dominant years ago. I believe more use should be made of these people, people who have proved themselves as being adequate for the job. I am quite sure that if we could incorporate the services of such people in our fight against soil erosion we would ultimately be successful. We must face up to the fact that for 20 years we have been losing the battle against soil erosion and we have now reached a point where urgent steps must be taken if we want to get on top. The suggestions I want to make are therefore (a) we must get rid of red tape and release our officers to go on the farms where they have a job to do, and (b) we must make a greater use of our experienced farmers. This is a job we cannot tackle on a peacetime basis. This is exactly what we have been doing so far. What we must do, however, is to go over to a wartime footing. Only then can we be successful.</p>
