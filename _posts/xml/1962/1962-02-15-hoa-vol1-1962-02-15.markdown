<speech by="#heystek">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned yesterday, I was drawing attention to the harmony that existed when both sides of the House took part in a discussion on a Bill in a positive and constructive, yes, even co-ordinating manner; that is to say when both sides of the House functioned in a full knowledge of what their vocation was and when they were true to that vocation, and when the Opposition had a clear realization of what the function was of a minority group in a democratic system of government when the majority group acknowledged the right of the majority group to exist and to function; all that is conducive, if not to mutual blind confidence, then at least to calculated confidence when a Bill such as this is discussed in this House.</p>

<p>That takes us on to that high plain of which this House is proud, and which we should like the people inside and outside this country to acknowledge. Mr. Speaker this Bill has aroused a certain measure of disquiet amongst some of our farmers, partly because they do not realize the full impact of some of its provisions, but partly also perhaps some provisions of this Bill will understandably have an irritating effect on a certain type of farmer because their application will mean a certain amount of economic disruption to him and will necessitate drastic adaptation on his part. That, as a matter of fact, is always the case when established practices come into the picture, even though it is admitted that such practices are not always in the best interests of the general public.</p>

<p>By selling farm produce, mainly fruit, along declared national and special roads, the farmers have built up a kind of independent market for themselves, a market where they, in the first place, sell their produce for cash at the minimum of cost and in the second place render a service to members of the public who, when they are travelling, may perhaps find it difficult to go to municipal markets to buy fresh fruit at a reasonable price and in the third place eliminate the middle man, although we acknowledge the important part that he plays in our marketing structure. In the first place you have the farmer who sells his fruit along the road without the assistance of the middle man. You have the hawker who moves his vehicle from place to place and removes it at night and in the third place we have the hawker who offers his fruit on a lorry, the wheels of which have been taken off, and that wheelless vehicle remains alongside the road day and night to the great danger of the travelling public. I feel very sorry for those who fall in the first category, partly sorry for those in the second and very little or not at all for those in the third, because of the potential danger that they constitute to the travelling public and because of their unsightliness along our main road at the entrances to our cities and towns.</p>

<p>I have received numerous telegrams, not one of a personal character, but all on behalf of certain farmers&#x2019; groups who have for years been selling their entire crop through the channel which this Bill wants to limit. In the main they ask that the farmer himself should still be permitted to sell his produce on a sight outside the proclaimed width of a road with due regard to safety. We know that under this Bill a person can still sell fruit outside the proclaimed width of a road on his private property. but Clause 7 does have a restricting influence, to which I shall return later. I do not want to deal with specific clauses in such detail that you, Mr. Speaker, will regard it as your duty to remind me that we are not in Committee but that we are taking the second reading. I think Clause 9 is the cause of the disquiet. Clause 9 will be Section 15<i>ter</i> (1) in the new Act and it is very clearly a prohibitive clause; it prohibits any person from trading along a declared road. The preposition &#x201C;on&#x201D; in the definition is, however, reassuring. It refers to trade within the proclaimed width of the road and not outside it. Difficulty will however arise when it comes to the question of the granting of ingress to and egress from a declared road by the Road Transport Commission for the purposes of carrying on trade alongside that road. Even the permissive character of Clause 7 which will become Sections <i>14bis</i> (1) and (2) in the new Act does not reassure the farmer in this respect because if ingress to and egress from roads is to be largely or completely refused by a statutory body from whom no appeal lies to a higher authority, the practice of selling his produce along a declared road, which has become an established practice in the marketing of farm produce, will be something of the past as far as the farmer is concerned. It will cause a major disruption and will require a great deal of adaptation. We fully agree that it is necessary to review the existing position and we support the idea wholeheartedly that a prohibition should be placed on all sales within the proclaimed width of declared roads in order to put a stop to the accidents that this practice causes because somebody turns off the road right in front of you, applies his brakes on the edge of the road, and causes a collision, or because a Native jumps under your car with a bag of naartjies hoping that you will buy them and when you <span class="col_1151-1152" refersTo="page_592"/>enquire as to the price you find that they are not too cheap, yet he always says: &#x201C;Nice, master, sweet naartjies.&#x201D; Collisions are also caused because numbers of motor cars park close to the stalls and the whole area around and near the declared road is occupied by people who stand about talking and eating fruit. Revision of the position is also necessary so that wheelless motor vehicle which is a very unsightly display window and a perpetual danger, can be completely done away with. But we hope that the permissive character of the Bill in its entirety, together with the sympathy of the Road Transportation Board and the influence of the hon. the Minister, will all contribute towards some concession being granted in the Committee Stage to enable the farmer to retain something of this system of marketing which is under discussion, bearing in mind the maximum amount of safety and the elimination of innumerable unsightly trading stalls along our declared roads.</p>

<p>Having in duty bound said these few things of which the Minister is aware as a result of the discussions we have had in that connection and having drawn attention to the needs of the <i>bona fide</i> farmer as far as the retention of his right to sell on private property alongside declared roads, is concerned, I leave it in the hands of the Minister and of the Department of Transport, assuring them, as in the past, of our wholhearted support and our sincere co-operation.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>It was interesting to listen to the introductory speech of the hon. the Minister. We listened to it with joy and pride. We on this side of the House, as well as hon. members opposite, are proud of our network of roads and in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister has told us that R200,000,000 has already been spent on the construction of national roads and that this legislation will bring about comprehensive changes, as the Minister has said, you feel, of course, that you want to go somewhat deeper into the matter. This legislation controls the ingress to and egress from roads. This Bill provides that any land that is required for national road construction purposes may today be expropriated by the various Provincial Administrations and that the costs of such expropriation be regarded as part of the costs of constructing the road and recoverable from the National Road Fund in the customary way. When I look at Clause 2 I find something that I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister, something which I am sure will have the sympathy not only of this side of the House but also that of the other side of the House. I refer to the fact that under existing legislation the farming community have to sacrifice land for a road 100 feet wide, if such land is ordinary grazing land, without receiving any compensation, and that they only receive compensation when there are buildings on it or when the land is under crops or if the land has been cultivated in some other way. What is true in the case of Natal is also true in the case of the other provinces. In Natal expropriation takes place in terms of Section 10 of Ordinance 11 of 1942. It says that any land may be expropriated and as much of it as necessary used for the construction of a main road, provided such road is not wider than 100 feet. Section 12 deals with the compensation and says clearly, in sub-section (3), that no purchase price can be demanded except compensation for improvements in the form of buildings or other structures or in the form of irrigation or any other way and also for any loss that may eventually be suffered as the result of a remaining extent. Those are exactly the same conditions under which the Railways expropriated land some years ago and this hon. Minister, together with his predecessor, assisted the farming community in that they changed the position. In other words, it was only in those cases where improvements had been effected or where the land had been cultivated that the farmers received compensation. When the Minister tells us to-day that the construction of national roads has only cost R200,000,000, I wonder how many morgen of land, grazing land, have already been sacrificed by the farmers without any compensation. I do not think it is right that position should be allowed to continue. I feel that where our national roads are used to get from one point to another, and where they often encroach on a farmer&#x2019;s farm and cut it in half, he should be compensated for that portion that is taken away from him. Not only is the land expropriated, but once the national road has been constructed and the fencing erected on both sides, that farmer is held responsible for the maintenance of such fencing. The life of a road is not ten or 15 years, but the life of a fence is indeed ten to 15 years. My argument is this that it is reasonable to expect a fence to last from ten to 15 years without having to spend a great amount of capital to maintain it but once a fence has been in existence for 15 years, it means that the farmer has to spend a great deal to maintain it. We had the same position in the case of the Railways and the Minister introduced legislation that provided for compensation to be paid. Seeing that the tendency in all civilized countries in the world is to-day to make greater use of road transport and to place less emphasis on railways and seeing that it was clear from the Minister&#x2019;s speech that they will concentrate more on the construction of national roads, greater sacrifices will be demanded from the farmers. I want to give the Minister an example of what happened in my constituency, in the Mooi River and Nottingham Road area. What is true of my constituency to-day will later become true of other constituencies and the first person who will find himself in difficulty in this connection is the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Maree) and then the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins). The position is that a railway line was constructed. It was then decided to double the line in the interests of South Africa and the farms of those people were once again cut up. The original railway line cut them <span class="col_1153-1154" refersTo="page_593"/>and then they were cut again by the second line and they were cut for the third time by the national road which is usually not very far from the railway line. The policy to-day is to double the national road and to straighten it. Work will be commenced at Pietermaritzburg and will go through my constituency. There are farmers there who have to carry the doubled railway line, the original national road and now the new national road, they all traverse one farm, and no compensation was paid in respect of the two last-mentioned. Most of the farmers had to sacrifice land for the first railway line without compensation. They were compensated in respect of the second line.</p>

<p>I am not talking politics now. I am talking in the interests of the farmers. I do not know who constructed the first railway line nor does it make any difference. May I remind the hon. member for Wakkerstroom that he introduced a motion in this House last Friday in which he alleged that the farms were already too small and when the first line was constructed the farms were not as yet too small, but to-day they are. It is of the utmost importance that compensation be paid to a farmer when his land is expropriated. I want to urge all sides of the House to see to it that is done. I am not talking politics but this matter is of great importance and I think that if the Minister takes the initiative as far as compensation for land, grazing land, expropriated for national road purposes is concerned, the Provincial Administrations will follow his example.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>It has on previous occasions also been my privilege to get up after the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). We are living at a time when the lion and the lamb graze together and I take it, therefore, Mr. Speaker, that you will allow me to congratulate the hon. member for Drakensberg on the victory which the United Party gained yesterday in Houghton and Johannesburg (North).</p>

<p>This Bill meets the needs that have arisen as a result of the ever increasing speeds at which traffic passes along our roads. I want to point out to the hon. member for Drakensberg that one of the things that she pleads for is being remedied in this Bill. In Clause 2 provision is made that where pieces of land are cut off from a farm, the National Transport Commission will have the right to provide the Provincial Administration with funds to pay compensation. I join her in appealing to the Minister to see to it that this fragmentation does not go too far. I want to refer to the position that we find just this side of Paarl, not far from here. There you have the old tarred road and next to it the new national road from Cape Town to the north. This new road is only ten or twelve years old and another new road has already been planned, a road that has become essential as a result of the necessity to double the new road. But unfortunately the idea is for this road to follow another course and that will mean that those farmers who made sacrifices twelve years ago will now have to make further sacrifices. I want to express my appreciation for the fact that we have a Minister who is so sympathetically inclined, because I am sure &#x2014;he has already invited me to discuss the problem with him&#x2014;that having such a sympathetic Minister, we shall be able to solve this problem. But I do want to issue a word of warning that this fragmentation should not be allowed to go too far. I welcome Clause 2 because it brings about a big improvement. Because of the provisions of Clause 6, namely, that the National Transport Commission will in future close gates and accesses to the national road, it is no longer necessary to cut up farms unnecessarily. That, however, almost becomes an insurmountable problem if you want to construct a straight road. In that case it is inevitable that pieces of land are cut off farms and where it is not always possible to construct two or three subways on such a farm, the best solution will be if there could be an exchange between the owners on either side of the road. But then the compensation will have to be sufficiently liberal, and I realize that I am on dangerous ground here and that you, Sir, will possibly call me to order because the question of compensation is something for the Provincial Administration to deal with. However, I hope you will be as lenient with me and you were a few minutes ago with the hon. member for Drakensberg when she quoted from that Ordinance. I want to plead with the Minister to use his influence with the Provincial Administrations concerned to see to it that this compensation is such that exchanges can take place because it often happens that a small piece of farmer A&#x2019;s land on that side of the road is cut off and another small piece of farmer B&#x2019;s land on this side of the road but on farmer A&#x2019;s side. If there could be an exchange the problem would be solved, but the survey fees and costs of transfer of these small pieces of land will be so high that people will not consider it worth while to do it and the result will be that both these pieces of land will be neglected, because A cannot cultivate the small piece of land that lies on B&#x2019;s side, and <i>vice versa.</i> The result will be that both pieces of land will be neglected and lost to agricultural production. We cannot allow that to happen in this country where our agricultural land is so limited. I want to put forward a plea for the highly developed agricultural areas of our country where intensive farming methods are applied. It happens so often where there are small holdings or highly developed farms such as we have in the Boland, that small pieces of land are neglected. I have more than one example of that in my area. That is why I once again want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to use his influence with the Administrations so that the compensation will be sufficiently liberal to enable these exchanges to be effected, not only in the <span class="col_1155-1156" refersTo="page_594"/>interests of those farmers, but in the interests of the agriculture of the Republic of South Africa. It is true, we are living at a time when there are surpluses, but these times will pass and the farming community will once again have to put everything in gear to provide food for an ever growing population, and for that reason we should not allow land to lie idle because of this fragmentation.</p>

<p>There is also another way of taking action. It often happens that such a double road takes up 200 feet, that it takes up such a large portion of that smallholding or farm, that the farmer cannot make a living on the remaining piece. He should then be placed in a position by way of reasonable compensation to purchase adjoining land. I know only too well that it costs so much to construct a road that the authorities concerned do not want to spend a great deal of additional money to expropriate the necessary land, but my submission is that in view of the fact that the travelling public get the benefit of these wonderful roads, that travelling public should be willing to incur the necessary expenditure to get those wonderful roads; and for that reason the farmer or the smallholder should receive adequate compensation so that he will not suffer any loss.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to draw attention to Clause 10 where the National Transport Commission is now empowered to plan roads. In this respect I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to see to it that such planning takes place in close co-operation with organized agriculture. Because it often happens that this fragmentation to which I have referred can be avoided if there is a small deviation or a very minor turn. Unfortunately our experience&#x201D; has been that the people who plan the roads are engineers with cold, hard logic. They do not have the love of the land that the farmer has; they do not have that sincere love for the land; their only object is to make that road as straight and as good as possible. With minor deviations that road can be constructed in such a way that we do not encroach too much on our agricultural land and for that reason I want to make an urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister to see to it that planning is done in the closest co-operation with organized agriculture and if that is done I predict that we shall have good roads, straight roads, with minor deviations in some cases, but roads that will not make too many inroads on agriculture.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>As a new member of this House and as a migrant from the Provincial Council, the question of roads naturally interests me greatly and I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction. I would like to refer to the background to the establishment of national roads. The national road system which was introduced in 1935 was a bold and ambitious scheme and it came as the result of considerable public pressure. There are many of us here who still recall the slogans that appeared in the Press throughout the country over the years. &#x201C;We want good roads&#x201D;. We had to overcome many obstacles, and we were not without our pessimists. First of all we saw the advent and the beginning of the gravel road. Even with its dust it was very much better than what we had experienced previously with our unmade roads. Then later we saw the black-topped road which to-day stretches to nearly every part of South Africa. I think our country can be very proud of the progress that has been made with the first part of this programme which has been completed. I would like to pay a tribute to the provinces for the part that they have played in this scheme in collaboration with the national roads authorities. I would like specially to mention the Cape Provincial Administration. In this Cape Province of ours, which is a very big province, we have succeeded over the years in building roads to the borders of Natal, to the Free State, to the Transvaal and we are now building a road to the borders of the Rhodesias, and are busy building a link to the South West Africa border as well. We have our Divisional Councils who have been busy building the link roads. At the present time finance does not stretch to black-topping them, but they will be black-topped in the very near future. The financing of our national road scheme has been a colossal task, but the road-user has played his part in finding the revenue. My only regret is that the total tax derived from the road-user has not been paid into the Road Fund. These national roads of ours have a considerable economic value. I think we are inclined to discount their real value, and I think it would be difficult to estimate the savings to the motorist, to the commercial user, in repairs and replacements. It has brought our small towns near to the cities, and these national roads are playing a very large part in attracting tourists to this country. We need the revenue of the tourist and these national roads, as I say, are playing their part.</p>

<p>There is one very important point&#x2014;and I think the entire costs of national roads can be written off to this point&#x2014;and that is the strategic value of our national roads system. I do not think that particular value can be underestimated. I think we can write off the entire cost of national roads to that value. We know from our experience in the last war, especially in the East African campaign, that it was a case of fighting on the very good roads that the Italians built.</p>

<p>The only black spot in the whole history of our national roads system is the road-safety factor. At the present moment the growing accident rate on these roads is a matter of concern. It requires intensive road-user education, the road-user will have to be taught how to use these roads with safety. The roads themselves will have to be designed to assist wherever possible to promote safety. This Bill, by making provision for limited access roads, will no doubt assist in that direction. Having completed their task of linking the towns and cities, under Clause 4 of the Bill, the Minister has now decided to come to the rescue of the cities by lending financial aid <span class="col_1157-1158" refersTo="page_595"/>for the building of through roads and link roads. I feel sure that this will be welcomed by all, notwithstanding the strings attached to the offer, but I think it is an accepted fact that the man who pays the piper usually calls the tune, providing of course that it is the correct tune. We in the Cape have been very fortunate in that the Provincial Administration has given assistance in the past in meeting 80 per cent of the cost of the construction of our proclaimed roads within the urban area. One can see the results in and around Cape Town. You see the doubling of the highway over De Waal Drive, Rhodes Drive, to the Southern Suburbs. Further on at the Black River, you find from the Southern Suburbs a doubling and linking of the roads to the national road to the North, the building of these roads in and around the city would have been completely impossible if we did not receive this assistance. The local ratepayer is certainly not in the position to pay for these roads.</p>

<p>As I have said, this Bill deals with limited access roads. National roads, are inclined to become like railways and rivers. They are by nature limited in their access, and if they were not so, they would not be able to serve their very useful purpose. By limiting the access to these national roads of ours, we also improve the road-safety factor on these roads. But there would be no point in designing limited access roads if you do not at the same time design the service roads and bridges. When I talk about service roads, I think it is generally accepted that where a national road goes through a built-up area, that adjacent to this particular road there must be built a service road to carry the traffic of the area adjacent to it, to the junction point. Very near us here we have a national road that stretches through from Maitland to Bellville and beyond, and I can well remember that when I came into the Provincial Council, one of the first things that we had to deal with was an Ordinance making it possible for the Administrator to build limited access roads. That particular road was designed as a limited access road. In other words, the two-lane traffic way you see at the moment was meant for the main traffic, and adjacent to the two-lanes there were two service roads. Apart from the fact that the two bridges have been built near Bellville and one near Maitland, nothing further has been done. You have two very big developing residential areas building up alongside this road, and they have direct access on to this national road of ours, which to my mind is all wrong. I think when we are building our national roads we must build service roads and bridges. I just quote this as an example. The same thing happens in the platteland, as my hon. friend, the member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) (who was a colleague of mine in the Provincial Council), will know. One can imagine going through a vineyard area outside the Cape where quite often you see roads leading directly onto the national road. This Bill makes provision for the Administrator to have the power to close-off gates. But, sir, it is not good enough to close-off gates. Provision must be made for the adjacent owner to get to the junction point of the national road. He cannot be expected to go around the mountain to get onto the national road. That is why service roads are so imperative. We are inclined to forget about it, but they must be built. When one gets up to the Northern Cape which is cattle country, you find that whereas quite a lot of the cattle to-day are moved by truck, there are farmers who move their cattle by road. They drive them along the national road and the cattle become a natural hazard to the road-user. There service roads are required very urgently and are a &#x201C;must&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As far as our through-ways through the towns and cities are concerned, they naturally have to be of a limited access nature as well. A through-road in the city invariably goes through built-up areas, through congested areas, through industrial areas, and as a result they must of necessity cut off quite a number of cross-roads, and it does create hardship. An owner of a property who has built up a very lucrative business or is struggling to build up a lucrative business, finds a road driven through in front of his property, and it practically puts him out of business. There again something must be done in the planning to help those people. There must be some way of relieving their position, either by building a service road through to their business or bridging the road. Overseas it is the practice, wherever they can, to bridge these roads. We have a road here which is going to be pushed through my Constituency; it is known as Boulevard East, and this particular road will leave Rhodes Drive and cut diagonally across a highly congested area and will enter Cape Town at the foreshore. Negotiations have been going on for years and now at last that road is to be built very shortly. But the effect of this particular road is this. The road will be at groundlevel, although it will be bridged a certain length of its way and quite a number of cross-roads will be cut off. It is going to affect this particular area. As I have said, these roads become like railway lines and rivers; they do have this dividing effect, and provision should have been made for this road to be bridged the whole way. Sir, I only quote this as an example because in all our large cities to-day, when this Bill becomes law. you will find that greater impetus will be given to building our ring-roads and through-ways, and it will take foresight and planning to alleviate any hardship that is going to be felt by the adjacent owners. It happens not only in the towns but in the platteland as well. It is not good enough just to draw a line across a map and to say, &#x201C;this is where we are going to put the road.&#x201D; I think we will have to give very much more forethought to that.</p>

<p>Clause 9 of this Bill makes provision, in the interests of road-safety, to control trading on these national roads. That will be welcomed by everybody. But at the same time I think you have to take into account the fact that the road-user does require refreshments at times, and provision should be made at points along the <span class="col_1159-1160" refersTo="page_596"/>road for service roads where the road-user can leave the national road and refresh himself and take a few gallons of petrol.</p>

<p>Finally I should like to make just one appeal to the Minister. We have these beautiful roads in this country of ours stretching from one end to the other, and I should like to hear from the Minister whether he can see his way clear to relax the provisions of the Road Transportation Act. That is probably outside the scope of this Bill, but I would like to leave that thought with him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>It is my pleasant duty to congratulate the previous speaker, the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) on his maiden speech. It seems to me that he chose his subject well, and that he also has particular knowledge of roads. His reference to the economic value of good roads to the industrial and commercial development of our country, and also their strategic value in time of war, is fully endorsed by me. The hon. member is the successor of the well-known and almost notorious Mr. Harry Lawrence, who sat in this House for 32 years, and who played a particular role in the activities of this House during the past three decades. I do not know whether this hon. new member will have the stamina also to retain his seat in this House for 32 years. If so, I just want to advise him not to follow the bad example of his predecessor, and, in this regard, I wish to refer to the old adage which says that it is no use a man doing good for 99 years and then back-sliding in his hundredth year. He should not follow the bad example set by his predecessor and do in the last year of his service what the latter did to his party. At all events, I congratulate him on his speech and hope that he will be a useful member to his party and also to this House in future.</p>

<p>To come to the subject under discussion, it is surely a fact that everybody who is interested in effective road development in South Africa can welcome this Bill with acclamation, because it is a further step towards the improvement and better control of our roads. In South Africa we are very proud of our roads. We have splendid national and provincial roads, roads which are good for vehicles and pleasing to the eye. They are good for traffic because they are well built and they are pleasing to the eye because they have been well finished off, because special care has been devoted to rounding off the sides of the roads, with special attention to the prevention of erosion, etc. The careful rounding off of approaches to bridges, railings, etc., all contribute towards creating a good impression on the travelling public, apart from the fact that our roads mostly also wind through beautiful natural scenes.</p>

<p>Good roads are like good blood vessels in the human body. When the blood vessels become old and calcified it is very dangerous. It endangers life. Any sudden obstruction, particularly of the important coronary and other main vessels of the body can cause sudden death. The same applies to a road, and particularly to the important national, provincial or proclaimed roads which carry the traffic of our country from one corner to another. The ageing and crumbling of our road service must constantly receive attention, otherwise it can develop into a road disease, a road disease of wear and tear and accidents which may prove fatal. Still worse is the dangerous position which arises when, as the result of road obstacles, a sudden obstruction occurs which can bring sudden death to the traveller. Medical men call this disease, caused by a sudden obstruction of the veins, thrombosis; the ordinary man calls it a blood clot which obstructs the circulation and causes sudden death. The vehicle which suddenly stops in a road in front of another one and which suddenly turns across the road into an unexpected side road right in the path of a fast-moving vehicle, or a vehicle which overturns on a bad road, one which should have been straightened, or a stray animal which has entered a gate which should have been closed or which should have crossed a bridge or gone through a subway, are the causes of those road obstructions, these sudden obstructions, those blood clots or this road thrombosis which can affect the traveller just as suddenly as this dread disease to-day strikes so many people. It appears that medical men up to this moment are still sitting with their hands in their hair trying to ascertain the causes of or how to prevent the formation of this dangerous blood clot; and if we think of the numerous road accidents with fatal results, we welcome this Bill all the more. We also welcome it because it is a further attempt to reduce these danger points. When we thank Minister Schoeman, we want to call him Dr. Schoeman, who, with his fellow road specialists, has made another attempt to ascertain what the causes are of these many obstructions which cause so many fatal accidents. Like a good doctor, he has again given a prescription for the prevention of road thrombosis. What also catches one&#x2019;s eye on reading this Bill is the particularly realistic and sympathetic approach by the responsible Minister and his administration towards the owners of properties on whose land roads are built. The cautious approach, the recognition of the rights of the owner, the compensation which is offered and paid, are clearly defined, and show that claims will not be made recklessly or ground expropriated without compensation or without thoroughly taking into consideration the interests of the farmer concerned. The control of access and egress for greater safety, the building of bridges, subways and roads on which cattle can be herded from camp to camp have been placed on a sound basis in this Bill.</p>

<p>Then we come to the fairly contentious clause, Clause 9, to which reference has already been made by the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) and others. We realize that this is also intended to prevent and to reduce the incidence of that fatal, sudden road thrombosis. The car which turns <span class="col_1161-1162" refersTo="page_597"/>in on to the wrong side of the road right in front of one in order to stop at a fruit wagon or fruit stall, the arm-waving Bantu or the child who runs right into the middle of the road in order to offer fruit for sale or to attract the attention of the traveller, are eliminated by this clause. But still I have doubts as to the practical application of this clause. As hon. members know, it has become tradition over a period of many years to hawk along our public roads. Hon. members will remember the timber wagons, the fruit and vegetable wagons, the ox and mule wagons which travelled over the dusty roads of the NorthWestern Transvaal during the depression, by means of which many farmers sold their products and firewood on the diggings, in the towns and along the roads. That gave them an income on which they lived in those days, and therefore it was of vital importance to them. These activities in later years developed into what we have to-day in the form of the fruit-stall, the lorry or the ox-wagon parked along the roads and loaded with fruit and which encroach into the roadway and sometimes stand there day and night in order to sell fruit. That was carried to unnecessary lengths. On the other hand it renders a service on both sides. It offers a market for the produce of the farmers, and it is also convenient to the traveller who can obtain fresh fruit in that way. It has been developed to such a fine point to-day that in districts like Rustenburg and others there are farmers who sell practically their whole naartjie crop in this way along the roads until right into the Free State. Read literally, Clause 9 now totally prohibits this traditional way of trading by the farmer. And then we must remember that the farmer has already been prohibited from hawking in the urban areas by various ordinances and regulations. Therefore he complains. rightly, that his products have to pass through tremendous bottle-necks before reaching the consumers. In so far as it prohibits trading within the proclaimed area of a public road. I cannot find fault with it. But there is another aspect; the question is whether many of these farmers will not still be able to offer their fruit and vegetables for sale across the fence along the road, through their fruit stalls, lorries or wagons standing on the other side of the road boundary but on their own property. The question is what the position will be then. Will the traveller first stop and turn out to the border of the road, and will he still be allowed to buy fruit through the wire or across the fence or even across an imaginary fenceless border-line? Will that be a contravention of the law? Technically, it seems to me that the transaction taking place between the buyer who is a traveller on the road surface and the seller, the farmer who stands on the other side of the fence, is in conflict with the Bill. What is the position in this regard? We must get more information from the Minister on that point, because I believe that there will still be farmers who in this way will try to direct stalls on their own property, and that even traders may obtain the right to carry on business in this way on the farmer&#x2019;s land or on somebody else&#x2019;s property. The question also arises: In the case of people who do not know the law well, e.g. where Natives sell their own products, the products of their own home industries like clay pots and baskets&#x2014;they usually travel by ox-wagon and stop along the road&#x2014;will they in terms of the letter of the law have to turn out until they are outside the road area and will they have to pace off the distance where there is no fence to indicate the border of the road? This is only a small example, but it may cause trouble in practice. If we have clarity about it, much of the difficulty will be eliminated. The question is whether in terms of this Bill the trading across the fence will also be totally prohibited or not.</p>

<p>I just wanted to bring these few aspects of Clause 9 to the notice of the Minister. If these few doubts are cleared up it will facilitate the whole-hearted acceptance of the Bill as a whole and of Clause 9 in particular also outside the House.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>This piece of legislation has come none too soon, but in speaking on this Bill I think it is appropriate to acknowledge our indebtedness to the Cape Divisional Council system which has now operated for over 100 years. These divisional councils, Mr. Speaker, have been the pioneers in road development in this country and they still lead in the most economic construction of roads, and they set an example to check extravagance in general which we often see and which is often very evident in respect of road work. We have, and I must bring this to the attention of the hon. the Minister, great expenditure on deviations within a couple of years after the construction of a national road, not minor deviations, but deviations running over miles, and I do hope that the hon. the Minister will pay due regard to the correct allocation of national roads and the checking of extravagance which has been so often evident where these roads shortly after their construction, long before they had in any way deteriorated, are deviated.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on account of the financial contributions of property-owners in the Cape, I claim that divisional councils have been responsible for bringing about the position that in the Cape Province there is a greater length of constructed roads than in the other three provinces put together. Sir, these divisional councils have been run generally, I should say in 90 per cent of the cases, by farmer representatives, and farmer representatives have paid due regard to the interests of farmers in general as regards the allocation of roads over farms. I want to stress this point: We in this country regard ownership of land as a sacred right, and I would ask the hon. the Minister, as others have done, to pay due regard in Clause 2 (Section 4<i>bis)</i> where &#x201C;An Administrator shall at the request of the Board acquire by treaty or, failing that, by appropriation. any remaining extent of any piece of land which has been appropriated for the purposes of a declared road.&#x201D; I think that no <span class="col_1163-1164" refersTo="page_598"/>remaining extent of land which has been appropriated should be purchased without the consent of the owner. In fact I would prefer the provision to read that it is the owner who must apply for the remaining extent to be purchased by the Board. I would like the hon. the Minister to look into that clause in particular and when it comes to the Committee Stage of the Bill to see that it is suitably amended.</p>

<p>Then in Clause 6, as many hon. members have stressed in this debate, the words &#x201C;in the discretion of the Board&#x201D; are very far-reaching. It says &#x201C;at the discretion of the Board it shall determine whether the occupier of land shall have access to the said portions of land by means of such bridges or subways&#x201D;. That will be at the Board&#x2019;s discretion. As an hon. member said here last night, our roads are particularly wide and these subways will have to be of large dimensions, and if one has to move large numbers of stock across the road, it is not easy to drive them through a subway. I grant that in time they will learn, but I know of many farms where one subway would never adequately permit the proper carrying on of farming operations. One cannot move stock for miles to cross a national road, and I do hope that when the Board exercises this power, it will do so with the greatest circumspection and consideration of the needs of the farmers concerned. I appeal to the hon. the Minister in this particular clause to provide for an appeal by the land-owner in question. The land-owner should have the right of appeal, but this clause obliterates any right of appeal whatsoever, and I think that is quite contrary to our general principles of administration and government in this country. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to pay due regard to these two points.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>The aim of this legislation is to make our roads safer. The toll of lives taken on our roads every year is appalling. It is also a curious fact that while our daily papers make such a fuss about a few people who are caught by sharks at our beaches, little attention is paid to great number of victims claimed by road traffic every day. Many lives, valuable lives, are lost on our roads every day, and we realize therefore that this legislation, which aims at making our roads safer in the future, is one of the most important legislative measure which can be submitted to us in this House. The aim of this measure is to reserve sufficient space for future development. It is essential to plan for future expansion and for the tremendous increase of traffic on our roads. If our predecessors had adopted such a far-sighted policy, we would have been able to reap the fruits of it to-day, and it would not have been necessary to cut up expensive, valuable land. In doing so to-day, we realize that if we do not act now, the position will become more and more difficult and that the time will come when it will be very difficult to get the necessary land to make provision for it. This proposed legislation, which will create the opportunity for us to reserve land for by-pass roads and crossings, for which large tracts of land are sometimes required, particularly very near to our cities, is therefore most necessary. When one thinks what it costs to construct a throughway in a city like Johannesburg, one realizes the importance of this measure. But I nevertheless want to point out that these by-pass roads are now being constructed around our cities and that they sometimes cause a good deal of inconvenience. I want to make it clear that I believe that it is most essential that this land should be reserved, but it is not essential to construct these roads immediately. Some of our towns have such wide streets that they can still cope with that traffic quite easily. If that traffic can still pass through such a small town for another few years, it will be to the great advantage of the residents of that town. It is imperative that the by-pass road should be reserved and proclaimed, but where we have the opportunity to make use of the existing roads through such a town for some time to come, it is a great convenience to the residents of that town to do so. It is claimed that the removal of traffic from the streets will promote road safety, but I contend, as far as that aspect is concerned, that it can also be said that anybody who travels long distances without a break or without an opportunity to have a cup of tea in such a town to refresh himself, overtaxes himself to such an extent by the long distances that he has to drive that it involves an equally great danger. I think fewer accidents take place in these small towns, where the roads can still carry the present traffic, than on the long stretches on which people become overtired and then find themselves involved in an accident. I want to make it clear therefore that while we welcome this measure, we want to ask the hon. the Minister to come to our assistance and to see that these towns are not by-passed unnecessarily until it becomes absolutely essential to do so.</p>

<p>I also want to emphasize another aspect and that is that these roads are sometimes planned by people who shrink from the task of building the road on the old foundations because of the fact that traffic is very troublesome when the construction of such a road is in progress. They then construct a new road close to the existing road. Here I want to associate myself with previous speakers who pleaded that the existing route should be followed as far as possible. Great inconvenience is caused by constructing a new road close to an existing one. Not only is the soil of the old road destroyed, but the entire structure has to be dug up and it is practically valueless to the owner. But the travelling public who pass and see that a second hard-surface road is being constructed close to another one, while they themselves are pining to get a hard-surface road in some remote area, cannot help feeling that there is a certain amount of extravagance. Very reliable experts have told me that it is in fact possible to build a road more cheaply on the old foundations, <span class="col_1165-1166" refersTo="page_599"/>if the old route is followed, but that there is just the inconvenience that the traffic on that road makes it difficult to build the road. I want to ask the Minister therefore to keep this in mind when it comes to planning the route of roads. We often find that a very slight bend, which would not have caused any inconvenience, is removed and that a straight route, which leads to great inconvenience, is introduced. I want to express my gratitude for the provision in terms of which it will now be possible to pay compensation for the small piece of land which now becomes useless to the man concerned. But I also want to support the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) who mentioned the fact that land can be consolidated with the land of his neighbour on the other side, and <i>vice versa.</i> But great problems are involved. Permission has to be obtained in respect of the small piece of land which is cut off; it has to be consolidated with the other land and the surveyor&#x2019;s fees and other costs are high. We therefore ask that this be kept in mind.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by expressing my gratitude that we are now timeously making provision for future expansion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Even at the risk of being regarded as a new recruit to the &#x201C;we-thank-the-Minister&#x201D; chorus in this House, I want to say at the outset that I, too, appreciate the introduction by the Minister of this Bill. I am happy to say that having regard to certain negotiations, of which the Minister is very well aware, he has yesterday delivered the goods, and on time&#x2014;and for that many people in South Africa and particularly in the city in which my constituency lies&#x2014;Johannesburg&#x2014; will be grateful to the Minister. However, I think that he will, perhaps, prefer a more critical examination of this Bill than he has had this afternoon from some members on the other side of the House, because we have often been told that the Government welcomes criticism, provided it is constructive. And I make bold to say that any criticism I may make will be rather in the nature of a suggestion here and there which will improve the working of the Bill or bring nearer the attainment of the object for which this Bill has been framed, and will therefore, I hope, be regarded by the Minister, and all concerned, as constructive, and not destructive.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister will agree that there are several persons, committees and even corporate bodies to whom credit should be given for the work that has been done in advancing the project&#x2014;of which I will only deal with one example&#x2014;the project of providing this country with the best possible means of road transportation by providing the best possible road system. And among those to whom great credit is due, I think we should in the first place mention the Borckenhagen Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Carl Borckenhagen, whom many of us know personally&#x2014;a committee appointed by the Government, which has done a tremendous amount of work in analysing the financial aspects of this very matter we are considering to-day, and a committee which, I think, has produced what might be considered as a monumental report on the subject, and Johannesburg, certainly, having regard to its long and even long-drawn-out relations with the Borckenhagen Committee, recognizes the merits of the chairman of the committee as well as the report the committee has produced.</p>

<p>There is, of course, widespread recognition, of which this Bill is evidence, of the need to plan in South Africa for future road expansion. First of all, here is an issue of <i>The Open Road, Die Oop Pad</i> which is the official journal of the South African Road Federation, which has had a great deal to do with the planning of the roads of South Africa, and in the current issue, the January issue, there is the following statement which I think is very relevant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit moet egter nie verwag word dat ons in die onmiddellike toekoms &#x2019;n stelsel van autostrada, Autobahnen, langafstand-snelpaaie en dies meer in die lewe gaan roep nie. Om te beplan is een ding en om dit uit te voer &#x2019;n ander. Hoofsaak is egter dat &#x2019;n plan en &#x2019;n voorneme om dit uit te voer bestaan, en dat ons vroe&#x00EB;r of later die padstelsel sal h&#x00EA; wat ons vinnige uitbreiding in elke rigting regverdig.</block>

<p>In other words, there is already common cause about the fact that the need is there and that the planning has been undertaken to meet that need. There is further reference, Sir, to the need, in a reference not only of the position in South Africa, but in terms of the whole Continent with which we are in fact closely linked and will I think be more closely concerned in the future. The statement in regard to this need and the fact that there is so much room still left for growth, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Compared with Europe, the road system and vehicle traffic seems small in relation to the size of the African Continent. Figures which were published recently by the International Road Federation show that in 1960 there were a total of 839,260 miles of paved roads in Europe, carrying 27,488,361 vehicles, whilst there were 70,167 miles of paved roads carrying 2,431,655 vehicles in Africa. <br/>But comparatively the rate of increase in road traffic in many parts of Africa is phenomenal.</block>

<p>And I say, as an aside, that applies more particularly to the Republic of South Africa. &#x201C;The three main tests of traffic growth, vehicles licensed, motor fuel and oil consumption and traffic census figures, all confirmed a very big increase in road usage in recent years.&#x201D; And if I may refer to one other matter which was raised here and with which I want to deal in greater detail, I would say that the problem is naturally of special interest to South Africa which has over 1,000,000 of the 2,500,000 <span class="col_1167-1168" refersTo="page_600"/>vehicles on this Continent, and certainly of even greater interest in this context of South Africa, to the largest city in South Africa, Johannesburg. I should at this stage indicate to the House that there the planning of expressways, throughways, call them what you will, has been in hand for many years, and this is borne out again in this particular publication which states, in regard to Johannesburg, that the first part of the expressway programme will be completed by 1966, that is, four years hence. I refer to this because I think it is time that hon. members should realize that this is much more than an academic matter, a theoretical position which is being dealt with by a Bill, the effect of which may be felt at some future time. In fact, it deals with something which has already been commenced, in respect of at least one aspect of the entire problem. The article then continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first section is expected to come into operation in about four years time. The expressways will have a six-lane divided double carriage-way so there should be no collisions with oncoming traffic. The lanes will have an adequate width of 12 feet. Many kinds of vehicles will probably be prohibited, including all two-wheeled vehicles, animal-drawn traffic, trolley-buses, and perhaps even all buses. Trade vehicles will be permitted.</block>

<p>That gives in a very brief outline the position that has already been reached in the City of Johannesburg. In fact in this city the ratepayers are aware that for some years they have actually been in the throes of a R64,000,000 road improvement scheme, and therefore I believe it is fair to say that the impulse for this legislation, at least the major impulse, comes from the planning undertaken in the City of Johannesburg, where, Sir (and I want to make a slight correction to what the hon. member for Turffontein said yesterday), this planning was embarked upon as long ago as 1946, when the City Council of Johannesburg undertook to plan its post-war development scheme for all the aspects of urban life in a large city, and this Johannesburg Traffic Plan to which I have referred is a part of that post-war planning scheme, and in turn the Traffic Plan includes the planning of the two expressways to which reference was made by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) yesterday. It is this planning which has, through the years, resulted in the necessity for the Bill which is before the House to-day. This brochure, which I certainly do not intend to read to the House, contains in a very condensed form, the scheme for Johannesburg&#x2019;s traffic development and/or its expressways. May I say at the outset, Sir, that I am not referring to this brochure because I, as Mayor of Johannesburg in 1960, had some responsibility in bringing it out, and because I had some responsibility in previous years for the planning of this expressway system. But I do bring it to the notice of hon. members because this is a blueprint for a throughway or expressway or autobahn-system for South Africa. In considering any sort of progress in our country, we have in many cases to go outside the borders of South Africa in order to find out what a particular matter is all about. But I make bold to say, Mr. Speaker, that at least in so far as a throughway is concerned, we already have in substance that experience and that know-how&#x2014;partly acquired from the experience gained overseas but developed in South Africa for South African use&#x2014;in respect of this particular scheme. This brochure is very amply illustrated with every kind of graph and diagram and with visual illustrations of how an expressway from one end to the other of the city, from north to south, east to west and vice versa, will alleviate traffic congestion and will make access easy, or easier and will in fact greatly benefit not only the city but the country in which it flourishes. Incidentally, Sir, I would also say that the brochure is a credit to the South African printing industry. I am quite sure that any member of this House who is interested will be able readily to obtain a copy either in English or in Afrikaans from the Town Clerk of Johannesburg. I make this offer, Sir, without any authority, but I believe it can be obtained.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY-SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must come back to the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to do so, Sir. I merely indicated that the Bill dealt with throughways, unless I have misread the entire Bill. I do not think it is commonly known in this House that this matter is not one purely of theory and of planning in advance, but that there is in fact a portion of an expressway system already in existence in this country. I submit, Sir, that can reasonably be held to be relevant to the Bill.</p>

<p>We realize that all the larger cities in South Africa, if they do not already face the same problem, will in the very near future face the problem which beset Johannesburg in embarking upon its planning of an expressway system. There are over 180,000 vehicles registered in Johannesburg to-day and the number is still increasing, as is commonly known. The main consideration for Johannesburg&#x2014;and for that matter for any local authority now or in the future&#x2014;in regard to planning an expressway or a throughway is that of finance. As I have said before, the knowledge and the experience is available but the question of money crops up immediately&#x2014;and that is one of the problems which this Bill is obviously designed to solve. I think that perhaps with some adaptation the Bill may answer that very important question: How and by whom should the money for a throughway be provided? Here, Sir, I want to draw attention again to the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Financial Relations between the Central Government and the Provinces and the Local Authorities. The third interim report of the Borckenhagen Committee deals with the subject <span class="col_1169-1170" refersTo="page_601"/>of the financing of roadworks. The hon. Minister said yesterday that whereas he had taken note of the report of that committee of inquiry, he was not necessarily going to accept their recommendations. The fact appears to be that to some extent at any rate, the hon. Minister has accepted some of the recommendations of that Committee of Inquiry. Because one of the things recommended in this report is briefly that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa and all those concerned with the planning of its roads should look far ahead, as far ahead as possible&#x2026;.</block>

<p>This, I submit, is what the City of Johannesburg has already done. The relevant recommendation appears in paragraph 178 which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore if, after a full study of all the problems, of the various possible solutions and of the costs involved, a particular Local Authority as well as the National Transport Commission and the Provincial Administration concerned are satisfied that the provision of a freeway system will become necessary in the future, immediate consideration should be given to the steps to be taken towards freezing development along such freeway and securing the necessary rights-of-way. In this latter connection the cost of interest on capital and loss of rate income in the case of early pre-emption should be weighed against the possible rise in property values if this is delayed.</block>

<p>Hon members on the other side of the House have dealt with this aspect of the matter in regard to its impact on the farming community. But, quite clearly, from the financial point of view, that is not of any consequence whatsoever in comparison with its impact on an urban local authority when it has to acquire expensive urban land in order to provide a freeway. It is not necessary for me to develop that point. Furthermore, all these recommendations which I am sure the hon. Minister has studied, are fully relevant to the subject under consideration to-day. There is a schedule in paragraph 180 which sets out the total capital expenditure of the cities of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban and Johannesburg. It shows, opposite each one of these local authorities, the annual interest and redemption, and then shows as a percentage of the 1959-60 total net income. The report goes on to say in paragraph 181&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the above it will be apparent that the costs of the major roadworks (and particularly of freeways) envisaged for these cities is so large that if they were to be borne solely out of their own resources they would impose a crippling burden upon the ratepayers.</block>

<p>I should like to know from the hon. the Minister to what extent&#x2014;because he apparently has certain reservations on the report of this Committee&#x2014;he has been impressed with that particular recommendation.</p>

<p>I would like to know why the hon Minister who up to now has been extremely patient with everybody else in this House, becomes impatient when I refer to the Borckenhagen Committee which was appointed by the Government.</p>

<p>Anyway, Mr. Speaker, subject to your ruling, I quote this committee which goes on to say in paragraph 195&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Briefly, therefore, the Committee is of opinion&#x2014; <br/>(i) that the provision of ordinary streets (other than main arterial roads) is a fair charge against fixed property taxation and the other sources of revenue at present available to urban Local Authorities.</block>

<p>Then it goes on to say in sub-paragraph (ii)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">that it is neither equitable nor desirable that the high cost of arterial roads in urban areas should be financed wholly from municipal revenues and that a substantial proportion should be financed from motor taxation.</block>

<p>The very argument may hinge around the difference between the definition by the hon. Minister of &#x201C;substantial&#x201D; and my definition as a ratepayer of Johannesburg. We find the following statement in paragraph 199&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After full and careful consideration the Committee has come to the conclusion that the better course to adopt is along the lines proposed by such bodies as the Automobile Association of South Africa, the South African Road Federation, the Association of Chambers of Commerce and others. The Committee accordingly recommends that the National Transport Commission should retain <span class="col_1171-1172" refersTo="page_602"/>control of its present sources of revenue, and of any necessary increases thereto. The Commission&#x2019;s responsibilities should however be widened to enable it to have due regard to and to co-ordinate the overall requirements in respect of the whole arterial road system of the country and to take over greater financial responsibility for portions thereof in both urban and rural areas.</block>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, if I must remind the hon. Minister of such recommendations, but I believe it is my duty to do so.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I can only hope that the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) has read this report. The report goes on to say in paragraph 201&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the opinion of the Committee that urban roads which link up with the arterial network should be regarded as an extension and a part of the arterial system; this should apply not only to the arterial roads proceeding directly through the central business areas of towns, but also (in cases where these are by-passed) to the roads linking the central business areas to the main roads &#x2026; Accordingly although the Committee considers that these arterial roads in urban areas should be regarded as a part of the national network, it nevertheless considers that the urban communities (except in the cases of small villages) should contribute to their cost &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, I want to point out that I am trying to give both sides of the picture. It says very clearly that &#x201C;urban communities (except in the cases of small villages) should contribute to their cost &#x2026;&#x201D; I do not want the hon. Minister to think, therefore, that I am building up to the argument that the Government should bear the full cost of a freeway or a throughway. That is not the point. Paragraph 203 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the costs of obtaining rights-of-way and of providing bridges, elevated roadways and certain other services are inevitably and directly connected with the provision of such roads, the Committee considers that these costs should be included in the overall costs in respect of which the financial responsibility should be shared.</block>

<p>I have noted here, Sir, at least six other references to the financing of throughways made in the third interim report of this Committee, which, I think, emphasize the point that I have tried to make. But for all sorts of reasons, including the possibility that this may become irksome, I am not going to pursue this aspect further.</p>

<p>What I want to say, however, Sir, is this that in the case of the throughways planned and already in hand in the case of one local authority&#x2014;namely Johannesburg&#x2014;we must of necessity regard this example as the prototype, or the &#x201C;guinea-pig&#x201D; if you wish. Therefore I should like to make, with great deference, some proposals to the hon. the Minister in regard to an approach to the local authorities concerned, now or in future, with the building and the financing of throughways and expressways. I am convinced that other local authorities will subsequently benefit very considerably from our own deliberations here, and from the proposals which I wish to place before the Minister. In the first place, I believe that although the National Transport Commission seems to be reluctant to agree with the point of view that the payments of the subsidy to a local authority&#x2014;in this case Johannesburg&#x2014;should be made over a period of ten years&#x2014;the Commission prefers a period of twelve years&#x2014;it is necessary to make an appeal to the Minister that, on the evidence contained in this Borckenhagen report, at any rate, he should agree to the proposal that the payments should be spread over ten years. The main reason is this: The impact of the cost of the throughway is greater in the first four years than it is in the succeeding six years. In other words, you have to find more money during the first four years of your ten year scheme than you have to find in the subsequent six years.</p>

<p>Another point which is very important and relevant to this proposal is that practically 25 per cent of the total cost of a throughway is in respect of land that has to be acquired. That land, as you know Sir, cannot be acquired piece-meal as the throughway progresses mile by mile. It has to be acquired well in advance, as I and other hon. members have already pointed out, in the interests not only of the local authority concerned, but in the national interest. Therefore, because some 70 per cent of the total expenditure on a ten year plan&#x2014; and we have demonstrated this in regard to one city at any rate&#x2014;has to be found within the first four years, I should like to ask the Minister to give consideration not only to the question of spreading the subsidy over ten instead of twelve years, but to the question of paying out the subsidy <i>pro rata</i> or in proportion to the work completed, including the cost of the expropriation of land, instead of in equal annual or monthly instalments as is presently proposed. This will obviate the situation which will otherwise arise&#x2014;it has already arisen in this one case&#x2014;where the loans plus the interest which have to be raised by the local authority to finance its part of the cost of the scheme, become a burden on the ratepayers, because those loan charges cannot be charged to the scheme as such. In the interests of the local authority, I would urge the hon. the Minister to give regard to this particular need. If the Minister were to agree to this proposal and if payment of this subsidy were to be made according to the rate of expenditure on the scheme, that is on the construction of the throughways, I think the Minister can reasonably be asked to vary the formula by giving the particular local authority permission to use <span class="col_1173-1174" refersTo="page_603"/>this subsidy, say during the first three years to acquire the necessary land and not to restrict it, as. appears to be the intention at the present time, to using its subsidy purely on construction purposes.</p>

<p>I should also like to say that in the case of the City of Johannesburg or in the case of any other local authority, it might be very necessary, let alone advisable, for the Government at an early stage, perhaps at this stage, to lay down a policy which would serve to encourage the local authorities which have vital interest in this matter, to embark on the planning of those throughways which they need. The Borckenhagen Committee has given at least three other instances of local authorities that have that in mind, local authorities that have plans or intentions, but that are hampered by the lack of finance.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) who said yesterday, before the adjournment, that there had been certain comments from this side of the House, but no firm proposals. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider a basis of subsidy, Rand-for-Rand, as between the higher authority, that is the governmental authority, and the local authority, in regard to the entire cost of the freeway. There are such systems in operation. It is conditional in certain instances that they should be based on the &#x00A3; for &#x00A3; basis, or the R for R basis as it is to-day. In this way the Government, which represents the national interest, and the local authority, which represents only a section of that national interest, will indeed become partners in a scheme that can only lead to the fruition of all the plans to give South Africa a full-scale, comprehensive and serviceable road system at the minimum cost. With that, I would urge once again upon the hon. the Minister that whereas I, as a member of this House and as the representative of my constituents in Johannesburg, am grateful for this Bill, I do believe that it would be improved if he would adopt some of the suggestions that have been made by members on this side of the House, including my suggestions.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that this Bill is receiving the support of both sides of the House. It certainly makes the task of the administering authority much easier when it knows that when it applies the provisions of an Act which sometimes affects certain individuals adversely it has the general support of the public.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) queried the correctness of the term &#x201C;appropriation&#x2019;; he suggested that it should be replaced by &#x201C;expropriatory&#x201D;. I too queried that matter with my Department. The term &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; has appeared in the principal Act since 1940 and the terminology has to be uniform. That is why the term &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; is used in the amending Bill is well. I am advised by my legal advisers that it serves the same purpose, that &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; and &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; mean exactly the same. I am not prepared to argue on that point.</p>

<p>Possibly if the United Party administered the Act it would.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 2 the hon. member wanted more information. He also expressed his concern about the powers conferred upon the National Transport Commission to appropriate. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) also dealt with this matter and suggested that expropriation should only take place with the owner&#x2019;s consent. That of course, Mr. Speaker, is not feasible. Expropriation only takes place in cases where the owner does not consent. Otherwise there would be no purpose in making provision for expropriation if at the same time you stipulated that the owner must consent to that expropriation. It nullifies the whole process. If he has to consent expropriation will not be necessary. Then there is provision that the land can be acquired by treaty or otherwise.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>Don&#x2019;t you appropriate something with the consent of Parliament. Perhaps you could appropriate instead of expropriate with the consent of the owner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The only thing we can do is to leave expropriation or appropriation, if they have the same meaning, right out of the provision. But then certain difficulties will arise. It happens that as a result of expropriation of land for road purposes, small pieces of land are cut off. Very often those small pieces of land are of very little value to the owners and the National Transport Commission must provide egress from or ingress to those pieces of land. That may have to be done by way of building a bridge or constructing a subway. The value of that land may be very much less than the cost of building the bridge or constructing the subway. The owner, on the other hand, might place an exorbitant value on that land. He might demand a price that is out of all proportion to its real value. In that case the National Transport Commission should have the right to expropriate to prevent exploitation of the Commission by a landowner who places an exorbitant value on his land, a piece of land that is really useless to him. Consequently if we do not have a provision for expropriation it will simply mean that the Board will be unable to purchase that land at the price asked for by the owner and that a bridge or a subway will have to be constructed at a very high cost. That is why it is necessary to have this provision namely that the National Transport Commission can expropriate. I can also assure hon. members that the Commission will not act unreasonably. Obviously if the National Transport Commission expropriates valuable farm land, there will be an immediate outcry and as always happens they will probably approach the Minister and make complaints to him and the Minister will have to take action. I do not think there will <span class="col_1175-1176" refersTo="page_604"/>be any abuse of this power which we are giving to the National Transport Commission to expropriate under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 5 the hon. member dealt with throughways, but as the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) also dealt with this matter, I will deal with it when replying to him. In regard to Clause 6 the hon. member rightly stated that the National Transport Commission will be the sole judge as to the number of bridges over or subways under a road to be constructed on a declared road or as to whether the number of bridges, subways and gates to provide access is adequate. The principal Act stipulates that reasonable access must be provided, but the Act does not say who must decide what &#x201C;reasonable access&#x201D; is. As a result of that numerous difficulties have arisen in the past. I agree, Mr. Speaker, that there is no recourse to the courts as this provision is framed at present and that no appeal is provided for. But this is nothing unusual. We have a number of Acts where the decision of one or other body or one or other individual is final. I have in mind the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. There in it is provided that the decision of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commission shall be final and there is no recourse to the courts from that decision. Even the Railways Service Act provides that in regard to appeals the decision of the Railway Board is final and that there shall be no recourse to the courts and there is no further appeal. But the difficulty in regard to providing for appeal especially to the Minister is that the Minister is always subjected to political pressure. And apart from that, if the Minister has to deal with dozens and possibly hundreds of appeals in regard to the provision of accesses or ingress or egress to and from properties adjoining a national road, another Minister would probably have to be appointed to deal with the ordinary administrative work of the Department. But I say, Sir, that if the National Transport Commission acts unreasonably complaints will immediately be made and the Minister will in any case be approached and I can give hon. members the assurance that if I find that these powers are not justified, if the National Transport Commission does act unreasonably, I am quite prepared to come back to this House and to amend the Act to provide at least for an appeal.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 7 the hon. member suggested that if I found that they did not need these powers I should come back to this House and amend the Act. I can assure him that if undue hardship is caused and it is found necessary I shall certainly do so. But all members agree that it is absolutely essential that there should be effective control. There has been no effective control in the past. The very least that we can do is to give these new provisions a trial. As hon. members know there is a provision in this particular clause for compensation to be paid in certain cases.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Kempton Park also dealt with the provisions of Clause 2, but I have already dealt with that in my reply to the hon. member for Wynberg. As regards Clause 5 the hon. member felt that there were not sufficient sanctions in the event of an urban authority not complying with the conditions laid down by the National Transportation Commission. I feel, however, that the sanctions already provided for, namely that if the conditions laid down by the Transportation Commission are not complied with, not only the subsidy, the money still to be paid, may be withheld, but that the money which has already been paid to the local authority may also be recovered, are sufficient. The National Transportation Commission is mainly concerned with the planning of that particular throughway through the city, of which it naturally has to approve. The most important matters are the accesses to that throughway. As far as the other matters are concerned, they are matters for the local authority. But provided the throughway is constructed in accordance with the standards laid down for a throughway, the National Transportation Commission will naturally give the necessary financial assistance to the local authority.</p>

<p>As regards Clauses 6 and 7 the hon. member asked that accesses, and even accesses which are refused by the Transportation Commission and which have been closed, should also be registered on the title deeds. I have no objection to that in principle, but I cannot do such a thing without consulting my colleague, for it would be improper on the part of any Minister to place a heavy burden of work on the officials of another Minister. The hon. member must bear in mind that there are literally thousands of owners whose land adjoins the national road and that there are therefore thousands and thousands of entrances to those properties from the national road which would have to be registered. This would naturally place a very great burden on the Registrar of Deeds. I doubt whether he or his Minister would agree to having this burden placed on him, because we have already had to struggle a good deal to get him to agree that the restrictive conditions contained in the Advertising on Roads and Ribbon Development Act may be registered. Then there is also the question of costs. Every owner would of course have to bear the cost of such registration and I personally am convinced that owners in general would raise considerable objection to it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) dealt with Clause 5 and quoted the recommendations of the Borckenhagen Committee&#x2019;s report in support of his arguments. We are not discussing the policy of the National Transport Commission now; we are discussing this amending Bill, and Clause 5 merely provides that the National Transport Commission can financially assist local authorities without the necessity of having a throughway proclaimed as a declared road. In regard to the general policy of the National Transport Commission, this is not the appropriate time <span class="col_1177-1178" refersTo="page_605"/>to discuss it. The hon. member can discuss it under my Vote.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No, but the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) did. He was quite off the road throughout his speech. The hon. member for Turffontein asked me to make a statement of policy in regard to the financial assistance that the National Transport Commission will give to local authorities for the construction of freeways. All I want to say in this regard is that financial assistance will be given and it has already been decided to give some financial assistance to local authorities for the construction of freeways, but I cannot agree to definite percentages being embodied in a Bill such as this. The reason for that is that the funds are limited and the available funds must be spread over a large number of projects. Those funds must be utilized for the building of national roads, special roads, for the redemption and interest on loans, administrative expenses, contributions to the National Parks Board and the Level Crossings Committee. Consequently the Transport Commission is compelled to cut its coat according to its cloth and it cannot give substantial financial assistance to urban authorities at the expense of building national roads or special roads. I want to give the hon. member some indication of what it would cost if the Transport Commission had to bear the whole of the cost of the construction of freeways. There are about 200 towns concerned along the national roads and the average length of the route through these towns that will come under consideration for the building of freeways is three miles per town. That means that approximately 600 miles of throughways will have to be constructed. at an estimated cost of Rl,200,000,000, which of course is a financial burden the Road Fund cannot carry. The Transport Commission has already decided to contribute an amount of R40,000,000 over the next ten years to the cost of construction of freeways through certain urban areas. That is all I can say in that regard.</p>

<p>*The hon member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) has talked about Clause 9 in connection with trading on proclaimed roads. I have great sympathy for those people who are affected by it, but the hon. member himself has mentioned all the good reasons why that prohibition should be passed by Parliament and I certainly cannot improve on them. I am sure that some farmers are uneasy. I have also received letters. There are farmers who have created an independent market, and, as the hon. member has said, this has contributed to the elimination of the middle man, who is not always such an evil as farmers suggest, because I just want to say in parenthesis that without the middle man very little distribution of farm products would take place. But what the hon. member must remember is that this little group of farmers is a privileged group. These farmers had the privilege to sell their produce on proclaimed roads because of the fact that their farms border on proclaimed roads. But other farmers producing the same product are compelled to use the ordinary marketing channels. In other words, a privilege which a certain group of farmers had is now being taken away, a privilege which the vast majority of the farmers producing the same produce did not have. As always happens when legislation of general national interest is introduced, there are individuals who are personally affected, and that is also true in this case. But I cannot see how we can say that the sale of one pocket of oranges on the road is worth the life of a human being. This happened again the other day. A Coloured youngster ran across the road with a bag of fruit in order to get to a car and was killed. Is it worth while even for ten pockets of oranges? It is really in the general interest that this prohibition should be introduced. No matter how sorry I am for those farmers or for the hon. member, because it is mainly his constituency which is affected, it is a necessary provision.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) talked about a matter which has nothing to do with this Bill. She asked that compensation be paid for ground which is taken for the building of national roads. She said, quite correctly, that compensation is paid for improved land. In this connection I just want to say that this is a matter which affects all the provinces. No compensation is paid for unimproved land used for road purposes. If therefore I were to accept the principal in this measure that compensation must be paid, it would also affect the provinces and there would be quite a lot of opposition. I am very sorry that I cannot grant this request.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) has asked that I would see to it that the cutting up of land is not aimed too far. I entirely agree with him that where it can be obviated, it should be obviated. I have already instructed the Transportation Commission not to make deviations or to divert roads or to cut up land unnecessarily, but that where it is at all possible the existing road should be re-built rather than construct a new road to eliminate unnecessary bends, etc. As regards the planning of roads, I also think that organized agriculture can be consulted.</p>

<p>I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timony) on his maiden speech and I can assure him that the matters he dealt with will receive attention.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) has asked whether it will be illegal to sell over the fence after this provision comes into force. My information is that it will not be illegal, but if such a case goes to court it will be for the court to decide that is to say, where a person sells his goods over the fence to people in the roads. I only hope that it will not happen, because then one will again have cars pulling up alongside the road.</p>

<p><span class="col_1179-1180" refersTo="page_606"/>The hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) in his concluding remarks said that it disturbs one&#x2019;s aesthetic feelings when one sees the beauties of nature so ruthlessly destroyed to make way for a road. I agree with him, but I think it has its compensations. How many inaccessible beauties of nature are revealed to people by the building of roads? And then I think that a road has a beauty of its own. What is more beautiful than to see a road snaking its way up a mountainside, passing through green valleys and forests and crossing deep gorges. Roads are the arteries of civilization. Where well-built roads are found, one will always find civilization. Then there is the romance of roads. Think of the Great North Road leading to new lands and peoples, and who can ever forget the Via Appia, the road leading from Rome? I think everyone who has ever seen that road will always remember it. When you stand on that road you think of the legend when Peter fled from Rome and Christ appeared before him and he asked Christ: &#x201C;Quo Vadis, Domine?&#x201D; and Christ replied &#x201C; back to Rome to be crucified again&#x201D;. On that road you still see paving-stones laid down by the builders almost 2,000 years ago, and in your imagination you again see the legions of Caesar marching along that road to conquer the world. As I have said it has its compensations, despite the fact that sometimes the beauties of nature have to make way for them.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill now be read a second time.</block>

<p>This is also a Bill which is not contentious. In the main, all the proposed amendments are intended to achieve a greater measure of protection for our network of national and special roads.</p>

<p>At the outset I wish to emphasize that the Provincial Administrations are also closely concerned with this matter, they have been fully consulted by my Department and the National Transportation Commission and I have pleasure in reporting that the Provincial Administrations fully agree with the proposed amendments.</p>

<p>The Advertising on Roads and Ribbon Development Act, 1940, has now been in force for about 22 years and the experience gained over this long period has brought to light many loopholes and defects. There is real danger that our existing national and special roads are fast becoming inadequate and out of date and that they will eventually have to be written off and rebuilt unless immediate steps are taken to protect the existing assets. The greatest deterioration of proclaimed roads is undoubtedly caused by ribbon development and, in particular, by the conversion of these roads into business streets with the attendant gradual smothering process.</p>

<p>Clause 1 is necessary because the National Roads Board has been abolished and all its powers, functions and duties have been transferred to the National Transportation Commission. Clause 2 is designed to give greater powers to the National Transportation Commission to exercise effective control over the display of advertisements along proclaimed roads outside urban areas, with special reference to the so-called curtilage advertisements.</p>

<p>In the absence of a definition of &#x201C;curtilage&#x201D; in the principal Act, difficulties are continuously arising in the application of the particular provisions of the principal Act. The original idea was not to restrict businesses along the road unduly, but the position has got completely out of control. In most cases the main object of such curtilage advertisements is no longer that the traveller should come into the shop concerned and buy the advertised product, but to serve as a general exhortation to the general public to buy the particular product wherever it may be offered for sale.</p>

<p>As indicated during the last session of Parliament, there are loopholes in the existing legislation which allow the erection of advertisements which not only disfigure the landscape, but which are a real danger from the road safety point of view. It must be realized that the more effective the advertisement, the greater the danger for road safety. At the time I also indicated that amending legislation would be introduced to combat this problem and I hope that this measure will now enjoy the support promised to me last year.</p>

<p>Apart from the disquieting number of advertisements which are springing up alongside our roads outside urban areas to-day, there is the extremely disturbing feature of the size of some of these advertisements. Instances of advertisements being displayed measuring 42 feet by 12 feet by 17 feet have already come to the attention of the National Transportation Commission. In another instance the advertisement is actually bigger than the little building in which the advertised business is carried on.</p>

<p>Another aspect which is disturbing is the tendency to-day on the part of some advertisers to use reflecting material more and more in the manufacture of their advertisements. Such advertisements are visible at great distances, distract the attention of drivers from the road, and affect the safety factor adversely.</p>

<p>The effect of this provision will be that advertisers may in future only advertise on the building in which the advertiser carries <span class="col_1181-1182" refersTo="page_607"/>on business or in which the advertised article is offered for sale without the approval in writing of the controlling authority. It must be emphasized, however, that the proposed amendments only relate to trade advertisements. I want to add here immediately that I have also reviewed the position of the Administration of the South African Railways in this regard. The exemption formerly enjoyed by the Railways in respect of advertisements erected within the boundaries of a railway station, siding or halt, is being withdrawn.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c) of Clause 2 is designed to grant to advertisers who are presently displaying advertisements which are permitted by existing legislation but which do not qualify under the new provisions, a period of grace before they will be required to remove their advertisements.</p>

<p>Clause 3 is in the main designed to make the provision as comprehensive as possible. Structures of whatever nature, whether above or below the surface of the ground, will now be included in the prohibition.</p>

<p>Paragraph (i) of Clause 3 deletes from the principal Act a provision which has never been used and has accordingly become redundant.</p>

<p>Clause 4, in my opinion, is self-explanatory. It deals with the prohibition on the erection of structures near the intersections of certain roads. There has been a strong tendency for a long time to erect business premises preferably at important intersections and junctions. Fly-over bridges etc. will eventually have to be constructed at all these points and the proposed provision will ensure that ground required for this purpose will remain undeveloped. This will also help in the struggle against the establishment of the many businesses which are springing up like mushrooms to-day next to declared roads. This applies particularly to cases where a declared road is diverted so as not to pass through the central business area of a town. These businesses are established only to the detriment of existing businesses in the town and it is imperative to exercise control so that existing businesses may be protected. It is the considered opinion of the National Transportation Commission that trading should as far as possible be confined to towns and cities.</p>

<p>The intention of Clause 5 is that Section 10 of the principal Act should no longer apply to declared roads. Comprehensive provision is made in another amending bill for the effective control over accesses to declared roads.</p>

<p>Clause 6 authorizes the controlling authority to impose conditions in respect of the consolidated property in certain cases where a consolidation of adjoining properties takes place. The Surveyors-General and the Chief Registrar of Deeds are in full agreement with the proposed amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 7 provides for the extension of the penal provision. In the absence of a penal provision for a contravention of Section 10 of the principal Act, it is extremely difficult to apply its provisions. The Provincial Administrations welcome the provision which is being made here.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think this House will long delay the passing of this measure. We approve the principle of preventing unsightly and dangerous ribbon development along our National Highways. Indeed, we have asked for such legislation in the past, and of course we do not intend to oppose it but to facilitate its passage through the House. We know that the 1948 Act did not work as satisfactorily as was expected. Advantage was taken of loopholes in the law to build not only unsightly but dangerous erections and advertising hoardings and devices along our national roads. We have been anxious, for aesthetic as well as safety reasons, to see that this development was adequately controlled. The original latitude that was allowed was permitted with the intention that those who happened to adjoin a national road or had a business near one and wished genuinely to advertise their business or the wares they sold should be allowed to do so. I hope even now that, in spite of the powers which are being granted to prevent unsightly ribbon development, ready permission will be given to anyone who wants to make unobjectionable use of road-signs for legitimate purposes. I realize that sanctions must be imposed, but I hope that permission will be readily granted in a genuine case. As the Minister said, the original intention was that anyone could advertise his own wares, to show what he had for sale. But this right has been badly abused. Little shops that sell certain articles, often in very small quantities, were made use of by national advertisers to advertise their products on an enormous scale. It was known that no speeding motorist ever intended to stop and purchase those particular articles at those particular shops. In other words, advantage was taken of the definition and they were enabled to erect huge and often very unsightly signs along our national roads. We hope it will now be adequately controlled. We hope that permission will never be arbitrarily withheld but that unsightly or dangerous erections and poster sites will be curbed.</p>

<p>Now, of course, there is never any measure which is introduced without having some corresponding disadvantage for somebody. I believe that the Minister has had representations made to him by certain commercial men, such as the sign manufacturers, who will suffer. They declare that their livelihood will be adversely affected as the result of the new regulatory laws now to be passed. We all have sympathy for people in these circumstances. They have put up hoardings on which they get commissions. Others think that the sale of the products which they advertise may fall off. All feel that they should not be penalized for something they have done which was quite within the law. It seems that hardship <span class="col_1183-1184" refersTo="page_608"/>might be experienced if these advertisements are suddenly removed and they are suddenly deprived of an advantage which they enjoyed legally. The expense they incurred on building these erection and advertising signs will be a loss to them. But they should have been forewarned. We on this side of the House have made representations for this kind of control for many years. People who indulge in unaesthetic or dangerous practices should have been warned. In any case I have received the assurance that the contracts which have been entered into will be allowed to run out. Even after that time, provided there is nothing that offends either safety or aesthetic values, or which will run counter to this Act, will in future be permitted. Permission must be sought and I hope that in proper cases it will not be withheld. It is always difficult to weigh an even balance between the demands of different sections of commerce and industry. When a national road side-tracks the town, the inhabitants of that town always feel that they will lose business. They also make representations to us for protection. They say that there is an inevitable attempt by other competing businesses to establish themselves on the side of the national road in the neighbourhood of the town. That is being by-passed. The townsmen feel that they are suffering a loss, and indeed, they are. Many of the measures here are calculated to protect commerce in the town itself, especially the clause dealing with crossroad buildings and advertisements. It cannot be a fair objection to this Bill to say that those who have set up new businesses on a national road have a priority over the old established shops of the by-passed town or village. Commerce just outside the town must not be allowed to create ribbon development of an unsightly or hazardous nature. Hawking and other businesses along our national roads is also being controlled. The Minister has been so eloquent about the beauty of our roads that I know he also feels, as many of us do, that beauty should not be marred. But I hope that I am correct when I assume that this measure has been introduced only after consulation with representatives of industry and commerce who may be affected by it.</p>

<p>There is one question I should like to ask the Minister. I will give my own answer first to the question and see whether it is correct. I refer to the clause wherein he makes allowances, on national roads that are crossed by an ordinary road leading to a town or village, that no erection shall be put up within 1,500 feet from the crossroads. Is it the intention, in taking this vast area, to keep the crossroad free so that in future either a fly-over bridge or a roundabout can be made? In other words is his demand for this vast expanse at crossroads a &#x201C;look into the future&#x201D; and for the purpose of keeping our roads as up to date and safe as they should be?</p>

<p>That is the one idea.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I presume, also, that a secondary consideration is the protection it gives to the local merchant in the neighbouring town or village. When one is racing along a national road, one might be induced to stop and buy something if it was readily available on the side of the road. But if you have to turn off, say a thousand feet, your need must be very urgent or you must be nearly out of petrol before you do so. Thus this clause has the double purpose. It removes unsightly or dangerous buildings from our crossroads and it protects the commerce of the nearby town. I think probably the Minister did what I would do; he weighed up the respective merits of the two opposite claims of commercial interests and decided to come down on that side which leaned in favour of aesthetic values and safety.</p>

<p>Sir, as I have said we approve of this Bill. We believe that it will have good results; we believe that it will be the means of doing away with unsightly hoardings that have screamed their messages at us as we passed by a little village distracting our attention from the wheel. We believe that improper use has often been made of roadside buildings with advertisements. Perhaps one of the main offenders has been the Railway Administration itself. I have noticed with horror the use that has been made of some Railway sites. Hoardings can be used to good effect; they can hide an unsightly goods yard or building. But in many cases the Railway Administration has allowed advertisements to be put up in a very ugly and dangerous way. The Minister himself admits that the more attractive and appealing an advertisement is, the more dangerous that poster may be to a passing motorist. I believe he may have been interested in some of the attractive, curvacious women depicted on posters&#x2014;dangerous curves on dangerous curves. They tell me that once, in rounding a curve, because he did not wish to be tempted by the sex-appeal attractions of a poster, he closed his eyes to hide the sinful sight, and bumped into the kerb. Is that correct? To become serious, we are glad&#x2014;and it shows the Minister&#x2019;s good faith&#x2014;that he has included, within the prohibitions of this Bill, the Railway Administration. We know it will mean a considerable loss of revenue. We know that pressure was brought to bear on the Minister to exclude the Railways. We are pleased that he has not yielded. We welcome this Bill and will give it an easy passage through the House.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>When approaching Cape Town along the road from the north, we see that against the bridge at Bellville there is an advertisement which has been standing there since 1958 and which says: &#x201C;It is time for a United Party Government&#x201D;. Since last year&#x2019;s election there is an advertisement &#x201C;Vote for Thompson&#x201D;. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister to make an exception in this case and not to prohibit this advertisement, because the United Party is cooperating so nicely with us to get these two Bills passed.</p>

<p><span class="col_1185-1186" refersTo="page_609"/>I want to thank the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) for the attitude adopted by him and I want to congratulate him on the objective manner in which he approached both this Bill and the previous one. I do not want to waste the time of the House by discussing the merits of this Bill, seeing that it has been received so favourably by both sides. But I feel that this House would be neglecting its duty to-day, seeing that we have this opportunity, if it did not express a word of thanks to the Minister of Transport for what he has done for road safety, not only by means of these two Bills but also through other legislation in the last few years. As an ex-Provincial Councillor I know the long and tiresome story of uniform legislation. We know about the mission overseas, and we know about the Joubert Report; we know about all the quarrels in regard to the licensing of tractors. It was a much more bloody battle, I think, than in regard to the naartjies that are sold along the roads. We know of the ideal we had to get uniformity and to put the Road Safety Organization on a new footing. I think I will have the support of both sides of the House and of the country outside if I say that this Minister in his time has done more than any of his predecessors in order to promote road safety, even though much still remains to be done.</p>

<p>One defect which I recognize immediately is that it will be of no use to combat trade and commerce on the national roads on the platteland whilst in the urban areas trade is still carried on, as in the suburban areas we drive through on the road to the north. And there are still gaps in regard to the Road Safety Organization also. I just want to mention one, and that is in respect of research. The Minister has omitted to tell us whether this measure comes before this House as the result of specific statistics and as the result of research done by the Road Safety Organizations. I am curious to know, when we deal with such legislation, whether we have that basis on which to stand, so that we know that statistics have given rise to this legislation. I shall be very glad if the Minister would give me a reply to that question.</p>

<p>Then I want to bring to his notice the question of whether we derive the maximum advantage from research done in other countries; whether by an exchange of information and of statistics we derive the maximum advantage from the money which is also being spent in other countries which have devoted much attention to the matter, such as Western Europe and the United States. When one considers the enforcement of road safety, i.e. the legislative side of it, one would like to know whether that is being done as the result of certain observations with regard to the reasons for road accidents. I should like to quote a Canadian medical practitioner here where he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Very little is actually known about what causes accidents, but all that is known points to the conclusion that accidents result when drivers find themselves in situations to which they cannot respond correctly, either because their minds don&#x2019;t work fast enough or simply because it&#x2019;s &#x201C;too late&#x201D;. A good number of these situations arise not from anyone being at fault, but simply and inevitably when enough cars are put in one place at one time.</block>

<p>Then he continues to say that it is a certain type of person who causes accidents. He says a man drives as he lives. Then he says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is quite possible that future research will find that a man who has just had a furious argument with his wife is inclined to knock down pedestrians with his automobile. But how shall we go about preventing husband-wife arguments?</block>

<p>Then I want to quote Dr. Ross MacFarland, an authority in this sphere, of Harvard University. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Temperament seems to have much more to do with accident experience than physical abilities. Teen-age drivers are at the peak so far as most sensory, physical and co-ordinative functions are concerned. Yet motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for both males and females from 15 to 20-4. One out of 17 in this age group gets injured in an automobile every year.</block>

<p>Dr. MacFarland has concluded that the high accident rates must be regarded in terms of &#x201C;inexperienced, emotional and social immaturity, and temperamental qualities associated with youth&#x201D;.</p>

<p>When I say that it is a certain type of person whose powers of observation or reactions are responsible for accidents, I also want to make this statement. I have also noticed in my short life that the man with the inferiority complex insists on buying the largest motor car, because it gives him a feeling of safety. It gives him a feeling of importance and prestige, and in passing others on the open road he experiences a strong sense of achievement. It is the urge to compensate for certain characteristics one is aware of in oneself. A frustrated person, one who suffers from a feeling of frustration because he cannot attain certain objects, gets a feeling of release from speeding. To the frustrated person it gives a feeling of freedom. I do not want to give a lecture on that now, but whilst you have allowed me, Mr. Speaker, to deviate somewhat from the provisions of the Bill, I want to ask the hon. the Minister that in future more attention should be devoted to the research on which our legislation is based.</p>

<p>I have listened with great appreciation to all my colleagues who pleaded here for their constituencies, and I listened with even greater appreciation to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s replies to them. As my neighbour, the hon. member <span class="col_1187-1188" refersTo="page_610"/>for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) said here, the respect we have for the soil when roads have to be widened &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to come back to Section 9 of the principal Act, which deals with irrigation works. The Minister may now tell me that the clause which deals with irrigation works is not under consideration here, but then I just want to bring it to his notice that whereas the controlling body in the Cape Province is the Divisional Council, there were in fact cases where irrigation works of farmers were involved, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not please give the undertaking that we will retain the safeguards we had under the old Act in those cases where the only water the farmer has falls within the building limits of the road.</p>

<p>I want to support my colleague, the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) in regard to this Bill but to limit myself to one aspect only. Certain representations have been made to us in regard to Clause 2 on the ground that certain manufacturing interests, businesses and advertising interests would be unjustly and adversely affected. On going into the matter closely it is extremely hard to follow the reasons for these objections, and I am afraid that they cannot be supported. One of the first objections is the question of the deletion of the words &#x201C;curtilage appertaining thereto.&#x201D; The Oxford Dictionary defines &#x201C;curtilage&#x201D; as &#x201C;a small courtyard or piece of ground attached to a dwelling-house and forming one enclosure with it.&#x201D; Webster&#x2019;s Dictionary says, &#x201C;a yard, courtyard or piece of ground included within the fence surrounding a dwelling.&#x201D; Chamber&#x2019;s Dictionary says, &#x201C;a court attached to a dwelling-house.&#x201D; Then I turned to the Afrikaans and I looked up the definition of &#x201C;werf&#x201D;. Bosman en van der Merwe define &#x201C;werf&#x201D; as &#x201C;a yard or farmstead&#x201D;. The new Dictionary of Terblanche and Lombard defines &#x201C;werf&#x201D; as &#x201C;grond of terrein om &#x2019;n woning of opstal&#x201D;, and then defines &#x201C;opstal&#x201D; as &#x201C; &#x2019;n woning en bybeho-rende gebou op &#x2019;n plaas&#x201D;, so it would seem that the objections that have been brought to us are in connection with advertising signs on residences or farmhouses, and, quite frankly, I am completely on the side of the Minister in regard to that particular matter.</p>

<p>The other deletion that has been dealt with affects this unsightly advertising round small shops. Whether the removal of those rights will affect those small shops is problematical. In my view it will not affect them at all, and it will certainly make travelling more pleasant than it has been for some time past. Sir, I do not want to dwell on this matter. The Bill has the blessing of this side of the House and I can see no valid objection that can be brought against it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>In this Bill we are dealing with planning in the ordinary sense of the word because it is a measure dealing with control of the use of land next to our roads, with all the objects of any planning scheme we have in South Africa to-day, like the safety and the convenience and the welfare of the public and the beauties of the environs. The particular nature of this planning measure is that it really emanates exclusively from the tendencies and the needs and the dangers which motor traffic have brought about in South Africa. But even though I were to describe this measure as such, it probably would not be saying much because practically all physical planning emanates from factors caused by motor traffic. The control of motor traffic has probably become the most decisive factor and motive in regard to all planning.</p>

<p>I do not want to expatiate on this, but seeing that in my opinion this is the essence of this legislation, I hope you will allow me to make a few remarks. This control of motor traffic has really become the nightmare of the planners. A man like Mr. T. B. Floyd, in his book &#x201C;Planning in South Africa &#x201D;, still said in despair last year that it does not help just to bow to the idol of the motor-car; they cannot sacrifice all the planning to the motor-car; they must also think of other factors, and it is clear that in this legislation the other factors were also considered, and not only the needs of the motor-car. The two things, planning and the motor-car, with which we are dealing here, are really contemporaries. They both started developing in the &#x2019;twenties, but as matters are to-day it has deteriorated into a race between the hare and the tortoise because the motor-car to-day is probably the most potent factor in changing the landscape, whereas originally it was hoped that it would be planning. To-day the planners see that the motor-car is busy changing the whole landscape in a moment, whilst planning struggles along through all the obstacles. Therefore I regard this Bill as of the utmost importance because it deals with the two real needs and phenomena of our time. This process which is in progress between the handling of motor traffic and the attempts of the planners, is changing. We can expect the number of motor vehicles still to increase appreciably, as it has increased in recent years. From 1948 until now, in this period of 14 years. the number of motor-cars and commercial vehicles, for example, increased from 500,000 to over 1,000,000. Speed is increasing, and according to an American writer we can expect the number of motor-cars in America still to increase for probably another 30 years, and if that is the case in America we can expect that to be the position in South Africa for probably another 50 years. I was greatly encouraged when I saw that the Chief Engineer of the Road Transportation Commission, Mr. de Villiers, said at the Congress of City Engineers a little while ago that we must accept the dangers resulting from highspeed travel; that it will increase and that it will always be there, but that the engineer <span class="col_1189-1190" refersTo="page_611"/>must accept that challenge and provide roadways which will be safe. And that is how we shall have to accept the position.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about one or two of the specific provisions of this Bill. The first is the new provision introduced in regard to cross-roads&#x2014;the land which is being reserved there. This provision means that 1,500 feet of land from every cross-road must be reserved. I originally thought that 1,500 feet from the middle of a road and 1,500 feet from the other cross-road gives one an area of between 20 and 25 morgen, but now I see that my arithmetic is very rusty and that it really amounts to an area of between 70 and 80 morgen which is actually being frozen in this way. I know that the principle is not recognized in our legislation that compensation should be paid in respect of land which is not expropriated for road purposes and that this land will not be expropriated immediately, but is being reserved. Seeing that it comprises such a large area and that we can accept that in the neighbourhood of cities and towns, where most of these crossings will occur, the land holdings are really not very big and that 70 to 80 morgen could be rather a large slice out of a man&#x2019;s land, I do not think that we can remain impervious to the principle of paying compensation in that case. I think it is a case which because of its scope differs completely from the other type of land required for roads. We would not be adopting a completely different course if we now consider paying compensation in this case. I am not quite <i>au fait</i> with matters, but I know that the British Act, the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act of 1925, provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any person having any estate or interest in land which includes any piece of land subject to restrictions in force under Section 1 or 2 of this Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the one dealing with roads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; proves that his estate or interest is injuriously affected by the restrictions, he shall be entitled to recover from the highway authority compensation for the injury to that estate or interest.</block>

<p>The British Act makes specific provision for comepnsation in this parallel case. I also have an example here which is not complete, but that is what is being done in France. I quote from a lecture by Mr. Verhoef, the city planner of the Peri-Urban Areas Health. He says that in France the position is that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When an application for permission to drill is refused for the reason that the work should be executed on land reserved for roads, open spaces or for public services, the land must be expropriated within five years. If this is not done, the permit to build can no longer be refused.</block>

<p>And later on he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reservation of land for roads, public squares and open spaces which take in more than a quarter of the property, entitles the owner to compensation.</block>

<p>It seems to me, for this reference to the French system, that we are on very similar terrain. We will probably find land where more than a quarter is taken up by this reservation. For this reason I feel that we cannot remain indifferent to the interests of such persons affected in this way. Seeing that these amendments are now being made to the Act, I had hoped that Section 11 (4) of the Advertising on Roads and Ribbon Development Act, which deals with the sub-division of land in an area where this Act applies, would also be amended. The controlling body, in terms of this section, has the power to refuse or to grant consent to the sub-division of land. But from that provision is excluded land which is sub-divided in terms of a will. It is probably self-evident that if it is necessary to insert such a provision, that the sub-division of land must be subject to the consent of the controlling body, then it must also be necessary for that land which is sub-divided in terms of a will to be subject to the approval of the controlling body, because now it really amounts to this, that because of the death of a person all considerations of planning have to be abandoned, or, to put it in another way, a man can do much more after his death than he could do whilst he was alive, and to the detriment of the public interest. I believe that there is every reason for making this amendment, even though it is not done now. At the moment, because consent is not required, the controlling body or the local authority need not even be notified that such a subdivision is taking place, and one can realize how that can obstruct any planning. I believe that if such a provision is inserted, all testators will know that it cannot be done, and the position will be remedied.</p>

<p>There is another matter I want to discuss, and I will accept that in this regard I will be a fairly lone voice, and that is that in this Bill also, as in all our planning measures, the right of existing use is recognized. I believe that is the cardinal weakness in all the planning measures we have in South Africa, because by recognizing the right of existing use, something which really upsets the whole of the planning is not only allowed to exist but is being strengthened and encouraged. Take the case of a business built alongside a road, within a distance of 10 or 20 yeards&#x2014;much nearer than the 300 feet which is actually required. In view of the fact that the whole object of the legislation is to keep businesses at least 300 feet away from the road, that person, from the very nature of the legislation and its application, is put into a much stronger position than he would have been in if this legislation did not exist, because he is now freed from all competition, and that creates the situation that all economic considerations as far as he is concerned only operate one way, and that is to remain settled there for ever, contrary to the whole idea of the scheme and contrary to the public interest <span class="col_1191-1192" refersTo="page_612"/>and safety. I have not the recipe to change it but I feel that we can find a formula which will make it less advantageous for the holder of such an existing right just to remain in that one spot. I do not want him to be penalized but we must find a formula which will give him an incentive to consider shifting his business further back. If that is not enough, we can consider negative measures like more onerous obligations in regard to continuing his business in that specific place; to create a situation where economic considerations will work in both directions, and I believe that when dealing with a planning measure such as this, and whereas in the original Act we did not give a permanent right of existence to existing advertisements but said that the controlling body could have them removed after six months, and where now again in the case of the previous Bill we will not tell a man: &#x201C;You have been trading here for years and you have the right to continue to trade here&#x201D;&#x2014;I concede that he has no permanency on the spot where he is trading but he had a right there similar to the right which these people had. I cannot see any real difference between these two cases and I believe, although few people will agree with me to-day, that if we want to make our planning effective, particularly in view of the defective methods we have, where we are dealing with this rapidly increasing problem of motor traffic, we shall be compelled to adopt a completely different view as to the value that an existing right has for the holder of it.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Like other hon. members who have already spoken I am rising to voice our support in general of the measure now before us. I want to add this plea, that some of the powers which the Bill now grants, or rather clarifies (because they are powers which existed in the parent measure but have not been quite as effective as was expected at the time), powers which in some cases exercise fairly drastic rights over what has been regarded as a fairly sacred issue in the country as a whole, that is the right of private ownership of land, and the right to do certain things on such land, will be exercised with the utmost caution. I have no doubt that will be done, but any action carried out under this provision should be carried out with the least amount of damage to the individual concerned.</p>

<p>With regard to the Bill itself, I regard this Bill as to a very large extent complementary to the Bill we have already discussed this afternoon, both having the object of providing not only a more satisfactory system of arterial roads through the country, but a much safer system of these roads. I think that in considering some of the principles or the extension of principles provided for in this Bill, we have to accept the philosophy that the arterial road system or the national highway system is in fact another railway system through the country. But it is more dangerous than the railway system, because a railway is very clearly defined and very carefull protected and over the years has developed a technique of its own and is. not only well protected but well understood. On the public roads, however, we have vehicles with a death dealing power fully equal to any railway engine and yet not bound or restricted as a railway train is. Therefore a matter such as we are dealing with now aimed to afford necessary isolation, the isolation of our national highways from unsuitable access and egress which as such brings danger. and also isolation from the distractions which may cause dangers as a result of distracting the attention of drivers, is a matter which we have to accept as one of the developments of this new road highway system which modern science has developed through the country.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. the Minister when he says by implication that it is essential that we should not permit signs and attractions on our main arterial highways which will distract the attention of those responsible for the driving of vehicles, particularly in view of the high speed with which vehicles travel to-day. I think there is the other aspect, apart from the road safety aspect, namely the unsightliness aspect of hoardings and other what have you all along such highways, many completely unnecessary, many of them unsightly, and to a great extent also providing a dangerous distraction. But I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider, and it falls to a very large extent under Clauses 3 and 4, the clauses which deal with the control of erections, buildings, or anything really set upon or on the land adjacent to the roads, that he would also give consideration, or get the Board to give consideration, to erections which normally would not fall under the scope of hoardings and signposts. I refer to the road safety warnings and the road safely signposts and the fittings that go with them, which very often with the intention of providing the greatest safety on the national highways in themselves introduce added risks in case of an accident. It has become an accepted fact all over the world that the erection of any pole of any sort, particularly an inflexible pole, closely adjacent to the boundaries of such roads does constitute a anger in the case of an emergency as say in the case of a car being driven off the road to avoid an accident. Many of our government institutions with their telephone system the electricity system, with the poles that are being erected, help to constitute a grave risk. There is that and there is also the multiplicity of road safety signs which are beginning to permeate along our roads and which so often as between province and province are as yet not altogether uniform, and which require the attention of the driver to read when he passes them, at least if he is to derive any benefit of them. I think there is still room there for a much greater clarification of these warning signs, so that once a driver recognizes them, almost by colour or shape, they immediately give the warning they intended to give without having to read the notice. They must come to him almost automatically. These are features also that could <span class="col_1193-1194" refersTo="page_613"/>well be considered. When it comes to the erection of anything upon the roads, I think another matter which might receive very serious consideration particularly in the development of our national road system as it is to-day, is the erection (falling within the scope of Clauses 3 and 4) of square-faced kerbing along our new national highways and speedways; they are a thing also which is rapidly disappearing; you have instead the bevel-faced kerb so that if a car has to tough them it does not capsize and roll over but has at least the chance of running up the bank. I believe that these are features which would fall within the scope of this Bill and deserve full consideration. We have to accept that these roads are here, and if they are to achieve their object, they must develop into speedways and therefore the precautions taken, as envisaged by this and the previous Bill, are sometimes beyond what we would normally agree to in respect of a road but have to accept in a case like this.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) in regard to road signs along our roads. Until such time as our motor vehicles, perhaps in the not too distant future, are equipped with radar, we must rely on road signs to get a picture of the road ahead, and I want to tell you. Sir, that it is at present very pleasant for a motorist to make use of these speedways around Cape Town, particularly where the road signs give us a very clear indication of what lies ahead, where the roads will turn off to certain suburbs, etc. That facilitates traffic to a large extent in Cane Town. But we ought to extend that principle to all our roads and all our main roads in the country, so that motorists generaliy will have an idea of what the road looks like half a mile or 1&#x00BD; miles ahead and in order that he may, without being compelled to make hasty decisions, determine what to do when he gets to the point where the roads, for example, turn off, or where there is some obstacle in the road.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) said that our advertisements are very un-sightly, but I want to associate myself with what the hon. the Minister has said, that the more effective the advertisement, the more dangerous it is. I am thinking here particularly of one kind of advertisement which hon. members will agree with me is a very striking advertisement and which is the reason why I was a somewhat unwilling participant in a certain incident. These advertisements of a certain cool drink have a very scantily-clothed but most attractive girl depicted on them, and they are in fact a very dangerous advertisement in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s proposition. I was a passenger in a 1934 Ford, and hon. members will remember that for some reason or other they were always painted red or brown and they were notorious for the fact that their mechanical brakes never worked very efficiently. There was a newly-built subway beneath the railway line and the driver of the car was admiring one of these advertisements along the road whilst at the same time a train was approaching the crossing, when his wife suddenly called to him to look out for the train. In his subconscious mind he thought it was a level crossing and as the train approached him and when his breakes would not work, he swerved out of the road. I think I should rather draw a curtain over what happened further in that incident. It was humorous, but I do not think you will allow me to relate the story here. As the Minister says, it only shows that the more effective an advertisement board is, the more dangerous it may be. When a car travels at 60 miles per hour it covers a distance of 780 feet in approximately ten seconds, and ten seconds is approximately the time required by the average driver with normal reaction time to look at an advertisement and to get a picture of it, but in that ten seconds his car has travelled 780 feet. Apart from the fact that it diverts his vision to an ever increasing degree to one side of the road and therefore temporarily makes him lose sight of the road immediately ahead of him, it blots out his conscious actions for approximately ten seconds. I therefore agree that these striking advertisement boards along our roads are very dangerous. Often they are unsightly as well. The hon. the Minister spoke about the Italian roads, and I suppose that during his travels in Italy he also noticed that a particular type of fuel is advertised along those roads <i>ad nauseum,</i> and to us as South Africans it is amusing, because expressed in Afrikaans, it is a word which is not allowed in this House. There one finds the tiresome repetition of advertisements of petrol, cool drinks, etc. and it is so bad that along certain stretches of the road one is unable to take a decent photo of the scenic beauties without getting the advertising board of some product or other into the picture. For that reason I feel that this legislation serves an excellent purpose and that it should enjoy the general approval of the House.</p>

<p>I cannot allow this second reading to pass without expressing my deep-rooted doubts in regard to one principle contained in the Bill, namely the principle contained in Clause 4, where we are suddenly at crossings extending from four morgen to 78 morgen the area subject to the control of the controlling authority. The old Act provided that within 300 feet of the road this control existed at a crossing: if it was the crossing of two proclaimed roads it was an area of four morgen which was affected. Now it is 78 morgen. Now I must point out in the first place that as the wording of the Bill now stands it was possibly the intention of the draughtsman to provide in Clause 3 (a) that the proviso in favour of agricultural use would also be applicable to these crossings.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Then I will not take the matter further, but it is a serious defect at this stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_1195-1196" refersTo="page_614"/>But then we come to this aspect: These crossings are not only the crossings of proclaimed roads. The two concepts are clearly included: Where a proclaimed road crosses another proclaimed road, or any road. Now one would still be able to defend fairly strongly the number of crossings of proclaimed roads as probable crossings where one day fly-over crossings will be necessary, but where it includes also crossings with other roads it means that it will affect a larger number of crossings and these restrictions affect the potential use of the land appreciably. The only development which is now exempted is constructions which are already in the process of construction, but not the further obtaining of rights. A person may be in the process of obtaining the right to trade on land where there may be some authority which has to grant such a right, but that is not covered. There may be cases where persons are laying out townships, and that is not covered either. Only constructions are covered here.</p>

<p>Then we must note that the crossing of proclaimed roads will in general take place in densely populated areas where the limitation on the use of an area of 78 morgen is a matter of great financial interest. I believe that only where this is absolutely necessary should it be done. I quite agree with the Minister&#x2019;s policy that provision should be made for the future so that if the ground is required there will not be expensive structures on it which will have to be bought out, but I believe the people as a whole must pay for the benefit of the people as a. whole and that particular individuals should hot become the victim of it.</p>

<p>I feel that we should take four principles into consideration in connection with this new principle which is being introduced. In the first place there must be some form of compensation for the curtailment of rights. One suffers loss not only by losing structures but also by losing rights. In the second place, there must on the other hand be compensation for the so-called enhanced value. That is a principle which hitherto has not been considered here, but hundreds of people derive advantage from the existence of proclaimed roads and even from the existence of a road crossing. In the third place the principle should be introduced of pressure on delay. It is very easy for a road engineer to say, &#x201C;No, you must not develop on that crossing because one day we will require it for a fly-over crossing&#x201D;, when in fact this bridge will be built only after many years. I think a method should be evolved to restrict the lengthy postponement of the use of the reserved area to some extent. Finally, I believe that a pertinent distinction should be made between the crossings of proclaimed roads and those of proclaimed roads with other ordinary roads. In the case of proclaimed roads I have no doubt that we will have to reserve this large area for fly-over crossings, but there are hundreds of other small crossings where this reservation is not necessary. I have made these remarks about the principle of the matter merely from the point of view that I hope that the hon. the Minister, after this important new principle has been introduced, will create the departmental machinery to consider this whole matter very carefully as to how we can evolve a reasonable system which will not make road building impossible but which will compensate people whose rights are restricted as the result of our road legislation and at the same time collect payment for the enhanced values which have been created. We cannot on the one hand say that the curtailment of rights should be compensated, whilst on the other hand enhanced values will inure only to the benefit of individuals who have received privileges. And machinery must also be evolved by means of which the lengthy postponement of the use of reserved land will be restricted by ensuring that the owner gets something better or more if he has to see this land lying there unused for years and years after permission has been refused.</p>

<p>Before I resume my seat I just want to deal with the question of the registration of rights in terms of this Bill and the previous Bill under which I have already raised the matter. The Minister has said that the Registrar of Deeds will strenuously oppose the registration of this right, but just let me put this to him: In these modern technical times in which we live we have created new material rights, positive and negative, like those created when for example we issued claims and under the Gold Law granted surface right permits. Merely to say that such a large number of these new rights have been created and that it will be a difficult task to register them does not derogate from the necessity of registering them. I venture to say that a surface right permit registered under the Gold Law by the Registrar of Rand Townships is of precisely the same character and nature as the various prohibitive and permissive permits issued in terms of this legislation. I concede that it is a matter which cannot immediately be solved, but machinery must be established in order that these important rights can also be registered.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am grateful to hon. members on both sides of the House for the support they have so readily given to this Bill. As has quite rightly been said, this is a Bill of national interest and, as in the case of most such bills, it also affects the interests of individuals adversely, but the greater interest is of course decisive. I think it will promote road safety quite substantially. I particularly agree with the few remarks of the hon. member for Hottentots Holland (Mr. de Villiers) in connection with road safety. I do not know if hon. members know it, but last year more than 3,000 lives were lost in road accidents, an average of nine a day, and that is apart from the 139,000 who were only injured. We should therefore do everything in our power to promote road safety and prevent accidents. I do know that I cannot enlarge on this, but I mention it only as one of <span class="col_1197-1198" refersTo="page_615"/>the important motives for the introduction of this Bill. The hon. member for Hottentots-Holland has asked whether the legislation is based on statistics. No, unfortunately not. The new road safety organization was only established last year and one of the important functions of that organization of course is to collect statistics, but it will probably take a few years before any reliable statistics can be made available. But the National Transportation Commission and the Department of Transport have, of course, taken into account what happens in other countries and in most Western countries it is felt that the erection of uncontrolled advertisements is to the detriment of road safety. The hon. members for Innesdale (Mr. J. A. Marais) and Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) dealt with the provision relating to 1,500 feet. They said that 70 to 80 morgen of land would now be frozen and reserved. That is not quite correct. Hon. members will realize that this is a permissive provision and the National Transportation Commission can give permission for the erection of any structure within that area. It naturally depends on circumstances; it depends on when large structures are going to be started in connection with road bridges or traffic switch-overs, etc., but as it has been evident over the years that no one has acted unreasonably in connection with the 300 ft. provision and in numerous cases permission has been granted for the 300 ft. provision to be contravened. It is entirely permissive, but it is an extremely important provision. Not only is control exercised over the area with an eye to the building of future bridges, but it is particularly important from the point of view of combating businesses which are established next to by-pass roads at towns. If there were no such provision, it is true that it would be possible to prohibit the establishment of businesses on the boundaries of the national road by means of the control over accesses for which provision is made in the measure which the House has just dealt with, but any business could then be erected adjacent to the cross-road, which is not a declared road, to within 300 feet of that crossing, and then you would have the same evil that we are now seeking to avoid, namely that businesses would be established adjacent to these by-pass roads to the detriment of the businesses in the town. That is one of the reasons for this 1,500 ft. provision. It is necessary to combat this evil of the establishment of businesses near to or next to the national road to the detriment of the existing businesses in the town which is by-passed by the road. We have a two-fold control. The one form will be by way of the accesses to and from the national road which are now controlled under the previous Bill, and the other form of control which is necessary is that businesses should not be established on the cross-road, the road which leads to the town, within 300 ft. of that crossing. That is one of the reasons why such a large area is taken up. Hon. members have asked that compensation should be paid, but the principal Act makes no provision for the payment of compensation, and if I were to accept the principle that compensation should be paid to people affected by the 1,500 provision, what justification would there be for refusing to pay compensation to people affected by the 300 ft. provision? There are numerous people who were affected in the past by the 300 ft. building restriction provision, people who had business rights on ground which extended up to the national road. There would be no justification for paying compensation in the one case and not in the other. That would be completely unfair and unreasonable. But I accept that cases may arise where people will suffer damage as a result of this control. I discussed this matter with the National Transportation Commission, because it is the only controlling authority as far as this provision is concerned, and the Commission confirms that where a person can prove that he had an absolute right on the date of the publication of the Bill, i.e. no 2nd February 1962, that right will be observed. In other words, if he had that right, it will be recognized. It must be remembered that this does not apply within urban areas where business rights are usually granted on plots. It only applies outside the urban areas. Where a person can prove that he had rights before the Bill was published on 2 February, his rights will be observed. I must emphasize, however, that the absence of a prohibition on trading, does not give the owner any rights in that connection. I want to emphasize again that it is a permissive provision, it is a control measure, it is not a general prohibition; it is not a question of reserving or freezing the land; it is only a permissive measure which is necessary for the reasons I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdale has suggested that the principal Act should also be amended where it provides for the exclusion of bequests in connection with the sub-division of land. The information which I have received from the Department regarding this provision, that is to say, the reason why it was originally excluded, is that the original provision was inserted in the principal Act at the request of the then (1939) Chief Registrar of Deeds. It was alleged that it could cause difficulty with regard to bequests in estates. Theoretically the hon. member is quite correct, but my information is further that in the last 20 years not a single case has come to our attention in this regard. If such cases do come to my attention, he can rest assured that they will receive my attention, and if necessary that provision in the section can be amended.</p>

<p>I want to assure the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) that the matters which he raised in his speech, will be brought to the attention of the National Transportation Commission.</p>

<li>(b) the upward trend in production costs; and</li>

<p>and of making adequate marketing facilities available.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a large section of the farmers in our country find it very difficult to make a living to-day. At every agricultural congress and meeting of a farmers&#x2019; association the economic position of the farmer is discussed. We heard the other day from the hon. members for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) and Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) that all is not well in regard to agriculture. The Commission of Inquiry into European Occupation of the platteland makes the following important statement. Their conclusion is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After a very thorough and deep investigation of all aspects of White occupation of the platteland and after thoroughly studying all the problems connected with it, the Commission has come to the firm and definite conclusion that it is in the greatest future interest of South Africa to maintain on the platteland the maximum number of White people who are assured of a decent and stable existence there. There is definitely no method of preventing the exodus from the platteland, unless those persons who are concerned in agriculture can be guaranteed a sound economic existence. Only a prosperous, settled and dedicated farming population can make an actual and indispensable contribution to the continued existence and preservation of White civilization.</block>

<p>I believe we will all agree that the tarmer constitutes a very important section of our population and that he is responsible for feeding the nation and that he contributes by means of the export of his products towards keeping the trade balance of our country on a sound footing and in earning foreign currency. But as the result of steadily increasing production costs and falling prices for his products, his economic position has deteriorated. Production costs have increased tremendously and are still increasing. For example, the cost of a bale of wool from my station to where it was marketed in 1945 was R2.8, whilst to-day it is R9.5. It has almost quadrupled in that period. Tractors, spare parts, tyres, labour, grainbags and woolpacks, insecticides and fertilizers, all the things needed by the farmer to produce, have risen and are still rising in price. On the other hand there is a strong falling tendency in the prices of his produce. Wool, for example, sold at an average of 40s. 9d. in the 1959-60 season, but last year it was 36s. 4d., a fall of 4s. 3d., and we still do not know what it will be this year. The prices of meat, milk, wattle bark and other products are even lower. In the year ending 1959 our national income increased by R90.000,000, but the income from agricultural products fell by R58,000,000, in spite of the fact that there was an increase in the physical volume of about 4 per cent, because prices decreased on an average by 10 per cent in that year. Agricultural loans and State advances amounted to R46,000,000. Arrear payments on Land Bank loans, expressed as a percentage of the total loans, increased from .997 per cent in 1955 to 1.991 per cent in 1958. Arrear interest increased from .59 per cent to 1.28 per cent over the same period. These people are falling into arrears with their payments and with their interest, which proves that there is deterioration in the position of the farmers of our country. Of course we have a country which has a variable climate. There is more or less always a drought in some part of the country, and when there is no drought there is damage caused by floods.</p>

<p>The supply and demand also changed quite a lot in the past. After the First World War the demand was greater than the production and then prices were good, but in the years 1930 to 1933 the position was different and prices fell to such an extent that the farmers could not make a living. After the Second <span class="col_1219-1220" refersTo="page_626"/>World War, however, as the result of industrial development, prices were high again because the demand exceeded the supply. As the result of large-scale mechanization the number of tractors alone, for example, in the last 13 years increased to five times as many, and to-day there are about 120,000 tractors in agriculture, and with the good prices received, with the best farming methods which were applied, as well with the application of soil conservation methods, a third problem has now arisen and that is the problem of surpluses in certain branches of agriculture, and the task now is to ensure that the farmer makes a decent living and to keep him on the platteland. Some people think that one can do so by restricting production; in other words, by allowing the farmer only to cultivate a certain acreage and in that way to try to reduce the production. But in most cases it is found that the farmer simply cultivates the bit of land to which he is limited much more intensively and still produces more, and in that way the production is also increased again. Then there are others who think that a reduction in prices will help to squeeze out some of the farmers and in that way to reduce the surpluses. But it is no use either, because if you reduce the farmers&#x2019; prices he sows more in order to implement his income in that way, with the result that there are even larger surpluses and the price is reduced once more. In many instances it results in exploitation of the soil. The farmer, in the circumstances under which he is compelled to farm to-day, is in many cases compelled to exploit the soil. He is compelled to take increasingly more out of the soil in order to make a living as the result of reduced prices. Nor has he the necessary capital to do the conservation work which he ought to do, and consequently, instead of restoring the soil faster in order to apply better agricultural methods, the progress made is not as fast as it should be.</p>

<p>Another important point also is that every year about 3,000 young farmers enter the industry, of whom only 20 per cent have received any training in agriculture. In other words, these young men are not fitted for the task they are tackling, and consequently they do not make use of the best methods. We shall have to do more in training those people to be better farmers. The troubles of the farmer just continue and in this process agriculture steadily retrogresses.</p>

<p>I want to mention a few branches of agriculture. The wattle bark industry is one in which &#x00A3;40,000,000 capital has been invested in this country. That industry is restricted now because the export markets are restricted. In 1953 we exported wattle bark to the value of R15,000,000; last year we exported only to the value of R7.6 million. The local consumption has also been reduced considerably. Of course we are facing strong competition from the Argentine wattle industry which receives State assistance. Fortunately we still have a little preference on the British market which assists us, but I believe that when Britain enters the European Common Market we shall possibly lose that preference, and then things will go badly with the wattle industry.</p>

<p>The maize farmers reap larger crops every year and the increasing surplusses are exported at a loss, to such an extent that the stabilization fund will be exhausted. Maize prices were first determined on a cost-plus basis, but recently the rising costs of production have not fully been taken into consideration and the margin of profit has been reduced to such an extent that the mealie grower had to plant increasingly more in order to make a living. Last year, of course, we had a good year; we also had good rains and the crop was 52,000,000 bags, almost double our requirements in the country, with the result that there must be heavy exports. Markets have and will be found for it, but the maize is exported at a loss. There are thousands of mealie farmers who are in financial difficulties, and they will remain in trouble unless they receive financial assistance to enable them to plan their farming operations on a soil conservation basis. Dr. Penzhorn makes it clear in his study of the physiological-biological phase of farming in the Highveld area of South Africa that by means of planned farming it is also possible to reduce the production cost of maize to a level where a profit can be made on the export of maize and maize can be sold in the Republic at parity. I assume that this will be a long process for the farmer to apply soil conservation in such a way and to plan his farm in such a way that he can derive so much benefit from it that he will be able to reduce his production costs. He also mentions the case of a farmer who, after four years of near insolvency, progressed so much that ten years later he was in a sound financial position and was quite prosperous, a farmer who had planned properly and who had applied all the soil conservation methods. If the price of maize can be reduced appreciably but can still be profitable to the farmer, then Dr. Penzhorn considers that animal products such as milk, butter, cheese, meat and eggs can also be produced much more cheaply. It is therefore the duty of the Government to ensure that the maize farmer is put into a position where he can restore the fertility of his soil and to preserve it and to apply proper planning and soil conservation.</p>

<p>In regard to the dairy industry, one hears on all sides to-day that industry is in a critical position. Two years ago we imported 3,000,000 lb. of butter from New Zealand, and the butter had not even been landed before we had a surplus. It is true that climatological conditions play a great role in the matter, but still one feels that somebody must have made a serious mistake somewhere. Last year we had a tremendous surplus. We had to get rid of 24,000,000 lb. of butter and 8,000,000 lb. of cheese at low prices, and the stabilization fund has now practically been exhausted. The exports were mostly to Britain, which has now fixed a quota, and a very low one, for us, and I am sure it will now be difficult for us to sell dairy products in Europe in future. We shall, <span class="col_1221-1222" refersTo="page_627"/>therefore, have to seek other markets. In the meantime the producer&#x2019;s price is dropping, with the result that he cannot make a living. The price of butter-fat has been reduced to 29c per lb., and of cheese-milk by 11c. to 133c, and of condensed milk by 11c to 143c. per 100 lb. The maximum price for fresh milk on the Rand was 29c per gallon, but the farmer mostly receives 25c for quota milk and 10c for surplus milk, and at that price he cannot make a living at all.</p>

<p>The costs of the distributor of milk have also increased, but the producer&#x2019;s price has simply been reduced in order that the distributor may retain his margin of profit The milk scheme has now been published and we hope that it will go far towards bringing about stability in the supply of milk to the large cities. But a milk scheme cannot solve the problem of the surplus, and we are finding ourselves increasingly in trouble. A long-term plan, as well as a short-term plan, are needed here. The Government must have a long-term plan to reduce costs by keeping better cows which give more milk, by providing cheaper fodder, and in many other ways as well to enable the product to be sold at a lower but still at a profitable price. For the present it is the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to see that the farmer does not go under. The farmer was encouraged to include the animal factor in the planning of his farm, and he did so. It is not right simply to reduce prices in the hope that production will consequently be reduced: in some cases it will possible increase the production, and in other cases it may mean that the farmers go insolvent. The sale of a large proportion of the surplus milk, butter and cheese should take place in our own country. There is tremendous malnutrition here and the Government must help to build up a healthy nation by making use of the surplus dairy products. The <i>Argus</i> the other day referred to the advantages of milk in regard to malnutrition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is now a country of widespread malnutrition and of so-called &#x2018; surplus&#x2019; food. This was underlined again this week by Prof. Hansen of the University of Cape Town&#x2019;s Department of Pediatrics, who spoke of his personal experience of thousands of children in this city dying from malnutrition. &#x2018;Mortality and sickness rates are so high that I feel that a conference at a higher level is necessary to discuss this crisis,&#x2019; he said.</block>

<block name="quote">Quashiorkor (Prof. Hansen spoke of a child too weak to stand, covered with ulcers and with swollen limbs being brought back to life in 10 days with 20c worth of powdered milk), tuberculosis (still South Africa&#x2019;s health problem), gastro-enteritis and catarrh of the stomach are the deficiency diseases&#x2014; and the first three are real killers.</block>

<block name="quote">Up to 1959 there was a Department of Nutrition struggling to meet the problem of malnutrition by the fortification of bread.</block>

<p>Then later on it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department of Nutrition might still be functioning and the problem of deficiency diets well on the way to solution, if this surplus milk had been available before 1959, for powdered milk worth only 19c a week can keep a child healthy.</block>

<p>This morning again we see that they write seriously on this subject&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Malnutrition is costing South Africa an incalculable fortune in lives, waste of manpower and medical treatment. That milk is the lifesaver has been shown by the studies of doctors, dieticians, food technologists, pediatricians, and other experts who met in Cape Town for the Third Annual Congress of the Nutrition Society of Southern Africa. Every year in South Africa&#x2019;s urban areas at least 10,000 children die of gastro-enteritis&#x2014;mainly because malnutrition makes them susceptible to the disease. Thousands more are physically retarded. They grow up stunted, weak and prone to illness. A great part of the hospitals&#x2019; work, particularly with children, results indirectly from malnutrition and costs the taxpayers millions. A half pint of skim milk a day would change all this. According to the experts. if each child in the backward, lower-income groups receive that amount of milk, the gastro-enteritis death rate could be cut by 95 per cent. It would supply much of the needed calories and proteins.</block>

<p>We have the problem in this country that we are producing food which we cannot sell. We are landed with surplus foodstuffs which have created a problem which threatens to ruin the producer. On the other hand, we have the problem that a large section of our population suffers from malnutrition, to such an extent that 10,000 people die of malnutrition every year. Something is radically wrong. It should be possible to use that product of which there is a surplus, and which to a certain extent is really a burden, to save the lives of those people who cannot obtain milk and to build a sound nation. It simply must be done.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>I have already said that we should find a market for a large proportion of our surplus milk, butter and cheese in our own country because there is great malnutrition here. A healthy nation will save us thousands of pounds in hospital costs, and just imagine how many working hours we will save. The indirect benefits flowing from the provision of milk and dairy products to our people will be tremendous. Methods should be evolved to make it available to those who really need it, and at reduced prices. In the past we provided food to the <span class="col_1223-1224" refersTo="page_628"/>less privileged people on a small scale through the Department of Social Welfare. For example, we supplied the school children with dairy products. That can be done again on a larger scale. We supplied the so-called enriched bread. That was useless and it cost us R8,000,000. The people were prepared to spend that money, and that being so, they will also be prepared to pay the difference between the price needed by the farmer in order to make a living and the reduced price at which it is supplied to the less privileged. The Government must ensure that the less privileged people can get dairy products at an appreciably reduced price, a price which they can afford to pay, and the Government must subsidize it.</p>

<p>I think that the wages of workers could also be increased. I think it is generally felt that the time has arrived when workers&#x2019; wages should be increased in order to increase the purchasing power. The worker will spend a large proportion of his earnings on food. Mr. Silberbauer is reported to have said the following in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 8 February&#x2013;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. E. R. Silberbauer, Director of the Bantu Wage and Productivity Association, said last night in answer to a question that an increase in the salaries of the urban Bantu would help to improve the position of the Bantu in the reserves. <br/>His association was an entirely voluntary body consisting of members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which aimed at getting increased wages for the Bantu. As a result of its work a new wage consciousness had come about among many employers. More people were attending meetings that he addressed on the subject In Johannesburg the Association had been instrumental in getting one firm to increase the minimum wage of its Bantu employees to R10 a week. Another firm had increased it to R12. It had been found that when Bantu wages were improved, about 80 per cent of the people spent the increased earnings on food.</block>

<p>If Bantu wages and those of the ordinary workers are increased, a large part of it will be spent on food. There is an idea held by some people&#x2014;I want to say frankly that I do not think it will work&#x2014;that part of the increased wages should be paid in the form of milk coupons. That would ensure that the worker buys the right article and it would also assist the industry. I doubt whether it can be done, but it may be investigated. If it is practicable, it will help the industry very much to find a market for its surplus milk. A considerable subsidy will have to be paid, but in that way the health of the people will be built up and it will be well worth while. It will give the dairy industry a chance to improve its production methods and to reduce its production cost in such a way that it will still be able to sell its products at a profit. It will of course also create a much bigger market for the profit.</p>

<p>Then I want to say a few words about meat. The meat industry is also getting into a deplorable position. Less than a year ago the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services said in the Other Place that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that with the annual population increase and the higher standard of living of the lower-income groups there will be a scarcity of meat in the country within the near future unless energetic attempts are made systematically to increase meat production as well as the sale of meat.</block>

<p>His words were not yet cold when we sat here with tremendously overloaded markets. Every single meat market in the controlled areas was so overloaded that animals had to stand for days before they could be slaughtered. The permit system was lifted barely a year ago, and we find that here in Cape Town there are often from 10,000 to 16.000 sheep. and in Johannesburg up to 30.000 a day, awaiting their turn to be slaughtered. People are inclined to blame the farmer to some extent for this state of affairs. They ask why the farmer cannot withhold his sheep or cattle. But if he does that he simply does not receive a turn for his animals to be slaughtered. He is compelled to send his stock, even though he knows that the animals will have to stand there for ten days before being slaughtered. Unless the farmer does that, his animals will never be slaughtered. There were periods, particularly in December, when use was made of the Railways in order to exercise control. The Railways refused to carry slaughter stock to certain markets. But there are no signs of improvements yet, and I believe that if we have normal rains this year the position will deteriorate still further, because it seems to me that we are producing increasingly more meat.</p>

<p>An experimental consignment of cattle carcasses were recently sent overseas, and the experiment succeeded. The meat arrived there in a good condition; it was of high quality and good prices were paid. I want to congratulate the people who sent those carcasses. If that experiment is a success, I suppose we can continue with it and we can see to it that more cattle carcasses of the same quality are exported. I cannot accept that our exports will be on such a large scale that it will spoil the markets there to any extent with the result that prices will fall. I think we should ensure that more articles of the right quality are exported. After that we exported 2,000 sheep carcasses and it was a failure. The meat was sold there at 7 or 8 cents a pound. If the Press report is correct, it seems that they were badly prepared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Butchers said that the dressing was not good and there were signs of bad butchery.</block>

<p>One does not know whether that is the only reason, nor do I know whether it is the real reason. The Minister will perhaps be able <span class="col_1225-1226" refersTo="page_629"/>to tell us. If it is true, it is a great pity that we exported an article which was not properly prepared. By doing so we spoilt our reputation overseas. We should ensure that we do not export any product, of whatever nature, which cannot compete on the markets overseas with the products of other countries. A few years ago our canned fruit almost had a monopoly on the British market, and because the industry practically had a monopoly they eventually started exporting products of a lower quality, with the result that canned fruit from America entered the market because it was better and began to oust our product there. and to-day we have to fight hard to regain those markets. Under no circumstances should we in this country allow products of an inferior quality to be exported.</p>

<p>What will also assist in reducing our surpluses somewhat is a bigger population, if we could have more immigrants. Of course, we could already have had a larger population as the result of immigration if it had not been for the fact that a stop was put to immigration. There could perhaps have been hundreds of thousands more people in South Africa to-day, people who would have set afoot great developments in the country and who would have brought more money into circulation, which would have increased the purchasing power tremendously. In any case, we should continue and see what we can do to strengthen our population, because that will increase the market. The Government can also perhaps in the meantime expand Iscor and Sasol.</p>

It is the Government&#x2019;s duty to see that they are able to produce as cheaply as possible. Research should be done in connection with other products such as rice, coffee, tea, fibres, etc. of which there is still a shortage in the country, and to see whether our farmers cannot switch over into that direction. It is necessary that the Agricultural Department should be expanded tremendously at all costs in order to be able to do the necessary research and to give the necessary guidance. Steps should be taken to prevent agriculture against landing in the position in which it was in 1930.</p>

<p>I second the motion. It has been interesting to listen to the all-embracing speech made by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan). It was also interesting a week ago to follow the agricultural debate which took place in this House, and I found the reply of the Minister of Lands particularly interesting on that occasion. One point which interested me in particular was his explanation that in European countries subsidies were being paid in respect of agricultural produce. He mentioned England, Holland, Switzerland and France; and we also know, of course, that in America large subsidies are paid on agricultural produce. I found it particularly interesting when I made a comparison between the yield per hectare in European countries and the yield in South Africa. I find that in some of these countries where subsidies are being paid, the yield is as follows: In France, 2,080 kilograms of wheat per hectare; in Italy, 2,030 kilograms per hectare; in Western Germany, 2,830 kilograms per hectare; in Eastern Germany, 3,100 kilograms and in England, 3,080 kilograms per hectare. And as far as South Africa is concerned we find that the yield is 560 kilograms per hectare.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>There is a reason for it, but I am not talking about the reasons at the moment. I am stating a fact and that fact is that we produce so much less per hectare than these European countries do. And when I notice in this connection, as the hon. the Minister of Lands has pointed out, that in most of these countries which I have mentioned a subsidy is paid on agricultural produce, then I am not surprised to find that the South African farmer is in difficulties. Because with our lower production we should be able to show a greater profit in order to be able to make a decent living out of agriculture. We have comparatively few farmers in this country bearing in mind the size of our country. At the moment there are 112,000 farming units in this country, and the hon. member for Gardens says that with young farmers entering agriculture that number is growing. But I contend that figure remains fairly constant because farmers are continually leaving agriculture because they are being driven off the farms. They then have to seek employment in the cities. That is the difficulty with which we have to contend. But, Mr. Speaker, when you bear in mind that we have 112,000 farming units in our country, then you realize that they have an enormous task. When we consider that in 1957-8 the gross value of agricultural production was R723,000,000, that it rose in 1958 to R729,000,000 and in 1959-60 to R766,250,000, then we realize that our farmers are doing their job and that they are producing on quite a large scale. But in order to be able to compare the income of those farmers we must take other factors into consideration. You will have noticed that I referred to gross value. But we must bear in mind what their cost of production is and we must look at the prices they receive for their produce. And when we do that, we get an entirely different picture. If we take 100 as the index for 1938 and bear in mind that the price of lorries has risen from 100 to 410, agricultural implements to 300, spare parts for agricultural implements to 310, fuel to 260, fencing material to 350, tractors to <span class="col_1227-1228" refersTo="page_630"/>259, then we realize what an enormous increase there has been with prices of the means of production.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. Minister if it is not true that a farmer needs a lorry when he produces mealies. Or does the hon. the Minister not know that? Does he think that the farmer can carry the bags of mealies on his head? Surely that was a stupid remark on the part of the Minister. Mr. Speaker, the index for dried beans rose to 408. That was the biggest of the increases. But how many farmers in the country produce dried beans? The figure for potatoes rose to only 288, that for wheat to 280 and that for kaffircorn to 260. We see, therefore, that it is a vicious circle: the more the farmer produces, the higher his production costs; the more he mechanizes, the better he plans, the greater the surplus. We find to-day that there are surpluses of milk, mealies, eggs, sugar, citrus fruits, wattle, bananas and several other products and, as the hon. member for Gardens has said, one of these days we will also have a surplus of meat products and in many other branches of agriculture. The question now arises to what the farmer can switch over, because as soon as a farmer finds that a product no longer pays, then of necessity he begins to ask himself whether he can change over to something else.</p>

<p>Bananas.</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>No, he cannot change over to bananas because already the banana farmers are having to feed 30 per cent of their production to cattle. He cannot, therefore, change over to bananas. But the Department gives the advice and many farmers unions&#x2019; have been advised that the farmers should switch over to rice, to tea, to coffee, to fibres, to wheat and to cotton. Mr. Speaker, tell me how big is the area in our country in which products like rice, tea, coffee, fibres and cotton can be produced? They can be produced only in frost-free areas and those areas are in the minority in our country. We also know that the frost-free regions are situated mostly in the Native areas. How then can the farmers change over to those products? How many of our ordinary farmers who produce milk and mealies and eggs and citrus fruits can change over to those other things? And as far as wheat is concerned, how many more farmers can change over to wheat? I cannot see how it can be done in the highveld of the Transvaal because the production of wheat there is practically impossible. As a result of the rainfall it is attacked by rust there. But that is the advice that is being given to people at present. Last year I heard the hon. the Minister of Agricultural and Technical Services speak about fibres and the wonderful future that there is in the cultivation of fibres. I cannot see how this advice is going to help most of the farmers in our country. People talk about the physical control of production, but again I cannot see how that is going to help. At the prices paid for agricultural produce at present, if the farmers are also to be restricted in respect of what they produce, there remains only one thing for them and that is bankruptcy. The truth is that the farmer to-day is in difficulties and I cannot see how he can earn his living without protection in this world. Let me take one product, butter. I recall that one of the recommendations of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and of the Minister himself was that the farmers should keep more animals, that they should not rely only on the cultivation of their lands, but that they should keep animals and R9,000,000 was then lent to these farmers to buy animals.</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Prices have declined so much to-day that the farmers cannot repay these loans. A week ago I was at home for two days and during those two days five farmers called and told me that they could not repay the loans. Their 18 months have expired and they cannot repay the loans. Two of them were working at the iron works at Newcastle; they were not on their farms at all. But let me pursue my argument. There is an idea that if we lower the price of agricultural products we <span class="col_1229-1230" refersTo="page_631"/>may get rid of surpluses. Let us take butter as an example. As from 1 December 1961, the price of butter was reduced by 5 cents per lb. But what is the effect of that? It is true that more butter was consumed, but it was also found that more and more was being produced. The consumption during the week ending 18 November was 1,703,000 lb. and the production was 2,238,000 lb. of butter; during the week ending 25 November a little more was consumed, namely, 1,726,000 lb., but the production then was already 2,400,000 lb. and in the week ending 2 December the consumption was 1,882,000 lb., but the production was then 2,564,000 lb., and in the week ending 9 December the consumption was 1,854,000 lb. and the production 2,894,000 lb. You see, whereas the consumption rose from 1,703,000 to 1,854,000 lb. during those four weeks, the production rose from 2,238,000 lb. to 2,794,000 lb. There is, therefore, no solution to be found in that respect.</p>

<p>I come now to another point and that is that the farmer is surely entitled to proper remuneration. I insist that the Government&#x2019;s attitude should be that every farmer must receive decent remuneration. Surely there much be a basis other than just the basis of supply and demand. Surely that cannot be the only factor that counts. Surely it cannot be the only factor that counts in determining prices, if the farmer in South Africa is to be able to make a living. If the position is that the factor of supply and demand is the only factor in terms of which prices are to be determined, then the Marketing Act has very little meaning. I do not plead for any favoured treatment for the farmers. Somebody asked me a moment ago whether I insist on higher prices. I ask for proper remuneration for the farmer. I do not ask for favoured treatment for the farmer. In saying that, I want to ask why the factor of supply and demand is not the decisive factor in other fields in South Africa. Why is that not also the case as far as the remuneration of a labourer or of a professional person or the price of factory goods is concerned? Why should the factor of supply and demand be the decisive factor as far as farming is concerned? Is it not the same then throughout the country? Why cannot the farmer demand what other people get and that is proper remuneration for the work that he does? Mr. Speaker, after all there are accepted standards of living which also apply in the case of the farmer. There are the usual living expenses which have to be taken into account. There are the production costs. All these things must be taken into account in connection with a basis of remuneration for the farmer.</p>

<p>May I make it clear to the hon. member that the farmer draws no salary, but that he is a self-employed man and when I speak about price fixation or remuneration for the farmer, I mean that his prices must be determined in such a way that after deduction of production costs a reasonable remuneration remains for him, a reasonable sum on which he can live decently. I have now stated it as simply as one could state it for a Std. II child.</p>

<p>I come now to something that the hon. Minister of Finance said. The hon. member for Gardens made mention of the fact that the national income rose in 1959 by R90,000,000 and that the agricultural income over the same period declined by R58,000,000&#x2014;and that in spite of the fact that the physical volume of agricultural products rose by 10 per cent. In the Part Appropriation Bill the hon. Minister of Finance, when I said that it was not going well with the farmers, told me that the gross income of the farmers had risen. He mentioned the percentage and unfortunately I could not write it down, but he said that the gross income of the farmers had risen more than that of the other sectors in our country. I say again that it serves no purpose to talk about the gross income of the farmer.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I included myself in that. But now I come to the interjection of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. Naturally I read with interest what the Minister himself had to say. I listened with interest to see whether he did not have a plan for the farmers of South Africa. Now I find that he said the following when he opened the Congress of the South African Agricultural Union&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The application of improved techniques of agricultural production and the application of the measures under the Soil Conservation Act have had this result that agricultural production has increased more rapidly than the demand during the past ten years with the result that to-day surpluses are the rule. This proud achievement, which should have improved and strengthened the position of the producer, in a certain sense undermined his position and endangered it.</block>

<p>Do you know, Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister tried a moment ago by way of an interjection to suggest that I was arguing wrongly in saying that production costs in our country <span class="col_1231-1232" refersTo="page_632"/>are so high that the farmers cannot make a decent living. But the Minister made that confession before the agricultural congress and he spoke about the surpluses and said that the export market was becoming more and more limited. He spoke about stabilization funds which were becoming exhausted. He said that the whole system was collapsing in view of the fact that production was being encouraged in this way. I then looked to see what he suggested as a solution, but he had no solution.</p>

<block name="quote">Quotas in their turn entail difficult administrative problems and also have serious consequences for a young and developing country, in which the potential production of many regions can hardly be estimated.</block>

<p>No solution! But he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nor does the solution lie in a reduction of the number of farmers.</block>

<p>Again no solution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The main reason for this is that large sections of the population of the world do not have enough to eat. In our own country too, there is almost unlimited scope for improved nutrition.</block>

<p>No solution, because he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our attitude should be to increase the demand rather than to decrease production.</block>

<p>No solution. The Minister then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus it is advisable to pursue a policy which will not bring about food prices which are unnecessarily high.</block>

<p>Is that a solution for the farmer or a solution for the consumer? The Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State will have to act very judiciously in granting assistance to farmers who cannot make the grade on their own.</block>

<p>Throughout there is no solution! There is one more short sentence that I could read out if the hon. the Minister wants to hear it. When I could obtain no solution from the Minister I turned to the speech of the President of the Republic at the opening of Parliament, because nobody in this House, particularly not hon. members on the opposite side, will deny that farming is one of the most important, if not the most important industry in our land because no country can exist unless it has a sound farming industry. I waited therefore to find some ray of light in the address of the President for the farmer. What did I find? He did refer to agriculture. It must be remembered that this speech was not written by the President himself, but by the Cabinet, and this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For agriculture there are ever-increasing prospects, not only by means of soil conservation and the planning of farming to cope with natural disasters so as to give agriculture the necessary stability, but also by means of the exploitation of extensive new areas with the aid of irrigation schemes on the Pongola and Orange rivers.</block>

<p>What does that mean? It simply means more production, more surpluses. And what is the solution for that? I find that the Government offers no solution and I want to say here that I regard it as the responsibility of the Cabinet, and I do not want to lay all of the blame on the Minister of Agriculture. It has now become a matter of such magnitude that the whole Cabinet must bear the responsibility in connection with this matter. This is not a matter of making political capital; it is a matter of the utmost seriousness, because the farmers in our country are in a desperate plight.</p>

<p>I have no objection to irrigation schemes. I am in favour of the introduction of irrigation schemes. I have no objection to that, but I am pointing out that when irrigation schemes are introduced, without any other scheme being undertaken, it will again result in greater surpluses. There must be other schemes as well as irrigation schemes. They speak of &#x201C;an amendment of the Government&#x2019;s tender system to ensure for the producer a reasonable income and to prevent his market from being unnecessarily depressed&#x201D;. Then they speak of &#x201C;creating the possibility of levelling the farmers&#x2019; income within a few years&#x201D;. They speak of &#x201C;an expanded inland market for products by more energetically speeding up industrial development in the Republic and along its borders with Bantu areas &#x2026;&#x201D; Then of a &#x201C;dynamic immigration programme&#x201D; and of, &#x201C;using surplus food as part of the developmental capital Then they speak of &#x201C;increasing the buying power of the lower income groups etc.&#x201D; They speak also of the alternative of helping the farmer by bringing supply closer to demand by introducing a quota system where practicable and desirable. Here, naturally, I have certain misgivings. They talk about the revision of the transport policy and the integration of railway bus services, together with a system of proper roads. Then, they talk about &#x201C;investigation into economic production possibilities &#x201C;the consideration of a comprehensive crop insurance system and a long term planning in agriculture&#x201D;. That, to me, is the most important thing of all. Mr. Speaker, there ought to be planning in this country so that the farmer can know exactly what he can get for his agricultural products during the following five or 10 years. Farmers ought not to leap in the dark, as they are doing at the moment without knowing what the future has in store for them. I have pleasure in seconding this motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>At one stage I felt sorry for the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). I felt sorry for her because while she is so concerned about agriculture when she talks in this House, there were only five members of the United Party in this House except during the last five minutes. Only five members of the United Party were interested in her speech. It was tragic to witness that.</p>

<p>I want to analyse a few of the statements made by the hon. member. She gave the House the index figures in respect of the increase in the price of lorries and spare parts etc. and against that she gave us the index figures in respect of the increase in the price of products, and because they do not agree in every instance she takes it that the costs of production are much higher and that they are rising faster than the increase in the price of products. But the hon. member should bear in mind that she cannot make deductions like that, because, if you have to have a lorry and not use a trailer, you do not convey only one load of mealies with it, but every bag of mealies for two or three years. The same in the case of wheat. You do not use one plough to sow one bag of wheat, but you use it over a number of years. Those are not figures that you can juggle about in that way, Sir&#x2014;it creates the wrong impression. The hon. member was very concerned about the R4,000,000 which, she alleged, was paid for milk cows, and she said that was the reason for the over production which we have to-day. But surely those milk cows were already in milk before the R4,000,000 was paid. They only changed hands&#x2014;that was all. Because certain farmers in the agricultural areas who found it difficult to integrate stock farming with their agricultural farming were assisted, she regards that as a reason for the over production of milk. That may be true to some extent because those cattle <span class="col_1235-1236" refersTo="page_634"/>are better cared for now and because the remaining cattle are also better cared for. But that is not the norm. She concluded by quoting the suggestions made by the South African Agricultural Union, suggestions that they have put forward as offering the solution. But does she not know that most of the recommendations of the South African Agricultural Union are already actively being carried out&#x2014;or at least to a very great extent? The others are still being investigated. I shall analyse the position in a minute and show you, Mr. Speaker, how some of those things are already being done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) has introduced a very interesting motion. The only pity is that his motion is based on the wrong premises. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing to-day in the agricultural industry &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, he generalizes and says that conditions in the agricultural industry are unsatisfactory. As far as he is concerned conditions are unsatisfactory in the entire agricultural industry, and the hon. member based his entire motion on the premise that conditions were unsatisfactory in the agricultural industry. He then went on to say that I was supposed to have said, when we discussed the motion which was introduced the other day, that conditions in the agricultural industry were not satisfactory. But that is not the case. We said very clearly that everything was not satisfactory as far as certain areas and certain sections of agriculture were concerned, that everything was not satisfactory as far as certain commodities in agriculture were concerned. But we have never generalized. The hon. member gave a few examples. He mentioned, for example, the price of wool. But surely he knows that the price of wool is an international price that depends on the international demand. He also knows that had it not been for the fact that action could be taken under the Marketing Act, under the Wool Board and the Wool Commission&#x2014;in respect of which legislation has been introduced&#x2014;to maintain a stable price, the farmers would have received much less. In other words, he quotes the price of wool as an example to prove that agriculture is in a bad shape, as a charge against the Government, knowing that this Government have taken those steps, more so than any other country in the world. Then he went on to say that meat prices were still going down. But that is not the position. The speculative meat prices may be lower, but surely he knows that there is a floor price under the marketing system and under the Control Board and that price is fixed from time to time. That price has never as yet gone further down. It is only the speculative price above the floor price that is lower. But that is not the position in respect of the price provided for under the Marketing Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member then referred to the outstanding amounts due to the Land Bank and to the State Advances Recoveries Office. I shall deal with that at a later stage. Mr. Speaker, so that we may have clarity, I again want to make an analysis of what the hon. member said about the unsatisfactory conditions in the agricultural industry and his generalization in that connection, something to which the hon. member for Drakensberg subscribed and quoted what the hon. Minister of Finance had said the other day and what the Minister of Finance had said. He quoted from a publication of the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch&#x2014;A Survey of Contemporary Economic Conditions and Prospects for 1962. To what conclusion did he come after he had made his analysis? He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the above it also appears that the mainstay of the 1959-60 revival was not the manufacturing sector. Whereas overall geographical income for 1959-60, as compared with 1958-59, increased by 7 per cent &#x2026;</block>

<p>Namely the earning capacity of the people. That is what it means. That has increased by 7 per cent. But what does he find further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Agriculture, forestry and fishing, 9 per cent</block>

<p>That is higher than the average increase in the earning capacity of the entire population. There were the mines for example 11 per cent; private factories 4 per cent; commerce 8 per cent, etc. In other words, according to this survey by the University of Stellenbosch, the earning capacity of agriculture was higher than the average and had kept pace with the other sectors in the country.</p>

<p>This Government knows and admits the fact that in certain areas the position of certain farmers is not what it should be as well as the position in regard to certain agricultural commodities. We have never denied that. The United Party with this motion of theirs only want us to consider now what action should be taken. But the Government has long since passed that stage and has not only to start considering to day. It is taking action. It is already taking active action. Because we know that everything is not what it should be with certain farmers; yes, that things are even going badly with them, but we cannot generalize as the United Party has done. We are aware of the agricultural problems that exist and of the anomalies that are created by ever increasing over production, due perhaps to the improved agricultural-technical services, the better guidance, the better circumstances of production and the better production facilities, that have come about as a result of the steps taken by the Government. The Government has not waited only to consider those things to-day. It has already conducted an inquiry into the European occupation of the <span class="col_1237-1238" refersTo="page_635"/>platteland; it has already appointed a study group to go into all aspects of agricultural credit and in their report that study group divides the farmers of South Africa into three categories. They mention group 3 specifically as those farmers who find it difficult to make a living. Those are the people who continually suffer crop failures, who are over-capitalized and who farm on uneconomic farming units. In this connection they also refer to the collapse of the markets, inexperience, unbalanced farming; and then they say that in such cases special assistance and expert guidance are necessary. These are the farmers about whom we should really worry. According to the report of this study group&#x2014;and this is not an old report, because it is for 1960-61&#x2014;the other farmers are not in difficulties. Their position is not such as to cause us to panic. According to this report category I can manage its own financial affairs. It is not necessary for them even to go to the Land Bank. Category 2 go to the Land Bank and they are all creditworthy, sound, <i>bona fide</i> farmers about whom the country need not worry, because they are already protected in various ways. Then we come to category 3 which consists of those people who have to be assisted. This Government, knew not only as a result of these reports, but because it has its finger on the pulse of the nation, that steps had to be taken and what has the Government done already? It has made a temporary change in the loan policy of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act by again granting those loans. The Land Bank Act has been amended so that loans up to 80 per cent of the value could be granted. We have the hypothecation loans to purchase livestock and implements. We have introduced emergency loans for the purchase of seed, fertilizer, fuel, etc. We have also introduced emergency loans for drought stricken areas and there has been action on the part of the Department of Agriculture to give advice to farmers economically. These are all steps which the Department has already taken. But what is more, a commission of inquiry was appointed to make a thorough investigation into the profits that were made on implements, farm machinery and spares. We trust that report will shortly be Tabled. The Government is, therefore, not only at the stage where it is considering what action should be taken. It has long since been taking positive and active steps in this connection. Mr. Speaker, I want to give another example, a very good example as far as I am concerned. This publication came out in Pretoria yesterday and I was fortunate to get hold of this copy. It is called <i>Agrecon.</i> This is a new brochure which the Department of Agricultural Economics publish quarterly and make available to the farmers of South Africa. It can be bought for 20 cent. This new publication gives us the necessary statistics and data and details relating to all the areas and circumstances surrounding production. It is worth-while getting a copy. In case members are interested I should like to analyse one item. Having analysed the position in respect of the grain industry, they give a table in which a comparison is made between Grootvlei and Bethal. We find for example that the yield per morgen in respect of mealies is 23.1 bags at Grootvlei. The test was carried out over three morgen. In Bethal the yield was 19 bags. But this is what is interesting about the whole thing: The figure in respect of costs of implements per morgen at Grootvlei is 8.6, whereas it is 11.6 at Bethal. They conclude that the farmer at Grootvlei gets 20.2 per cent interest on his capital investment if he produces mealies, but the farmer in Bethal gets only 9.2 per cent, because conditions there are different. Mr. Speaker, with the assistance of this wonderful publication and the investigations that will be conducted in future, we may find, for example, that the farmer in the Eastern Free State, where my hon. colleague (Mr. Knobel) farms today, probably only makes 2 per cent; or that the farmer in Volksrust who cannot produce what the farmer in Bethal or Grootvlei produces, probably only makes 3 per cent. With a survey such as this at its disposal the Government can take steps to advise the farmers and the farmer himself will then know that he cannot grow mealies in certain areas&#x2014;a table has been compiled to show him that it will not pay him to grow mealies there.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, who are the farmers who are in difficulties to-day? Those who are in difficulties are those mentioned in category 3. The Natural Resources and Development Board conducted an investigation in 1949. They took five districts in the centre of the Free State where the farmers raise stock and go in for agriculture. That was 40 per cent of the farming units; 10 per cent of that area was already subdivided into units of under 200 morgen. Smallholdings excluded. If we investigate the position we will find that those farmers constitute a group of farmers who find it difficult to make a living. That does not mean to say that they are all insolvent; they are not all insolvent as some people would make us believe. They are people who find things difficult, perhaps their units have become uneconomic in present-day circumstances because of their size. You have the same position in the southeastern Transvaal, possibly in the districts of Standerton, Amersfoort. Ermelo, etc. The managing director of the Land Bank quite rightly said&#x2014;and I agree with him&#x2014;that there was no longer room in our economy for uneconomics units in our agriculture. That was why we were pleased the other day when we had the discussion here, to hear the Minister of Agriculture tell us about the investigation that is to be conducted, namely an investigation into the subdivision of land into uneconomic units. It is true that a certain group of farmers find it difficult to make a living, but this Government has not forgotten them. Let us analyse briefly what has already been planned, the assistance that has already been given in order to solve the problem. I do not want to give all the figures to the House. I merely want to say that the Department of Agriculture grants subsidies for fertilizer, there are railway <span class="col_1239-1240" refersTo="page_636"/>rebates on fertilizer, etc. There are rebates on the conveyance of stock from drought-stricken areas to areas where there is grazing. Then there are railway rebates on the conveyance of stock feed to drought-stricken areas. The farmer only pays a quarter of the railage; the Department pays a quarter and the Railways carry half. Where else in the world do you find a service like that; where else is that type of assistance given? Water is conveyed to drought-stricken areas. You have soil conservation works, the eradication of noxious weeds, the combating of pests and plagues. The Department of Water Affairs gives assistance to farmers and to irrigation boards, etc. During the years 1956-7 to 1960-1&#x2014;during those few years&#x2014;assistance was given to the farmers in the form of subsidies to the tune of R41,193,000. That is an example of what has been done to assist those farmers to keep their production costs lower. These subsidies constitute active steps to keep production costs lower. Those have undoubtedly been active steps. I want to give another example and I want to analyse what has been done by State Advances. I am doing this particularly because the hon. member for Gardens said that those people who had been assisted by State Advances, had fallen into arrear. Mr. Speaker, the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board assisted only those farmers who were financially in an absolute weak position. It did not assist all the farmers. The Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board helped those farmers who were in a weak position. That is the largest group of people that can be taken as the norm in deciding what the position is in regard to agriculture, because they are the people who have found it most difficult to make a living. The others have not. The farmer who found himself in difficulty and who could not meet his obligations went to the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board that year and asked for assistance. In other words, that is the norm that we can apply to determine what the position of our agricultural industry in South Africa is. It is one of the best norms. Let me analyse the agicultural position: We have 100,000 farming units in South Africa. At the end of 1961 there had been 7,015 applications for assistance. In other words, only 7 per cent of the farmers of South Africa had gone to State Advances and asked for assistance because they could not meet their obligations. It is interesting to note. Sir, that those 7 per cent are not insolvent. Under the farmers&#x2019; assistance scheme an amount of R17,960,000 was given to those farmers in the form of mortgages; for irrigation schemes, water shortage, assistance in drought-stricken areas in the Cape Province a total of R19,000,000; loans to save stock which the farmers would otherwise have lost, stock feed, conveyance of stock; loans for the cultivation of crops, loans in respect of flood damage in Natal and Griqualand East; loans to farmers in the mouth-and-foot disease areas, a total of R12,036,000. In other words, during this short period of time up to 31 January 1962, the Department of State Advances had assisted the farmers to the tune of R31,091,000. I repeat that only 7 per cent of the farmers of South Africa found it necessary to apply to State Advances for assistance. I also repeat that they are not insolvent. Let us see how these amounts have been repaid, and this is a scheme which has only recently been introduced: Repayments under the assistance scheme for 1959-60&#x2014;the first payments under this scheme fell due in 1960&#x2014;in the form of capital and interest amounted to R1,817,000. That is on R19,000,000. In other words, within a year State Advances recovered 10.53 per cent of the loans it had granted to those farmers. Does that look like insolvency? Does that look as though we should panic? Capital repayments were as follows: Debtors who are up to date with their capital and interest payments, 28.8 per cent; those who have only repaid capital, 7.2 per cent; debtors who have repaid capital in part and interest in full, 11.8 per cent; debtors who have only paid their interest in full, 7.8 per cent. In other words, the position of 48.4 per cent of the farmers who were assisted under State Advances has not deteriorated; their position has not deteriorated because they can still meet their obligations in full. When you analyse these repayments, Sir, you find this interesting fact. The position in respect of repayments and losses is that State Advances has advanced R92,700,000 in the form of capital and they have already recovered R71,900,000 in the form of capital and interest. They have written off an amount of R2,700,000 in the form of capital and interest. That is 2.9 per cent. What is the amount that has been written off? Let me analyse the amount. This amount does not include the demobilization scheme under which a number of ex-soldiers were established in the farming industry. Under this scheme the corresponding figures are: R20,500,000, R18,400,000, etc. But it means that 2.9 per cent was written off. And that means 2.9 per cent of 7 per cent of your farmers. You can work it out yourself, Mr. Speaker. In other words, less than .08 per cent of the farmers could not meet their obligations towards State Advances as was expected. It is interesting to note that State Advances estimated what they could expect to recover and they estimated that they should recover the amount of R3,220,000. On 31 January 1962 they had already recovered the amount of R3,975,000. In other words, more than they had estimated. They expect to-day that by the end of 31 March 1962 they will have recovered R4,700,000, whereas they originally expected that they would only recover R3,220,000. Does that not show that things are not as bad with the farmers as we are led to believe?</p>

<p>I wish to move the following amendment to this motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;in view of the tremendous increase in production resulting in large surpluses as well as the international downward trend in commodity prices as against still increasing production costs, this House once more expresses its confidence in&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_1241-1242" refersTo="page_637"/>(i) the marketing system as embodied in the Marketing Act, which serves as the only guarantee of stabilization;</li>

<li>(ii) the steps already taken by the two Agricultural Departments in bringing about greater efficiency in agricultural production;</li>

<li>(iii) the steps taken by the Agricultural Departments and the Control Boards to develop domestic and foreign marketing; and</li>

<li>(iv) the steps taken by the Agricultural Departments, the Land Bank, the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board and other Government bodies in giving financial assistance to areas where unsatisfactory conditions arise in the agricultural industry on account of phenomena of nature.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>In moving this amendment I wish to point out that hon. members have already showed what the increase in production has been. In 1947-8 our wool production was 206,000,000 lbs.; today it is 296,000,000 lbs. In 1948 our beef production was 646,000 000 lbs. In 1959 it had already increased to 677,000,000 lbs. You find the same tendency in the case of mutton. There has been a tremendous increase in the production of butter. Our butter production is 114,000,000 lbs. to-day. There has been a tremendous increase in our cheese production. It was 20.3 and to-day it is 37,000,000 lbs. The same applies to concentrated milk. But farming does not consist only of mealies and milk, but of many other facets such as dried fruit, wine, meat, cotton, wheat and groundnuts etc. and to generalize, as the hon. member for Gardens has done and to say that things are bad with the farmers, is wrong. When you make a wrong statement like that your entire case falls away. Fortunately he admitted that it was on account of climatic conditions that everything was not going smoothly. It is true that some farmers in the mealie-producing districts find things difficult, but let me make another analysis. I will only give the House three figures. In 1947-8 the net cost per morgen for the production of mealies was &#x00A3;5 9s. 5d. and &#x00A3;11 15s. 1d. in 1959. The net income per morgen was &#x00A3;7 14s. 1d. in 1948 and &#x00A3;16 10s. 9d. in 1959. In 1948 the profit per morgen was &#x00A3;2 4s. 8d. and &#x00A3;4 15s. 8d. in 1959. That is in respect of mealies, and it is globular for the whole country. That is why we are right in saying that taken as a whole the position of agriculture in South Africa is as sound as any country can wish it to be. We admit, however, that there may be certain districts where the position is probably bad. The hon. member for Gardens spoke about the price of meat. In 1938 beef was 34s. per 100 lbs.; in 1956 it was 110s. and in 1960 it was R12.27 or 122s. There has not been a decline in the price of beef as alleged by the hon. member, and that is merely the floor price. But that is not the position in all respects. I want to state this clearly. The South African Agricultural Union is incorporated in the Marketing Act and that is the machinery. Planning has already been done. The United Party only want to do it to-day. The Meat Board has sent people to Europe. The Wool Board is continually there. A mission has gone overseas and to the East in connection with sugar. The Government is not only going to consider to-day what should be done. They are already taking action. It is only a pity that suspicion is too often cast on our attempts by United Party stories and that they try to sabotage our attempts. Hon. members said that the position as far as Land Bank loans were concerned, was bad. Do they know that since 1912&#x2014;incidentally the Land Bank is 50 years old this year&#x2014; R327,980,000 have been granted to farmers and the Land Bank reports that to date they have not suffered one penny loss. What better evidence do you want than that, Sir, to prove that the farmer of South Africa is one of the most honest in the world! He is not a person who evades his responsibilities, even if he is in difficulties at times. But hon. members said that they were in arrear with their payments. Let me analyse the position. In 1933 the arrears were 4.9 per cent, in 1958 they were 1.99 per cent, in 1960 1.95 per cent and we want to admit frankly that the figure for 1961 is 3.39 per cent. The position is not as sound as it was in 1960. That may be a danger signal but there is a reason for it. In 1959 the Land Bank based its system of instalments on 35 years; it has now reduced it to 25 years, which means that the instalments are so much higher to-day and in consequence the farmers are not always able to meet them. But the Land Bank has once again extended the period to 35 years. In other words, if a farmer has a 10 year loan he can of his own choice extend it to 15 years, those that are for 15 years can be extended to 20 years etc. up to 35 years, on merit, if it is sound. That gives farmers the necessary breathing space that hon. members are asking for, without making beggars out of them and without undermining their morale by saying they are insolvent and only want to live on credit.</p>

<p>I want to make four statements. The first is that our farmers are some of the most honest people in the world. They meet their obligations. Secondly, in general our agricultural industry is inherently sound; particularly when we compare it with other countries, and it is even sounder to-day than it was in 1936 or in 1948. Fourthly, the gross income of the farmer has kept pace and compares favourably with that of the urban dweller. I want to analyse this statement by giving a few examples. In the first place I wish to say that the movement to the cities was not an evil one. In the thirties we had 300,000 poor Whites. We are not faced with that problem to-day. In other words, it is not a question of the depopulation of the platteland, but a question of uneconomic units. We are changing from a system of extensive farming to one of intensive farming; that conversion is taking place to-day. That is why we have certain problems.</p>

<p><span class="col_1243-1244" refersTo="page_638"/>Let us look at the value of our agricultural production. In 1936 it was R96,000,000; in 1956 it was R486,000,000, and in 1961 it was R814,000,000; eight and a half times more than in 1936. That indicates prosperity, but let us look at the volume of production: In 1936 the index figure was 100. In 1956 it was 170 and in 1961, 196. It is still rising because we are offering services and because the farmer is availing himself of those services. That is also the position in the case of mealies.</p>

<p>I just want to state one final case. When we look at the capital investment in respect of agriculture, we find that it was &#x00A3;1,655,000,000 in 1954; in 1957 it had risen to &#x00A3;2,000,000,000 and in 1958 it was &#x00A3;2,470,000,000 and to-day it is 6.2 times as high as in 1938.</p>

<p>But we must bear one thing in mind. We must compare the mortgage burden with the capital investment to find a yardstick. In 1947 the mortgage burden was R132 million as against Rl,894 million, in 1955 the mortgage burden was R203 million as against R3,719 million. In 1947 it was 7.2 per cent and in 1955 5.5 per cent and on the 30 June, 1958 the capital investment in agriculture amounted to &#x00A3;2,888 million or R4,167 million and the mortgage burden was R305 million. In 1958 the mortgage burden was only 7 per cent of the capital investment in agriculture. Is there another industry in South Africa that is so sound that its mortgage burden only constitutes seven per cent of its capital value? There is not another business like that. I say again that there are certain farmers in certain areas who have a difficult time. Do you know what that means per farm unit Sir? In 1936 when it was R400 million, it was &#x00A3;4,000 per farm unit. In 1954 it was already &#x00A3;16,550, in 1957 it was &#x00A3;20,000 and in 1958 the unit value per farm was &#x00A3;24,700. I repeat that the mortgage burden is only 7 per cent. That is why I say that we should not commit the crime towards our agricultural industry of telling the world, as the hon. member for Gardens has done, that things are bad with that industry. We should say that there are certain areas and certain farmers with whom things are not as sound as we would have liked to see them, but the position of our agricultural industry is as sound as it is in any country in the world today, because the farmers meet their obligations. That is why it gives me pleasure to move this amendment and to show that this Government realizes what the problems are and is already taking active steps. It is not only considering them to-day as the U.P. is doing. They are always too late.</p>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>I second the amendment. All of us in this House are grateful for the opportunity and grateful to the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) for having introduced a subject of such importance for discussion. Although we look at the matter in a somewhat different light, agriculture is and remains the backbone of our economy. We know that throughout the world those governments that have been careless enough to allow their agriculture to deteriorate, have fallen behind and have gone under. On the contrary we know that the problem that we are discussing to-day, the financial soundness of agriculture, is a world problem to-day. The stranglehold of costs and surpluses that has taken hold of the whole world, has not overlooked South Africa. I should like to refer to the world food production organization which held a conference recently in Rome. They discussed the whole position of food surpluses. That organization represents 88 countries and at that conference tribute was paid to South Africa, as one of the oldest members, on account of her approach to the question of overproduction in the world. They also mentioned that as far as mealies were concerned, even in a country such as France, there was a surplus to-day, also in Hungary. That shows that the tendency throughout the entire world is to become independent as far as food supplies are concerned, that is the general direction in which every country and nation think to-day. That means that export countries such as South Africa who is dependent on the overseas markets for the disposal of many of her products, is entering a period where we shall have to employ new methods and find new markets if we do not want to lose the struggle.</p>

<p>I want to give further proof of this, by quoting a few sentences from a speech made by nobody less than Pres. Kennedy when addressing his Congress recently and when he pointed out how America was also concerned about her agricultural problems. Before I read it I want to summarize what the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing says in his Annual Report. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the position which the agricultural sector occupies to-day in our national economy has focussed the limelight on three aspects in particular, namely (a) the decrease in the play between expenditure and income, the so-called cost price stranglehold, (b) the marketing of agricultural surpluses and (c) the need for credit in agriculture.</block>

<p>There we have the position as it grips the farmer to-day. but that is our problem. Pres. Kennedy describes his problem in the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources. American farmers took heart in 1961 from a billiondollar rise in farm income and from a hopeful start in reducing farm surpluses. But we are still operating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws which cost us $1,000,000,000 a year in C.C.C. (Commodity Credit Corporation) carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt rural poverty or boost farm earnings. Our task is to master and turn to fruitful ends the magnificent productivity of our farms and farmers. The revolution of our own countryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm failures of the communist nations, and is a <span class="col_1245-1246" refersTo="page_639"/>source of pride to us all. Since 1950 our agricultural output per man hour has actually doubled. But without new, realistic measures it will some day swamp our farmers and our taxpayers in a national scandal or a farm depression. I will therefore submit to Congress a new, comprehensive farm programme tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop to the long-range needs of the nineteen-sixties and designed to prevent chaos in the nineteen-sixties with a programme of commonsense.</block>

<p>I mention this because I am convinced that the problem which we are rightly discussing to-day is one which you can only approach with commonsense and that is how it will have to be approached from all planes and sectors. We shall not be able simply to say there is the problem and in saying that think we have solved it. We shall have to deal with the problem as the Secretary for Agricultural Economics has put it in a nutshell, and thereafter we shall have to act further along the lines of this amendment and try to keep our agriculture on a sound basis in the future.</p>

<p>We know that as far as mealie surpluses are concerned the attitude which America adopted was practically that of an elder brother. In the past she has deliberately held back her surpluses from the European market and stored them at a cost running into astronomical figures, but in the meantime we have been given the opportunity of selling our surpluses on that market. America gave those surpluses that she could not store practically as a present to countries that had been hit by catastrophes and to underdeveloped countries. But America has also now reached a stage where, as Pres. Kennedy says, she will have to clean her own house, with the result that we are no longer in a position to use all those markets for ourselves. We should therefore cast our eyes wider afield, go further and give attention to new markets and find new uses for our products. Where we have imported wheat from Canada in the past to the tune of millions of rand and exported mealies to Europe at a loss of millions, we shall even have to consider whether that is not a wrong policy and whether the time has not arrived to include mealies in our bread, because the C.S.I.R. have made tests and determined that a certain percentage of mealiemeal could be used in bread and that an expert would not be able to say that it had affected the taste or the quality. I do not hold that out as a solution of the problem because we cannot do it on a sufficiently large scale, but the R2,000,000 or R3,000,000 which we shall be able to save along those lines, will assist in meeting the position. I think of this for example. We are still to-day prohibiting the marketing of bakers&#x2019; cones in this country, whereas I am convinced that the eating habits of the Natives have changed over the years. We notice to-day that Natives like to eat white bread, most of the flour of which we have imported on a subsidy basis, whereas if the Government were to make that fine, processed mealie product available to the Natives, they would be only too pleased to get it. But they have discarded those eating habits of ten years ago and we shall have to take those things into account and see, if by doing that, we cannot create a bigger market. The fact remains that in certain parts of our country certain farmers are struggling under a financial burden of such dimensions that we dare not lose sight of it. I know that in the mealie industry we have reached a stage that, when a farmer suffers a crop failure one year, either because of drought or hail or pests, even if he is assisted by the State&#x2014;and he gets assistance &#x2014;that farmer suffers a set-back of three or four years economically, and one crop does not compensate him for the loss that he has suffered. It takes at least three or four successful years before he gets where he was. But fate often decrees that when an area is hit by crop failures, as happened in the Eastern Free State a few years in succession, the farmers get into a position where they require special assistance. That is why we realize to-day how vulnerable agriculture is and that is why, according to our amendment, the Government must continue to give assistance in that respect, and I am pleased to be able to say that it is doing so.</p>

<p>I also want to associate myself with the statement made by Mr. Pentzhorn, someone who is held in high esteem by everybody in the mealie triangle. He said that we would have to get to the stage where we sold mealies at parity prices. But what are parity prices on the world market to-day? That is the price you get after the entire world has dumped its surpluses. It is not a realistic price but a dumping price and that is why the farmer is so reluctant to accept it. I also want to say that where the hon. member mentioned the case of a farmer who was nearly insolvent ten years ago but who was to-day a prosperous farmer, shows how one farmer differs from another. One of the chief factors that we must take into account is that one person, on account of his exceptional ability and managerial qualities, is able to do better than another. I agree with him in expressing the hope that we should do everything in our power, but that brings me again to the question that I have so often raised in this House, namely that we should not be stingy when it comes to the training of scientists, scientists to give us the necessary guidance so that we will be able to place our agricultural industry on an efficient basis and so that our country will develop and grow to such an extent in all respects that we will be able to absorb the growing surpluses.</p>

<p>I do not want to go further into this matter. I want to give other hon. members an opportunity of speaking. There are numerous farmers present who want to take part in this debate. I want to conclude by saying that we should not minimize the seriousness of the position, we should take it into account seriously and <span class="col_1247-1248" refersTo="page_640"/>it will pay this country to take the greatest possible interest in the farmer and to see to it that the position of the South African is kept inherently sound.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) proves the need for this motion moved by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan). The hon. member for Wakkerstroom says that there is a very great surplus problem, a problem of getting rid of surpluses which are ruining the market for the producer in South Africa. He says that there is a downward trend in our overseas market and that something must be done about it. Well, if that is so, why does he not support the original motion which deals with that very point? Because if this downward trend continues and is so serious as to upset the economy of the South African primary producer, it shows that it is not necessary to thank anybody for developing markets for us or even for holding our markets, but that it is more important to see that we get rid of that surplus to the best advantage and to see that it does not interfere with the basic price for primary products. He goes on to say that the Land Bank has come forward and has helped the primary producer to meet his indebtedness and his troubles occasioned by his loss of income. There we have what is virtually an admission from Government speakers&#x2014;and of course that is the true position in this country&#x2014;that the primary producer is in a very parlous position. That is certainly true except for the producer of wool and perhaps those who produce fruit for export. I do not include in that category the producer of fruit for canning purposes. What has this Government done to protect the farmer and the price he should receive? The primary producer is like anybody else who produces a commodity for sale. He wants his cost and production plus enough to give him a decent living, and that was the reason for the introduction of the Marketing Act, in other words, to get rid of and to handle that surplus that ruins the market as a whole. In referring to advances by the Land Bank to the primary producer, the hon. member overlooks the fact that those very advances that have been made in the last few years, amounting to many millions of pounds, are made to the farmer because he is not getting an economic price for his product. In many instances, instead of putting him on his feet, it is loading him with a debt at quite a high rate of interest, which adds to his indebtedness and brings him into greater trouble. We know that an advance at the right moment by the Land Bank or an advance to a man to start farming, can put a man on the land and keep him there and help him over temporary difficulties owing to droughts. But the taking over by the Land Bank of all the assets of many of these farmers, has put them in a position where they are now loaded with debt, a position from which many of them will never recover. In the end those very debts and advances will drive them off the land at a time when they will be too old to start another line of farming. Sir, I have had practical experience in helping many of these people to get these advances, and when you look into the facts and figures and see the rocommendations of the Assistance Boards you realize as a practical farmer yourself that many of them can never recover. When they need a small amount of money for a month or two they cannot get an advance from any other business house because all their assets are pledged to the Land Bank. Except during the very first year or two of my farming, I have always found the banking facilities of commercial houses of greater use to me because I did not have to pledge all my assets when I needed financial help. But under this system where every asset of the farmer is pledged, I think many people who have taken help in the last few years will go under in due course, especially now that there is, as admitted by hon. members on the other side, this downward trend in prices and a collapse of the market at a time when costs of production are rising. Just take labour costs. We know that there is a nation-wide drive at the moment to increase the cash wages of all unskilled labour in commerce and industry. Do you think that is not going to have the effect of raising the wages that the farmer has to pay to his own unskilled labour? Of course it must have that effect. We know that farm labourers receive a good deal of their wages in kind, and many of our labourers who, according to commerce and industry, are not adequately paid, are actually better off financially and have a better home life than the urban labourer in as much as they live with their families and get a portion of their wages in kind. The labourer in commerce and industry, on the other hand, gets his wages in cash and fritters it away with the result that his family suffers from malnutrition and other diseases brought about by malnutrition. However, we cannot get away from the fact that the producer will be compelled to pay increased cash wages, which will, of course, increase his cost of production. There is already a declining market, and many of the primary producers&#x2019; prices have been fixed under the Marketing Act on cost of production figures arrived at after a considerable time lag. Cost of production has gone up in the last year or two and there has been no increase in commodity prices to re-imburse the farmer for that extra cost of production. The hon. the Minister admitted that last year in this House in replying to the debate, when he said, &#x201C;How can we just go on raising the price of primary produce when there is overproduction?&#x201D; I think he has recently given the same reply to the fresh milk producers of this country. There is a surplus of milk, and how does the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services deal with that problem? He holds a meeting and tells the producers that they have to produce more cheaply and bring down their costs of production. Sir, I ask you, how can the primary producer bring down his costs of production unless he increases his production per acre, and the moment he does that he temporarily helps himself by getting a bigger production for immediate sale, <span class="col_1249-1250" refersTo="page_641"/>but then he has a bigger surplus to contend with before the year is out. I will deal with those surpluses and once again make a suggestion to the hon. the Minister and to the Government as to how some of the surpluses can be used to the best advantage of the country as a whole. On this question of increased production costs as the result of increased cash wages, I would point out that commerce and industry can afford to raise cash wages because all they need to do is to increase the price at which they sell their commodity. When transport costs go up, all they have to do is to increase the price at which they sell fertilizers and implements to the farmer. The farmer is therefore caught both ways; he has to pay increased costs to get the fertilizer and the implements to his farm and he has to pay increased costs in sending his product to the market. The man in commerce and the man in industry simply adds those increased costs to his price, and he is allowed his margin of profit without any question. Even the distributor of fresh milk is allowed those costs, but it is not allowed to the primary producer, and as far as fresh milk is concerned no minimum price is fixed; only the maximum is fixed. In that case therefore the Marketing Act is used to help the consumer but not the producer, and the Marketing Act was put on the Statute Book in an effort to help the producer as well as the consumer. If you read the debates in this House in the &#x2019;thirties, you will see that the Marketing Act was brought in to get rid of the surpluses, to introduce orderly marketing and to give the producer a better return on his product.</p>

<p>In the last couple of months the price of industrial milk has been reduced. The price of butter fat has been reduced by 2d. a lb., and it is suggested that huge surpluses are going to be consumed because butter is 5d. per lb. cheaper. Sir, have you ever heard so much nonsense? The ordinary housewife uses so many pounds of butter per week, and she goes on using that quantity, and a reduction of 5d. per pound at the present price of butter will not bring the non-European and the less-privileged classes into the market to purchase that butter, and the Minister knows that. If commerce and industry can add all their extra costs of production to their cost of production figure and then put on a reasonable profit, why cannot the farmer do the same? That is all the farmer asks. He wants a reasonable return for his product. He does not want to make a fortune out of it, and if that is guaranteed to him, then it is up to the Minister to evolve a way of getting rid of that surplus, if necessary by means of subsidization for the good of the nation.</p>

<p>When business was suspended I was dealing in some detail with the dairy industry in this country and our difficulties in disposing of the huge surplus of butter and other surpluses that we have which depressed the basic price. The Minister, as hon. members know, gazetted a reduction in the price of butter fat on behalf of the dairy industry in South Africa, in other words, the Dairy Industry Control Board. I did say that the price of butter fat had been reduced by 2d. per lb. I should, of course, have said &#x201C;2c&#x201D;, and the reduction in the case of butter to the consumer was 5c per lb. It is quite easy, when you are thinking back to the prices gazetted up to last year, to think in terms of pennies instead of cents. But what is the future of the industry in South Africa the way we are going? Because we are now in the position that people who are in other lines <span class="col_1251-1252" refersTo="page_642"/>of primary production are now being encouraged, because they are now subject to a quota, by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to produce milk. Take the wattle farmer. I would like to ask the Minister what future there is for the wattle industry. As a wattle grower I am not re-establishing one wattle plantation that has been cut in the last three years because the outlook for the marketing of wattle bark, if you are not really close to a railway, is very bleak at the moment. Our quotas have been cut down from year to year. Until three years ago, as you know, Sir, there was no quota in the wattle industry. The wattle grower made his own arrangements with the factory, whether he was selling green bark or dry bark. To-day there is a quota, and each year over the last three years the quota has been reduced. This year it has been reduced very drastically. We are told that there is a very poor outlook for the future. The cane growers, too, are subject to a quota, and their quotas have been reduced because of the difficulties in the overseas market.</p>

<p>Admittedly the price has gone up. The price of sugar to the consumer has gone up. Of course, they are a very well-organized industry and they have been given a higher internal price to offset their lower quota. But what is the position of the dairy farmer? Instead of getting a higher price, his price has been reduced. But what does the Department of Agricultural Technical Services do? They go to the sugar farmer, especially the small cane growers, and say to him, &#x201C;We can see that you have to have a bigger margin now because as the result of your quota you have lost the sale of so much of your cane; you had better go in for dairy farming; you had better put down pastures; these lands are very suitable for pasture growing, so go in for dairy farming&#x201D;. What is the wattle farmer being told in the midlands of Natal? Exactly the same thing. Of course, your wattle land will produce very good grass for two or three years, with practically no fertilizer, because wattle improves your soil as far as grass is concerned because it is a depositor of nitrogen. Many of these people, instead of purchasing mealies, are now producing their own maize and maize for sale to Natives in the area, so once again you have further surpluses brought about through the difficulties of marketing these products. But the bulk of the farmers who have been producing wattle, who have to switch to some other form of production to increase their net income, have been advised by the Department to go over to pastures and dairy farming. We already have this huge surplus, and what are we going to do? More surpluses are being produced, forming a vicious circle on the advice of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and that is not helping the dairy industry. I say that is going to lead to further difficulties in marketing and further trouble. As I have said, some of these farmers are producing their own maize. If dairy prices drop much further, you will find the wattle areas producing enough maize not only for their own use, whereas before they were importers of maize to those areas, but surplus maize which is going to lead to further difficulties in getting rid of the surplus maize which is being exported from this country. And what is going to happen if the United Kingdom goes into the European Common Market? She is almost sure to do so. The chances are 99.9 per cent that she will go into the European Common Market, and then what is going to happen to our butter market? We have no other country to which we can export butter at all. We have been limited in what we can export to Great Britain. What will be the position should the United Kingdom enter the European Common Market? And what about the egg producer, who has been rather hard hit in the last two years as far as the export of eggs is concerned? He is getting low prices for his commodity compared to what he got before in the market over there, and when Great Britain enters the European Common Market I think the egg producers of the other six countries who are already in the Common Market are going to insist on preferential rights for the sale of their eggs in the United Kingdom market. That again will hit us very hard.</p>

<p>I put some questions to the hon. the Minister, which he answered to-day in relation to the export of day-old chicks, a business that has been built up over the last few years with Tanganyika and Kenya and one or two other countries in Africa. We have had a ban put now on the export of day-old chicks as far as Tanganyika is concerned. The Minister says in his reply that they do not know whether the ban was imposed for veterinary or other reasons. I know that one man in my constituency who has specialized in this business has lost orders to the value of R1,800, which he was due to start executing from next month. All these things are forming a vicious circle, and I ask the Minister what he is doing to help the farmer to obtain markets and a basic price for his product that will give him a decent living. All the farmer wants is his cost of production plus enough to make a reasonable living, as I have said before, and with the trend in the overseas markets, with surpluses being built up here, I cannot see much future for him. These people will be forced off the land. Where they have been helped by the Land Bank, the Land Bank has taken over all their assets, with the result that they cannot obtain any help from commercial banks in the shape of overdrafts or temporary help. Over the years we on this side of the House, and I in particular, have pressed Minister after Minister&#x2014; Mr. Steven le Roux who was Minister of Agriculture for some years and then the present Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and the present Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing&#x2014;to get rid of our surpluses in this country to the best advantage. In the thirties&#x2014;I have repeated it over and over in <span class="col_1253-1254" refersTo="page_643"/>this House in other debates&#x2014;we had a scheme whereby the small schoolchildren in this country got an issue of free fresh milk every day and where the milk was not available a cheese ration. That was most successful. Further, there was a sale of butter at a reduced price, the cost of production price actually, through the market-masters in all our bigger cities and towns and through welfare societies to people who were on the welfare societies&#x2019; books. So they bought second-grade butter, not top-grade, (which they call &#x201C;choice&#x201D; to-day), at cost of production price, which took that surplus butter off our market to the advantage of everyone concerned. The people who could not afford sufficient butter for their children, the lower income groups, obtained that butter by going to the authorities, and you could control and stop the exploitation of this cheaper butter coming into the market in other ways. It was a great success. I had a lot to do with it in my own area. Through our market-master we supplied huge quantities of butter at a reduced price, and it did not affect the sale of the ordinary priced butter in business. What can we do? It is admitted that we have a position of malnutrition in South Africa, that there are hundreds of underprivileged people, irrespective of race and colour, who need the protective food, milk or dairy products. And, Mr. Speaker, how I heard hon. members on the other side cheer when the Minister said, &#x201C;We are going to cut off all school-feeding&#x201D;. It is a wrong principle. But I then reminded the farmers on the other side that they were going to lose one of their best markets for the disposal of our surplus products. What a fateful thing to do as far as nutrition is concerned! You had a system of free milk provided, irrespective of income group, every child got his ration of free milk or a cheese ration, and the surpluses were used up which helped the dairy industry&#x2014;but what was much more important, we were building up healthy citizens in South Africa. To-day we are faced with the huge surpluses. The farmer is not getting a reasonable return for his produce, because there is nothing in fresh milk to-day or in industrial milk. Every agricultural organization that has to do with dairy products is complaining that the price is not an economic price. It will be much better if instead of getting large Land Bank loans, pledging all your assets and becoming heavily indebted to the state, if those people were helped by not subsidizing the producer but subsidizing the consumer so that all those protective foods could be used by the underprivileged people or people who cannot afford them at the price prevailing to-day. In relation to their wages, prices are high, and it would be to the benefit of the whole country if those surpluses of dairy products were used to the best advantage, which could be done through that scheme. Once again I plead with the hon. the Minister to consider the introduction of such a scheme again. He has all the details, and it could be implemented in the near future, and it would remove those surpluses to the very best advantage of everybody concerned in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>The motion of the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) has one sub-paragraph to the effect that the Government should do everything in its power to try to reduce the accumulated surpluses, which to my mind is. a particular indication of the wonderful service which the farmers of the Republic of South Africa have rendered the people of the country. Those farmers are charged with the important duty of providing the nation with food and to do so not only in sufficient quantities but also to deliver the best quality. I think if a monument had to be erected, we should decide to erect a monument to the farmers of the Republic of South Africa, on account of the fact that they are fulfilling a task which is not such an easy one in South Africa. South Africa is a country which is generally known not to be a wonderful agricultural country and the farmers were faced with the big challenge of feeding the people of this country. They have now achieved such wonderful results as regards food production that there is practically a surplus in every respect. Not only that, but the quality of the food is such that you need not be ashamed of the food that the South African farmer produces. When we look at the quality of the fruit that is served in the dining room of this House, you feel proud of the fact that you are living in this country of ours, thanks to the person in charge who goes to the trouble and shows the loyalty of seeing to it that fruit of that quality is served at table. But you can also go to any decent butcher shop here in Cape Town and you will find beef or mutton of such a high quality that you will be able to treat Her Majesty the Queen of England on it. The farmer has fulfilled that task in full realization of the fact that he is also responsible for preserving the soil of this country and that he should not produce food at the expense of the soil of our country. When you travel through the country, Sir, you are surprised to see how the farmers are doing everything in their power to conserve the soil by means of soil conservation schemes, schemes which they tackle with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>I just want to sketch briefly what the task of the farmer is. When you think of the unfavourable climatic conditions under which the farmers sometimes have to render that service, the disasters that nature causes to hit him over which he has no control, when you think of the pests and plagues that beset the farmer, stock diseases, lice, floods, droughts, I think we should really pay tribute to the farmers of the Republic for having fulfilled their task under those circumstances in such an honourable manner.</p>

<p>It now appears that they have done their duty too well. In other words, they have progressed faster than the rest of the country and they have produced more food than the 14,000,000 up to 15,000,000 inhabitants of South Africa can consume. That is indeed an achievement on the part of the 100,000 farmers of our country. Hon. members of the <span class="col_1255-1256" refersTo="page_644"/>Opposition have now suggested that the Government and the Minister should do more to prevent those surpluses from being exported at a loss. Various speakers have already pointed out the different steps that the Government have taken to encourage that consumption. For example, mealies are subsidized to a great extent to encourage consumption. We find that in 1960-1 the Government paid a subsidy of R8.8 million for the storage and handling of mealies; the subsidy paid in respect of railage for local consumption amounted to R3.144 million, butter was subsidized to the tune of R2.967 million. Similarly, subsidies are paid in respect of wheat and many other products. I want to know from the hon. member for Gardens whether that is not sufficient evidence that the Government is doing everything in its power in an effort to meet the problem.</p>

<p>As I have already said, we all know that if you want to have a country with a sound economy, your basis should be a sound agricultural economy. I think the problem of surpluses should in the first place be tackled by greatly increasing the consumption on the local market. It is not my problem or my duty as a farmer to increase that consumption. My responsibility as a farmer is to produce food and it is the duty of the people on the other hand, after I as a farmer have done my duty, to see to it that the product is consumed. Take the position in respect of butter for example. It is estimated that the butter production for the year 1961-2, that is the present season, will be approximately 118.6 million lb. and it is estimated that only 94,000,000 lb. will be consumed during the year. That means, therefore, a butter surplus of 24.6 million lb. whereas in the case of condensed milk and powered whole milk, in respect of the two together, 72.19 million lb. were produced in 1959-60 and the consumption 70.71 million lb., in other words, there was not a surplus in respect of condensed milk and powered milk. I know the hon. the Minister will say that the factories only produce sufficient to meet the demand. I know that and that is sound policy, because there is no export market for those products worth mentioning. I agree with previous speakers that with a view to the large number of Bantu and Coloured children in this country the problem of surplus butter could be minimized by producing more whole milk and thus reduce the butter surplus. I do not want to place sole responsibility on the State. But I think, for example, of the amendment to the Liquor Act where it is envisaged that only local authorities will have the right to sell the White man&#x2019;s liquor in the Bantu residential areas around our White cities and that in that case the policy is to plough back the profit that is made into the Bantu residential areas. That is why I want to make an appeal this afternoon to the authorities concerned to think seriously about using some of the profit that is made from the sale of liquor in the Bantu residential areas to provide the Bantu children in those Bantu areas with dairy products on a subsidized basis, products such as powdered whole milk (not skimmed milk), something that will improve the health of those children and reduce the surpluses. We know that as a result of malnutrition many Native children suffer from kwashiorkor, but one pint of milk per day can prevent that disease and thus the State will be saved a great deal of money that it would otherwise have had to spend on medical services.</p>

<p>Now I come to meat. What was the position in the case of meat in 1959? The total production that was offered on the market were 134,000,000 lb. of beef and 312,000,000 lb. mutton and the consumption was only 91.7 lb. <i>per capita</i> per annum, beef and mutton together, that is to say the consumption <i>per capita</i> per day was .22 lb. or 2 to 3 oz. I can assure you, Sir, that the hon. member for Wakkerstroom does not eat .2 lb. of meat per day, but rather 1.8 lb. Here I see an opportunity to encourage the consumption of meat considerably. I do not know whether the people of Cape Town really know what is happening, but if you go to a first-class butcher shop and you ask him what he charges for rump steak or beefsteak, he will always tell the consumer that he stocks prime beef, whereas in many cases it is only grade I or grade II, and then he charges you 35 cents per lb. Chops are also 35 cents per lb. For fillet they charge no less than 60 cents per lb. I do not know where the butchers get all the fillet from, but they never run out of supplies. Only a small portion of an ox is fillet steak, but they always have a supply on hand. The butcher charges 25 cents for a pound of sausage, and for mince, which we all know consists of odd pieces of meat, sinews, etc., they charge 22 cents. I do not want to appeal so much to the butchers as to the consumers. Do you know why the butcher has to charge such a high price? Because you as consumer are too lazy to go to fetch the meat personally at the butcher shop. That butcher has to deliver the meat from the centre of the City to Sea Point and elsewhere, he has to make out the accounts and post them; he has to give credit and in many cases have summonses issued against people if they do not pay. But if you as consumer want to accept the responsibility together with us as farmers you will do everything in you power to help that middle man, who must also live, to reduce the price. He as middle man renders an essential service. You as consumer cannot go to the farmer or to the abattoirs and the middle man renders a valuable service. But he has assured me that if you help him he will be able to sell his meat much cheaper. What will the result be? The consumption of meat will increase appreciably. I want to go further.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the mine-owners and the industrialists of this country, the mine-owners who take those treasures from below the surface. They did not plant them there as I as a farmer planted my mealies, but the Creator put them there. Those treasures should be used to develop the surface. However, I do not want to be unfair towards the mines. I admire them for their enterprising spirit and for the large capital investments they have <span class="col_1257-1258" refersTo="page_645"/>made in order to mine those treasures. We know that those treasures earn us valuable foreign currency. But I want to appeal to them to do their share as well. If we as farmers had not provided them with the food, they would really not have attained those achievements. Because all the gold that has been produced in South Africa so far cannot keep a baby alive for 24 hours, but one pint of milk can do so. That is why I want to make this appeal to the mine-owners and industry that they should carry their responsibility together with us as farmers. The surpluses are there and they should be grateful that they are there. What would have happened to them had there been shortages and prices rocketed sky high? It is their duty today to stand by us. Why cannot the mine-owners and the industrialists provide proper food to their underfed employees from the lower income groups, the Bantu and the Coloureds and also others? The industrialist does not know what the Bantu whom he employs eats. The Bantu gets paid and I admit that in many cases he gets paid well, but how many of them spend their money on healthy body-building food? How many spend it on milk? No, he buys a bottle of Cocoa-Cola and half a loaf of white bread and then his stomach is full of wind and he thinks he has had a meal. That is why I ask the industrialists of this country to assist us by giving their Bantu employees a properly balanced plate of food every day, at least one healthy meal a day? Have you ever thought about this Sir, that in 1960 there were 275,614 non-Whites working on the gold mines and that during 1959 a total of 556,888 non-Whites were employed on all mines. Then you still have the industries. I do not have the figures with me, but I think you will agree with me, Sir. that there are quite a few hundred thousand Bantu employed in industry. I am not asking the industrialists to help us to solve this problem for selfish reasons. I am asking it in the interests of the industrialists themselves, because if I as farmer have the purchasing power, I can buy his industrial product. I saw an example of this in certain areas in my constituency where those areas were hit by disasters four years in succession, disasters that were beyond their control. The farmers&#x2019; mealie and wheat crops were destroyed by rust. That happened four years in succession. What was the result? Those towns deteriorated into ghost towns. The position is better to-day but I really hope that the industries will help us in this respect. Secondly, if consumption is developed to its utmost so that we are convinced that every person in this country gets what he needs, and there is still a surplus that has to be exported at a big loss, I believe&#x2014;but we have not reached that stage yet&#x2014;that the responsible Government, the National Party Government which will still be in power at that time&#x2014;will realize its responsibility and that we shall then have a round table conference to try to find a solution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) pointed out in a very capable manner &#x2014;and I want to congratulate him on it&#x2014;that the motion was not quite correct, that the farmers of the Republic of South Africa were not in such difficulties. The figures that he mentioned showed that the position was reasonably sound. But he did point out, however, that there were parts of the country where the farmers had been hit by disasters which were beyond their control, disasters for which neither the Minister nor the Government could be held responsible. I wonder whether you as an urban dweller and consumer, Sir, have ever visualized yourself in the position of a farmer whose lands are full of beautiful wheat, a promising crop, and then the hail comes along and not only does it destroy that crop, but it also destroys the farmer&#x2019;s entire capital investment? The hon. member for Wakkerstroom pointed out in a very capable manner how the Government has on every occasion when disaster has struck the farmers come to their assistance in a sympathetic way with annual crop loans of &#x00A3;300, etc. and farmers&#x2019; assistance throught the Land Bank. I want to make one appeal to the House this afternoon. An old farmer once said to me: &#x201C;Jan, you know I can still put up with those droughts, but the thing that finishes me is that untimely frost just when your crop is at its best.&#x201D; That is why I want to appeal to the Government that due account should be taken of that risk factor in agricultural production. When you look at the price fixations, you find no indication anywhere that the risk factor has been taken into account in fixing those prices. When a disaster hits me and the Government gives me a loan of &#x00A3;300 so that I can start my following crop and another disaster hits me, I am only more in debt and my position is only worsened to the tune of a further &#x00A3;300. That was what happened in those parts. That is why I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and ask him whether he does not think the time has arrived to give serious consideration to do what the United States of America have already been doing since 1939, what Japan has been doing since 1939, what Mexico has been doing since 19545, Brazil since 1955, what Ceylon started a few years ago and Costa Rica recently, namely a system of cost insurance of the capital the farmer invests in his crops. Mr. Speaker, it has become necessary to do that and in those countries where that scheme has been in operation, the capital investment in that crop is at least insured when disaster hits the farmer and if he loses his crop he at least gets back the capital that he has invested in it. Amongst others the scheme embraces the following. The farmer is covered in respect of all causes beyond his control&#x2014;all natural causes and natural disasters: too much rain, floods, hail etc. That scheme is already operating in those countries reasonably successfully. Time does not permit me to go into more detail to-day. I think the Minister knows everything about it. Neither do I want the Minister to tell us <span class="col_1259-1260" refersTo="page_646"/>to-day that he will introduce such a scheme. I know he cannot tell us that. But I want to conclude by making his appeal to him: Will he promise the House that he will have this matter thoroughly investigated? And if he then thinks that it is a scheme that can be introduced successfully, whether he will introduce it in this country?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I would have had no fault to find with the motion introduced by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) if he had introduced it with a few amendments. I must say that the hon. member in moving his motion stated the case very objectively, and it was clear to me, too, that like all of us he was trying to find a solution for the difficulties in which a certain section of our agricultural producers are finding themselves to-day. But when we read the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, we find that it says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, in view of the unsatisfactory conditions at present prevailing in the agricultural industry, this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of combating&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the downward trend in commodity prices;</li>

<li>(b) the upward trend in production costs; and</li>

<li>(c) the accumulation of commodity surpluses; and of making adequate marketing facilities available.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Government is asked to consider the advisability of combating these things. As I have said, if the hon. member&#x2019;s motion had been worded differently, we would have had no fault to find with it. Because in the first instance I do not think it is correct to talk about difficulties and troubles experienced by the whole of the agricultural industry. After all, there are certain facets of our agricultural industry which are not experiencing these problems and difficulties. There are certain facets of the agricultural industry which are doing reasonably well. There are other branches of the agricultural industry which, for various reasons, are not doing so well at the moment. And if the hon. member and his seconder were concerned about those branches of the industry I would have no quarrel with them, because I think all of us here who have the interests of the agricultural industry at heart, as we should, are aware of the fact that certain facets of our agricultural industry are going through difficult times to-day. Indeed it is because the Government is aware of that fact, that steps have already been taken by the Government to combat those things which the hon. member refers to in his motion. It is not necessary for us at this stage to consider the advisability of doing so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had an entirely new phenomenon in our agricultural industry in recent years. During the war, and particularly immediately after the war, there was a shortage of nearly all agricultural products in the world. A demand arose in every country throughout the world for the necessary food for the nations of the world. But in due course, by making better use of technological aid and means of production, and to some extent also as the result of reorganization and price adjustments, which were effected to a very great extent in certain countries, surpluses arose, particularly in the grain production of the world. To a very large extent surpluses arose throughout the world. That naturally also affected us here in South Africa. We had an enormous expansion of production in various fields. We had an expansion of production in maize and other cereals, as well as of other products which in turn are derived from cereals. There is an important reason for that. By using the new technological aids, by resorting to mechanization, it was possible to step up production, with the result that to-day we find ourselves in the position that there is a surplus of grain produce as well as of certain animal products, and that surplus is to be found not only within South Africa but in most countries of the Western world producing those particular products, with the result that the markets for those products outside our own country are becoming more and more limited. There are various types of agricultural products that we produce; we have products that are produced largely for the overseas market and the bulk of those products are marketed abroad. I am thinking of wool, for example, of our deciduous fruit and our citrus fruits. I am also thinking of other products which hon. members have mentioned, such as wattle bark, which is produced almost exclusively for sale on the overseas market. Then there are other products of which we had a shortage in the past, in respect of which we were not self-sufficient, which have been produced in ever-increasing quantities to meet the needs of our internal market, with the result that there, too, we have had surpluses as far as the domestic demand is concerned. These products have to be sold in some way or another. There are various ways, of course, in which we can try to find a market for those products. If there is a good export market for them, they can be sold there at a certain price. One can, of course, sell practically anything at a price. Another way is to develop our internal market in such a way that the internal consumer is able to make greater use of this country&#x2019;s products. Steps are already being taken in this direction, and I shall come back to this later on. But I think there is one thing that we must realize to-day and that is that in our agriculture we have brought about completely changed conditions in the past few years. I think when we seek to use means to stabilize our agricultural products and to place them on a sound footing, it is essential to ensure that those means are not of such a nature that they can cause greater <span class="col_1261-1262" refersTo="page_647"/>difficulties for us; they should be of such a nature that we can try to bring about stability in our agricultural industry as a whole. In other words, Mr. Speaker, any means that we adopt to overcome our difficulties temporarily, may create further problems for us if we do not tackle this matter in the right way. That is why it is essential, since we have now come to a period of adjustment, that adjustment should take place in such a way that in the long run it will be in the best interests of the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>In this adjustment of our agricultural industry to the new circumstances, each of us has a function. The agricultural producer as such has his function to fulfil. In this transition period of adjustment the Government too has its function and it is quite prepared to recognize that function and to help to meet that adjustment. Our agricultural industry in South Africa, apart from the fact that we have to contend with surpluses, is in this position, with our cost of production structure, that we are unable to compete overseas at the prices at which we have to sell there. At least that applies to many of the products we produce. With the structure that we have, one can only maintain one&#x2019;s internal price if one is prepared to do certain things. In the first instance one must be prepared to pay big subsidies to the internal producer. In the second place the internal producer must be prepared to accept the lower price for his products, particularly for that portion which has to be exported. That is the second way of getting rid of the surpluses if one wants to get rid of them on the overseas market. The fact remains that one can only get rid of the product at the price that one can get abroad, and the price that one can get there is a price that one can only get in competition with other parts of the world which also sell their products there at a price at which they in turn are prepared to sell. We must be careful that the solution that we suggest does not place us in greater difficulties.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, to come to the motion of the hon. member for Gardens, I should like to mention a few things which the Government is trying to do to overcome the difficulties that we are experiencing in certain sections of the agricultural industry. The hon. member refers in the first instance to the upward trend in production costs. There are many factors in our production costs over which we have little or no control. Internally the Government has very little control over it, except in so far as it controls the margins of profit which are allowed on the imported article. Over that aspect of production costs we have little control therefore. The solution in this connection is to try to guide producers to display greater efficiency in their methods of production; in other words, to produce in the cheapest way with the means at their disposal. This is in fact done by the Government through its Departments of Agriculture, by means of instruction with regard to better farming methods, better utilization of the soil, better utilization of fertilizer. We have already started with economic instruction to assist the farmer to plan his farming in such a way as to bring about the best balance and to keep his costs of production as low as possible. While I am on the question of costs of production I just want to mention that there are certain items in the cost of production over which Governments have or can have very little control, unless they are prepared to take certain drastic steps. One of the items in the costs of production over which the Government has very little control is the question of the price of land. In our country we adopt the attitude that every person who wants to go and farm may buy himself a farm, and he can pay for it what he likes. In other words, if the Government is not prepared to intervene and to say that he may not pay above a certain price, it has no control over the item of interest which enters into the price. That is something which our farmers have to look after themselves, if they are not prepared to abandon that basic principle upon which our farming is based. But I want to mention a second one, and that is the question of labour. The Government cannot determine for a farmer how efficiently or how inefficiently he is using his labour. With the steadily rising wage scales (a trend of which we also approve) in our industries for our labourers, it will mean that in the long run the agricultural industry, which has to compete with secondary industries for labour, will necessarily have to pay higher wages. This is also why one of the functions of the producer is to use his labour as efficiently and as economically as possible. I do not think there is a single farmer in this House who can sincerely say that our farmers are making the most efficient use of labour. Here, then, we have another item, an expensive item, over which the Government cannot exercise control without interfering with the basic outlook of our producers. But there is another basic outlook which we have. When a farmer has bought his land at the price which he is prepared to pay for it, according to the value which he places on it, he himself determines with what he is going to farm on that land. If this House is not prepared to allow the Government to tell him with what he is to farm, if we are to retain that basic principle of freedom, then we have those problems and the Government cannot be held responsible for them. I say therefore that if the producers want to retain that basic freedom, they will have to be prepared to a large extent to sell the article that they produce at the price that they can get for it.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further point in this connection. Not only does the farmer decide with what he wants to farm, he also decides how he wants to farm. He does not want to allow other people to tell him how he should farm and how he should use his labour and that sort of thing. He decides that himself. If we do not want to interfere with that basic principle of freedom on which our agricultural industry is based in South Africa, we cannot <span class="col_1263-1264" refersTo="page_648"/>expect the Government alone to be held responsible for the difficulties that we are discussing here. It seems to me that to some extent hon. members here want the Government to be held solely responsible for what goes on in the agricultural industry. No, Mr. Speaker, this question of adaptation to new circumstances is a matter which the agricultural industry as such and the farmer as such, together with the Government and together with the bodies which are able to assist them with advice and in other directions, will have to tackle together and solve together.</p>

<p>I have listened to various speakers putting forward certain suggestions which they regard as solutions. It seems to me that one of the solutions which is accepted almost generally is that if you simply adjust your price to the right level, if you have a higher price to compensate you for certain things, then everything is in order and all your difficulties are removed. I have said on a previous occasion, and I want to repeat, that the price factor is not the only factor which can place agriculture on a sound economic basis. On the contrary the price factor can be the very factor which causes it to get into difficulties. I want to mention an example again to illustrate that. If you have a good demand overseas for a certain product, as we had a few years ago in the case of canned pineapples, it means that the price of that product rises steeply and the higher it rises, the greater the investments that are made in that direction and the higher the price that is paid for land which is suitable for the production of pineapples. If that product then has to be sold on a falling market later on, then the producer who paid those prices is in trouble immediately. In this industry therefore the high prices paid for products may even be dangerous in the long run. That is why I say, Mr. Speaker, that if we are looking for a solution for these problems, we must not think that it is simply a question of saying that the producer should receive adquate compensation for his product. I think the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) put it that way when she said that &#x201C;the Government must see to it that every agricultural producer gets a living wage for the work done by him&#x201D;. She went on to say that every farmer must receive proper remuneration for the work done by him. Let me just analyse that proposition for a moment. Since we do not want to interfere with the farmer&#x2019;s freedom&#x2014;and I do not think there is anybody in this House who would wish to do so&#x2014;to buy land and to pay whatever price he likes for it&#x2014;if we retain that basic freedom &#x2014;it is an untenable proposition to say that the Government must see to it that the farmer gets proper remuneration for his labour after deducting his costs of production and after deducting interest on his capital investment, etc. I think it must be clear to every right thinking person that would result in an impossible position. It would create a totally untenable position. The difficulties that we come across in certain branches of the agricultural industry in this country are not due so much to the fact that prices have not been remunerative in the past; indeed they arise from the fact that to a very large extent prices have been remunerative and that producers have been encouraged by those remunerative prices to step up their production. There are certain commodities which were produced under these circumstances, and when prices dropped later on, the producers were unable to adapt themselves immediately to the reduction in price, with the result that they found themselves in financial difficulties.</p>

<p>As I have said, the Government is already taking certain steps to comply with the request which has come from the hon. member for Gardens. We are trying to give our farmers the necessary guidance, economically and otherwise, so that they will be able to produce in the most economic way. And we shall have to produce in the most economic way in spite of the increase in our costs of production in order to find a market for our ever-increasing production, at prices which are not necessarily highly subsidized but which will be able to compete reasonably with competitors on the overseas market. We are inclined to talk lightly about subsidies and increased subsidies. But may I remind hon. members that the higher the subsidy, the greater the production of that product. And when you have to export that product to markets abroad you immediately come up against GATT and you are told that you are dumping that product on the overseas market and that you are dumping it because you are subsidizing it internally. You may then lose that overseas market entirely or you may have such a heavy duty imposed on the product that you cannot sell it overseas at all. It is very easy to say that all we have to do is to subsidize. In a country such as South Africa with such a small population, it is much more difficult to subsidize the products of our agricultural industry than it is in other countries such as England, Germany and Italy where you have large populations and a high national income. In those countries they can subsidize internal consumption to a certain extent, but it is more difficult to do so in our country. I shall give the House the figures in a moment to show what the Government is already doing in this respect.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the upward trend in production costs. I have already said that there are certain items, which I have mentioned already, in connection with which very little can be done, but through the development of our own industries such as Foscor and others the Government is already undertaking the manufacture of our own implements and other things so as to keep our costs of production low. In that respect we are also in a transition period. There are certain industries which began a short while ago, which want a certain amount of protection, and it is necessary to support these industries because we are all convinced that in the long run they help our agricultural industry.</p>

<p><span class="col_1265-1266" refersTo="page_649"/>The third point that the hon. member makes in his motion is that the Government should see to it that markets are created for the surpluses that we have in our agricultural industry. I just want to say that as recently as two years ago we still had shortages in certain industries which are saddled with enormous surpluses to-day. As recently as two years ago we still had to import butter from New Zealand to be able to supply our regular export markets such as Rhodesia. That happened as recently as two years ago. But in the past two years the picture has changed entirely. In the past two years we have started to produce an enormous surplus of butter. Apart from the fact that in the past we did not export to the same extent to the other overseas markets to which we are obliged to export to-day, those markets in Europe, particularly the market in England (which is about the only market for our dairy produce) are being flooded with dairy produce from other countries as well as from our own country, with the result that when we had to export this butter surplus we found that the British market could not absorb it because butter was already being dumped to such a large extent from other countries. GATT was then requested to place the countries selling butter to Britain on a quota basis. And because we exported very little butter until two years ago, our quota is naturally much lower, relatively speaking, than that of countries which regularly exported to Britain, with the result that in spite of the fact that the overseas price is much lower than ours the British market at the moment is actually closed to us to a large extent and that is about the only market to which we can export butter; practically all the other countries meet their own needs. When we realized that we would be producing a surplus of butter for a reasonably long period, the Government immediately took steps together with the various boards. During the past six months we have on three occasions sent Government officials and Dairy Board officials overseas to investigate the position there with the result that to-day we are also selling butter in a country like Italy&#x2014;naturally at a lower price than our internal price. At the same time every effort has been made to encourage and to increase our internal consumption. There is only one way in which to increase consumption, and that is that the people must be prepared to pay the low price that we charge them to consume that butter. In the circumstances in which we found ourselves the Government showed its willingness to ensure an increase in the internal consumption by bringing about a reduction in the price of butter. Instead of loading the whole of the export loss on to the producer the Government introduced an additional subsidy of <i>2&#x00BD;</i> cents per &#x00BD;lb. which together with a <i>2&#x00BD;</i> cents reduction in the price of butter fat, brought about a reduction of 5 cents per lb. in the price of butter. It would seem that this effort is successful. During the few months that this scheme has been in operation the consumption of butter in all grades has increased by 6 per cent. But even if this consumption were maintained it would only mean that an additional 6,000,000 lb. of butter would be consumed and our consumption is 22,000,000 lb. That means that we shall still have 12,000,000 to 14,000,000 lb. left to be exported. I mention this only to emphasize once again that since we have this problem and since the Government is prepared to make its contribution, the producer too will have to make his contribution. Somebody has to pay for it. You cannot sell a product if the consumer is not prepared to pay for it, if he is not prepared to pay the price that you charge for it. In other words, you may be able to sell the product at a lower price but in that case either the State or the producer, or the State and the producer jointly, must carry that loss. And that is what we are trying to do here. It remains to be seen whether it will be so successful that we shall overcome our problems in connection with butter and dairy produce, but we should make this adjustment in such a way that in the long run it is to the advantage of the industry. We must not do things which may hit the industry even harder.</p>

<p>Let me take meat as another example. Until last year we had a shortage of meat in this country during certain periods. Hon. members will recall that year after year we discussed the question of the shortage of meat and they will recall that the accusation was made against the Government that people were unable to get meat. But that position too has changed from a shortage to adequate supplies throughout the greater part of the year and a surplus at other times. We have no overseas market for our meat. We have not developed an overseas market because we have not had meat to export, but to-day we have, and here I want to make an appeal to hon. members. Since we are now adopting certain methods in an effort to get rid of our surplus meat&#x2014;because it is expensive to store meat&#x2014;they must not come along with criticism when the board exports meat, for example. In the first place we must start <i>de novo</i> to develop markets for our meat. We all know that there is a very poor market overseas for mutton, and when I talk about mutton I refer to what we in South Africa describe as mutton. What the overseas market wants is young sheep, the super and prime lamb from Australia and New Zealand. But it is not only lambs which come on to our market. All sorts of sheep come on to the market here, even old ewes. In this country our Meat Board has had to buy up meat from time to time, particularly mutton, which has not been specially prepared for export but for local marketing. The Meat Board had to buy up a large number of sheep carcasses; it had to get rid of them and it tried various ways. It sold a certain number to the mines at a low price for their Native labour. A certain quantity was exported to the Congo and other places. They also had to test the overseas market and the only market that they <span class="col_1267-1268" refersTo="page_650"/>could test for that type of meat was the British market. They exported 2,000 carcasses as a test consignment to see whether there was a demand for that meat. To a large extent this was a type of meat which people overseas do not normally buy, but now the Board is being attacked and it is said that the Board exported the poorest type of meat that it could lay its hands on and that it spoiled the whole market. The Board was fully aware of the fact that this meat had not been prepared for export, but in this respect the Board has a trading function that it has to carry out. If any other person in the normal trade had exported that meat in order to test the market, there would have been no criticism, but because the Board did it, it is criticized. We became aware of the fact long ago that we were heading for a meat surplus at certain times. I said so in this House last year, and apart from this attempt made by the Board to sell this meat which it had bought up, I gave the Board permission three months ago to prepare special lamb carcasses for export so as to test the market. It is essential that we test the market, and we are making a great mistake if we think that we are going to get a better price for our meat overseas than we do with a protective price here.</p>

<p>The same thing happened in connection with beef. In the past we also exported beef which the Board had bought up here, and the same complaint was made against them. But now that it is becoming clear that we shall be able to export meat more regularly, the Board has started to export boned meat specially prepared for export, because we are sure now that we can maintain those exports for a reasonable period and that we shall be able to export regularly. But apart from that the Board also has special permission to buy up and to prepare for export prime and super young cattle carcasses in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on our own market. I mention this in order to show that these requests from the hon. member for Gardens that efforts should be made to find markets are in fact being made; efforts are being made in various directions to exploit the overseas market as far as possible. Apart from that we have sent three trade missions overseas to various parts of the world, not only to sell our industrial products but also to find a market for our agricultural produce. The various boards, such as the Citrus Board, the Meat Board and the Deciduous Fruit Board, have been sending missions overseas continually in the past few years to inquire into the possibilities of export. On behalf of my Department I appointed a special official in London to investigate the export possibilities and to advise us. But we are in a transition period and it will take us some time to determine what the actual potential of the overseas markets are. At the moment the indications are that we shall be able to find a reasonable market overseas for beef and that perhaps this market will not be overstocked so quickly; but there are other commodities such as butter, and particularly mutton, in respect of which we are aware of the fact that at the moment the market is so flooded that there is no great demand. But everything is being done to try to find a market for our surpluses.</p>

<p>We are also doing the same thing in this country. The Government is undertaking various big projects. Sasol and Iscor, etc., are busy with huge developmental programmes which must inevitably increase the internal consumption. But all this cannot be achieved within the space of a day. The Dairy Board and other boards are investigating the possibilities of disposing of products in the Bantu market at lower prices. That is already being done in the case of butter. Hon. members are so inclined to say that the Bantu market, particularly the under-nourished people, can easily be provided with milk. One hon. member has said here that if every Native gets a pint of milk the problem of the surplus will be solved. But somebody has to pay for that milk. Either the farmer must give it away free of charge or else the Bantu must pay for it. But even if somebody pays for it the milk still has to be brought to the Native, and I wonder whether hon. members realize what it costs to bring a pint of milk to the public. If hon. members adopt the attitude that the farmer&#x2019;s price must be maintained at all times and that in the meantime the State must subsidize it so that the less privileged people can get milk, it is going to cost a great deal of money, and it costs very much more to give them fresh milk. The only solution therefore is to use powdered milk. The Department of Health is conducting experiments at the moment at various institutions to see whether that powdered milk can really serve the purpose which they say it must serve.</p>

<p>The hon. member talked about school feeding, milk and cheese and raisins for the children, and he said that this was a very important market. Mr. Speaker, we know what administrative difficulties we had in that connection, but apart from that, the greatest portion of that milk never reached the people who should have got it. But how big is the market that you can reach in that way, even if it were administratively possible? I want to give hon. members the assurance that all these things which have been mentioned here to-day, even the development of the Bantu market, are being examined in every possible way by the Department and also by the boards. Together with the Minister of Bantu Administration, we have also appointed a special committee now to see how we can best reach the Bantu market with our various products. It involves research and it takes time, but all those things are being done.</p>

<p>I just want to say again that the Department of Agriculture and the Government are fully aware of these problems. Many of these problems have arisen not only because there has not been an economic price for the product, as stated by hon. members, but also because of climatic conditions. There are certain parts of the country which have had poor <span class="col_1269-1270" refersTo="page_651"/>crops year after year, and those people were caught by circumstances. I am thinking of the north-eastern Free State where we had to grant assistance. Where such circumstances have placed the farmers in a difficult position the Government has always tried to tide those people over that period by means of loans or other assistance. But we shall simply have to come to the conclusion, whether we like it or not, that there are inefficient farmers in our agricultural industry too, and if we were to adopt the attitude that we must keep all the farmers on the land, however inefficient they may be, we will be tackling an impossible task and we will be harming the agricultural industry instead of benefiting it. We shall have to accept the fact that even in our agricultural industry, where we have inefficient farmers, just as there are inefficient people in every other industry, some of our farmers will disappear from the agricultural scene from time to time. Any attempt on our part to keep on the platteland all the farmers who are there to-day is doomed to failure. The duty that rests upon us in that respect is to create other opportunities for those people who do not fit into the agricultural industry. We hear such a great deal about the depopulation of the platteland, but that depopulation has always taken place to the greatest extent at times when large sections of our farmers have done extremely well. A second reason for the depopulation of the rural areas is that our agricultural units are sometimes uneconomic, that the farmer has insufficient income and then lives on his capital as long as he can. We shall have to face these problems and find a solution for them. We shall be rendering the agricultural industry no service by adopting the attitude that we must keep on the land all those people who are farming to-day, who enjoy all these basic advantages in our economy, who have the basic freedom to buy land and to farm on it as they please. I say again therefore that I am pleased the hon. member for Gardens introduced this motion. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the time available is too short to reply adequately to what the hon. the Minister has said, but I should like to say something about it for a minute or two. I hope the hon. mover of the motion has been listening to the Minister. I hope he will get the Minister&#x2019;s Hansard and study it carefully, because it seems to me that the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins), who moved the amendment to the motion, made a speech which was entirely at variance with that of the Minister, and if the mover of the motion would get those two speeches and put them together he would have the complete answer to this debate, because the Minister and the hon. member for Wakkerstroom have been joining issue with one another right throughout.</p>

<p>What is the background of the situation today? It is that over the years, while this Government has been in power, there was under-production, and so there was a producers&#x2019; market and we were able to sell at a good price, and the Government sat back and basked in the light of conditions they had nothing to do with, and the Ministers responsible said that they were very competent Ministers and that everything was fine. But to-day we get the Minister coming along with a long list of complaints, particularly in regard to those matters where he says the Government can have little or no control. During the war we were better off than other lands, but that has nothing to do with the Minister. Other countries have surpluses, too. We are not concerned with their surpluses. We want to know whether we have a Minister who can tackle the problem in this country. What is he doing about our surplus? The basic principle is to produce and sell at a price which is competitive in the world market. Yes, we have surpluses and have to export, but what is he doing about it? He comes back to the old story that we must have lower costs of production and produce more at lower cost. What is the difference between that and the position when we had the last Government? He says the Minister of Bantu Administration has a special committee investigating the Bantu market. May I tell the Minister that if the Bantu get down to an efficient method of farming, they will ruin the White farmers of South Africa. That is the curious position. The position to-day is that because the Bantu are not producing efficiently, the Bantu farmers themselves form the market for the White man&#x2019;s produce, so what is this nonsense about producing more? The more we produce, the more surpluses we will have and the more the Minister finds it beyond his control.</p>

<p>Sir, we have a motion on the Order Paper and I challenge the Government members to vote against it, in spite of the political amendment moved by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom. It is time that we got away from this nonsense. We are dealing here with a fundamental issue and the Government is running away from it. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom came with a red herring to distract attention. Sir, I am going to sit down now timeously, and I hope the mover of the motion will forgo his right to reply and that he merely gets up and says that he now moves his motion so that the Government shall vote on this motion and the amendment. I challenge them to vote. [Interjections.] We will call for a division and let us see whether the Government votes on this fundamental issue of agriculture. I say they will funk it. They dare not let it go to the vote. Look at them. They will do everything but let it go to the vote. So I ask the mover not to reply to the debate but to call for a vote.</p>

<p>It is already the second time this Session that I have had to sing the swan-song on private members&#x2019; day, and it is just as well that the opportunity to do so presents itself to-day because we see what the political proposition was which was made by <span class="col_1271-1272" refersTo="page_652"/>the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell).

<p>That was also emphasized from both sides of the House, and there was a moderate debate. Then the hon. member for South Coast got up, stood on his head and waved his legs in connection with a motion which was intended to discuss the difficulties of the farmers and he made a political matter of it. I am now sure that whereas the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) said that she was not seeking favours for the farmer, the whole idea now is to obtain favours for that party opposite, to catch the vote of the farmer, but they have missed the ball completely because they will still have to learn that they have completely underestimated the integrity, in the agricultural sphere and otherwise, of the farmer, and that the farmer of the country knows that the party opposite has never in the past been a farmers&#x2019; party and never will be. That is all it amounts to. Those hon. members who spoke about the position in which the farmer is alleged to find himself remind me of the man and his wife who were washed away down a river. In the middle of the stream they encountered a tree and whilst the man clung to a branch his wife swam out and fetched a boat with which she rescued him and later put him into bed and gave him a cup of milk, and when he felt better he said, &#x201C;Wife, it seems to me that we are in trouble to-day&#x201D;. It is quite clear that we are all aware of the difficulties being experienced by some farmers in some areas. They have commodity troubles and regional troubles.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>It gives me pleasure to move the second reading of this Bill. I want to say at the outset that I have the approval of my party caucus to bring this matter before the House, although my party has decided to treat this as an open matter and to give members on this side a free vote. I understand that the official Opposition have done the same thing, and I want to thank them for it in advance I am sure that hon. members will discuss this matter in an objective and realistic way to-day and I do not even want to make an appeal to them to do so therefore.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the history of this Bill. This Bill was drafted by the Confederation of Labour in co-operation with the two chiropractors&#x2019; associations that exist in South Africa. I have here the minutes of the congress at which this matter was discussed and I want to quote what the congress said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the Confederation of Labour last year we decided to make representations to the hon. the Minister of Health to introduce legislation to grant recognition to and to exercise control over chiropractors. This matter has now progressed so far that the Confederation of Labour and the two chiropractors&#x2019; associations have prepared a Bill. We have looked for a Member of Parliament to introduce this Bill as a private Bill, and we can only express the hope that when that is done the Members of Parliament will be allowed to vote according to their convictions. We believe that the Bill will then become law.</block>

<p>I want to say at once that this Confederation of Labour consists of three trade unions, the S.A. Federation of Trade Unions, the Federal Consultative Council of Railway Staff Associations and the Trade Unions Co-ordinating Council, and according to figures given to me by the Department of Labour, these three trade unions represent more than 180,000 members. According to other information, there are also other trade unions which support this Bill. For example, I have a letter here from Mr. L. J. van den Berg, the chairman of the Trade Unions Co-ordinating Council which he addressed to the Minister of Health and in which he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Confederation of Labour decided as long ago as last year to make representations to Your Honour with a view to such recognition. We held discussions with the representatives of the chiropractors &#x2026; I may add that the fourth trade union federation (apart from this Confederation of Labour), namely the Trade Union Council, was represented last year at this meeting where this matter was discussed and that their representatives fully associated themselves with the decision that the trade union movement should take steps in this matter.</block>

<p><span class="col_1273-1274" refersTo="page_653"/>When one bears that in mind, one realizes what great support this Bill enjoys amongst the workers of South Africa. I also have a letter here dated 9 February of this year from the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union in which the general secretary says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to express the hope that it will be piloted through the House of Assembly and that you will be granted the necessary time for a full discussion of this matter.</block>

<p>This Bill is supported not only by these 180,000 members of the Confederation of Labour who caused the Bill to be drawn up, but, Sir, I think you will probably concede that I can claim that almost the whole of the trade union organization in South Africa supports this Bill. The reason for that is perfectly clear. Members of the trade unions make use of these services, but they are not allowed, as in the case of medical practitioners, to send their bills to the medical aid societies for settlement. As a rule the constitution of the majority of medical aid societies or medical funds, contains a clause prohibiting the payment of fees charged by persons who are not registered with the Medical Council. In other words, workers who go to chiropractors cannot have their bills paid through the medical aid societies. That is why the trade union organizations support this Bill and caused it to be drawn up. I think I should tell the House immediately that it is not the chiropractors who asked me to submit this Bill. This request, as the minutes show, came from the trade union organizations. They asked me to submit this Bill in their interests. When I was asked to pilot this Bill through the House, I had to satisfy myself as to whether it can be regarded as being in the public interest that such a Bill should be brought to this House, and I must say that having studied and considered the matter I came to the conclusion that it would be in the public interest to grant this recognition to chiropractors.</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to ascertain, chiropractors have been practising in South Africa for the past 40 or 50 years, but it is particularly in recent times, after World War II, that their numbers have grown considerably, and it is interesting&#x2014;and I say this without reproach&#x2014;to note that it was in fact the United Party Government which was largely responsible after the last world war for increasing the number of chiropractors in South Africa. On demobilization the Smuts Government gave bursaries to 26 ex-soldiers to qualify as chiropractors in the United States of America. Bearing in mind the fact that to-day there are only approximately 100 chiropractors in South Africa, not all of whom are practising, this addition of 26 who were granted bursaries by the then Government, represents a great addition to the number of chiropractors in the post-war period. I say again that I do not reproach the previous Government, but I do want to draw the inference from that fact that the United Party and the then Government regarded the work done by chiropractors as useful work, because one does not give bursaries to people out of State funds to go and study abroad unless one thinks that the profession that they practise is of some use. The number of chiropractors in this country is still increasing steadily. At the moment there are 40 students abroad. I have a telegram here that I received to-day and that I should like to read out to the House. It comes from Davenport and this telegram was sent by Boshoff, president of the South African Students Club, Palmer College. I want to say to the House in parenthesis that this Mr. Boshoff is the son of Professor S. P. E. Boshoff, the well-known philologist, and he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">May success be yours in your appreciated efforts for chiropractic recognition. Dr. Palmer, President of world&#x2019;s largest chiropractic college, shares with present 26 South African students in Davenport their best wishes for success of proposed Bill.</block>

<p>I only mention this here as an interesting telegram that I received to-day. Since the number of chiropractors in South Africa is growing, I have come to the conclusion that there are only two courses open to this House. We in this legislative assembly must either forbid chiropractors to continue practising&#x2014;that is the one alternative&#x2014;or in the interests of the public and in the interests of their profession we should give them the opportunity to exercise effective control over their members. If there are dangers and malpractices which are inherent in chiropractic as a profession, as certain people allege, then we should forbid chiropractors, in the interests of the public, to practise their profession in South Africa. If it involves certain dangers to the public, then that is the only logical step that we can take. But if those dangers are attributable, for example, to poor training in some cases, or to the fact that untrained persons or persons with only meagre training hold themselves out as chiropractors, then in my opinion we should enable them to put their own house in order and to control themselves and to place their profession on a sound footing. Then there is no need for us to prohibit them. After all that was the position before the medical profession received recognition. At that time people with meagre training and all sorts of certificates acted as doctors, and it was then made possible for the doctors to control their members through the Medical Act which the Medical Council framed.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that these chiropractors have done a great deal of good to many people. Many of these people who have been helped and in many cases cured by chiropractors, or who have been given relief after years of suffering, are people who made the full round of the medical profession before <span class="col_1275-1276" refersTo="page_654"/>going to chiropractors. I have an article here dealing with chiropractice in America. It was not written by a chiropractor; it was written by an article writer. This article alleges that 75 per cent of the patients who visit chiropractors are people who first went to the medical profession, who could not be helped by the medical profession and only then went to chiropractors. If it is true that chiropractors help thousands of people, then I do not think that this House will forbid chiropractors to practise their profession. I do not think that public opinion would permit it. The support which is given to this Bill by the trade union movement proves to what extent the chiropractors enjoy the support of the public. There are even members in this, the highest legislative assembly of this country, who can testify to what extent chiropractors have improved their own health and the health of members of their family. Since last year I have received numerous letters, and perhaps I should read out some of these letters to the House. I am not going to detain the House very long by quoting letters, but I do think that hon. members will find a few of these letters interesting. I also have here a long telegram of three sheets asking that this Bill be placed on the Statute Book. The telegram reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are proud of you for attempting to obtain protection under the law for chiropractors. In 1956 I was in the general hospital for two months under the treatment of specialists, for the manipulation of dorsal and cervical vertebrae, without success. I was removed by ambulance from the hospital to a chiropractor. After two treatments I was able to drive my motor vehicle myself. After six treatments I was cured.</block>

<p>And so this telegram goes on. Then I have a letter here which was not addressed to me but to the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) who handed it over to me. In this letter this person says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You know how long I was suffering, how many times I received treatment in the hospital from the best specialists, and I continued to suffer until two months ago. The same applies to my wife. She was suffering from back trouble, etc. for ten years. I paid hundreds of pounds for medical, theraputic and X-ray treatment but without success. It gives relief for two or three weeks at most. Now after treatment for six weeks by &#x2026;</block>

<p>He then mentions the name of the chiropractor&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; we are both healthier than we have been in the past ten years, and that without a drop of medicine.</block>

<p>Then I have a letter here from an English-speaking person from the city of Durban. This letter comes from Bishop&#x2019;s Gate, Smith Street, Durban, and this English-speaking person says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have read in this evening&#x2019;s <i>Natal Daily News</i> of your efforts to obtain recognition of chiropractors. I wish you God speed. Unfortunately I lost the use of my right arm, after arriving here. My general practitioner called it a &#x201C;frozen shoulder&#x201D;. He sent me to a surgeon, who, in turn, arranged for me to go to St. Augustine&#x2019;s hospital. The surgeon then manipulated the shoulder under a general anaesthetic. I was far worse afterwards and in a great deal of pain. I was then told of another doctor, a radiologist, who could stop the pain by deep-ray treatment. He did, but he also told me that I had been treated wrongly, the real trouble being in my neck. He could only stop the pain. I still could not use the arm. I am a ladies&#x2019; hairdresser. I had sold a very prosperous business in London to come to the country of my choice. Can you imagine my worry? Then I went to &#x2026;</block>

<p>He then gives the name of the chiropractor&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I was a mass of bruises from the hospital manipulation; in short, I was in a bad way &#x2026; I know, without any doubt whatever, that I have this chiropractor to thank for the fact that I now have the full use of my right arm.</block>

<p>I could read out numerous other telegrams and letters of this kind to the House, but I do not want to go on with this sort of evidence. I can only tell you that I have come to the conclusion that in these circumstances we in this House cannot forbid the chiropractors to carry on with their work. I say therefore that only the second alternative is open to this House and that is to recognize the chiropractic profession. And if we do recognize it, we shall only be following the example of quite a number of countries which have already given that recognition. In the United States of America, where chiropractice originated, it has already been recognized by 46 out of the 50 federal states; the medical profession in the United States has been opposing recognition to chiropractors for the past 60 years or longer, and yet we find that to-day there are 30,000 chiropractors in the United States. I just want to quote here from a &#x201C;special McCall&#x2019;s report by Samuel Grafton&#x201D;. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Certainly chiropractic has been attacked by organized medicine for almost two-thirds of a century since, with passion and high <span class="col_1277-1278" refersTo="page_655"/>anger. The results of the long fight hardly represent a clear-cut victory for medicine.</block>

<p>As I have said, in the United States there are 30,000 chiropractors to-day who are recognized in 46 out of 50 of the federal states. They have been recognized in six provinces of Canada, and outside America they have been recognized in Switzerland. I have here all the legislation passed by the district governments in Switzerland to grant recognition to chiropractice. During 1960 a measure was placed on the Statute Book in New Zealand granting recognition to chiropractice. I have the Act here with me. Then there are other states like Greece and Denmark and Mexico which have also recognized chiropractice. I mention this only to show that more and more recognition is being granted to chiropractice.</p>

<p>Let me explain immediately what the objects of this Bill are. In the first place this Bill accepts the fact that there are approximately 100 chiropractors in this country who are continuing their practice. Even assuming that they treat only a few hundred patients a year, it is clear that large numbers of people visit chiropractors every year, people who obtain assistance and relief from them and whose health is sometimes restored by them. This Bill seeks to give these people, the public, an opportunity to be treated by registered chiropractors so that they will know that they are dealing with a trained, registered chiropractor. But this Bill also seeks to give chiroprators the opportunity to put their own house in order. It is the desire of the chiropractors to ensure that only trained chiropractors will practise the profession. They would like to ensure and raise the standard of their profession by prescribing examinations, as provided for in the Bill. I know that last year hon. members on the other side expressed some doubt as to whether it was possible to prescribe examinations efficaciously so as to make sure that a certain standard would be maintained by chiropractors. I am not going to deal with the educational qualifications of chiropractors; I leave that to other members. I merely want to say this with regard to educational qualifications in America to-day that there are 16 chiropractic colleges and one in Canada which prescribe a minimum course of four years. I have a cutting here which says that in America a chiropractor must first write a &#x201C;basic science&#x201D; examination together with medical students and thereafter a Chiropractic State Board examination before he can be given a certificate to practise his profession. There is nothing to prevent us in South Africa from inserting a provision in this Bill prescribing a minimum educational qualification such as matriculation, for example, before students will be allowed to study chiropractice overseas. Unfortunately there is no such college in South Africa. We can lay down the certain basic subjects which must be taken such as anatomy and physiology, diagnostics, radiology, etc., for example, to mention just a few, in which an examination can be written in South Africa before a chiropractor is allowed to practise. If they can institute such an examination in America, then we can institute a similar examination here. I wanted to refer this Bill to a Select Committee to go into this matter and unfortunately that was not allowed, but these are matters which could have been dealt with by a Select Committee.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with this Bill in its full details. It is not an involved Bill and its aims are no doubt clear to every member.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would appeal to hon. members to face the practical situation as we have to deal with it in South Africa to-day and to realize that we must devise ways and means of meeting that situation in an objective, judicious way. I have read the debate that was held in 1960 in the New Zealand House of Representatives. There the Minister of Health who introduced the Bill said that he was not going to argue over the fact that the medical profession there, the British Medical Association, was opposed to granting recognition to chiropractice, first as they are here in South Africa. The New Zealand Minister of Health stated that he accepted the fact that these people were practising and that for the sake of the public, for the sake of the profession, he wished to give recognition to the chiropractors to give them an opportunity to put their own house in order. That is why I say that we should devise a plan which will enable the public, for the sake of their own protection, to make use of the services of registered chiropractors only. Let us give the chiropractors the opportunity to lay down certain minimum qualifications for the training of members of their profession. To me this Bill is an indication of the desire on the part of the chiropractors to place their work on a high standard and in so doing to look after the interests of the public as well as the interests of their own profession. I have pleasure therefore in moving the second reading of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) correctly stated here that the Confederation of Labour, i.e. the trade unions, raised this matter and that they took certain resolutions in regard to it. I first just want to put this fact to the House, namely that although that is so, it is right that trade unions should give guidance to a House like this on a matter which must be a higlhy technical one, because it deals with the question as to whether people who have not had <span class="col_1279-1280" refersTo="page_656"/>the basic medical training should be allowed to handle the human body and to treat patients.</p>

<p>The second point the hon. member mentioned here is in regard to accounts which cannot be sent to the sick funds. I know that one of the main underlying reasons why the chiropractors feel so strongly about this legislation is because they would like to have their accounts paid by the sick funds. Medical science fully recognizes the value of manipulation and massage, but for that there is, in the first place, the bone specialists who do not undergo training for four years only, but for eleven years, to decide on manipulation, and in the second place there are the physiotherapists who receive a training which includes a basic medical training and who are recognized right throughout the world. There is therefore ample opportunity for manipulation, as well as for physiotherapy in present-day medical science.</p>

<p>In the third place, the hon. member said that he had to ascertain whether it was in the public interest to introduce this Bill and that he became quite convinced in his own mind that was so. I want to say this very clearly&#x2014;and I hope to prove it in the course of my further remarks&#x2014;that I am quite convinced that this House would be taking a great retrograde step in regard to science and the wonderful things medical science has already achieved for all of us if this Bill is to be put on the statute book. The hon. member quoted letters referring to the good done by chiropractors, and I do not want to quibble about that. Nor am I going to point out a single mistake to-day, although from the very nature of the matter I have much written material in regard to the mistakes made by these people. But my argument is not based on that at all. The hon. member has received various letters from people, who say that chiropractors have benefited them, and I accept that, but can that be the basis on which a House like this should decide whether people should be recognized as being fit to handle the human body, merely because a number of letters were written? In the first place, some of them must be inspired, but supposing that is not so, we can at any time obtain various letters written by people saying, &#x201C;Herbalists have done wonders for me; naturopaths have done wonders for me; cancer doctors have done wonderful things, also witchdoctors&#x201D;. I do not think that as a House we can take that as a basis on which to come to a decision. The hon. member has not mentioned a single scientist of repute in the whole world who at least gives his blessing to chiropractice. I think that when we are dealing with a matter like this, which concerns the human body and its treatment, we must turn to the great scientists of the world, because only from them can one receive the correct guidance.</p>

<p>In the first place, I want to say that my opposition to this Bill is based mainly on one matter, namely that there is no scientific basis at all for chiropractice. Medical science has done wonderful things in recent years. Chiropractice has a history, according to the hon. member, of 40 to 50 years, i.e. since 1912. Medical science has a history of 2,500 years.</p>

<p>I accept that, but I am trying to make the point that where we are dealing here with the human body we have to decide for ourselves whether we are dealing with a practice which has a scientific basis or not. To me that is the most important point we have to decide. In this regard I want to quote the views of the great men of the world&#x2014;the greatest in the world&#x2014;in respect of the treatment of the human body and in regard to medical science. Dr. Harvey, one of the great men of Yale University, says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1281-1282" refersTo="page_657"/>There is no pathological basis whatever for the theory of chiropractic, and it is silly to allude to it as a science.</block>

<p>Dr. Hugh Cabolt, of Mayo Clinic, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The theory of chiropractic is without scientific basis.</block>

<p>I want to point out that these are all medical men, but who else in the world can we ask whether a practice which deals with the human body has a scientific basis or not? They are the only people who can give us guidance in this regard, and they are the only people whose guidance we can confidently accept when we see what medical science has achieved.</p>

<p>These are the scientific opinions held by these men as the result of investigations they have been asked to do from time to time over a long period. Chiropractic has been thoroughly investigated by medical science. Also, the things done by cancer doctors are not ignored; they are thoroughly investigated by medical science, but if there is nothing in it, it is certainly not adopted by medical science, and when we talk about scientific matters it must be proved in the laboratory what the causes are, what the consequences are and what the cure is. That is the basis on which medical science works. Prof. Burr of the Department of Anatomy at Yale University says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Chiropractic is neither a theory nor a science It is fundamentally unsound.</block>

<p>Prof. Davies, Chief of New Research Region in the North-Western University College of Medicine, Chicago, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The theory on which chiropractic is based is quite false.</block>

<p>Emeritus professor of medicine, Prof. Barker, of John Hopkins&#x2014;what does he say? And when we speak about John Hopkins and Yale and Chicago, we are mentioning the great names in medical science. The fruits we are plucking in medicine emanate from those places. Dr. Barker says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The theory of chiropractic is entirely fallacious and has no true scientific foundation.</block>

<p>Dr. Dudley Morton of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The nebulous and vague character of the premise on which it is founded precludes any scientific status.</block>

<p>A second question I wish to pose in this regard is this: Is there any proof, in so far as anatomy is concerned, that there is a scientific basis for chiropractic? Now I again want to read what Prof. Huber, Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Graduate School of the University of Michigan, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no condition of subluxation or misalignment of the spinal vertebrae in the sense used by the chiropractic practitioner. If such condition, by reason of accident or disease, actually is found, it requires skilled surgery.</block>

<p>Prof. Bensley, Director of the Department of Anatomy of the University of Chicago, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a period of 29 years, during which time I have been Director of this Department of Anatomy, we have never found in our dissecting rooms a single instance in which the foramen or aperture between the vertebrae through which the nerve-branches issue from the spinal cord have been so narrowed as to cause pressure upon nerves.</block>

<p>And I may say that Bensley is one of the great names. He is not a practising doctor, but a professor in anatomy. That is precisely the basis on which the chiropractor works, but Prof. Bensley says that he has never found it in 29 years. A last one, Prof. Lewis, Surgeon-in-Chief of the John Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my judgment, it is not possible to reduce subluxation or misalignment of the vertebrae and thus relieve pressure of the nerve-branches by manipulation of the hand.</block>

<p>And then I must still mention the name of Prof. Lahey of the Lahey Clinic in Boston. I do not think there is anyone with a higher reputation in the medical world than Prof. Lahey, particularly for his research. He is very cautious, but he says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be a pity if the single standard of scientific attainment, cannot be maintained for all. It has been such a difficult climb to accomplish the progress which has been accomplished and true scientific medicine has done so much for humanity that it would be a great pity if a fanciful, theoretical method of practice as proposed by chiropractors is placed upon an even footing with medical science.</block>

<p><span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_658"/>I have mentioned these few people, but let me now also mention the finding of one of the greatest medical research institutions in the world, namely Heidelberg in West Germany. They investigated the matter and they particularly investigated whether there was not in fact something in chiropractice, and at the end they came to the following conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The medical profession insists that a chiropractic theory of diseases runs counter to so many of the established facts of medical science that it is not entitled to serious consideration.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in South Africa we received a lead in regard to the matter, and we received that lead from the SA. Medical and Dental Council, and let me say now that the Medical Council was established by this Parliament in 1928. It is a Council which in the first place consists of lay members, in the second place, of members of the legal profession, and in the third place of members of the nursing profession, of medical men and representatives of the training schools, people who are not in practice. The Medical Council adopted a very clear attitude. They gave evidence before a Select Committee of this House in 1952, and I think the hon member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) was Chairman of the Select Committee, and this is what the Medical Council stated after mature consideration. They were discussing the omission of, chiropractors from the Medical Auxiliary Services Act, and they said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This omission is, in the opinion of the Council, which was consulted when the Bill was drafted, deliberate. Osteopaths, chiropractors, etc. do not complement the services rendered by medical practitioners and the auxiliary workers included or to be included in terms of the Bill They oust them. They base their practices on conceptions of the ethiology and pathology of diseases which are totally different from those of scientific medicine, and no reconciliation is possible.</block>

<p>That is what the Medical Council said, and I shall come back to it later. I must also submit to hon. members the most recent decision of the Medical Council which I have. And now I want to repeat that when it comes to scientific matters I do not think, with all respect to this House, that we are capable of deciding. It is a scientific matter. In all spheres we allow ourselves to be guided by bodies which have been established, like the Bureau of Standards, the C.S.I.R., and also in regard to Defence, and we let ourselves be guided by the Medical Council when it comes to matters like polio and things like that, and this is the standpoint of the Medical Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Council accepts the doctrine of scientific medicine where all theories of the causation and treatment of disease are constantly subjected to critical scientific analysis and research. The Council does not accept the concept on which chiropractors base diagnosis and treatment; their theories of the aetiology of disease are demonstrably false and at complete variance with the concept of scientific medicine. As the Council has a public duty to perform and has to advise the Legislature on the best form of medical practice, it would regard any recognition of this group under the proposed legislation, or any other legislation, as a retrograde step. To the general public, rightly or wrongly statutory recognition of chiropractors will convey some kind of Parliamentary guarantee of the validity of the principles underlying this sect.</block>

<p>They call it a sect because it has no scientific basis&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This applies not only to recognition under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, but to recognition under any other Bill. The Council does not regard these persons as supplementing the services of general practitioners or of the group of recognized auxiliaries. From the point of view of logic a case cannot consequently be made for their recognition under any Act.</block>

<p>I want to bring further proof, and I quote the judgments of scientists because I myself can allow myself to be led only by them. The State of New York in America had an investigation made by the Professor of Anatomy of the University College of Medicine, Cyracuse University, and by an Associate Professor of Pathology, Columbia University, and a Professor of Bio-Physics of Cornell University, and this is their finding&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fundamental tenet of chiropractic claims that all disease is due primarily to pressure on nerves. It should be emphasized at the very outset that nerve pressure as the primary cause of disease is only a belief.</block>

<p>That is what medical science ascertained over all these years through dissection in the anatomy room&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The chiropractors have not demonstrated its truth by scientific experimentation. They have assumed that it is true and, on this assumption, have instituted methods of treatment. There is, however, a large body of scientific facts which conclusively disproves the fundamental tenet of chiropractic.</block>

<p><span class="col_1285-1286" refersTo="page_659"/>Then they continue, and towards the end of the report they submitted to the State of New York they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We would not take our car with engine trouble to a mechanic who believes that all car trouble results solely from the improper adjustment of the spark plugs. And yet we are doing a comparable thing when we allow the chiropractor with his erroneous concepts of disease based on false tenets, to manipulate the body. All too frequently the result is tragedy. The public should be protected from the errors of such misguided incompetence.</block>

<p>If one now wants to know further what chiropractice is, one should study its history. The hon. member who has introduced the motion read out a telegram he received from a Dr. Palmer. Now I would like to tell hon. members what the history of the chiropractic is. In 1895 a grocer by the name of D. D. Palmer of Davonport began to practise nature cures, and one day he came across a deaf man who had been deaf for 17 years, and by manipulating his back he cured him. That was the start of the whole thing. But this curing of the deafness of this man gives rise to all kinds of questions. It is said here: &#x201C;This was a discovery that was to evolve in a new theory of the treatment of diseases. As a grocer, Palmer could hardly be expected to know that the nerves of hearing never enter the spine, but are completely enclosed in the. head.&#x201D; But in any case, Palmer started it. His son then took over from him and turned it into a big business. And now we will let the son himself speak, in 1920, this B. J. Palmer from whom the telegram comes. In 1920 he addressed the chiropractors&#x2019; convention in Butte and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our school back at Davonport is established on a business and not a professional basis. It is a business where we manufacture chiropractors. They have got to work just like machinery. A course of salesmanship goes along with their training. We teach them the idea and show them how to sell it.</block>

<p>But I would like to throw more light on this same school, the Palmer School, and the person who has now sent this telegram. In 1910 there was a court case dealing with chiropractic and then this so-called Dr. Palmer had to give evidence. The following questions were put to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How old are you?&#x2014;I was 28 last September. <br/>And you have been studying chiropractics 16 years?&#x2014;I have. <br/>Then you began the study of chiropractics at the age of 12?&#x2014;At the age of 12 I was practising in the field as a practitioner. <br/>Of what?&#x2014;Chiropractics. At the age of 11 I was kicked from home, forced to make my living. <br/>What education had you up to that time? &#x2014;Common-sense <br/>What education had you had at the time you began the practice of chiropractics?&#x2014; Common-sense. <br/>No other?&#x2014;Horse-reasoning. <br/>Any other?&#x2014;Good judgment. <br/>Any other?&#x2014;That is enough. <br/>Any other, I ask you?&#x2014;That is enough. <br/>Did you attend any schools at all?&#x2014;I attended the common graded school. <br/>What grade did you finish?&#x2014;I graduated from the ninth grade. <br/>First year high is it?&#x2014;That is not the first year high in our school, no. <br/>Where was that?&#x2014;That was at Davonport, Iowa. <br/>Have you since that time attended any school of literature, science or any school of any kind?&#x2014;I graduated from the Palmer School of Chiropractic under my father. Your father gave birth to chiropractics?&#x2014; No, he could not give birth to an idea. <br/>Isn&#x2019;t it a fact that you stated on the stand the other day that chiropractic was born, or that your father gave it birth 15 years ago? &#x2014;Father not being an obstetrician he could not give birth to an idea. <br/>Did you not make the statement?&#x2014;Father is not an obstetrician.</block>

<p>And this Palmer was properly sworn and the case proceeded further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Who first put into practice the science of chiropractic?&#x2014;My father. <br/>What was your father&#x2019;s profession at that time?&#x2014;He was a magnetic healer prior to that. <br/>How did he first get the idea?&#x2014;Purely by accident, as all great movements start. <br/>You may explain?&#x2014;Harvey Lirrard was a janitor in the building in which father had his office at that time. <br/>Harvey came in one day thoroughly deaf. Father asked him (&#x201C;die dowe man&#x201D;) how long he had been deaf, and he told him: 17 years. Father said: &#x201C;How did this occur?&#x201D;. Harvey said, &#x201C;I was in a stooped, cramped position, and while in that position I felt something pop and heard it crack in my back&#x201D;. Father looked him over, laid him down on the cot, and there was a great subluxation on the back. Harvey said he went deaf within two minutes after that popping occurred in the spine and he had been deaf ever since, 17 years. Father reasoned out the fundamental thought of this thing, <span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_660"/>which was that if something went wrong in that back and caused deafness the reduction of that subluxation should cure it. That bump was adjusted, was reduced, and within ten minutes Harvey had his hearing and has had it ever since. He is now janitor in the City Hall at Davonport, Iowa.</block>

<p>Then he was asked further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Up to the time that adjustment was given he was deaf as a post?&#x2014;He could not hear the rumbling of a wagon on the street. <br/>Yet he carried on a conversation with your father?&#x2014;By yelling, yes. <br/>Since that time you have developed the science of chiropractics?&#x2014;Well, I have developed more new thoughts in that line.</block>

<p>I think I must leave it there. This Palmer School advertises as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do you want to follow manual labour or a profession? <br/>The field of common labour is crowded. There are any number of persons who want to do hard work. Let those who are anxious have it. You fit yourself for a profession. <br/>Our school is established on a business and not on a professional basis. We manufacture chiropractors.</block>

<p>I think this is enough in regard to the history. But may I just say very clearly now that in this respect this House will have to decide whether chiropractice has a scientific basis or not. You know, Abraham Lincoln one day asked some people: If a beast&#x2019;s tail is also a foot, how many feet has that animal? They replied &#x201C;five&#x201D;. He said: &#x201C;No, because calling a tail a foot does not make it a foot, so it remains four feet&#x201D;. And whatever we call chiropractice, it still remains a matter which has no scientific basis.</p>

<p>In the second place, I just want to refer to this Bill. The Bill asks that the Council should be composed of one member appointed by the Minister and his Department, and further there will be six members who are chiropractors. There it ends. Now I ask how on earth one can constitute a Council to exercise control over people who have to treat the human body if that Council consists only of their own people? The Medical Council has lay members, medical men, the representatives of training schools and members of the legal profession, but the request here is that only chiropractors should serve on the Council. In view of the fact that the concept of chiropractic is in conflict with our concept of science, and also of the scientists in the Department of Health, I ask how can there ever be co-operation? How can the hon. the Minister of Health ask a medical practitioner in his Department to serve on that Council whilst it is in conflict with his scientific conceptions? I also want to point out that three former Ministers of Health adopted a very strong attitude against it. The late Dr. Karel Bremer expressed himself very unequivocally against it in the Senate, and Dr. Stals also expressed himself as being against it as early as 1927, also on the basis that there was no scientific foundation for chiropractice. Dr. Gluckman, who was also a Minister of Health at one time, did the same. Now I ask again: How can there be co-operation between the Department of Health, which is founded on a scientific basis, and something which according to their own evidence has no scientific basis?</p>

<p>Now in regard to the constitution of the Council which in terms of this Bill is to consist of chiropractors only, I want to point out that according to their own evidence, that includes osteopaths, etc. But I want to get on to the matter of training.</p>

<p>In South Africa we have no school for chiropractic. No single school in America is affiliated with a university. Now I ask again: Where one is dealing with human bodies, how can one have training schools which are not affiliated with universities with years of experience? In South Africa it will simply be impossible. The majority of our medical schools are affiliated with universities, but not one of these universities will be prepared to take up a matter which has no scientific basis and to make facilities available for it. But in the second place a very thorough investigation was made in this regard by the State of New Jersey, and this investigation, I may say, was done by lay members. They obviously deliberately appointed non-medical men for the investigation, and this was their finding&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A practitioner, the Committee believes, ought to be acquainted with all the known means by which a bodily condition can be cured or alleviated, so that he may use his best judgment in using therapy.</block>

<p>They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the chiropractors, the medical profession and the committee are all in full agreement on the importance of adequate, basic training, the fundamental question would seem to be this: Are students presently enrolled in chiropractic schools or colleges receiving adequate training to be licensed to treat the sick?<br/>The committee&#x2019;s answer to that question is a categorical &#x201C;No&#x201D;.<br/>The training is inadequate for three reasons? No pre-chiropractic training on the college level is required before admission to a chiropractic school.</block>

<p>We have no chiropractic training school in South Africa. And even though we have this Council, what control can they exercise over training which takes place beyond the borders of the Republic? The most they can do is to refuse these people, but then they must refuse them all. The hon. member who introduced <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_661"/>the motion said that they received training for four years. A few years ago we in South Africa extended medical training for six to seven years But another reason why this training is not sufficient is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The approved chiropractic schools do not give the same quality of instruction as medical schools.</block>

<p>In this regard I want to say this: The school in New York, which trains many of the people who at the moment practise chiropractic, has 28 instructors for 282 students. The Medical School of Columbia University has 342 full-time and part-time teachers for 400 students. It is no use giving figures and saying that a student receives so many hours&#x2019; training The basis is not right. And then in the third place, and this is the most important to me, they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The chiropractic student receives practically no clinical training No chiropractic school has any kind of hospital affiliation.</block>

<p>Not a single school where chiropractors are trained has any connection with a medical school. Sir, how can we send people out into the world to treat the human body and to pass as doctors whilst the schools where they are trained have no affiliation with hospitals? Nor have they any hope of getting it, because they are entirely lacking in a scientific basis. Also in South Africa there is no affiliation with any hospital. Mr. Speaker, we are busy deciding a matter where we must be guided by people who know about those things. Permit me to say further that this is not a struggle between medical men and chiropractors at all. The function of the Medical Council is in fact to train as many doctors as possible. We welcome the opening of a new medical school. It is not a question of competition here. The medical profession welcomes it if there are more doctors, and the Medical Council welcomes it if there is more competition. But our standpoint is that the chiropractor and chiropractic is not founded on any scientific basis. That is why we are opposed to it.</p>

<p>I have said that I did not want to discuss the mistakes which are made. Let me now immediately give my alternative. I feel very strongly about vested interests in any share, and the fact is that we in South Africa have for many years allowed chiropractors to practise. They make a living out of it, their bread and butter comes from it, and I believe that those who are there should not be deprived of their work. Let them be allowed to practise, but let us decide, seeing that this thing has no scientific basis, that not a single one more will be allowed in South Africa.</p>

<p>If they constitute a danger to health, how can you then allow them to practise?</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Let me say that I do not base my argument at all on the question of whether it is dangerous to health. That is also true, but my argument is that this House is not qualified to judge scientific matters. As in every other respect, we must be led by scientific people If there is no such scientific basis, we will be rendering a tremendous disservice to the medical profession if we take the step proposed. All the medical progress over the years was based on a scientific foundation. I feel strongly that we should accept the advice of scientists, and that we should particularly take into account the advice of the Medical Council.</p>

<p>I must hurry, because I know my time has lapsed, but I want to conclude by saying: Do not let us undermine the authority of the Medical Council, a body which we ourselves established. Do not let us do anything in regard to which science tells us that it is wrong. And in the second place, do not let us take a vote here on this matter in regard to which the Medical Council told us the following in 1952, when it was giving evidence before our Select Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Select Committee on evidence which will undoubtedly be submitted to it by osteopaths, etc. feels that some kind of statutory recognition should be granted to these people in terms of this Bill or of any other measure, the S.A. Medical and Dental Council wants to urge strongly that it should be afforded the opportunity of submitting evidence as to the nature of osteopathy, chiropractic, etc. and an analysis and interpretation of the results achieved by the practioners of this cult.</block>

<p>That was said by Professor Oosthuizen, the present Chairman of the Medical Council.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to-day standards and standardization are the watchwords, but the proviso is always that it should be on a scientific basis. This House and the Government allow themselves to be led by scientists of the C.S.I.R. or in respect of the Broadcasting Corporation, or in respect of Defence and in all other spheres. I ask this House also to consider seriously, in this matter affecting the human body, our most precious possession, being guided by the great and wonderful scientists which the world has given to itself and to South Africa. I think they are the people who can give a lead in this respect, and we should follow that lead, unless we want to make a great mistake.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this Bill, and in my opinion the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) is rendering a public service by introducing a Bill such as this. Because, Mr.Speaker, <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_662"/>the chiropractor is here to stay. He is doing a public service and rendering an enormous amount of good to many people throughout the country, and throughout the world, and there is room for all those people who render such a public service to the public in the relief of pain and making them fit and well again and relieving their incapacity for work or free movement. And if the chiropractor is here to stay, Sir, I think it is right that he should be given the right to organize himself properly in an association, to protect the public. Because that is what the Bill does. Through this Bill the chiropractors in the Republic are asking for the right to organize their own association, to regulate the services rendered, to see that only trained people and people of a certain standard of training are registered, and to lay down regulations to control those persons in the way they provide service and what they do. There are many people walking around to-day who would not be walking so easily if it were not for the chiropractor, people who had been under doctors&#x2019; treatment and who, although they had been considerably relieved of their pains, were not free in their movements and certainly not free of pain. Let me mention fibrositis. I know of men in this House, not one but several, who since I have been in this House have suffered badly from fibrositis of the shoulder, the neck and other parts of their body, men who have only had relief when they had gone to the chiropractor. I know of those cases personally. I know of many medical men who go to chiropractors themselves as well as members of their families. I have met them in the consulting rooms in this very city. I think we must recognize this fact and give the chiropractors the right to organize themselves and to see to it that chiropractors are properly trained. We know that many to-day are only half trained or semi-trained. On the other hand, some of your best and leading chiropractors have taken overseas courses lasting up to six years It is only right that the public should be protected from these untrained men who profess to be chiropractors and trade on the fact that relief from pain is given by those who are fully trained and know their job.</p>

<p>As I have said before, Mr. Speaker, there is room for everybody who gives treatment that leads to the relief of pain and who gives an ill person the capacity to do his work and to have free movement rather than suffer from pain every day of his life. I would remind you, Sir, that the Government of this country at the time actually made grants through the D.S.D.C. after the last war, to ex-service personnel to enable them to proceed overseas to be trained in chiropractics. I think most of the chiropractors in my own city are men who were trained on State grants in America to become chiropractors. To my knowledge they have done a tremendous amount of good. You hear many people who are opposed to chiropractics say that it is faith healing and all that sort of thing. My experience has been that I only went to a chiropractor after I had failed to get further relief from the medical practitioner I think 90 per cent of the people who go to chiropractors only go there as a last resort They do not go there with the idea that it is faith healing; they only go there because they get treatment that does them good and because they realize that they are doing something to help themselves. I can only say to those who suggest that there is nothing in chiropractics, that the proof of the pudding lies in the eating. People go to chiropractors as a last resort. They get such satisfaction that they go back again.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Speaker, I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill and I hope this House will do its best and see that this Bill goes on to the Statute Book in due course</p>

<p>I have listened with great interest to the eulogies that we have had from those who have benefited by these gentlemen, and I would be the last to say that they do not do any good at all. I wanted to ask the mover of this motion a question but he refused to reply to it I want to tell him now what I was going to ask him, and I should like to have his answer. My question is this: Will he during the next year adopt a chiropractor as a family doctor for himself and his family and remain with him? The way for the hon. members for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Capt. Henwood) and Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) to find out about chiropractors is to keep on going to them. Because they seem to fail to realize that this is a complete system of medicine. They have had experience of backs and various things like that and we hear tales of shoulders that had been cured; all of which, I am quite sure, are true. But this is a request to this House to turn over the practice of medicine in this country completely, to create alongside the existing health services of the country another autonomous body which is able and permitted on its own recognizance to practise on the health of the people in all respects, from the cradle to the grave. Mr. Speaker, the chiropractor recognizes no limitations whatsoever.</p>

<p>That is what I say. There are no limitations on the illnesses that they can treat. Is this House prepared to allow chiropractors to bring children into the world by manipulating the back? I am not exaggerating. If you see what the chiropractors claim in their own documents you will find that they teach obstetrics There is no doubt about that. If you find a man suffering from a ruptured artery on the road after an accident will you try to stop the bleeding my manipulating his back, because if you are a chiropractor you would not be allowed to do anything else. You must manipulate the back. That is what this hon. member is asking the <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_663"/>House to do. He is asking the House to build alongside the existing services a new and autonomous system to take care of the health of the people. Is this House prepared to allow any chiropractor who does not believe in vaccination to issue a certificate to the authorities that a certain person should not be vaccinated? Are we prepared to allow the children of the country no longer to take the sweets that prevent poliomyelitis? Because that is what they are rejecting completely; they reject the theory of germs They say that there are such things as germs or there are not, they do not know, but they say that if they manipulate the back of a child that child will not get poliomyelitis They remind me of a doctor practising in Durban. He sells medicines and among other medicines he sells, what I believe is the most successful medicine in the world, a medicine to prevent you from being struck by lightning. I think that is a wonderful effort. Because if you are struck you can&#x2019;t go back and if you are not struck, you believe that he had stopped you from being struck. That is actually a fact. He is licensed in Nyanga and practises in Durban&#x2014;licensed by the State. Mr. Speaker I think I should read you a small extract about chiropractors. You must imagine, Sir, that you are travelling along the highway in your car&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The motor gives a few coughs and sputters and then stops altogether. You grind the starter and nothing happens. You look over the car and you can do nothing about it. To you it looks like a job for a mechanic. But a man passes along. He looks at your car and says &#x201C;If your car is out of order, you better see Jones up the road; he will fix you up. &#x201C;Is Jones an expert on automobile engines?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;Well, not exactly, but he adjusts spark plugs.&#x201D; &#x201C;But this may be a complicated motor trouble. I need a man who really understands automobile engines.&#x201D; Oh, that is all right&#x201D; says your informant, &#x201C;Jones is one of those fellows who fixes any trouble in your car by adjusting the spark plugs. He went to a school and took a course in it. He says any mechanical trouble can be cured by putting the spark plugs in shape. You don&#x2019;t have to worry about the motor.&#x201D; &#x201C;But that is impossible&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;there are many other things that can cause motor trouble besides bad spark plugs.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, you don&#x2019;t want to believe all these motor mechanics tell you &#x2026;</block>

<p>Don&#x2019;t believe what the doctors tell you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; they want to keep all the business for themselves. Let Jones adjust your plugs and you will be all right. He has got a certificate from the National School of Spark Plug Adjustment. I don&#x2019;t suppose there would be such schools if there wasn&#x2019;t anything in it. You had better see him.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Of course, Sir, that sounds ridiculous. There is not a man in this House who would take any notice of that but that is what they do with their families and themselves. It is quite true, some cars will be improved by adjusting their spark plugs. One of the hon. members has already spoken about it.</p>

<p>Well, the other fellow just did not adjust the spark plugs. What they would not do to their cars they would do to themselves and their families. They will go because somebody had said to them &#x201C;I think that chiropractor is a pretty good chap. He did my back for me. You had better go and see him&#x201D;. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) would not entrust his cattle&#x2014;he is a farmer, he keeps cows&#x2014;to a chiropractor. Does he think that he can have them cured by having their backs adjusted? Does he think that will stop them from getting ill? If he has such great faith in spinal adjustments why does he not start with all his cows and have their backs adjusted so that they will never become ill? He will get more milk. They must be consistent. They must either say &#x201C;yes, we believe that by pushing the back about all illness can be stopped&#x201D; or they must not say it. This Bill places no limit on what the chiropractor can do. He is only limited by the fact that he must do it by manipulation. This Bill even goes further because it does not limit its scope to the chiropractors; it extends it to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; persons engaged in the performance of manipulative health services and/or other incidental matters.</block>

<p>In 1952 there was a Select Committee that considered the Supplementary Health Services Act. A group of people gave evidence before that Select Committee. They called themselves the South African Manipulative Practitioners&#x2019; Association. The hon. member for Vanderbylpark (Dr. de Wet) has read extracts from that evidence. They say &#x201C;the manipulative profession is used collectively to describe the chiropractic profession, the osteopathic profession and the naturopathic profession&#x201D;. We don&#x2019;t know quite what that one is. But that shows, Sir, that they go far beyond the scope of what is pretended to be in the leading part of this Bill. They went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the present time the Association has a membership of 59 and includes nearly every qualified person practising the manipulative profession.</block>

<p><span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_664"/>I will not dwell on the fact that manipulation is provided for under the ordinary laws of the State and under the ordinary rules and regulations of the Medical Council. People are trained in massage and manipulation and are registered. Doctors are trained into two groups. There are the physical medical specialists who undergo a training of 12 years from the time they enter the university. Orthopaedic surgeons also undergo a training of 12 years before they are allowed to call themselves specialists in this field of medicine. In this Bill it is forbidden for anybody else to carry out the manipulative practice. Clause 22 forbids that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall engage in public practice as a chiropractor or hold himself out or allow himself to be held out as a chiropractor in public practice or use any designation or description calculated to create the impression that he is a chiropractor in public practice etc.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, if that is read in to &#x201C;scope of practice&#x201D; which describes what a chiropractor may do, you will see that no doctor or trained masseur is entitled to carry out any treatment on the spine because this is their peculiar domain. Clause 1 (viii) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;scope of practice&#x201D; means the analysis of the spinal column and the diagnosing of ailments by the use of all diagnostic and analytical procedures recognized by the various Chiropractic Schools; the elimination of abnormal functioning of the nervous system by the adjustment of the articulation and adjacent tissues of the body, particularly of the spine &#x2026;</block>

<p>So that nobody will be allowed in future to handle the joints&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and includes the use of procedures which may facilitate the adjustment, but excluding the prescription of drugs &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now, Sir, &#x201C;and includes the use of procedures which may facilitate the adjustment&#x201D;. In some of the States of America, it is claimed, some of the schools teach the administration of anaesthetics by chiropractors. That is one of the things they do. That is what &#x201C;facilitates the adjustment&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Let us go to Clause 1 (ii)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Chiropractice&#x201D; means a philosophy, science and art of healing and maintaining health;</block>

<p>From that it is clear that this is a universal system. It has no limits. It is a system, so to speak, a state not within a state, but a state alongside a state A new system of medical practice or healing practice or health practice lying just alongside and autonomous and completely independent and able to do anything that is necessary to care for the health of the public. What is a philosophy? After all, a science and an art has some basis in it They learn the art of selling. But what is philosophy? Philosophy is &#x201C;that department of knowledge or study which deals with ultimate reality or with the most general causes and principles of things&#x201D;. It envelopes everything. A philosophy deals with the world, it deals with everything that happens; it has no limit. That is what these people are claiming to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the most tragic things to my mind in the appeal of the hon. member for Pretoria (West) was the fact that he based his argument chiefly on the fact that the trade unions wanted it. Now the trade unions want it firstly, because in terms of the constitutions of some of them they are not allowed to pay out without a doctor&#x2019;s certificate. That really has nothing to do with us at the moment, but the fact remains that the same gentleman who gave evidence about a manipulative society whom I quoted just now, went on to prove the fallacy of the argument of the hon. member for Pretoria (West). He said this in his evidence before the Select Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A large number of medical aid and benefit societies honour the accounts of members of the association, to mention a few, the Shell Company, the Vacuum Oil Company, the Atlantic Oil Company, the Joint United Building Society, the United Banks and the Post Office Medical Aid Society, the Transvaal Chambers of Mines.</block>

<p>The simplest way, if the hon. member for Pretoria (West) wants to help the people who have asked him to bring this Bill forward, is to get the benefit societies of these trade unions to change their rules so that they can pay the chiropractor without the counter signature of a doctor. It is as easy as pie, Sir. They have only got to alter their rules. The doctors will not mind. What the doctors will not do is to certify work for which they are not responsible. That is illegal That is unethical. If a doctor gives a certificate in respect of anything about which he is not certain himself he comes under disciplinary measure. He cannot, therefore, do that.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with leave of the House, I wish to make a short statement on Part One of the Report of the Press Commission which I laid on the Table earlier to-day.</p>

<p>The first part of the Commission&#x2019;s report consists of two volumes together containing more than 700 pages. Then there are also 19 annexures containing 1,566 pages.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister recently announced that the Commission has again been placed under the care of the Minister of the Interior. I have been called upon to lay the report upon the Table.</p>

<p>The first part of the report which, as I have already pointed out, is a bulky document, is available in English only and the Government has deemed it advisable to lay it on the Table in only one language, and in its present typed form. If the report were to be translated first and then printed in the two official languages, it would take some months still before it could be laid upon the Table.</p>

<p>My first task now is to acquaint myself further with the contents of the report before the recommendations it contains are considered by the Government. As may well be realized this is no mean task, but I am doing everything in my power to expedite the consideration of the report by the Government.</p>

<p>Until such time as the report has been considered, I cannot comment on it because I do not yet know whether the Government is going to accept the recommendations it contains <i>in toto</i> or in amended form, or perhaps even reject them.</p>

<p>All I can say at this stage is that the report will be considered as soon as possible and that if the Government should arrive at any decisions in connection with the recommendations of the Commission, it will be announced without delay.</p>

<p>I have requested my Department to furnish copies of the report to the Universities in the Republic, the State Libraries at Cape Town and Pretoria and the Parliamentary Library where the remaining copies will be available to Members of Parliament who wish to acquaint themselves with the contents of the report.</p>

<p>Copies of the report will also be made available on loan to the Press, the South African Press Association and the South African Broadcasting Corporation.</p>

<p>As we said at the second reading, we believe not only that this legislation is essential but that it is also good legislation to place our archives and the care of our public records under better control and also to help the research worker in his research. In the course of the second-reading debate we put forward certain suggestions and tried to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to certain clauses. We received satisfactory replies from him to the points raised by us and also the assurance that if it should appear that in practice a particular clause cannot be administered smoothly, he will bring about the necessary amendments.</p>

<p>But I should like to make use of this late opportunity at this late stage to refer once again to a few of the clauses of the Bill, with the request that the hon. the Minister should give his serious attention to them. You may ask me, Sir, why I did not do so earlier, but certain other objections have reached me since, and after further study of this matter there are certain points I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister once again.</p>

<p>My first observation is in connection with Clause 1, the definition of the word &#x201C;archives&#x201D;. I think here we have a vague definition which may perhaps cause a certain amount of difficulty or uncertainty or ambiguity later on.</p>

<p>Let me read the relevant portion of the clause&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Archives&#x201D; means any documents or records received or created in a government office or an office of a local authority during the conduct of affairs of such office &#x2026;</block>

<p>So far it is perfectly clear, but now we come to the part which is obscure&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and which are from their nature or in terms of any other law not required then to be dealt with otherwise than in accordance with or in terms of the provisions of this Act.</block>

<p><span class="col_1299-1300" refersTo="page_666"/>I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister in his reply will explain the portion beginning with the words &#x201C;and which are from their nature.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then we come to Clause 3 (2) (a), to which I should also like to refer. In terms of Clause 2 the Minister exercises &#x201C;control over the custody and care of archives and accessions.&#x201D; But, on the other hand, under Clause 3 (2) (a) the Director is in charge of the custody, care and control of archives. It is felt by certain persons that this power which is being given to the Director also gives him control over the documents which are in the possession of city councils or town councils, and that he can, therefore, without the authority of the city council, without consulting them, without getting in touch with them, enter and examine such offices, and he may also recommend to them the destruction of documents or prevent them from destroying certain documents. The city councils, unless we are very careful, may feel here that their domestic activities can and may be interferred with. I think in this case it will be necessary to be extremely careful and to consult these local authorities and to obtain their co-operation. I wonder, if I may suggest it, Mr. Speaker, whether the hon. the Minister is not prepared to consider the question of appointing a representative of the United Municipal Executive to the Board so as to remove this difficulty.</p>

<p>Finally I want to refer to Clause 9 (1). Under this clause city councils and other authorities are obliged after certain periods to hand over certain documents to the interim places of custody. The Town Clerks of some of the city councils feel that the position will now be that they will have to obtain the approval of the Minister before they will be allowed to inspect any of the documents that they have already sent to the depot or to the interim place of custody. In actual fact these documents are still theirs; they come from their office. They may need them but before they will be able to inspect them again they will have to wait until they receive a permit or the approval of the Minister. In such cases where a local authority has handed over these documents to the interim place of custody, I wonder whether it will not be possible to give them free access to these documents if they desire to inspect them.</p>

<p>With these few words I want to ask the hon. the Minister in the first place to reply to these objections that I have submitted and, secondly, whether it is not possible for him at this late stage to bring about a change whereby it will be possible to administer these few clauses more smoothly than would appear to be the case at the moment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>In so far as the questions put to me by the hon. member for Hillbrow (Mr. Steenkamp) are concerned, the first was in regard to the definition of &#x201C;archives&#x201D;, particularly with reference to the words read out by him. I just want to point out that there are certain types of documents which are not covered by the Archives Act. I can mention one example, namely secret documents of an international nature. Therefore the definition had to be widened in order to cover that type of document. I think the hon. member will agree with me that provision ought to be made in such an act for all contingencies.</p>

<p>In regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s second question, where he first read Clause 2 and then Clause 3, it is quite clear that in Clause 2 the Minister is given control over the safekeeping and care of the archives. But if the hon. member were to read Clause 3 (1) right through, it reads that, by virtue of the Public Service Act, the Minister must appoint a Director of Archives who is to perform his duties in terms of this Act subject to the instructions of the Minister. In other words, when the Director is given certain functions in terms of Clause 3 (a), and is entrusted with the protection, care and control of archives, it is on the instructions of the Minister. In other words, these are delegated powers. The Minister personally cannot do everything. But the provisions of Clause 2 are clearly implemented because the Director, in terms of Clause 3 (1) is bound by the instructions of the Minister.</p>

<p>Then I come to the request of the hon. member in regard to local authorities. I can only say that I quite agree with him that it will be a very good thing to appoint a member of the Municipal Association to the Archives Commission. I think that is essential, seeing that we are now taking control also of these local matters. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that I will consider it. I think it is quite correct. And obviously it also solves the last difficulty he mentioned under Clause 9 (1), namely that they must receive consent to obtain access to their own documents when those documents are in the intermediate depots. If the local authorities have a representative on the Archives Commission, this matter can be solved administratively.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The object of this Bill is principally to eliminate legal and practical difficulties, particularly in relation to disciplinary matters encountered by the Public Accountants&#x2019; and Auditors&#x2019; Board when carrying out its functions and duties in terms of the principal Act. While recommending the necessary amendments in this regard, the Board took the opportunity of recommending some other amendments as well, most of which are of a minor <span class="col_1301-1302" refersTo="page_667"/>nature and are designed to set out more clearly, or to bring into line with existing practice, certain provisions of the Act. The principles underliving the amendments have in most cases been under consideration by the Board for a number of years and have formed the subject of several joint opinions obtained by the Board from two counsels. The amendments as finally incorporated in this Bill have been drafted in close consultation with the Board. I shall not deal with each of these clauses separately, but I propose to deal with the more important ones.</p>

<p>Clause 4 repeals those sections of the Act dealing with the Accountants&#x2019; Registration Advisory Committee. This Committee was established solely for the purpose of dealing with initial applications for registration as accountants and auditors arising from the promulgation of the Act. It was thus merely a transitional procedure. And it was in fact abolished in terms of Section 20, eighteen months after the Act came into operation. Sections 13 to 20 which all relate to this Advisory Committee, are now redundant and the opportunity afforded by this Bill is being used to excise them from the Act.</p>

<p>The object of Clause 5 is to empower the Board to prescribe that a previously registered accountant and auditor who, while registered, was guilty of improper conduct, may be punished by debarring him from re-registration either permanently, or for a specified period, or until the occurrence of a specified event. Paragraphs (g) and (h) of this Clause introduce the principle of empowering the Board, at its discretion, to take cognizance of the conduct, prior to registration, of a person who has applied for registration as an accountant and auditor, in order to refuse or cancel such person&#x2019;s registration. The type of case envisaged is that of an applicant, qualified for registration, about whom the Board has cogent and convincing evidence of dishonesty, such as the misappropriation of money, but in respect of whom the provisions of paragraph (b) of sub-section (6) of section 23 of the Act or of the opening portion of sub-section (7) of that section cannot be invoked to debar or cancel registration, as the case may be, because, for some reason, criminal proceedings were not instituted against such person. Paragraph (h) also removes the obligation which at present rests on the Board to cancel the registration as an accountant and auditor of a person who becomes of unsound mind, as special provision for dealing with such cases is now proposed in section 28<i>bis,</i> for the insertion of which Clause 11 of the Bill provides. The object of paragraph (j) is to permit registered accountants and auditors who are engaged in public practice to describe themselves as public accountants and auditors, thus serving to distinguish them from registered accountants and auditors who are not so engaged.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 8, paragraph (c) of which gives recognition to the fact that in South West Africa the books of an undertaking are frequently kept in the German language. Paragraph (d) substitutes in paragraph (e) of the sub-section for the expression &#x201C;the ordinarily accepted methods&#x201D; a more appropriate expression having regard to the fact that, in auditing practice, there do not exist &#x201C;ordinarily accepted methods&#x201D; which are of universal application. As regards paragraph (j), Section 26 of the principal Act imposes certain duties on auditors, and sub-section (3) thereof imposes the duty of reporting to the undertaking whose books are being audited any material irregularly of which the auditor has <i>cause to complain.</i> If further imposes on auditors the duty of reporting to the Board any cases where the undertaking concerned has not rectified material irregularities reported to it by the auditor. Where an auditor does not carry out either or both of the aforegoing duties, the Board can take disciplinary action against him. This sub-section was enacted in the public interest, but because the emphasis is placed on an irregularity &#x201C;of which an auditor has cause to complain&#x201D;, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove in appropriate cases that an auditor has not carried out his duties properly, since &#x201C;cause for complaint&#x201D; must always be a matter of opinion. It must always be subjective. The Governmnet&#x2019;s representatives on the Board therefore felt strongly that the existing wording of section 26 (3) did not protect the public interest to the extent intended when the principal Act was passed, and as a result the Board agreed that the sub-section should be reworded to place the emphasis on an irregularity which has caused, or is likely to cause, financial loss to the undertaking concerned, its members, or creditors. Such an irregularity, it is felt, is much easier to prove, and when the new wording comes into effect, it will simplify the task of the Board when taking disciplinary measures against an auditor who fails to carry out the duties imposed upon him by this sub-section. At the same time, care must be exercised not to expose an auditor to claims for damages by third parties where he has <i>bona fide</i> failed to detect a material irregularity. Although sub-section (5) of Section 26 already contains a general exemption from action against an auditor who has acted in good faith, it was considered that this exemption should be placed beyond doubt in regard to the matters contained in the new sub-section (3), as regards both reporting and non-reporting, to avoid any possibility of auditors who have acted in good faith being subjected to vexatious litigation by third parties.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 10. As the Act now reads the Board has no power to enquire into cases of improper conduct alleged to have been committed by persons who are no longer registered accountants and auditors while they were so registered. As a result, the Board is unable to take cognizance of such alleged improper conduct should the persons concerned again apply for registration under the Act. The object of paragraph (a) of this clause is mainly to enable the Board to inquire into <span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_668"/>such cases, which in turn will empower it in proven cases to debar the persons concerned from re-registration either permanently, or for a specified period, or until the happening of a specified event.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b) of Clause 10 empowers the Board to postpone disciplinary action in respect of alleged improper conduct which forms or is likely to form the subject of proceedings in a court of law until such proceedings have been determined. This brings the powers of the Board into line with those conferred upon the S.A. Medical and Dental Council by Section 41 of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act.</p>

<p>Clause 11 introduces two new sections into the principal Act, namely: (a) Section 28<i>bis</i> which makes provision for the holding of an inquiry by the Board whenever it has before it information on oath which appears to show that a registered accountant and auditor has become mentally disabled. If the Board finds that this is the case it is empowered to suspend the registered accountant and auditor concerned from practice, (b) Section 28<i>ter</i> which confers upon the Board, its members and officers, immunity from criminal or civil proceedings in respect of acts or duties performed in exercising its disciplinary powers.</p>

<p>Clause 12 is the next clause that I want to refer to. The main object of this clause is to include in the category of persons who may not, without the Board&#x2019;s consent, be employed by a registered accountant and auditor in connection with his practice persons who have been refused registration by the Board for any of the reasons set out in sub-section (6) of Section 23 of the Act. Certain minor improvements upon the wording of the existing provision are also being made.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, Clause 14 provides that in conformity with the provisions of Section 23 of the principal Act, the provisions of this Bill will also apply to South West Africa.</p>

<p>We support the second reading of this Bill. But I think it is well to place on record that the amending Bill does introduce certain new features. As the hon. the Minister of Finance has said, the amendment contemplated in Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to amend Section 26 of the principal Act. This amendment is being introduced following representations made by the Government members of the Public Accountants&#x2019; Board. It throws a tremendous responsibility on an auditor in practice. I think that the Minister will agree with me when I say that many members of the profession resisted this new requirement which requires the accountant to indicate whether a material irregularity has caused or is likely to cause financial loss to the undertaking or any of its members or creditors. It is a very far-reaching provision and one which throws a great deal of responsibility on the practising accountant. For that reason, Sir, individual members of the profession have resisted accepting those responsibilities. It is quite often purely a matter of opinion as to whether a particular action in a company is likely to cause loss to creditors. Having regard to experience in commercial life in this country, I think there are very few people who would like to predict the future and would like to say that a particular action would or would not cause loss. While the profession as a whole has agreed to this provision, I think they will watch the working of this provision very carefully indeed because while there is protection so far as the auditor is concerned from creditors, shareholders and other interested bodies where he is likely to be subjected to legal action, as far as the individual members of the profession are concerned, the placing of this onus on their shoulders is such that it throws a responsibility which many accountants would not lightly accept. We will watch this development with considerable interest. Accountants who realize that in many cases as a result of reporting in this way their profession may be affected in future, accept that responsibility on the understanding that they will have the full co-operation of the Board and that they will be fully protected by the Board. It is an innovation which, as far as I know, does not obtain in other parts of the world except in those countries which regard public accountants as virtually full-time State officials. I hope we will not reach that stage where the professional man will be regarded as a full-time State official and that the opportunity for individual practice will continue. Here, Mr. Speaker, in effect the public accountant is being put in the position of being virtually an officer of State without the same protection which an officer of State enjoys. It is an experiment, Sir, and we shall watch the development of that experiment with a great deal of interest.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have before us legislation, but I wonder whether all hon. members realize its importance. This Act originated in 1951, after repeated attempts had been made in South Africa&#x2014;and I must say they were made by my predecessor in my constituency&#x2014;who did much towards getting this legislation on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>The profession of an accountant and auditor is one in regard to which not all people in the country realize the scope of the work involved. They do not realize the importance of the work. It is one of those professions which is certainly, particularly under present circumstances, one of the most important of all. We have the medical man who is of importance to the health of the nation, but the accountant and auditor are equally important, or perhaps even much more important to-day, in looking after the economic health of the nation.</p>

<p>Auditing originated in the year 1314, when in Britain the expenditure of the Crown had to be investigated. It developed further until the year 1667, when the expenditure of Parliament had to be reviewed. Throughout the years it was the accepted practice that the auditor had to scrutinize the expenditure of the State and the expenditure of the various <span class="col_1305-1306" refersTo="page_669"/>economic undertakings. The auditor fulfils an important function, not only <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the shareholders as such, because there are many other groups interested in an industry. So we find the creditor, the public and the State. Sometimes the shareholder or the person who runs a one-man business has invested the least money in that business. The creditors have a greater interest, and that is why it is so necessary that their interests should be protected. The State has an equally great interest in the industries in the private sector as the entrepreneur, because if the private sector is prosperous the State can also collect its taxation and the country can flourish. The work of the auditor is very important if we have regard to the many millions of rand comprising our national income and we remember that the auditor has to deal with those finances every day. A full circle is completed every day. It goes from the bank to the private sector, to the State, and back again, and the auditor must continuously scrutinize all these transactions. It has never yet been ascertained how many times an auditor has to deal with the same money in its cycle of circulation. In the past the position was that, as appears from various court decisions, it was customary and traditional for the auditor merely to scrutinize expenditure. So we find cases like Kingston Cotton Mills, where it was said that the auditor was the watchdog and not the bloodhound. In the case of London and General Bank, it was stated that the auditor was not there to give advice. But seeing that we are dealing with these amendments, I want to express another thought which should be brought home, not only to our legislators, but also to the private sector. I want to stress a further idea, namely that not only should we be watchdogs, but that the watchdog should now become the bloodhound. I shall explain it as follows.</p>

<p>We know that the auditor must have a thorough knowledge of the law and of all the various facets of the economy. The auditing profession requires its members to have a high degree of training. Now we find that in the various spheres of life there is sufficient study and research. We see what the C.S.I.R. has done in its own sphere, and in other technical spheres quite a lot of research has also been done, but in the economic and financial sphere there is still a great lack of research. We find that various bodies in fact do research. We find universities, banks and private companies doing it, but these are all independent investigations and research, and we know how very expensive research and study are. In the accounting profession we have a section of the community which has the knowledge available. It is a section which has been trained in economic and financial problems, and we see that the law provides for the powers and duties of auditors, but I want to make a plea now for a further step to be taken. We cannot move this amendment now, but I ask that in future a further aspect should be covered by this Act, namely research and study and guidance. To-day there is specialization in all spheres, but in the economic and financial spheres, in which the auditor operates, there are as yet no such facilities. I want to plead for further research and facilities for study in the profession. Bursaries should also be made available by the State and by individuals and private initiative to give these accountants and auditors the opportunity to do further research. This Accountants&#x2019; Society should be enabled to make use of the universities and other bodies to study certain facets of our economic life and financial institutions. Seeing that medical men derive certain benefits in terms of the Income Tax Act when they go abroad for further study, we must also offer that benefit to the people concerned in this section of our economic life. If we create that opportunity, these professional men will also be inclined to make use of it and to extend it further. Unless facilities are established, we cannot expect one firm of auditors alone, or even a few of them, to do so themselves. We already have what are called managerial consultants who, where companies do not have the necessary guidance and technical managers, provide those facilities, but it is not physically possible to tackle this wide sphere of study unless the necessary facilities and channels are created. We must make the best possible use of the brains of these men. The brainpower of the people is one of the greatest assets we have to-day, but I am afraid that we do not make sufficient use of it. If we provide these facilities, we will provide the men in our profession who can give the necessary guidance and advice to private undertakings. When we have these facilities we will also not find so many of our companies going insolvent. We must prevent that and not simply say later: You can be the liquidator of that company. If we ensure that there are trained men to give guidance to these people and to cover the broad sphere with which industry is concerned, marketing, production and all the other accompanying problems&#x2014;if we provide those facilities and train those men. they can provide the private sector with the necessary information. The Government receives advice, because the Economic Advisory Council advises the Prime Minister and the Board of Trade and Industries advises the Minister of Economic Affairs, but we still do not have such bodies in the private sector, and that is the most important factor of all. See to it that private sector flourishes, and all will be well with the State. I want to ask that in future we should devote attention to this matter, not only as legislators but also through other bodies. If our private financial institutions prosper and if the auditing profession is able to give guidance, it will not be necessary for the Registrar of Financial Institutions to appoint an inspectorate to obviate financial loss by private investors who have invested their money in those institutions. We will pluck the fruits of that.</p>

<p>For the rest, I fully support these amendments of the Accountants&#x2019; Association. Great <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_670"/>responsibilities are being placed on the accountant and auditor. It is an honour to belong to the profession, and practising accountants, with their sense of responsibility, accept the burden placed on their shoulders. If a man practises his profession thoroughly and properly, he will not be afraid to take a firm stand when necessary and I can assure the hon. the Minister that, apart from certain exceptions, the profession wholeheartedly welcomes the amendments.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>It is my pleasant duty to follow the hon. member for Pretoria-Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl), who has just made his maiden speech. He obviously is an accountant, because he quoted the judgment which said that the auditor is a watchdog but not a bloodhound, but where he went on to hope that he becomes more of a bloodhound than a watchdog I must disagree. Anyway, it is quite obvious that with his training he will be a great success in this House, which is particularly short of business men, and if I say particularly on the Government side I hope he will realize that I am referring to the Government side and not to him. I wish him well in his career in this House.</p>

<p>As my colleague has said, this side welcomes the Bill, but we definitely have reservations in regard to the amendment to Section 26. These amendments do not really extend the powers of the auditor, as has been suggested. It does make some attempt to clarify his duties, but I still think it leaves him somewhat in mid-air. He has to take the prescribed action in terms of this Bill if he finds a material irregularity, which is then defined as was read out by my colleague. He then reports to his client and unless he gets a satisfactory reply within 30 days he must report to the Public Accountants&#x2019; and Auditors&#x2019; Board. That is all very well, but the whole thing will come back to this question of material irregularities, and although it is defined as action likely to cause financial loss to the undertaking or any of its members or creditors, it will remain extremely obscure, and I fear that at some stage or another some unfortunate accountant is going to be dragged into some very expensive litigation because of the obscurity of this definition. Whether anything can be done about it at the moment is a different matter. I cannot myself think of any amendment, and as I said before, this side of the House supports the Bill fully with the slight reservations we have in regard to this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) very heartily on his first speech in this House. I also want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross), that it is an acquisition to this House to have somebody with us who is a member of this profession. Without casting any reflection upon other hon. members, I feel it is a good thing to have somebody in our midst who is a practising accountant so that we may have the benefit of his views during our deliberations. He cast a very interesting light on the importance of the profession, and I think the way in which he regards it lends great importance to that profession. He is a member of the profession and as such he is aware of their obligations, not only as a means of earning money, but that they have a much higher vocation than that. They are there to guard, as he said, over the economic health of the people. Our whole economy is based on trust, and one of the means of ensuring that this trust is not abused is through the accountant and auditor. He stands midway between his client, the man who pays him, and the public. He must be loyal to his client, but he also owes a higher duty towards the people who have faith in the business he audits, and he is there to guard that trust, and to safeguard the interest of the public in that undertaking.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to research. I am not sufficiently expert on the subject precisely to visualize what form this research should take, but I understand the hon. member is an alternate member of the society, and perhaps he can make use of that position to make suggestions to the society, something he is unable to do now because this is not the suitable time and place for it, and if they then consider that the practical suggestions made by him can be implemented they can consider whether it is possible to do so, and if it requires legislation they can come to Parliament.</p>

<p>In regard to the other speakers, the two hon. members opposite who spoke gave their blessing to this measure in general. They do not quite see eye to eye, but generally when one finds experts on a subject there is always room for a slight difference of opinion such as we also had here. But I repeat that it is very difficult always to find suitable words. The hon. member for Benoni complained about the vagueness of the words &#x201C;material irregularities&#x201D;. I wish the hon. member could suggest other words which would be less vague and confusing. But it is not so much the words as the spirit in which they are intended, and the spirit in which the auditor supervises matters, and even more important, the spirit of dedication and pride in their profession revealed by them which will give meaning to these words, and which is in the interest not only of the protection of the profession, but also of the public as a whole.</p>

<p>This Clause 1 merely widens the definition of a &#x201C;declared road&#x201D; to include junctions and crossings.

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 13 and 14, to omit &#x201C;or, failing that, by appropriation&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In terms of 4<i>bis</i> (1) an Administrator shall at the request of the Board acquire by treaty, or, failing that, by appropriation, any remaining extent of any piece of land which has been appropriated for the purpose of a declared road. This clause provides that if a property owner is so unfortunate as to have a declared road traversing his property, not only the extent of land required for the road will be appropriated but the remaining extent of his property may be appropriated at the discretion of the Board, with or without the option of of the owner. The owner does not come into this clause at all. I think it is only reasonable that it should be emphasized how inadvisable these powers are and that no appropriation of the remaining extent as laid down in this clause should be permitted. The Board has all the powers it needs in Clause 1 in regard to any further area of land it may require. If it needs more land for any other purpose, it could acquire such land by treaty. It could be argued that this provision is only in relation to some small section of a property which may be cut off, just a corner of a farm or a strip alongside the road which may be regarded as useless to the owner, but it does not say so, and I still think that even if it is only a small section it should be at the option of the owner that any appropriation should take place. It may be a section at the end of his farm and he may be able to sell it to his neighbour at a big price. I think his liberty as regards the ownership of his property should be retained.</p>

<p>I have brought the necessity for this amendment to the notice of the Minister during the second reading and I hope he will accede to this amendment as I think it is necessary. The Minister has a broad outlook on matters of this nature, and he realizes that in terms of this clause it may not be exercised in an unreasonable way, but the powers remain in the clause to do so and I hope the Minister will accede to this amendment. I am certain that if we pass this clause as it is, it will create very wide dissatisfaction among property-owners in this country. It is bad enough to have a national road crossing your farm and have land appropriated for the public benefit, but I do not think that the rest of your property should be held in jeopardy at the pleasure of the Board.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_byl">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to support most strongly the amendment of the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker), because here the Minister can expropriate a property at Land Bank values or some value like that. As he has pointed out, that bit of land might be of very great value to a neighbour who might have been trying to get hold of it for years, because it might mean that it is the only way he has of supplying water to a bit of his adjoining land. He may be prepared to pay an enhanced price for it. We all know of cases where land was sold at a very much higher price than it would be valued at from the Land Bank point of view, due to the worth it has to an adjoining neighbour. But is may be worse still. The owner himself might have a farm next door to the area to be expropriated, and that land might be of the utmost importance to him for the development of the rest of his property, and he might not want to sell at any price. I think it is wrong to leave it in the hands of the Administrator. It ought to be done entirely by negotiation and I strongly support the amendment.</p>

<p>Now, it could be said that a national road enhances the value of a property. There I disagree slightly. In many cases it does enhance the value of a property as a whole, but it can also do a tremendous amount of harm to a farm. I have known of strips of land a mile and more long and only 50 to 100 yards wide cut off from the rest of the farm by a road and it is a very great disadvantage to have a road cutting off a strip like that. There is also another important factor, and that is that whilst the engineers know all about roadmaking, they know very little about farming, and most of us have had the experience where the water flows off the tarred road like water off an iron roof and that flood of water is turned out to the lands &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should like to move an amendment which will not conflict with that of the hon member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). because if his amendment is adopted mine will naturally fall away. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 14 and 24, respectively, to omit &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D;; and in line 15, to omit &#x201C;appropriated&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;expropriated&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The word &#x201C;appropriate&#x201D; is admittedly quite a meaningful word in the English language and that makes it important that the word should be used appropriately. The use of the <span class="col_1311-1312" refersTo="page_672"/>word &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; in the context of this Clause is quite inappropriate, I submit. It is true that one can appropriate something in the sense of taking it or annexing it with or without a reward, but in that context the customary use of &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; is that it implies that there will be cognizance on the part of the owner, or at least that there will not be disagreement. If, however, the taking or annexing occurs without that cognizance, or in the absence of agreement, the taking is not &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; but &#x201C;misappropriation&#x201D;, or it might be &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D;, I rule out &#x201C;misappropriation&#x201D;, because that is obviously not intended, but it is quite clear from the context that the word is &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D;. Let me point out that what is contemplated here as both hon. members who spoke before me have indicated, is that taking by &#x201C; appropriation&#x201D; should only take place after there has been failure to acquire the piece of land by treaty, or in Afrikaans &#x201C;deur ooreenkoms&#x201D;. Now the act of expropriation implies two things. Firstly, it implies the divesting of ownership from one person, and secondly, the vesting of ownership in another person. With due respect to the draughtsman, I suggest that the words in Afrikaans are also incorrectly used and it should not be &#x201C;ontneming&#x201D; but &#x201C;onteiening&#x201D;. Appropriation has a specific meaning in Parliamentary parlance. We use the term &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; more than once every year and by customary use in Parliament it means the setting aside of money for a specific purpose. So &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; has also, by usage become, in Parliamentary parlance at any rate, to mean a dispossession or deprivation of ownership and a revesting of the dominium in someone else, and the courts so understand the word &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D;. I am doubtful whether they would understand &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; in this sense. I would like to draw attention to a legal textbook dealing with ownership. It is Maasdorp&#x2019;s Institutes, the Law of Things, where it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where land has been expropriated in terms of a statute, dominium passes immediately without transfer being passed.</block>

<p>Sir, the courts&#x2019; interpretation in regard to the word &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; is contained in a number of decisions of the courts. It is a term which has been interpreted and which has a specific meaning. To substitute this new word, &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D;, is going to bring confusion where confusion has hitherto been avoided as the result of decisions of the courts. I can quote a dozen or more statutes in which the word &#x201C;exappropriation&#x201D; is used and used correctly, and where in Afrikaans it is &#x201C;onteiening&#x201D;. I need only refer to one with which the Minister is well acquainted. That is Sec.2 (1) of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management Act, (now No. 70 of 1957) which has been on the statute book for many years and where the powers granted are powers of expropriation. But there is another good reason for using the customary word. That is because the provision here is not to give powers but to direct the Administrator what he should do, and the Administrator when he exercises these powers will do so under an ordinance. As far as I am aware&#x2014;I have not had time to look at all the ordinances&#x2014; these ordinances use the word &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; as the correct term for dealing with the problem that we are facing here. My amendment is not a triviality; it is based firstly on parliamentary practice, secondly on legislative habit or custom and thirdly because the courts clearly know what &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; means and have interpreted the context of that word in many cases. I have referred to one legal text book. There are many such textbooks on law and anybody looking at them would look under the letter &#x201C;e&#x201D; and not under the letter &#x201C;a&#x201D; to find out what are the powers of divesting people from ownership of land and revesting it in somebody else. That is an additional reason why the amendment should be accepted, and I hope the hon. the Minister will be agreeable to do so.</p>

<p>I do not want to follow the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) in his objection to the use of the word &#x201C;appropriate&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;expropriate&#x201D; as suggested by him. Nor do I think that will satisfy the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) because the board will in any case be given the right to expropriate land. That is the very objection which the hon. member for Albany has. I trust that the House will not accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Albany. As far as the amendment moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) is concerned it is not clear to me either what the difference will be, but as far as the amendment of the hon. member must realize that we are here giving member for Albany is concerned, the hon. powers to land-owners who can at this stage already be regarded as being wilful possessors of that land; because if you read this clause, Mr. Chairman, you will notice that there have already been negotiations with the board to acquire that land. The owner refuses to accept the offer as a gesture towards the travelling public or towards the Administrator who want to effect an improvement and he is placed in such a strong position that land simply cannot be expropriated. What will be the result if we accepted the amendment of the hon. member for Albany? It will mean that it will be impossible to come to an agreement with that owner by way of negotiation, you will simply have to continue to negotiate and to negotiate because you will never have the right to expropriate the land. I do not think the hon. member for Albany has considered this amendment thoroughly before introducing it. The hon. member for Albany has experience of the workings of local boards; I do not want to go into that but he knows what difficulties local boards experience as far as the acquisition of land for public purposes is concerned&#x2014;for the construction of roads and also for other purposes, and practically every organization has the power to expropriate. But <span class="col_1313-1314" refersTo="page_673"/>where a road has to be constructed and where the Administrator has to acquire certain land, the hon. member for Albany says there should only be negotiation and if such negotiation does not succeed, it will mean that the entire enterprise will be doomed to failure. I do not think this House will accept such an unwise amendment.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) has not read the clause correctly. He seems to think that this &#x201C;remaining extent&#x201D; of land is expropriated for road purposes. The whole point of this clause is to enable a local authority to acquire a remaining extent of land that is <i>not,</i> specifically not, needed for road making purposes. Thus his main argument falls away. He also does not seem to realize the difference between &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; and &#x201C;treaty&#x201D;. It is only if a man will not willingly sell a piece of land that you may have to expropriate. The two things are two separate processes. I would like the House to consider more carefully the points of view put forward by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). We are conscious of the aims and we approve of the objects of this Act. But we differ on the methods by which the Minister sets out to achieve his objects. We ourselves are aware of the fact that wherever disputes are likely to arise, it is difficult to find means of settling them, which do not either clog the wheels of administration and lead to costly legal processes, or are dependent on the arbitrary wish of a local &#x201C;Authority&#x201D; or the delegated judgment of some official. We are trying to steer a course in between those two. We suggest that where a &#x201C;remaining extent&#x201D; of land is left, after a national road has been driven through a farmer&#x2019;s land and the necessary expropriations have taken place, an even balance of justice should be maintained, if possible. Both sides may be unreasonable. An owner, a farmer, may have some small odd-shaped space on the other side of the road to which the authorities are obliged to give access. If they were not obliged to give access he could do what he liked with it, but they are compelled by law to give this access. The value of that piece of left-over land may be so small that the cost of the access, whether it is by way of overhead bridge or underground culvert, may be so excessive that it would be better to give a good but fair price for the &#x201C;remaining extent&#x201D;. We believe that these things can best be fixed by treaty. We believe that they can be amicably adjusted by other means than an arbitrary decision. I know the difficulty of the Minister. Anyone who administers an Act is in the same position at some time or another. But I believe that in this case both sides should be reasonable. It must be remembered that the &#x201C;remaining extent&#x201D; is not defined; it is just any area of remaining extent. The extent may be worthless but it may also be as large and valuable as a small farm. In fact the extent may be larger than the original piece, as far as I know, from the reading of the law. A farmer may not want to part with it in any circumstances. I suggest that the danger exists that either side may be unreasonable. In legal practice, under the democratic system, where disputes are likely to arise and where we want absolute fairness, our custom is to go to some impartial judiciary, to some objective and disinterested Judge, to decide between the two parties. We believe that if the Minister will take out of the clause the reference to expropriation, the whole matter would be speedily adjusted by treaty, by mutual arrangement. If not then a court of law is the place to decide the differences of opinion.</p>

<p>May I come back to this word &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; and urge its use in place of &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D;. I think that the Minister should agree to change his word to &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; even if he feels that he is right in his interpretation and even if it was used in the original Act. Whereas there may be some difficulty about the word &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; there can be no misunderstanding about the word &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D;. The difference in the usage, even in Parliament, between those two words has become quite distinct with the process of time. I believe, also in legal language. The meaning of the word &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; in parliamentary usage is really &#x201C;to assign anything to a particular purpose&#x201D;. that is why we now use it chiefly in connection with the allotting of revenues to the various purposes to which they have to be applied&#x201D;. &#x201C;Expropriation&#x201D; on the other hand, has a meaning that applies specifically and by definition to &#x201C;the act of depriving somebody of ownership, usually the ownership of property, and usually by some public authority&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Act 21 of 1940 was the Act which amended the principal Act, and Act 21 of 1940 uses the term &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D;. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) talks about confusion, but if I had to agree to the amendment to substitute &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; for &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; then you would have confusion. In the principal Act you would have some sections using the word &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; and in the amending Act you would have the word &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; used, and I do not know what would happen then.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>It would, of course, cause confusion and that is the only reason why I cannot accept the amendment. You cannot have two different terms used in the same Act, two different terms apparently having the same meaning. I agree with hon. members that &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; is the right term to use, but it would simply cause confusion if in this amending Bill the word &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; were used whereas in the principal Act the word &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; is used. That is why I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>In regard to the amendment of the hon. member for Albany, I can only confirm what the hon. member for Wynberg has said as to the reasons for this amendment. Hon. members must realize that &#x201C;expropriation&#x201D; is only used as a last resort. It is only when an owner refuses to sell when it is in the public interest to acquire certain land, when the owner places an exorbitant price on his land, that expropriation is resorted to. In this particular case it might happen, as the hon. member for Wynberg has rightly said, that a small piece of ground might be left over after the national road has been built. To provide access would probably cost a considerable sum. It would either mean the building of a bridge or the construction of a subway. The building of the bridge or the construction of the subway might cost much more than the value of the land, but the National Transportation Commission is compelled to give access to that land. The owner of that land might want an exorbitant price for that land, a price which is out of all proportion to its value, and there is only one choice before the National Transportation Commission and that is either to expropriate or to provide the access, and I think that it is unreasonable to delete this provision and to create a stalemate or at least to place the National Transportation Commission in the unfortunate position of unnecessarily having to spend public money in order to provide an access. Hon. members must realize that the National Transportation Commission is not unreasonable. There is no intention to appropriate farms or valuable pieces of land. Hon. members can rest assured that if the National Transportation Commission had to adopt that attitude, their would soon be complaints both to the Minister and to Parliament. I think it is absolutely necessary to have this power. Quite possibly it may not even be used, but if it is necessary to &#x201C;expropriate&#x201D; I think they should have the power to do so. We have had this experience that the moment the State decides to purchase any land or property, the price is usually pushed up to two or three times its value. That always happens. Most people are under the impression that when the State buys, they can demand any price and that the State simply has to pay. We have had that experience over the years, and that is why it is frequently necessary to expropriate, otherwise there would be exploitation of the State, which is not in the interests of the public. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

The position is not that you will place the farmers in an impossible position, those farmers in whose interests the board spend these large sums of money&#x2014;sums which are far in excess of the value that land will ever attain. We dare not empower the wilful person, when negotiations have failed, to say that there cannot be expropriation. The hon. member for Green Point knows that there are cases where people have misused their rights and have refused to yield in the public interests and to come with such an amendment and to place the power in the hands of such people is not in the interests of the other taxpayers.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) is quite right. This clause is really in the interests of the farmer. What has the position been hitherto? A national road is built and small pieces of land are cut off which are useless to the farmer. It has never been possible for the National Transport Commission to compensate him for the land. In other words, the farmer has always suffered damage as a result of the cutting off of those useless pieces of land bordering on the national road. We are now making provision for the first time that he can be paid compensation for that land; in other words, those pieces of land can now be purchased, and surely that is in the interest of the farmer. Formerly those pieces of land were useless to the farmer; now they can be purchased and proper compensation can be given to the farmer. If he charges a fair and reasonable price, the land is bought from him, but we know human nature; there are many people who push up their price the moment the State wants to buy. I think it is our duty to obviate that exploitation of the State. It is only in those cases where the owner of the land is unreasonable, where he wants an excessive price for a useless piece of land, that the National Transportation Commission will have the right to expropriate. That is the only case in which it will happen, and it will occur very seldom. Instead of spending money unnecessarily to build a bridge or a subway, which costs much more than the value of that piece of land, is it not in the interest of the State to have the right rather to expropriate that piece of land?</p>

<p>The hon. member talks about arbitration. Who is going to arbitrate? The Bill would have to stipulate who is to arbitrate and who is to pay the cost of the arbitration. If you have arbitration, the cost of the arbitration may be higher than the value of that piece of land.</p>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Minister realizes that by law all farmers&#x2019; troubles as regards their fences and their boundaries cm only be settled by arbitration, and that system has worked over the years and has <span class="col_1319-1320" refersTo="page_676"/>given satisfaction. Perhaps the Minister would like to specify who the arbitrators should be, but all the difficulties of the farmers are settled by a representative appointed by each of the complainants together with a third impartial individual who is generally the magistrate. The services of the magistrate would not cost anything because he is a public servant. It would only be the cost of the services of the two individuals appointed by the two sides, and my idea is just to give the farmer some say in regard to the appropriation of the remaining extent of his property, without any harm to the Government. I would like the Minister to understand that system has worked for years and years as regards our Fencing Act. As the Minister knows, there is nothing so delicate as the question of a boundary fence. Many of our boundary fences are not properly allocated. Then we also have the difficulties about give and take on our river banks and enumerable difficulties of that nature, and they are settled at practically no expense by this method of arbitration. The farmers are used to the system of arbitration and I have no doubt that they would accept this and I hope the Minister will give it some consideration. I believe that it would make this Bill more acceptable, and I am certain that the farming community would appreciate any concession that the Minister might make in this regard.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>That is really no parallel with this. I know there is provision in certain Acts for arbitration in regard to certain specific matters. If the hon. member wants to introduce arbitration into this particular Bill and into the Act, you will have to have additional provisions in the Bill to say who the arbitrators are to be and how and by whom they are to be appointed; you cannot simply leave it in the air. The mere insertion of the word &#x201C;arbitration&#x201D; is not going to solve the problem. Additional clauses would have to be inserted to provide for the method of arbitration, to provide for the arbitrators themselves, to provide who is going to pay the cost of arbitration. I do not think it is really worth while to introduce a provision such as that merely for the purpose of preventing the owner of a small piece of ground from receiving less than the price he demands. I do not think any hardship will arise, and if there are any serious complaints, that the National Transportation Commission is acting unreasonably, then I am quite prepared to come back to the House and ask the House to amend the Act.</p>

<p>The Minister says that only a small bit of land will be cut off. Will he show me where it is stated in this clause that it is going to be kept down to only a small piece of land. There is nothing laid down here at all. But according to the Minister it is now getting smaller and smaller; it is like the unmarried mother whose excuse to her outraged parents was that it was only a very small baby. There is nothing here to say that it shall be a small bit of land. If the Bill had provided that it shall not exceed, say five or ten morgen of land, it might be a different matter, but as this clause reads the bureaucrat can take over any amount of land if he so wishes. It may be said that at some future date they want to build a fly-over or to erect a road workers&#x2019; camp there or take out gravel or make a stone quarry. They might want to use the land for quite a different purpose altogether. No, Sir, I am afraid that cock won&#x2019;t fight. The Minister keep on telling us that if it is only a small area, it would be cheaper to take it over than to have the expense of building a subway under the road or a bridge over it. Sir, this is all very well but these &#x201C;ifs&#x201D; of the Minister are not very satisfactory. If the dog, for example, had not stopped to catch the flea, he would have caught the hare.

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I take it that Clause 4 (c) is based on the idea that the cost of survey, investigation and preliminary planning of a route, before it is accepted as a declared road, should be part of the process of building the road. The Board is now going to take a power it did not previously possess, that is to defray the cost of such initial work from the fund itself. If that is so, I agree with it.</p>

<p>On Clause 6,</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 28, to omit &#x201C;in the opinion of the board&#x201D;; and in lines 31 and 32 to omit &#x201C;the board is of the opinion that&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The section to which an amendment is sought to be made here is Section 14 of the Act which empowers the Administrator to remove gates across a national road provided that the sides of the road are adequately fenced, and provided that adequate gates are inserted in the fences on the side of the road. The section as it stands provides that the Board has to insert in those fences on the side of the road such gates as may be necessary. I emphasize those words, because there is at the present time an objective test as to whether or not the necessary gates have been inserted. In other words, it does not rest with the Board to decide whether or not adequate access is given to the two pieces of land which are bisected by the road in question. It is an objective court that decides and if a farmer is dissatisfied with the number of gates put in by the Board, he can go to court and have a decision from the court as to whether those gates are adequate are not. Now the amendment in the Bill seeks <span class="col_1321-1322" refersTo="page_677"/>to extend the principle of gates and to empower the Board instead of gates to put in bridges or subways in order to give access from the one piece of land across the road to the other piece of land. But the principle as to whether or not that access is necessary, is changed, and it is now merely for the Board to decide whether gates or bridges or subways will be adequate. Therefore the Board decides as to whether one or two or three subways are adequate in respect of the farmer&#x2019;s access to his pieces of land, and provided the Board makes a <i>bona fide</i> decision, no court can interfere with the decision the Board has taken, and although the farmer may be strongly of the opinion that the access given is not adequate for his purposes, he has no relief at all, provided that the Board has applied its mind to the job. The Board&#x2019;s decision may be an unreasonable one, the access may not be adequate at all, but in terms of the amendment now sought to be introduced in the Act, the farmer has no redress. This side of the House believes that is a wrong principle and that the wording which was in the principal Act, and still is up to the present time, should be upheld, namely, that there should be an objective test and if the farmer is dissatisfied with the means of access given him by the Board, he can go to the court and say: &#x201C;The Board says that this is adequate, I say it is inadequate, will you please decide this issue as to whether it is adequate or not.&#x201D; For that reason I move my amendment.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>My honourable and learned friend has put the case very clearly and I don&#x2019;t propose to go over the same ground again. Sir, if you read Clause 6, it refers to bridges, subways or gates, and line 36 says: &#x201C;It shall be in the discretion of the Board to determine whether &#x2026;&#x201D; Now I suggest that will be an entirely <i>ex parte</i> decision by people who are interested from the engineering point of view and may not be interested from the owner&#x2019;s point of view. But let us go further, and this is the important point from the point of view of the practical man: Suppose they decide to put a gate at a certain sport. Now you are not allowed to take a tractor for instance across a tarred road. If they decide to put a gate there and they say that is good enough as an access for the farmer, how is the farmer to take his heavy mechanical iron-wheeled machine across the tarred road? He is not allowed to take anything over which has iron wheels. How is he to get his implements across? It is quite obvious how that difficulty can be overcome. It may be out of order if I make that suggestion, but it is that the road-makers can lay down a cement crossing section between the two gates so that the man can take his heavy iron-wheeled vehicles across. I have found it very difficult and I am not on a naitonal road, but on a tarred trunk road. At present they can stop any vehicle crossing a road if it is not rubber-tyred.</p>

<p>It does because if the Board decides on gates the farmer can take the matter to court. He may say that he is not satisfied with the arbitrary decision and that he cannot farm properly if they merely give him a gate. Surely the hon. Minister sees that. Here it is a question of going across a tarred road and your Board decides that you will give the owner no other access except by gate. Now how can you cross that tarred road with your heavy machinery! Surely he should have the right to appeal against the decision of the Board and say: &#x201C;This is unreasonable, I cannot farm my land on the other side if they only give me a gate.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>MR. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like the hon. the Minister to approach this matter in an attitude of sweet reasonableness. We dropped our objections to his word &#x201C;appropriation&#x201D; because it had appeared in the old Act and apparently was understood. We did not want to make confusion worse confounded. To please the Minister we resorted to the wording of the original Act. But now in this case the Minister wishes us to deviate from the wording of the old Act. In that Act the courts were not excluded. In the old Act there was no insertion of the sinister words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Board&#x201D;, words designed to take away from a complainant the possible correction of the courts of law, should a dispute occur. In the original section &#x201C;such gates as are necessary&#x201D; was the complete and vital phase. Interpretation of the word &#x201C;necessary&#x201D;, in case of a dispute, was left to the courts. Under this Bill the interpretation of &#x201C;adequate access&#x201D; is placed within the sphere of an arbitrary departmental judgment. I think the hon. the Minister should meet us in this instance, unless he can show that, in the workings of the old Act, unnecessary and lengthy court actions did take place involving the administration in costs and delays. I am quite satisfied myself that, as it previously worked, the Act was satisfactory. A farmer was entitled to and received reasonable access to different parts of his farm which had been cleaved in two by a national road. Such gates &#x201C;as were necessary&#x201D; were fixed by agreement between the Board and the farmer. I am quite certain that the Minister will find, on investigation, that there was not an unnecessary series of costly court actions in connection with the workings of the original Act. I ask the Board to accept exactly the same conditions, <span class="col_1323-1324" refersTo="page_678"/>to preserve the same attitude of mind now that the method of giving access to and egress from different parts of a farmer&#x2019;s land is being changed in the cause of road safety. We approve of the importation of a greater element of safety even though costs are increased. The fact is that it is necessary to change the system of giving access across a road by gates to a system of culverts and bridges. National roads nowadays are getting busier and busier. There is a greater element of danger in gates than in culvert crossings or bridges. But I do not think it is fair, in cases where a farm that is cut in two by a national road, that farmers have no say as to what is &#x201C;adequate&#x201D; for their needs. The farm, split in two by the road, may itself be divided up into camps. Previously the farmer could claim to be given gates opposite each camp across the road. He had necessary access to the other parts of his farm. Now there is a change. He must accept a culvert or bridge, whether he likes it or not, if the Board so decide. It is true that the culverts will be built at no cost to the farmer. The bridge will be built for nothing. But remember valuable land has been taken away from him for the national road. Now if, instead of say six gates for the three camps on each side of the road, the Board decides to build one culvert or one bridge, the farmer may think that is not sufficient. But the Board will be the sole judge as to whether the access given is adequate. The farmer may differ from their opinion vitally, but he has no redress. I think it was one of the hon. members on the other side who pointed out, during the second reading debate, how wide some of these culverts would have to be. They would have to extend the whole underground width of the national road. If they were made only about 6 feet wide, it might make it extremely difficult for the farmer. But the Board can simply say, &#x201C;In our opinion this is adequate &#x201D;, and there the matter would end. No matter what the farmer says, that decision cannot be reversed. I would like the hon. the Minister to consider objectively just how a decision or judgment in a matter like that may be arrived at. First of all let me say that I believe that the Board will always try to be as fair as possible. I am quite sure that most farmers will also be reasonable. But there is always a possibility of an arbitrary decision. I ask the hon. the Minister to try and picture how a judgment like this takes place: First of all, the Board members judging the adequacy of a culvert need take no evidence whatsoever; they need not consult anybody whatsoever; there need not be any examination of the evidence given; or of the site in question; they may come to a decision that is absolutely unreasonable; the law does not even provide that they should be reasonable. All the law says is that they should apply their minds to the problem, and who can prove that they did not. The possibility of upsetting a wrong decision is practically non-existent. You have to prove <i>mala fides</i> or that they did not apply their minds to the problem. So you see that our ordinary judicial processes of coming to a fair and impartial judgment need not exist in such a case. I think the hon. the Minister must agree that our suggestion is the fairest. I will only subscribe to his proposition if he can prove to me that in the workings of the original Act he and his Department, or the Board, were plagued by a series of costly court actions. I don&#x2019;t believe he can prove that, and I hope therefore that he will agree to our reasonable amendment.</p>

<p>No, because the National Transport Commission found it much cheaper to provide a gate on the insistence of a farmer than to enter into expensive litigation. That is what happened, but there was no control really, and they were simply compelled to supply gates, and to-day it is not merely a question of supplying gates, <span class="col_1325-1326" refersTo="page_679"/>it is a question of constructing expensive bridges and subways. That is why this amendment is being introduced so that the Board, not unreasonably, can decide what in its opinion is &#x201C;adequate access If the hon. member could devise some amendment to provide resort to a court of law in the last instance, I would probably be able to consider that. But to leave the matter open as it was in the past would nullify the intention of the Bill completely, and the intention of this amendment is to have more effective control over ingress and egress in respect of national roads.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would ask the hon. the Minister to give the matter reconsideration, because there is of course not just the one aspect to consider, that of control by the Board itself. It is the right of the land-owner that has to be taken into consideration as well. This side of the House is concerned with this aspect of the right of the owner of land. You see, Sir, I submit that there is really no need to deprive the owner of land of this common law right that he has always had of reasonable access to a public road. The law as it stands now in Section 14 gives recognition to that right by the use of the words &#x201C;as may be necessary&#x201D;. All we are asking is that should remain the position. Because whilst the hon. the Minister says that the Board has had some 25 years of experience in regard to this question of access, all I can say is that the courts have had experience of this very problem for very, very much longer. You see, a right of access to a public road is really a servitude. Once the right of access is agreed to, a servitude has been created which is a real right and which the owner of the land is entitled to have registered against his title. Now what we are doing here is to make the Board the arbiter in regard to this right of servitude. It is not going to be an arbiter who is impartial. The Board is going to be the arbiter in its own cause, because, obviously, the Board has an interest in the matter. All we are trying to do is to preserve the position as it stands now that it should be &#x201C;reasonable access&#x201D; determined by &#x201C;necessity</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The word &#x201C;necessity&#x201D; as my hon. friend there knows, has been interpreted by the courts quite explicitly. I may quote from the same text book by Maasdorp, in which he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether a right of way exists or arises from necessity or from a judgment of a court is of no practical importance, for the right to claim the servitude is based upon the necessity.</block>

<p>That you have got to establish, the necessity. It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A way of necessity can be obtained by grant, by prescription or order of court. In Natal a Road Board has the power to grant that right.</block>

<p>That applies to the position here. The fact that in this case access is to be governed by statute does not alter the nature of the right. The nature of the right is a real right, a servitude. I think the hon. the Minister should give reconsideration to this matter. By changing the law in this direction, you are doing two things. Firstly, you are infringing the existing right of land-owners, as I have indicated. But, secondly, you are also depriving the land-owner of having recourse to the courts. As I say, you are trying to make the Board the arbiter in its own cause, and as my hon. friends opposite who are in the legal profession know it is an elementary principle of justice that no one can fairly be a judge in his own cause.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has indicated that the Road Board will be reasonable. I accept that, but on the other hand, the owner of land is not going to jeopardize his assets by rushing into litigation. As the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) has indicated, nobody has been able to indicate that abuse has been made of the right of access to the courts in regard to this question of &#x201C;necessity&#x201D; in the past, and I see no reason why there should be any suggestion that the courts will be inundated with work or will be unfair. You see, Sir, once Parliament gives a body such as this discretionary powers to decide an issue, that means in effect that the courts are eliminated from the matter. Sir, when Parliament leaves the discretion to a body such as this to decide the issue, any decision taken in the exercise of that discretion is not open to question in a court. It is only open to question in a court if the body has exceeded its powers or has acted <i>mala fide,</i> and I can assure you that in practice it is extremely difficult to establish the second of these two grounds, namely that it has acted <i>mala fide.</i></p>

<p>We are here concerned not only with a general right, we are concerned essentially with private rights, and the courts of law have always been the protectors of private rights. I say that it would be entirely wrong that those rights should now be left to the arbitrary control of the Government or a body such as contemplated in this Bill. Because what the Road Board in fact is, is that it is the servant of the Executive Government, and under those circumstances, it is depriving landowners of a right which they have held not for 25 years, as the hon. the Minister indicated, but very much longer, ever since there have been courts established in South Africa. I hope the hon. the Minister will reconsider the matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>With all respect, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply did not cover the point of the amendment at all. The hon. the Minister says that if an amendment can be devised which gives access to the courts as a last <span class="col_1327-1328" refersTo="page_680"/>resort, correcting an irregularity in a decision by the Board, he will favourably consider such an amendment. But, Sir, the only thing the proposed amendment does is to restore that very access to the courts, so that any wrong decision which the Board may take can be corrected by a disinterested body. That is all it does. It does not impose or give to the landowner or to the farmer any right which he did not have before. It does not pamper him or treat him more favourably in any way. It merely allows him to retain a right which he has under the existing law. Then the hon. the Minister says: Who is to decide as to whether access is adequate and as to whether a gate or a bridge is necessary? Of course the Board is to decide that. The Board has to decide whether or not by putting in a couple of subways the access is adequate. But in terms of our amendment, if the Board makes a mistake, you can put it right, whereas in terms of the Bill as it stands, if the Board makes a mistake no one can do anything about it, and that wrong decision will stand, it will be put into effect, and the landowner or the farmer will suffer.</p>

<p>The Board would only have given in in those circumstances if the proper view of the thing was that the farmer&#x2019;s claim was just.

<p>Finally, I can see only one reason for the inclusion in this Bill of the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Board&#x201D; and that is to take away the right of correction which at present exists in law. There can be no other reason for the insertion of these words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Board&#x201D; in the place of the former words &#x201C;such as may be necessary&#x201D;.

<p>If this amendment of ours does not work and the hon. the Minister can show us next session that it has not worked and that a lot of unnecessary litigation has taken place, there is nothing to prevent him from bringing in legislation to cancel the effect of our amendment. But up to now the Act has worked very well. The Board gave those gates because they found it was necessary for the farmers to have those gates in order to have access to their land. They would not have gone and put up unnecessary gates. But now, after this Bill is passed, they will be able to say: You must do as we say. You shall have one gate here, and there is no appeal to anybody else to show that we have been unreasonable. The hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) gave us a very fine example. Say a man has three camps on the other side of the road. They might be pasture for the time being, and one gate or one subway might be sufficient for the farmer to get his cattle across to graze those three camps. But later he decides to plough the centre camp and to make it wheatland. How is he going to get access to the two pasture-lands on each side if he decides to plough the land where the gate is. He cannot drive sheep or cattle through a wheat-field to reach the pasture camps on either side. These things to us as practical men are obvious, and I wish the hon. the Minister could see them. Then there is another point. We do not want to control the Board doing this job on the roads, but all we say is that we also want to protect the landowner who has to farm the land in an economic way. Why should the Board have the power arbitrarily to decide what the farmer needs? Surely if there is access to the courts, or to an arbiter, they will be much more careful to see to it that they are not unreasonable. But under this Bill they can be completely unreasonable, and as the hon. member for Wynberg again pointed out: Say they decide to have a 6 ft. subway because at that moment the farmer only has pasturelands or veld on the other side. and a 6 ft. subway is wide enough for animals. Now he decides to put it under the plough. How is he going to get his 12 ft. combine or his 14 ft. Windrows across? He can&#x2019;t get it through the subway. At the time when the subway was put there, it might have been suitable, but in a few years time he may want to develop the land on the other side, but due to the width of gates or subway the farmer cannot take heavy machinery across. Then the Board can say that they will not give him a wider subway. It will come about and he will not be able to do anything about it; he will not be able to develop the other side. All sorts of difficulties may arise which cannot be envisaged by the House at the present moment. I am not speaking frivolously; I am speaking very seriously from personal knowledge. I do hope therefore that the Minister will see to it that there is somebody else other than the Board, who will act as arbitrator and who will then be able to say when the farmer has put his <span class="col_1329-1330" refersTo="page_681"/>case: &#x201C;I think the farmer is reasonable and therefore the Board must accede to his request.&#x201D; You cannot get a 16 ft. windroller through. How will you cultivate your land on the other side. I appeal to the Minister; he is a reasonable man. He sees our difficulties. We are not merely trying to be provocative. We are talking in the interests of the people. We realize that these subways are necessary because too many gates on a national road constitute a danger. But on the other hand you must have sufficient access to make farming economic for the landowner. So I hope the Minister will accede to this request.</p>

This, Sir, is the traditional conflict in Parliament between the opposition insistence that we should preserve what we call the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;, and the Government&#x2019;s willingness to bow down to the rule of the bureaucrat. We in Parliament assembled, possess the power either to delegate to subordinate authorities the right to make laws or to confer upon them the right to interpret our laws. In this Parliament, to-day, we are conferring upon the Board the right to make a decision that may affect a man&#x2019;s livelihood or deprive him of his personal property rights. The democratic way is always to insist that, in the event of a dispute, a disinterested judge should decide the case. The assumption now made is that in such a dispute between a farmer and the Board only the Board can be the judge. If the Board is unreasonable its opinion still holds sway. Yet the farmer, in my opinion, may be vastly better equipped by experience to know what is reasonable access, from a farming point of view, from one part of his property to the other. The point is that as soon as one confronts Ministers or bureaucrats with a court of law one would think it was the devil facing holy water. They shy away from courts of law. Sometimes it is with the best intentions in the world from their point of view. They do not want the wheels of administration to be clogged. So they take the easy way out which is to avoid correction of the courts of law, to avoid delay, to avoid costs. It is sometimes done with the best of intentions, as I have said, and with the sincere wish to be always reasonable themselves. But a Minister cannot control every arbitrary action taken by the subordinate authorities whom he confers the powers of making quasi-judicial decisions. There is no compulsion that they should even act in a judicial way. There is nothing to compel them to examine any case thoroughly. I know they do so in nine cases out of ten. But the point is that disputes as to legal interpretation should always be properly examined in a judicial manner. What the Minister is saying to the farmer in the case of all disputes is this: &#x201C;You have a national road going through your farm. Previously you had access by eight gates. The Board says one culvert will be sufficient. You can talk till you are blue in the face but you will still only have one culvert. I have spoken. You have no right of redress from my decision. There is no arbitration; you only have the doubtful help of a right of review.&#x201D; The old pretence is held up that there is a right of review. It is also urged as an excuse that, if <i>male fides</i> is shown, if it can be shown that the so called judges have not brought their mind to bear on the problem, redress can be had to a court of law. As a lawyer the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) ought to know that protection is very nebulous at the best of times, very insecure indeed &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>Have I tried it? How ridiculous. Have you tried it? Where do such silly questions get us? The hon. member&#x2019;s experience is not half as adequate as mine on this particular point and he ought to know it. The Minister must not over-simplify the situation. The hon. the Minister has implied that, if he were to give access to the courts, the workings of this Act will be nullified, that he will not be able to control access to and ingress from national roads. But that is not the case. The Minister ought to be able to exercise control just as he has done it in the past. The only thing that might impede him is the fact that in giving the farmers proper access he must be reasonable. And he should be compelled to be reasonable. I know the Minister wants the Board to be careful of the expenditure of their funds. Previously when it had to put up only a few gates it was not a very costly matter. Now he is faced with compulsion to provide either a culvert or a bridge. This is a much more expensive affair but because it is more costly that is no reason why he should not still be just as fair. I do not think the Minister should say that we will be nullifying the workings of the Act. The Act will work as it has always worked and there will be the added safety on the roads he wishes to achieve. The essence is that the Minister will be forced in all instances to be reasonable. The access he provides for a farmer from one part of his farm to another must be adequate to that farmer&#x2019;s needs. What could be fairer than that?</p>

<p>As I see it, the whole attack of the Opposition on this clause can be divided into three sections. The first is that they long for the old times. That, for example, was the case with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). The second is that they want to protect the interests of the owners adjacent to the road. Then in the third place there is a disguised attack on the Minister, to the effect that he will act unreasonably. And they are not honest enough to say frankly that they do not trust the Minister and his Commission here. They say it will be much better if the court does it.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member cannot say that hon. members opposite are dishonest. He must withdraw it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I withdraw it and say that they are not quite sincere in their attack. If the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) has his way, a problem will arise&#x2014;if there is a difference of opinion between the land-owner and the road authority&#x2014;which in any case must result in a court case. Then the court can decide whether there should be an emergency road or not. It will then depend on the circumstances whether he grants an order or not. But he will have to prove that it is really an emergency. I do not know how much experience the hon. member has in this respect, but one man&#x2019;s need is never as great as the others. It is one of the most difficult things to prove that there should necessarily be a road. The only way to prove it is by proving that one cannot get there in any other way, and the consideration that counts with the court is whether what he has is sufficient, whether what he has is adequate or not. Therefore we are not departing very far from the old position.</p>

<p>Then this other question arises&#x2014;the interests of the owner himself. Now, Sir, you know yourself that no owner wants too many gates on his farm. He himself will therefore be prepared to have a limited number. Therefore the Opposition need not concern themselves about the rights of the owner. But what I really want to come back and reply to is the argument of the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). He alleged that the Minister would not act reasonably.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#russell">

<speech by="#coertze">

<p>That is even worse. If he says the Minister perhaps will not act reasonably, he suspects the Minister of not acting reasonably.</p>

<p>It is the Board.</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member says it is the Board which perhaps will not act reasonably, he suspects the Board of not acting honestly. You know, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and what he knows about administrative law is dangerous. He and I have already crossed swords on this point before. He did not reply to a single one of the arguments which I used against him at the time of the debate in regard to delegated legislative and administrative powers. I want to put the matter to him again to-day, that if the Board acts unreasonably he need not prove that there were <i>male fides</i> on the part of the Board. He must simply be able to prove that a reasonable man would not have come to those conclusions on those facts. He must prove that the Board had a certain prejudice in respect of a particular standpoint. It is true that he will not get the judgment the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) would like, namely that the Board should be instructed to provide this or that form of access. But he will get an order that the Board must review the matter. Let me now tell him this, that when the Road Board or the Minister receive an order like that and have to pay the costs there will be such a fuss about the matter because the Board has not devoted its attention to it, that it will be very surprising if they do not provide that access.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) says that it may be that a person suddenly will find another use for the crossing which must be granted. But surely then it is clear that if he cannot pass through the subway with his combines and big machinery, that crossing or subway is not adequate; then it is not sufficient, it is not adequate. Then it surely means that the Transport Commission did not devote attention to the matter, and did not consider all the possibilities. That is how the position is. Mr. Chairman. the Opposition is really short of breath. They have a shortage of arguments.</p>

<p>Yes, they really are not adequate (adekwaat). The hon. member is quite correct. They are only angry (kwaad) because they cannot sit on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to give you the assurance that I hold no brief for the Transport Commission. I also have criticism against them. I can criticize them quite a lot. But I have no criticism against them in the sense that they act unreasonably or that they do not give consideration to a matter submitted to them, or that they are unable to consider anything properly. I repeat that if the Opposition longs for the past, they need not do so. If they think they are protecting the adjacent owners, that is not really within their mandate and they are making a mistake; and if the hon. member for Wynberg and those who string along with him think that they are thereby rendering road safety and the country a service when they discuss administrative law, they are also making a big mistake, because in that way they are besmirching our administration of justice by making these allegations (they are making) against the courts.</p>

<p>I do not know the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), but having listened to him I assume he has some sort of legal qualification. Having listened to the hon. member I am very surprised to hear that he represents the constituency of Standerton which, I believe, is vitally affected by landowners having their property cut in half by national roads, However, Sir, the hon. member makes the point that he has told the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) on a number of occasions that the right of review which one had in a court of law over statutory bodies of this kind when they were given <span class="col_1333-1334" refersTo="page_683"/>powers such as those that are given in this Bill, namely a discretion, gave relief to people who were dissatisfied in the sense that the Board had come to a wrong decision. The position is this, and I suggest that the hon. member asks any lawyer in Cape Town, that no relief is to be obtained by way of a right of review if the Board concerned has merely come to a wrong decision or a decision with which any other person faced with those facts would differ.</p>

<p>That is the whole point. If they do not apply their minds to the matter of course you can have it upset. But I have yet to see it proved that a board has not properly applied its mind to a matter if it has any sort of competent legal advice on it at all.</p>

<p>I do not know when the hon. member was last in practice. If he has any experience of the practising of law at all he will agree with what I say in regard. It is not a question of the Minister or the Board probably mis-applying its mind or coming to the wrong conclusion. But the members of the Board do not go and inspect every culvert all over the countryside.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Then they are not applying their mind.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They have to rely on reports submitted by inspectors, inspectors who come to their own conclusions on the matter. They submit a report to the Board or the Minister and he has to rely on what they say. It is physically impossible for the Board to go round and investigate these matters personally in each case. It is quite easy to visualize how an inspector can come to a wrong decision, either because of his relationship to the individual farmer or because he is in a hurry or because the farmer is away when he makes his inspection or because he is not fully seized of the work and has not got all the facts before him. So he decides that one subway is sufficient whereas in fact three should be constructed. Having considered that situation the Board comes to the conclusion that one subway is enough and provided it has applied its mind to the matter, you cannot have that put right and all the reviews in the world will not rectify that situation as far as that farmer is concerned.</p>

<p>I accordingly suggest that the arguments that have been put forward against this amendment do not answer the point at all.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am coming to the clause. The clause provides that a certain decision will be within the discretion of the Transport Commission. The allegation against the clause is that discretion may be exercised improperly. The allegation is further that if the discretion is not excercised properly the aggrieved person will have no redress at all against that exercise of their discretion. I want to contradict that and therefore I say that it appears to me that the hon. member for Zululand has also heard something about this matter already, as to when one exercises a discretion properly or not.</p>

<p>I want to interrupt the hon. member. I allowed the hon. member in the first instance to discuss it, and I allowed the hon. member for Zululand to reply to it. The argument is now going to and fro, and I want the discussion to be confined to this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, may I then discuss the advisability of this particular clause, drafted as it is, because it leaves something to the judgment of the Transport Commission. In my experience it is quite true that when somebody alleges that a discretion was not properly exercised, he cannot obtain an order of court substituting the court&#x2019;s opinion for that of the person who exercised the discretion. But I contend that when the allegation is that a discretion has not been properly exercised there are a number of grounds except <i>male fides</i> which the aggrieved person can advance to show why the discretion was not exercised properly. Such a person can obtain an order of court to the effect that the discretion was not exercised properly. That means that the body or person concerned has to reconsider the matter, and review it. That is what we will have in terms of this clause. When a person feels aggrieved by the opinion expressed by a board that the right of way is not adequate and feels that the discretion was exercised improperly, he still has redress to the court to ask that the matter be reconsidered. And when a person goes so far as to get an order of court, it means that there has already been such a fuss about the matter, as I said a moment ago, that the chances of receiving a favourable decision are very great. I concede that they cannot obtain an order of court to compel the Minister to do what the owner would really like him to do. I happen to know that much in regard to administrative law. But I repeat that it will not make the least difference in terms of this clause or in terms of the old position which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) wants to have.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that Clause 10 is here because there existed some doubt whether the Commission could undertake, and play its full part in, basic preliminary planning of declared, national or special roads. This doubt is now removed by this Clause. It is quite clear now that this preliminary planning can be done out of the fund. It need not be left, as I think it was often left in the past, to the subordinate authority. It is a good idea. The Board should exercise some control from the very beginning. This basic planning is really necessary, especially in determining the route and the direction the road might take. As I said in the second reading, I approve of the necessity for giving these powers without making the Commission a road-builder. The Board partakes in all the actions preparatory to road building and can now charge the cost thereof to the fund. That is reasonable and acceptable.</p>

<p>We are coming near the end of the Bill, and the Minister will find we have been more reasonable than he has, and more reasonable than his &#x201C;advocatus diabolus&#x201D; from Standerton.

<p>To omit all the words after &#x201C;with&#x201D; in line 52, to the end of sub-section (1) of the proposed new Section 9<i>bis</i> and to substitute:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the completion of the erection, construction, laying or alteration of or any addition to any structure or, other thing lawfully commenced prior to the date of commencement of this section:</li>

<li>(b) a structure erected by the Railway Administration on land under its control;</li>

<li>(c) a structure or other thing erected, constructed or laid in an urban area or on, under or below an erf or lot in a township;</li>

<li>(d) an enclosure, a fence or wall which does not rise higher than five feet above the surface of the land on which it stands;</li>

<li>(e) an irrigation work, as defined in the law relating to irrigation, a farm dwellinghouse, or any other structure or thing on a farm intended to be used in connection with <i>bona fide</i> farming operations;</li>

</ol>

<p>and provided further, that any permission granted under this section shall not realize the doing of anything which is unlawful under any other law.</p>

<p>The object is to bring this particular clause into line with Section 9 (1) of the principal Act. There is an anomaly at the moment. In other words, certain exceptions were made in Section 9 (1) of the principal Act and I am bringing this clause into line with it.</p>

<p>Looking at the clause I find <span class="col_1339-1340" refersTo="page_686"/>everything is in order except (b). I wonder what is the reason for including a structure erected by the Railway Administration on land under its control? Could the Minister give an explanation as to why the Railway Administration is brought in in that way? I know that they are brought within the general prohibition which applies to everyone else, but here it might be held that where there is a cross-road and the protection of 1,500 feet is insisted on, the Railways themselves could erect a structure on such land under their control and that structure might include advertising hoardings which it is expressly held to exclude. I would just like an explanation.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>It is really an omission in the Bill. Section 9 (1) of the principal Act deals with the 300 feet prohibition and (b) reads that &#x201C;a structure erected by the Railway Administration &#x2026;&#x201D; In other words, in regard to the 300 feet prohibition, farming operations as well as the Railway Administration are excluded. Now 9 <i>(])bis</i> is brought into line with 9 (1). Where you have the exclusion from the 300 feet, it is only right that it should also be excluded from the 1,500 feet, and the reference to the Railway Administration will only be in regard to essential works like the building of a railway line, if it arises. It is problematical that it will ever arise, but if it does railway work must receive priority over road work. The exception is made in regard to farming operations and the Railway Administration, to bring it into line with Section 9 (1) of the principal Act.</p>

<p>During his second reading speech the hon. the Minister pointed out that the 1,500 feet was applicable in the case where a declared road and another road crossed, the object of the Minister being that where a declared road crossed a minor road near a town, he wants to prevent the possibility of businesses being erected near the crossing along such minor road and thus attracting business and traffic away from the declared road to the detriment of the town which will then be by-passed. I think that is a very cogent reason but there are many crossings where a declared road crosses another road, crossings which are far away from any town, miles away in the veld, and I want to ask the Minister whether he will consider an amendment in the Other Place that will read &#x201C;any other road further than five miles from the border of a local authority&#x201D;. As it reads at the moment a limit of 1,500 feet is imposed in respect of all crossings throughout the country, whereas the reason for this limitation which the Minister has in mind is to protect those small towns which are close to such crossings.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the danger which the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) sees in this clause exists. There is also the right of appeal. I cannot for one moment think that the Board will act unreasonably. I quite agree that where a national road crosses another road far away from a town, even if a road interchange will only take up eight or nine morgen and it will be quite unreasonable on the part of the Commission to reserve 70 morgen for a road interchange that will only take up eight morgen. It is obvious, therefore, that they will act reasonably and that the National Transport Commission will not insist that no building or any work which is prohibited under this provision should not be erected within the 1,500 feet. Furthermore I am also inserting the right of appeal to the Minister. It has been omitted from the Bill but I shall insert it by way of amendment. In other words, if any person finds that an injustice has been committed, he will have the right to appeal to the Minister, and I can assure the House that if an appeal is made to me and I think that an injustice has been done to anybody, I shall certainly see to it that it is put right. I think, therefore, that we should leave it as it is at the moment. If there are cases where an injustice has really been done, we can always consider inserting some provision or other which will rectify the position.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The object of the Bill before the House is to amend the original Iron and Steel Industry Act in four respects. In the first place we propose deleting a doubtful clause from the existing Act. As hon. members know Section 2 of the existing Act empowers the Iron and Steel Corporation to purchase, sell and own any movable and immovable property, claims, mineral-bearing property, mining rights, water etc. within the Republic. Nowhere else in the Act do you find this limitation on the Corporation that it may only have possessions within the Republic. It does not appear in the important Section 1 nor in Section 2 (b). According to legal opinion that we have obtained it does not seem either that the original object of the legislators was that Iscor should be limited to have possessions in the Repubilc only. We went through the Hansards of that time but the discussions that took place do not throw much light on the subject either. It would appear, therefore, that it is quite unreasonable to retain the limitation &#x201C;within the Republic&#x201D; in the Act. You will realize, Sir, that the way in which Iscor is developing today, it may probably find it necessary next year to acquire certain interests overseas, as in the case of Sasol. It may be that those interests will be in respect of the sale of Iscor products or the acquisition of machinery or any commodity which Iscor may require. That may make it necessary for Iscor to own shares, claims, rights and companies etc. overseas. That is why we propose amending the law by deleting that portion and stating clearly that Iscor will have the right to own these things outside the Republic of South Africa as well.</p>

<p>The second amendment which we contemplate in the present Act concerns the kind of preferent shares which Iscor may issue. Under the existing Act Iscor may only issue cumulative or non-cumulative preferent shares, subject to the approval of the State President. It is now proposed to empower Iscor to issue all kinds of preferent shares with the approval of the State President. It may be that Iscor decides to issue other kinds of preferent shares, such as profit-sharing preferent shares etc. but it is prohibited from doing so under the existing Act. You probably know, Sir, that since 1947 approximately 220,000 7&#x00BD; per cent cumulative preferent shares of R2 each have been issued at 71 per cent. If this change is brought about, the way will be clear possibly to improve the position of these shareholders at a later stage by the issue of types of preferent shares other than the purely cumulative or non-cumulative 7&#x00BD; per cent preferent shares of to-day.</p>

<p>In the third place it is proposed to remove certain restrictions which have been placed on Iscor as far as its borrowing powers are concerned. As you know. Sir, as the law stands at the moment Iscor may not pay more than 5&#x00BD; per cent interest on loans issued against debentures. It may be that 5&#x00BD; per cent on loans against debentures was a realistic rate at the time when the original Act was drafted, but to-day 5&#x00BD; per cent is quite unrealistic and I propose deleting this provision from the Act.</p>

<p>The final amendment which is proposed is in connection with the borrowing powers of Iscor. Under the existing Act Iscor may only borrow up to 50 per cent of its fully paid-up capital. As you know, Sir, due to the development that has taken place and the increase in its reserves, Iscor has funds at its disposal to-day which are approximately five times as much as its paid-up capital, and it is unreasonable to continue to limit its borrowing powers to 50 per cent of its paid-up capital. Iscor is on the point of embarking on a great expansion programme. It will require money for that. Some of that money will have to be raised by way of loans overseas and we propose, therefore, to increase its borrowing powers to an amount equal to its paid-up capital.</p>

<p>These are the proposals which I submit to the House. I do not think they are contentious and I therefore move.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House accept the explanations the hon. the Minister has given as the reason for introducing this amendment to the Iron and Steel Industry Act. The provisions of Clause 2 are exceedingly widely stated. Sub-clause (4) which has to be inserted into the Act goes far beyond what the Minister seems to have mentioned. It means that Iscor can carry on any of the operations outside which it can carry on in South Africa. Iscor could, theoretically at any rate, start carrying on business as iron-masters or steel-makers anywhere else, e.g. in Japan. But we appreciate that notwithstanding the very wide terms in which this sub-clause is framed, the scope of activity which a national body of this nature can undertake outside the boundaries of South Africa would naturally be governed by practical considerations. Therefore we have no objection to the Bill, widely stated as the terms of this clause may be. With regard to the other clauses of the Bill we accept that they are designed to facilitate Iscor&#x2019;s operation; we are satisfied that they are designed to make provision for present needs and accept the explanation given by the Minister. Clause 4, which gives practically a 50 per cent increase in the borrowing powers is also somewhat widely stated, but here again it is a practical matter. It is a matter in which we on this side of the House certainly do not want to put any difficulties in the way of Iscor borrowing sufficient capital to carry on its operations. <span class="col_1343-1344" refersTo="page_688"/>The limitation at one stage was &#x00A3;4,000,000. That was then altered to half of the paid-up capital and it is now to be extended to the full amount of the paid-up capital. As I say, those are practical matters and we on this side of the House will lend our support to the second reading.</p>

<p>Eighth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Inventions Development Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The object of this Bill is to establish a separate organization as a corporate body which can develop scientific inventions to the stage where they can be put to use in the public interest. What is envisaged here in the first place is the scientific developments of the C.S.I.R. itself, but also that the scientific inventions of other persons or organizations like universities can be entrusted to such a corporation for development, and utilization.</p>

<p>The main object of this Bill is, when a scientific invention has been made, to develop that purely scientific invention further to the stage where it can be commercialized. Hon. members will know that a mere scientific invention, in theory, is not always fit for commercialization. For that much more investigation is required; it must firstly be ascertained whether that scientific invention can be made practicable and economical, whether it can be marketed, and that complete development from the time it is invented until it is commercialized is usually a complicated and expensive process. The work of commercializing scientific inventions at the moment rests with the Inventions Development Section of the C.S.I.R., but just recently the work in this sphere has increased so much, and there have been so many inventions to be patented, with the risk of possible litigation ensuing, together with the necessity for a large measure of negotiation, where business principles have to be applied, that it is felt to-day that it is not correct that a scientific organization like the C.S.I.R. should concern itself with matters which have more of a business character. What is actually being proposed here is that certain activities which are now being carried on by the inventions section of the C.S.I.R. should be transferred to a company which will be based on a business foundation.</p>

<p>I may just mention that a very thorough study has been made of similar organizations in Canada, in the United Kingdom and in India, and the proposals now before the House do not go as far as similar proposals in other countries because they have been framed in the light of local conditions. The C.S.I.R. sets out from the standpoint that it is a body established by public funds; that it is its duty to make inventions available to the people, and that it is not its duty to make too much financial profit out of inventions when they are put to practical use, but that it should always receive a reasonable percentage of those profits. However, it also sets out from the standpoint that it is obvious that such provision has to be made to compensate the proposed corporation, if not fully, then at least partially, for the funds it invests in developmental research. The position to-day is that when the C.S.I.R. has done research in a certain sphere and when certain inventions have been made, those inventions are published in all kinds of scientific and technical publications. But it has now been found that the mere publication of a scientific invention is not enough to ensure that this invention will be commercialized, and that certain further steps are necessary to bridge the gap between science and practical experience in industry.</p>

<p>This commercialization of an invention is generally accompanied by great financial risks, because hon. members will appreciate that a business man will not readily invest money in a scientific invention unless he has a fair degree of certainty that this scientific invention is likely to lead to something practical in industry. The first task therefore in regard to any invention is the patenting of that invention. Hitherto the development section of the C.S.I.R. has to a large extent concentrated on the patenting of new inventions. But this patenting is only an intermediate step in order to ensure the practical application of a new invention or discovery. Before an invention can be commercialized, it is almost always necessary to undertake further developmental research, which is very costly. These costs are often ten to 100 times as high as the cost of the original research and this, together with the fact that the opinion of a business man is necessary in order to select projects for further development, makes it even more necessary that the C.S.I.R. should not do too much in this respect. This corporation which is now being proposed will therefore have the important function of handling the business aspect of the invention up to the stage where it can be put to practical use. It will have the duty of patenting a scientific invention. Its duty will also be to awaken public interest in such an invention, and it will have to undertake further research in that field.</p>

<p>In order to explain the importance of this matter, I want to refer to something of which hon. members surely have knowledge. I refer, e.g., to the tellurometer which was based on research done by the C.S.I.R. itself, the tellurometer which to-day is one of the most important instruments and which has earned great respect in the world for the scientific research done by the C.S.I.R. The C.S.I.R. has had attractive offers for this tellurometer, but because of the policy it applies it decided <span class="col_1345-1346" refersTo="page_689"/>to have this tellurometer manufactured by local industry, with the result that to-day we have a South African institution which manufactures this tellurometer and exports it to various countries of the world.</p>

<p>Another example I would like to mention is in regard to the projects for desalting water which are being carried on now. That is of great interest to our country. In order to co-ordinate the activities of all the bodies which are dealing with this water desalting project, it was recently necessary for the C.S.I.R. to call together a large number of interested bodies and to have no fewer than ten agreements signed. This involves much time and trouble and it is not something which should be done by a scientific organization.</p>

<p>I repeat that the object of this foundation is to form a corporation to do all the work which this scientific organization is now doing, particularly in view of the business aspect of it and because of the fact that it involves patenting, with the resultant risk of possible litigation. I think hon. members will agree with me that it would not be wise for the C.S.I.R., as a scientific organization, to be involved in litigation.</p>

<p>A further example of what the passing of this Bill will involve is the provision of more freedom of movement in regard to the development of inventions and the fact that it will facilitate the taking of urgent decisions on a business basis. In view of this, it is therefore the intention to appoint people with the necessary business experience on the board of directors.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to say more about the desirability of having such a corporation, in view of the fact that the wording of the Bill is very clear, but I just want to mention a few other important provisions.</p>

<p>To the extent determined by the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance the C.S.I.R. will be the only shareholder in the corporation about to be established. They will therefore also be the only body to nominate directors, with an official or member of the C.S.I.R. as chairman of the board of directors. The number of directors will vary from four to eight, and the Council must appoint these persons for their knowledge of science, technology, industry, finance or the administration of patents. In regard to the erection of buildings, the lease or the purchase of sites, etc., in order to promote the object of the Corporation, the provisions of this Bill are mainly on the same basis as in the case of other corporations. Except for the manager and/or managing director the staff of the Corporation will consist mainly of personnel seconded from the Inventions Development Section of the C.S.I.R. Furthermore, hon. members will note that the Bill provides for a share capital of R200,000. The intention, however, is that in the beginning only R50,000 of this capital will be taken up in shares by the C.S.I.R. It may perhaps be asked why the capital should be as much as R200,000. The reply to that in the first place is that the C.S.I.R. is at present dealing with a large number of inventions which will soon be transferred to this proposed Corporation, and the further development of those inventions to the commercial stage will involve heavy costs. Secondly, funds will be required for the urgent patenting of inventions and possibly for litigation, and thirdly it is necessary for the prestige of the Corporation that it should have an appreciable capital.</p>

<p>The Corporation will also be empowered to build up reserve funds, and the reserve funds may only be built up with the approval of the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance. The Bill also provides for the payment, subject to certain conditions, of bonuses or other financial compensation to inventors or discoverers who are officials of the C.S.I.R., the Corporation, State departments or other State-aided bodies. In the case of inventors or discoverers who do not fall in this category, the Corporation is free to negotiate with such inventor or discoverer in regard to the financial participation of the latter.</p>

<p>It is also provided that the C.S.I.R. is not compelled to hand over all its inventions to the Corporation for development. This provision is necessary because it often happens that the C.S.I.R. has to investiage and to develop certain projects at the request of departments such as the Department of Defence. Such projects might be of a secret nature, and if the C.S.I.R. is compelled to hand everything over to the Corporation, a delicate position might arise.</p>

<p>In order not to place the proposed Corporation in a preferential position as against other similar private undertakings which already exist or which may be established, it will be subject to the payment of income tax and to all the provisions of the Companies&#x2019; Act which are not in conflict with the provisions of this Bill. The Corporation will also have to repay to the C.S.I.R. every year such surpluses as may be available after provision has been made for reserve funds in consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance. The possibility that the Treasury, after having made the original financial provision, will be compelled every year to provide the C.S.I.R. with more public funds for the implementation of its work than if the functions which the Corporation will now carry out were to remain with the C.S.I.R., is therefore limited to a minimum.</p>

<p>Finally, a further provision contained in the Bill is that auditors&#x2019; reports and annual reports and all the accounts must be submitted to the Minister of Economic Affairs every year, as in the case of existing State Corporations, who in turn must Table it in the House of Assembly and in the Senate. This provision will ensure the possibility of having Parliamentary control.</p>

<p>These are the salient points of the Bill I am introducing. I understand that hon. members opposite would like us to postpone the discussion of the Bill to a later stage. If <span class="col_1347-1348" refersTo="page_690"/>they should make a suggestion, I will be prepared to accept it. I feel that this Corporation, when established, will be of great benefit to our industry and therefore I have pleasure in moving the second reading.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill is very short. It follows the pattern of other Bills that we have had before the House in previous years. The sole object of the Bill is to increase by two the number of members of the Electricity Supply Commission. which from the beginning has been a minimum of three and a maximum of five. Hon. members will recall that last year we asked for the right, in respect of the Iron and Steel Corporation and in respect of the Industrial Development Corporation, to increase the number of directors by two.</p>

<p>We are now putting forward the same proposal here in respect of the Electricity Supply Commission, and my reason for this proposal is firstly the fact that since its inception this organization has developed so enormously that it is perhaps too much to expect three to five members of the Commission to bear the full responsibility of carrying out this work. If therefore the membership of the Commission is enlarged, as proposed here, to a minimum of five and a maximum of seven members, we believe that it will facilitate the opportunity for a specialization of functions and of responsibilities, with resultant greater efficiency.</p>

<p>I should like to mention a few figures, which may perhaps interest hon. members to place on record the enormous development which Escom has undergone since its inception. In the year 1933, for example, Escom had only four power stations: in 1961 there were 20 power stations. In the year 1933 its capacity was approximately 260,000 kilowatt; in 1961 it was 3,750,000 kilowatt. In the year 1933 its loan capital was R 17,500,000; in the year 1961 its loan capital was R566,000,000. In the year 1933 the number of units sold was 974,000,000; in the year 1961 it was 16,000,000,000. From the figures which I have mentioned here briefly, hon. members will realize what enormous development this commission has undergone in the short period of its existence, a development which has resulted in the consumption of electricity in South Africa being more or less equivalent to-day to the consumption per capita in Western Europe. I think it is a fact of which we in South Africa can be proud that the per capita consumption of the entire population&#x2014;White and Black and Brown&#x2014;is equivalent to the per capita consumption in Western Europe. I would also add that in the next few years great expansion is anticipated in this sphere. We believe that plans which are in operation already will involve an expenditure of R400,000,000 in the next ten years in further expansion of the activities of this Commission. I mention these things only to indicate the scope of the growth and development of the Commission, and to emphasize the necessity of enlarging the directorate, as we usually call it&#x2014;the Commission&#x2014;which now consists of a maximum of five members, to a minimum of five and a maximum of seven.</p>

<p>That is the main provision of this Bill. The other provisions are purely consequential, except for the last few which are only designed to remove certain printing errors which crept into an earlier edition of the Act.</p>

<p>This is a short Bill as the hon. the Minister has indicated, and we on this side can deal with the matter shortly. We are satisfied that the provisions included in this Bill are mainly of an administrative nature and we also accept the statement made by the Minister that the time has come to increase the executive body of this Commission. The Minister has indicated that there is a need, because of the expansion, to provide for a distribution or a delegation of duties amongst members of the board, and we agree that is a reasonable arrangement in a body of this nature. I presume that one of the functions of this delegation will be to ensure that in supplying electricity adequate consideration is given to both country and town. As the hon. the Minister has said, once you have increased the numbers, there are certain consequential alterations which have to be made; they are acceptable to us. As far as the last three clauses are concerned, it is quite clear that they are merely designed to correct printing errors. We will support the second reading of the Bill.</p>

<heading>Language Tests in the Public Service</heading>

<question by="#ross" to="#minister_of_the_interior">

<p>Whether language tests for promotion in the Public Service have been abolished; and, if so, for what reasons.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#Minister_of_the_Interior" to="#ross">

<from>The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:</from>

<p>No, the standard language tests for promotion in the Public Service have not been abolished. In terms of the powers vested in <span class="col_1353-1354" refersTo="page_693"/>it by Section 11 of the Public Service Act, 1957 (Act No. 54 of 1957) the Public Service Commission has, however, decided that officers and contract employees who come into consideration for promotion to posts of which the maximum notches of the salary scales&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) in the case of the Professional Division, do not exceed R3,120 per annum,</li>

<li>(b) in the case of the Technical Division, do not exceed R2,640 per annum,</li>

<li>(c) in the case of the Clerical Division, do not exceed R2,160 per annum, and</li>

<li>(d) in the case of the General A Division, do not exceed R2,160 per annum,</li>

</ol>

<p>be exempted from taking the language tests. The promotion of all officers and contract employees to posts of which the maxima of the salary scales are higher than those indicated above, shall in the future still be subject to the successful completion of the tests.</p>

<p>The reasons for this decision of the Public Service Commission are the enormous turnover of personnel in the junior ranks of the Public Service, the large volume of work entailed in the language testing of officers and the time devoted by senior officers to conducting the tests.</p>

<p>The Commission, however, at the same time laid down the requirement that whenever proposals for the promotion of officers and contract employees, who have not previously passed the standard language tests, are submitted to it, Departments should certify that the relative&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) officers&#x2019; proficiency in the two official languages is adequate for the proper performance of their duties; and</li>

<li>(b) contract employees&#x2019; proficiency in one or both of the official languages is adequate for the proper execution of their duties.</li>

</ol>

<p>In introducing the new arrangement, the Commission stressed that it should not be seen as a relaxation of the requirement that public servants should be proficient in the use of the two official languages, pointing out that no official can be an efficient worker unless he is fully conversant in both these languages. Departments were requested to encourage officials to improve their proficiency in Afrikaans and English at all times to the highest possible level and to maintain it at that level.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>In the last stage of this legislation I should just like to say a few words of blessing for this Bill. There are amendments which the hon. the Minister has not granted us. But it still remains, in essence a good Bill. We send him off to the Other Place with our Bill in his pocket in the hope that the arguments we have raised here will be reconsidered and will weigh with him more seriously in that Other Place. The content of this Bill relates to road safety. One of the methods of producing greater safety is greater control of ingress to and egress from national roads and throughways, both as regards the location of these inlets and outlets and their number. It also permits the board to use their funds to partake in the prior planning of throughways and to enforce compliance with their plans. I have every hope that in future, through the use of these powers, many of our throughways will be safer and that the Board will be able to carry out the objects of this Bill effectively. If that is so, I am sure that many a costly mistake or experiment will be avoided. The hon. the Minister probably knows that in the case of our own Settlers&#x2019; Way and its junction with De Waal drive a strange muddle has taken place. When coming in along Settlers&#x2019; Way from Caledon or the Strand or Hermanus a car or an ambulance cannot turn off the road conveniently to go to Groot Schuur Hospital. It has to go on right through into Woodstock, then turn round and retrace its way back to Observatory. If you want to go out from the Hospital to the same destinations I have mentioned you have to make for Mostert&#x2019;s Mill, then down through Mowbray before you get on to Settlers&#x2019; Way. Now those are faults in planning which I think the Minister had in mind when this Bill was drafted; those are the things that he is trying to avoid in future, if it is at all possible. I see from the Press that the Minister has other suggestions for increasing road safety and reducing accidents on our roads. His idea is to limit speed and use speed traps to eliminate accidents on badly constructed curves such as that one near Groote Schuur Hospital. I hope that he will implore those in charge of the administration <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_695"/>of this new scheme of his to instruct the traffic and speed &#x201C;cops&#x201D; to trap the biggest road hogs of all; to trap, without fear or favour the greatest speedsters of all; to enforce the law against those people who simply shoulder other drivers out of the way and off the road as they shoot along in their luxurious monsters of cars. I refer, of course, to Cabinet Ministers&#x2019; Cadillacs. They are the greatest offenders of our speed laws and should be corrected and controlled. I hope the Minister&#x2019;s own trapping plan will apply to them also.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Since the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) has spoken in this way about speed, I just want to refer him to a statement which appeared in an edition of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>: &#x201C;Speed is not the only killer on the road, says AA.&#x201D; He need not be so concerned therefore about the big Cadillac cars which travel so fast. It is stupidity on the road that causes all the accidents&#x2014;and perhaps slow United Party cars as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is really the basis of road safety. It makes provision for through-ways. I want to ask at once whether the time has come when it is necessary in the Republic of South Africa to make national roads subject to the requirements for throughways and to make them comply with those requirements. I think it is definitely necessary. We must remember that our national roads are really the road arteries for the whole of our transport system. When the arteries of a person become clogged up, he dies. In the same way any country whose road traffic arteries become clogged up, whose road traffic arteries are not planned judiciously, with the result that those arteries become clogged up because of the obstruction caused by injudiciously planned accesses to such roads, finds that its transport system is paralysed.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, but the point I want to make is that this Bill is the basis of road safety. With this basis for road safety. the possibility is created of eliminating these things. I am talking about the effect of this Bill in this connection. In planning our roads we must take into account our heaviest and constant time-saving traffic.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member must come back to the contents of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to say that this Bill makes provision for those things. As far as the contents of the Bill are concerned, we come to the crossings, thoroughfares and accesses over and to these roads which can be controlled under this measure. From the point of view of road safety it is essential that they should be controlled so as to obviate head-on collisions at intersections where roads cross one another at the same level. Those are things that we want to eliminate. The accesses to throughways should be rendered safe so as to facilitate the turning in and out of vehicles on those roads. That is what this Bill provides for. I believe that this Bill will to a large extent eliminate the accidents which continually take place, because this Bill practically complies with the requirements which experiments have already proved necessary in the United States of America, where they ensure safety by means of a traffic island of 150 yards in width in the middle of the road so that approaching vehicles cannot blind the motorist.</p>

<p>In the second instance this Bill provides that there shall be no thoroughfares cutting through the traffic island. In that way it will control the traffic. I say it is essential that we should have the control which is provided for in this Bill. I should like to tell the House why it is essential that there should be control. We find in the report of the S.A. Road Safety Council that there has been an enormous increase in the number of accidents. Let us look at the figures for the past two years. We find that from 1958 to 1959 there was an increase of 6.3 per cent, and from 1959 to 1960 there was an increase of 7.7 per cent. The number of accidents was 116,688; the number of persons killed was 3,051. During the last year there was an increase of 7.4 per cent. The number of persons injured was 39,365, an increase of 9.9 per cent. The number of motor vehicles damaged was 183,965, an increase of 7.8 per cent. This Bill will put an end to that state of affairs to a large extent. It is a measure which is necessary because we must take into account the enormous cost in human lives, in repair bills, etc. Mr. Speaker, when we analyse those accidents &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I do not think it is necessary to analyse the accidents. The hon. member must come back to the contents of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>In conclusion I should like to make this point in connection with this Bill. This is a measure which is designed to promote safety and to save human lives. It is designed to reduce hospital expenses and doctors&#x2019; fees and to alleviate pain and to reduce the number of persons maimed. That is what this Bill deals with. We find that when one person is caught by a shark, all the newspapers are full of it. But nothing is said about it when numbers of people are slaughtered on the road. I do want to point out that this Bill does not provide for the farmer to receive compensation. That was really the great point which the United Party made yesterday. But that is not a matter which should be provided for in this Bill. I shall very much like to associate myself with other members in supporting this Bill.</p>

<p>Since this Bill makes provision for greater safety on our roads, we all welcome it and we welcome it most heartedly. This Bill is going to affect <span class="col_1359-1360" refersTo="page_696"/>more people than we think, as far as their livelihood is concerned, and at this late stage I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to remember, when it comes to the implementation of this Bill, how many people will be affected in their livelihood inasmuch as we are now going to prohibit businesses and the sale of products on our main roads.</p>

<p>We all admit that the main roads of our country are not placed where there should be trading. It is entirely wrong and it also leads to accidents. But there are many of our people, particularly owners of smallholdings living next to main roads who have been selling their products for years along those roads. For years it has been part of their means of livelihood. Many of them have bought pieces of land along main roads with the object of selling what little they produce&#x2014;and it is not much&#x2014;along the roads so as to augment their income. All those people are going to be affected.</p>

<p>There are, of course, people who have grossly misused this privilege. We find that they have erected unsightly structures which to a large extent have blotted out the view of motorists. There are others who have erected small buildings at suitable places, on their own land adjacent to these roads.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill which deals with evidence is not a contentious measure. Moreover, it has been drafted perfectly clearly, and I have not the slightest doubt that it will be heartily welcomed by hon. members on both sides of the House, and particularly by the lawyers. I believe that it will be welcomed, &#x2018; firstly because of the fact that this Bill will facilitate the proving of facts. I believe that it will be welcomed because of the fact that, like the previous Bill that we dealt with here, it will also have the effect of reducing the costs of litigation. And at the same time we will have this assurance, as far as this Bill is concerned, that it will in no way prejudice the fair administration of justice.</p>

<p>This Bill, Mr. Speaker, must be seen against the background of our general rule of law, which, of course, runs like a golden thread through all civilized legal systems, that any person who has knowledge of a fact, must give personal testimony in court about that fact before the court can take cognisance of it. We and the courts are not concerned with how difficult it is and what costs it will involve to bring that person before the court. However indisputable the fact may be, that individual must appear in court personally. It is perfectly clear, of course, why that rule of law exists, and that is that it should be possible to question and, if necessary, cross-examine the person who possesses this knowledge. I say that is the general rule of law. There are exceptions to that rule, as hon. members know, but it is against that background that this Bill should be seen.</p>

<p>As far as this measure which is now before the House is concerned, there is a history attached to it. The principles involved in this measure have been discussed for years in legal circles in South Africa, particularly since 1938 when the British Evidence Act was passed by the British Parliament. As far back as 1953 the Bar Council recommended that the provisions contained in this measure should be submitted to Parliament. The Bar Council&#x2019;s recommendation, which, as I shall show later on, went further than this measure that we have before us now, was referred by the then Minister of Justice to the Law Revision Committee. That Committee considered and debated this matter from all angles, and agreed with the Bar Council that this was a good, sound Bill. It is perfectly clear therefore that the initiative, as far as this Bill is concerned, came from the Bar Council, and the Law Revision Committee also went into it very thoroughly. In 1955 the then Minister of Justice introduced a Bill in this House as a result of the recommendations of the Bar Council and of the Law Revision Committee. Hon. members who were in this House at the time will recall that Bill went further than the present Bill, because for the greater part the present Bill only applies to civil actions, while the 1955 Bill, if it had been passed, would also have been applicable to criminal matters. At that time the Bill covered both civil and criminal matters because that was the attitude of the Bar Council at the time. The matter was then debated here and in the course of <span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_697"/>the second reading debate it became evident that the Bar Council had changed its attitude and that it was then of the opinion that it would not be advisable to make it applicable to criminal matters as well but to confine it to civil cases only. It is some consolation to us as Members of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, that it is not only politicians who change their views, lawyers also do so. We have the position therefore that the Bill with which we are now dealing, except for two small exceptions to which we shall come later on, is only applicable to civil matters and is similar to the British Evidence Act of 1938. Hon. members are aware, of course, that our Act, as far as evidence is concerned, follows the English law, and since our whole system of evidence follows that of the British law, it is not wrong on our part to accept the British lead in this respect as well.</p>

<p>After the debate of 1955 this Bill was again referred to the Law Revision Committee and to the Bar Council. Once again this Bill which is before the House to-day is the product, on the one hand, of discussions held by the Bar Council and, on the other, of the deliberations of the General Law Revision Committee.</p>

<p>The most important provision of this Bill is Clause 2. As hon. members will see when they read this clause, it radically amends the hearsay rule. The hearsay rule, for the information of hon. members who are not lawyers, is of course the rule which provides that the person himself must come and testify and that second-hand evidence cannot be adduced. It is perfectly clear why that should be so. We older people have come to realize that &#x201C;van hooren en zeggen liegt men veel&#x201D; (The repetition of hearsay leads to many lies). It is necessary therefore to hear first-hand evidence in connection with the case. It is clear from this Bill that there are certain departures, and my attitude is that one can have those departures provided there are sufficient guarantees, where it only concerns formalities and facts&#x2014; I say again, provided there are sufficient guarantees&#x2014;that there will be no misuse and that no injustice will take place. I respectfully submit, Mr. Speaker, that this Bill contains sufficient guarantees. In the first place it provides&#x2014;that will be found in Clause 2&#x2014;that the statement sought to be admitted must be one in respect of which the person concerned has personal knowledge, or it must be a statement made by a person in the performance of his duty. Here we are concerned only with formalities. May I give an example. Let us assume that it becomes an issue in a court of law as to whether an hon. member was paired in this House on a certain day. One would then have to follow the very cumbersome procedure of making use of the evidence of the Whip to prove whether the person concerned was in fact paired off or not&#x2014;and one is perhaps a little sceptical sometimes about calling in Whips to come and testify in court! In these circumstances it will be possible simply to produce the pairing-off book as evidence to show that the person concerned was in fact paired off. The book will not, of course, be evidence as to whether the member concerned went where he said he was going. That is a different matter or a different aspect which will not be covered. It will only serve as evidence as to whether he was paired off on a specific day or not. The position is that the person concerned must be called unless he has died or unless he is insane, or unless he is away and cannot be found, or unless he is outside the borders of the Republic. Sub-clause (2) gives the court the right, on application, to admit a statement even if the person concerned is in fact available. If there is any difficulty in connection with the relevant sub-clause, I would suggest that we rather discuss it in the Committee Stage, because we can then have a much more fruitful discussion.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the guarantee that the statement must not emanate from a person who had an interest in the matter himself. Fourthly, it must be in that person&#x2019;s handwriting or signed by him. Fifthly, this Bill provides that the court shall have a discretion as to what inferance to draw from such a document.</p>

<p>Clause 3 speaks for itself. It provides how the court is to determine the weight to be attached to such a document. The advantages of that are self-evident, and I do not want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily at this stage by enlarging upon the advantages. One sees immediately what the advantages of this Bill will be inasmuch as it will make it possible for post mortem reports, log books, meteorological records&#x2014;not the prophecies but simply the records&#x2014;and other technical reports to be produced much more easily before the court.</p>

<p>Clause 4 is self-explanatory. I would just point out to hon. members in passing that it is not applicable to wills, for very good reasons which hon. members will understand. Clause 5 is also applicable to criminal law and it deals only with documents which automatically prove themselves after 30 years, if I may put it that way, and the period is now being reduced to 20 years.</p>

<p>In the main these are the provisions of the Bill which I confidently recommend to this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>We welcome this Bill, and particularly do we welcome the fact that on this occasion we have before us a piece of legislation which certainly cannot be said to have been rushed. The hon. the Minister has told us that it is now no less than seven years ago since a similar Bill was introduced in this House, and before that and since that time the contents of the Bill have been under consideration from time to time by the Law Revision Committee and through the Bar Council. I would like to express the hope to the hon. the Minister that he may be successful where we have failed in persuading his colleagues that if you want good legislation it is a very good thing not to have rushed <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_698"/>legislation. The Bill, as the Minister said, deals with a very important matter. We have the advantage of the English precedent and, as the hon. the Minister says, our law of evidence is based upon the precedent of the English law of evidence, and it is logical, therefore, that we should have regard to the experience in England of a law of evidence which is the same as our own. It would appear that the Bill takes proper care of any possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising, but there are certain points upon which in the Committee Stage we will discuss certain of the provisions of the Bill in more detail to examine whether or not an amendment might be advisable. It is really on this point as to where the person who has signed the document or is a party to it is readily available, the other parties to the case cannot insist on that person appearing as a witness in a case where he queries either the authenticity of the document or the correctness of the information contained in it, which has been certified by the person concerned. Apart from that, we can see only good in this Bill, and as I have already said, it has been the subject of very careful consideration by persons whose whole lives are wrapped up with the question of evidence and the weight to be attached to evidence. In so far as the Opposition is concerned, we therefore welcome this Bill. We believe that except possibly in the one respect I have mentioned, there are, as the Minister has said, adequate safeguards, but we will discuss that in the Committee Stage. But I would say that on the face of it this Bill seems to be a step in the right direction. It will in many cases, I think, save a great deal of unnecessary trouble and thereby cut down expenses and we therefore welcome this legislation.</p>

<p>I only want to add one very small point to what the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has said, and that is that I particularly welcome the fact that the Minister has worked very closely with the General Bar Council in this matter and, indeed, has allowed himself to be guided by that body to the degree he has mentioned in this House. We are hopeful that not only with the General Bar Council but with the Law Society and other similar bodies he will work closely to the profit of all.</p>

<p>I believe that it will be open to abuse. There will be very little opportunity of cross-examination as to where these documents come from. We have heard of forgeries in the past. If a document is put in and purports to be signed by certain persons, what evidence will there be that was in fact the case? I have known of many cases where documents were in fact put in in court cases and the witness who put it in before the magistrate swore that it was signed by certain people, when in fact it was not so signed, and the opportunity was afforded to prove that it was not so signed. I do not understand the necessity for this amending Bill at all. I believe that time has tested the way in which evidence is given in our courts of law. I oppose any change from that tested procedure to which we who have practised for many years have become accustomed. Any deviation from our present system is dangerous and will react to the detriment of the poorer people, who in many cases cannot afford legal representation. They do not know about documents being put in. They do not know their rights and unless the Minister will, in addition to changing this law, also make it a rule that people who cannot afford legal representation shall be given legal representation in order that the import of this type of law should be made clear to them by their legal representatives, I am afraid that many of the people who cannot afford legal representation will experience great difficulty.</p>

<p>I do not want to waste the time of the House since we are all more or less <i>ad idem</i> in connection with this Bill, for the introduction of which I should like to congratulate the Minister most heartedly. I should just like to point out one thing to the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). He says that he is not keen to accept this Bill because he is not keen on anything new and because he likes to stick to those things which have stood the test of time. I submit that it is for that very reason that the hon. member should accept this Bill, because this Bill is the outcome of the findings over a period of time of people who are concerned with these very matters, the Bar Councils and the Law Revision Committees, on which judges also sit. These are the people who have experience of these matters and they have found over the years that it is necessary to introduce a Bill of this nature. It is for the very reason that it has withstood the test of time that I am in favour of these provisions and I want to ask the hon. member for Boland, since that is also his attitude, to give his support to this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, firstly with regard to the observations made by the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) in connection with my relationship with the Bar Council, it is perhaps not inappropriate that I should repeat on this occasion what I also said on another occasion, that as I see it, one of my duties, <i>inter alia,</i> is to be on the most cordial footing with the Bar Council and to attempt to obtain their co-operation at all times. In my discussions with the General Bar Council I made that perfectly clear to them. I also went further, and I feel that I should say this here with reference to the remarks made by the hon. member. I said to the General Bar Council that I should like to co-operate with them at all times and that I should like at all times, if the time and the circumstances permit, to consult with them in respect of all matters which affect the profession directly or indirectly. But I went on to add&#x2014;and the Bar Council understood and appreciated this&#x2014;that naturally I could not allow the Bar Council to dictate to me. Because the responsibility is mine, the decision must also be mine at all times. On that basis I do co-operate with them and I propose to continue to do so.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) is concerned, this Bill, as I said by way of interjection, only relates to civil cases, of course. While the hon. member was speaking I could not help thinking of one of his constituents who found himself with us in the Transvaal. He was always in trouble and he always defended himself&#x2014;and with great success. Probably those are the cases which the hon. member had in mind. But one day he got into serious trouble; he then engaged an attorney to act for him. While the attorney was arguing he noticed that things were going wrong. He then tugged at his jacket and said to him, &#x201C;You had better sit down; you are getting me convicted.&#x201D; In all fairness to the hon. member, I think that is what would have happened to him in this case if he had stated his case as he did here. But to satisfy the hon. member, I can say to him that a very great authority on the law of evidence, Lord Maugham, had this to say in respect of this specific matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During my long time at the Bar I came across a number of cases in which the Evidence Act, 1938, had it been in force, would have been of extraordinary value. I have had cases in which it was necessary to prove reports by engineers as to the value of ore deposits of various kinds, where the reports would have been of extreme value if they could have been put in in evidence. If the engineer was in a distant part of the world at the time of the trial, it might have cost thousands of pounds to produce him as a witness, or it might be quite impossible to procure his attendance.</block>

<p>These particular provisions of the Bill have been in force in Britain since 1938, and I have read or seen nothing which induces me to believe that the provisions of this Bill are unfair or that they will promote injustices of the kind visualized by the hon. member. Like the hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouche, Jnr.) I believe that we should accept the provisions of this Bill as they stand, and I thank hon. members on the other side for their co-operation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Committee of the Whole House on the Provincial Executive Committees Bill have leave to consider the advisability of making provision therein for the removal from office of and resignation by members of Provincial Executive Committees.</block>

<p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept this motion. There are two points here, the removal of members of the Executive Committee, and their resignation. May I deal with the last point first.</p>

<p>It is rather curious that, as far as I can remember, provision is made for a member of the Provincial Council to resign. A member <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_700"/>of Parliament may resign and provision is made for that. A member of the Senate may resign and provision is also made for that, but there is no provision for the resignation of a member of the Executive Committee. It is quite clear that a member of the Executive Committee is entitled to resign, and the usual procedure is for him to send his resignation to the Clerk of the Provincial Council concerned. Sometimes he sends it to the Chairman, but it is suggested that he might send it to the Administrator as being the best method of dealing with the matter. But what I suggest is necessary is that we should be clear on the point and that proper procedure should be laid down providing for an M.E.C. to resign.</p>

<p>Then we come to the first part of the resolution and that is the removal from office of an M.E.C., and here I want to make a special appeal to the Minister because he obviously in the second reading realized that there was a hiatus in the Bill in regard to this particular matter, and he expressed the hope that members of the Executive Committee, if they ceased to represent the majority of members of the Provincial Council concerned, would as honourable men resign, a very fine sentiment, but we are living in a hard, cruel world. These feelings, which do the hon. the Minister credit, perhaps do not go outside the walls of this Chamber. The truth of the matter is that it is a fact that a member of the Executive Committee having been elected, as the law stands and as it is contemplated in the amendment in the Bill before us, it makes no provision for a member of the Executive, having been once elected, to be reduced to another status either as a member of the Provincial Council or as a member of the public (because a member of the Executive is not necessarily a member of the Provincial Council). Under those circumstances it seems to me that it is quite possible that there may be a very small majority for one political party in a Provincial Council, perhaps a majority of just one or two. A by-election takes place and there is a changeover in the majority by one or two. On the principal of winner take all, a party with a majority of one in the Provincial Council will have elected all four members of the Executive, and if as the result of a by-election or for some other reason the majority shifts to the Opposition party, then the members of the Executive having been elected, as the law stands and as it is contemplated in this Bill, those members cannot be unseated. In other words, the majority party brought about as the result of by-elections are not now in the position to take their reward, i.e. to take the four executive seats. It is perfectly true that if parliamentary procedure is to be followed, the Executive Committee could be placed in the position that the Provincial Council concerned, because the Opposition is in the majority, could refuse to vote supplies. But that is not the complete answer. We have had such a proceeding in the history of South Africa. We have had an Administrator who was the sole representative of the Government of the day, and all four members of the Executive, as well as all the members of the Provincial Council, were against him, and all sorts of financial difficulties were placed in his way. But the Government of the day is never likely to be thwarted in carrying on the services of the Province and providing the necessary financial means to that end merely because of what would be looked upon as obduracy on the part of one side or the other in the Provincial Council. When all is said and done, as the law stands to-day. Provincial Councils are creatures of statute and they are limited by the statutes which create them. Sovereignty vests in this Parliament and not in the Provincial Council, and no Government is likely to be thwarted in the financing of the Province by the obduracy of a political party. But there should be no question that when once the majority group in a Provincial Council which has elected the members of the Executive Committee is no longer the majority group but has become the minority, the minority group now having become the majority group it should have the right to insist upon the four members of the Executive getting out and making room for the members to be elected by the new majority. I think provision for that should be made in the law so that the matter will be put beyond dispute and we do not have a fresh kind of trouble developing where members of the Executive Committee may refuse to vacate their seats unless the majority group refuses to vote supplies, with all the troubles that flow from that. Therefore I appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept this motion and to allow us in the Committee Stage to move an amendment which can then be dealt with on its merits.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I second. I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider this very carefully and, indeed, to give it his blessing. I think he will remember that the main argument from his side in regard to the second reading of this Bill was that the present arrangement was something of a constitutional monstrosity. We on this side certainly do not agree with that approach, but at any rate his intention was to tidy it up from the constitutional point of view, and I think most of the hon. members who spoke from his side of the House very definitely emphasized the need to have the Executive Committee responsible to the Provincial Council. That is the very purpose which this motion seeks to achieve, and I therefore hope very much that hon. members opposite will find it possible to support this motion. Naturally one could make more extensive suggestions in regard to improvements or changes in the present arrangement, as now modified, but this is a limited one, it is a simple one, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accept it. I appreciate that he and his party may feel this difficulty that they stand to lose&#x2014;as time passes and as our members grow&#x2014;in three provinces and that they have merely the opportunity to gain by such a change in one. but I am sure he will not be deterred by <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_701"/>that, and I hope sincerely that he will find it possible to accept this.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>At first glance this seems to be a very reasonable and perfectly logical request, as a result of the amendment brought about in this Bill, but it is not as simple as that. Hon. members may regard it as reasonable and they may think that it flows logically from this amendment, but if I were to accept what they are asking for, I would be doing precisely the opposite to what hon. members would like to see, and that is that there should be no interference with the inherent system of provincial government. I think I stated that perfectly clearly in reply to the debate. In Section 84 of the Constitution, as hon. members are aware, a summary is given of the functions of the Provincial Council, and we must not forget that the Provincial Council is not absolutely sovereign in respect of its actions, even under Section 84. I just want to remind hon. members of that fact. For example, it is provided in Section 85 of our Constitution that an Ordinance passed by a Provincial Council is only of force in and for the province as long as and to the extent that it does not conflict with a law passed by this Parliament. I want to show hon. members what their whole argument amounts to. But then the Constitution goes further and under Section 89 even a proposed ordinance passed by a Provincial Council must be submitted by the Administrator to the State President for approval, and subject to certain conditions. I mention this specifically in order to show what this request on the part of hon. members on that side amounts to and that is to convert a system which is not a sovereign federal system into a semi-sovereign system. The three entities in provincial government are entirely separate. The Administrator, who is appointed in terms of Section 66 of the Constitution, is called a chief executive officer who is appointed by the State President&#x2014;in this case by the State President-in-Executive-Council. The Administrator, as the chief executive officer, is entirely separate therefore; the Executive Committee is chosen by the Provincial Council, in terms of Section 97 (1) of the Constitution, to represent the Provincial Council really, together with the Administrator, in the implementation of ordinances. What do hon. members want to achieve? As soon as there is any possibility of its having to be removed in case of a change in the majority, it goes without saying that the Executive Committee is made responsible to the Provincial Council for its work; it is given Cabinet status. It does not became an executive officer. It is really only an executive officer to-day when sitting together with the Administrator. The Administrator-in-Executive-Committee is only charged with the carrying out of the functions entrusted to it by the Provincial Council, and there the Provincial Council&#x2019;s mandate is not that it can call the Executive Committee to account. The Constitution is perfectly clear on this point; and if we depart from the Constitution then I want to sound a warning note here to-day that we are going to meddle with the provincial system and that we are going to convert our provincial system into a semi-federal system and place it on the road towards federalism. In my reply to the second reading debate I stated that was by no means the Government&#x2019;s intention. The Government is not adopting this course to grant more powers and responsibilities, in the first place, to a Provincial Council, which will now have a responsible Executive Committee, and, in the second place, more powers and responsibilities to the Provincial Council than it had formerly. The only reason for these changes is the untenable position in which we place people who have to carry out the decisions of the Provincial Council. And what are the decisions of the Provincial Council? They are decisions of the majority. A majority decision is taken in the Provincial Council. The Provincial Council is not in session and the majority decision has to be carried out by the Executive Committee. How can we expect it to be done in this way? It cannot. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has only quoted half of what I said. He says that I stated that Executive Committee members were decent people and that they would feel that they no longer fit into the picture and that they have to clear out. But I said that there were sufficient checks and balances to keep these people in check so that the situation will not get out of hand. Hon. members can argue as much as they like but let me say unambiguously and very clearly that if we yield here, we shall be yielding to the idea of federalism, and I challenge hon. members on the other side to prove the contrary. If hon. members on that side suggest that federalism is to be the road that South Africa is to follow, after all the blessings that we have had arising from the unity of Union, blessings which we shall continue to have in the Republic, then they are repudiating the whole of our system. I want no part of it, and I shall oppose it with all the strength and power at my command. In the second place it must be perfectly clear that this amendment, as far as the Executive Committee is concerned, represents an improvement from the point of view of the practical working of the Committee. It has nothing to do with the system as such. The cry which has gone up on that side that the minority will no longer be represented, is nothing more than a slogan, but in actual fact this slogan has not even been taken up by the public or by the newspapers. This so-called representation of minorities in a democratic state, or representation of minorities on an executive authority, is something that we find nowhere else. It is a monstrosity, and all that we are doing here is to remove a monstrosity. I can only say with reference to the remarks of the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) that I wish them every success. If they can succeed I hope that they will take over the Executive Committee, and I want to give them the assurance that if there are four National Party Executive Committee <span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_702"/>members then, they will resign and make room for the others. The hon. member for South Coast says that the first part of his motion seeks to make provision for the resignation of Executive Committee members; he then goes on to mention how members of Parliament resign and how Senators resign, while no opportunity is given to an Executive Committee member to resign. The Constitution does not prescribe how a Minister is to resign. The hon. member should at least compare comparable posts and officers with one another; he must not say that on the one hand a Senator may resign and that a Member of Parliament may resign but that no provision is made for the resignation of an Executive Committee member. These are not comparable things, and that portion of the motion does not carry much weight as far as I am concerned therefore. Mr. Speaker, I remain unconvinced. I have given very serious thought to all the implications, and I think it is as plain as a pikestaff that to yield on this point would only mean a retrogressive step in our actual system, as it has existed for 50-60 years, and as praised by hon. members on the other side. I want to ask that we should not meddle with our system but that we should make it practicable for Provincial Councils and for Executive Committees to do their work properly, and that we should create a better opportunity for a responsible Opposition to judge provincial matters properly, without a member of the Executive Committee belonging to the Opposition having to be afraid to take part.</p>

<p>I would like to come now to the Minister&#x2019;s arguments and I would like to say that it is very seldom that I have been able to say of this Minister that his argument is completely illogical. The hon. the Minister was at great pains during the second reading to make it clear to the Opposition that the reason why he was proposing that the election of the members of the Executive Committee should be on the basis of &#x201C;winner take all&#x201D;, was that experience had shown that the system of allowing a minority to be represented in the Provincial Executive Committee led to a completely untenable position, which was not in the interests of the Provincial Council or of the province concerned. The hon. the Minister argued that most earnestly, that it was not to be thought of that you could have a position where an Executive consists of three members from one party and a minority from the Opposition party in the Provincial Council; that it was essential for good government that all of them should come from the governing side, from the side that has the majority. There we disagreed with the hon. the Minister. We said that we believed that the present system had worked well for 50 years. No system can work perfectly. The hon. the Minister has the power to bring about this change because he has the majority of votes behind him, and he made it perfectly clear that the Government was quite determined to bring about this amendment because it was unthinkable that you could allow the existing position to remain in the Transvaal where the United Party minority is represented on the Executive Committee. What we wish to do is merely to carry that to its logical conclusion. Accepting that this is to be the system for the future in South Africa, the object of the hon. member for South Coast is that we should then be consistent and ensure that will be the case throughout. Sir, there is the very famous case which I would like to refer to again&#x2014;I mentioned it earlier&#x2014;of the Provincial Council of the Transvaal where there was a Labour member, one Frank Shaw, I believe, representing the constituency of Krugersdorp. He held the balance of power in that Provincial Council. He was expected to sit with the one group but he did not; he went and sat on the crossbenches and when asked why, he said, &#x201C;I am the Provincial Council.&#x201D; There was a case where the vote of that one person might easily have thrown to the one side or to the other side the majority of the Executive Committee. But suppose that in that case, having been working with one side for a while, he found that he could not hold his allegiance, and he then decided&#x2014;this is an actual case&#x2014;that he wished to support the other side; assuming that he was a member of the Executive Committee on the one side or the other, you had the position that he himself carried the balance. That was the situation in the Executive at that time; that his vote would vitally change the complexion of that Council. The complexion of the Council can be changed by by-elections&#x2014;and we tend to have a lot of Provincial by-elections in this country. As we know a large number of members of this House have come originally from Provincial Councils; having gathered experience there they have come to this Chamber and there are constantly by-elections after Provincial elections, as we have seen in the past week, and as we will continue to see.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Sir, I am seeking to show that there can be a change in the control in the Provincial Council and consequently the situation which the Minister has not envisaged but which we have envisaged could very easily eventuate; it could enable the Provincial Council to change the situation which the hon. the Minister is seeking to obtain through this Bill; it could bring about the situation that even if the one side which had control loses it, it would still control the Provincial Executive, a state of affairs which the hon. <span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_703"/>Minister said would be most undesirable. There is the case of a person changing his political allegiance. Assuming that the party in control of any particular province had all the Executive Committee members, which the hon. the Minister says is desirable, and one of them then changes his political allegiance, it is quite illogical for the Minister to suggest, if you once grant his initial premises that all of them should come from the one side or from the other, that it is wrong to achieve that during the life of a Provincial Council whereas it is right to achieve it at the birth of the Provincial Council immediately after the election. I submit to the hon. the Minister that it is perfectly clear from what he has said here this afternoon that he is, if I may say so with respect, somewhat obsessed with the idea of federalism. I saying to him in all earnestness that this has nothing to do with the question of federalism. It is a question of taking the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own arguments at the second reading and say that if that is to be the system in future, let us see that system will apply throughout the life of a Provincial Council. I do most earnestly hope that the hon. the Minister is going to be prepared on this occasion to agree that this motion can go forward, so that this matter may be debated fully at the Committee Stage, when I hope we will be able to convince him. I can only say that if the Minister is not prepared to do that, then it is obvious that the race federation plan has made a very much bigger impact on the Minister than he would have us believe.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Let me commence by saying that the Opposition should not think at all that they have already made such progress with their race federation idea that they can advance it as an argument for or against the particular motion of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). It is something which is still beyond the horizon. Let us start with the hon. member for South Coast. He has made two points. The one is that no provision is made for resignations and he says that provision for that should be made because there is similar provision in the Constitution for members of the House of Assembly and Senators.</p>

<p>Let me tell him that there were sound reasons why provision was made in the Constitution for members of the House of Assembly and for Senators to resign. The reason is that in those days they were not allowed to hold office under the Crown: a similar provision operates in the House of Commons. Up to to-day there has been no provision in the British system for a member of the House of Assembly or of the House of Commons to resign. But because he cannot hold an office of profit under the Crown, he is appointed to one or other post and the post for which he comes up for consideration is the Chiltern Hundred and I believe he receives one or three pennies per annum. That post has already been in existence for a few hundred years. As soon as he is appointed he loses his constituency. But he is not expected to remain long in that post; he has to vacate that post soon so that it may become available for another member of the Commons who wishes to resign, because the theory is that when your constituency has sent you to Parliament you must do your work. You simply cannot resign. We do not have Chiltern Hundreds in this country, but here too the intention was that once you have been elected you may not resign. That was why provision for resignations had to be made in the Constitution. But that is not the position in the case of the Provincial Council.</p>

<p>As far as the other part of his motion is concerned, I think there is room to differ from the Minister on the question of whether or not it would promote federalism. I can well imagine why the hon. the Minister says that he does not want to effect too many changes to the system at this stage: that one blow is quite enough. During the second-reading debate I said that if it did not happen to-day, it was bound to happen at a later stage and I want to repeat that. I can well imagine, however, why the Minister says that this is an academic matter. Perhaps that is the reason why I like the idea and he does not, namely because it is an academic matter. There are so many factors that can promote what hon. members opposite want, that even though the Minister were not to make the changes, they would still get their way if they were to be privileged in future of winning more elections than they have won hitherto, of if they changed their habit of losing elections, as was their habit last year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you why hon. members will get their way even if this amendment alone is accepted and not what they want. The reason is this: the Provincial Council have to provide the money and if they are not satisfied with the Executive Committee who draft the budget proposals via the Administrator, they refuse to give the money. Furthermore it is also customary that once you have lost the confidence of the Council which has to provide the money, or which has to pass the measures which you have proposed, it is unbecoming to try to keep the reins in your hands. Take our own Constitution. There is nothing to compel Ministers to resign when the governing party loses an election. There is no such provision in the Constitution. But respectable and decent people resign of their own accord. Perhaps it is not so much a question of decency because they know that they will be unable to continue. They will find it impossible to achieve anything, hence they resign. They make a virtue of necessity. The hon. Opposition will therefore get what they want even though the amendment does not go through; even though it is logical what they say namely that the power to appoint also embraces the power to resign. It is true that if the body or the party which gives you the authority to act, falls away and no longer has the right to confer that authority upon you, it simply means that the Executive Committee member who sits there has no authority.</p>

<p><span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_704"/>I now visualize the situation where the National Party has a majority, say, in the Free State and where the Provincial Council majority in the Free State appoint an Executive Committee consisting of Nationalists. They take their authority and title from the National Party majority. If the United Party gets into the majority that Executive Committee no longer has any title or authority. That means that they will not be able to carry on and it also means that just as in the case of the House of Assembly, a convention will come into existence according to which members of the Executive Committee will resign of their own accord when it appears that they no longer have a majority in the Council.</p>

<p>Then a final remark. I think the hon. the Minister is far too scared of a federation, or let me rather put it this way that I think the fear which he harbours is without foundation, because where the Administrator is appointed by the Executive authority &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should like to thank you, Sir, for bringing us back to earth. This motion does not ask us to discuss the question of applying for the Chiltern Hundreds, as we have heard this afternoon, or the merits of the motion. What the hon. member for South Coast is asking in this motion is simply that the House should give leave to carry on the debate which certain members here have initiated. We do not wish to debate it now. We are asking for the permission of the House to debate it. The hon. the Minister has commenced the debate and the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) has carried it on. But this motion does not ask for that, and that is why I am so grateful to you, Sir, for your ruling that we must get back to the motion. This motion simply asks for leave to consider the advisability. At this stage we are simply asking for leave to consider it and not to debate it. We are not debating it now. When the time comes to debate it, then I think these arguments advanced by the hon. the Minister will be relevant. But at the moment they are not relevant. At present we are simply discussing whether we may debate the merits of a very good suggestion made by the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

You, Sir, quite rightly call members to order when they depart from this motion. They are therefore restricted in this debate in fully stating the case for the necessity of amending this Bill. If the Minister will allow us to move our amendments to this Bill, we could then go into this very question fully. As I say, at the moment, we are restricted in our arguments. Sir, the Minister who has built up a reputation as a logical debater, has fallen down badly to-day; his reputation has been ruined.

<p>I should like to give one reason as to why the House should not grant the leave which is sought in this motion and that is that I think the change which is asked for cannot be reconciled with the Constitution as it stands to-day, and that creates a whole set of problems. I want to refer hon. members to sub-section (5) of Section 76 of the Constitution. It is in pursuance of that sub-section that I maintain that if leave were granted to effect this change, it would be necessary to effect a number of other changes to the Constitution. That is the reason why I submit that the House should not grant leave because it is irreconcilable with the remainder of the South African Act. The relevant section to which I am referring reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>In regard to this Bill now before the House, I want to say that the position is that the only protection of names, uniforms and coats-of-arms was afforded by the Protection of Names, Uniforms and Badges Act of 1935, which is the only South African legislation in regard to heraldry which has hitherto been passed by our Parliament. The above-mentioned Act is limited to the registration of the names, uniforms and coats-of-arms or badges in respect of associations and institutions (and under the last-mentioned should be understood educational institutions like schools, technical colleges and universities) and it leaves out of account the large sphere of official, municipal and private coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems. In order to bridge this gap, liberal use was made in the past of the services of the College of Arms (also called the Heralds&#x2019; College) in London.</p>

<p>In order to find a way out what was regarded as an unsound state of affairs, die SuidAfrikaanse Akademie vir Kuns en Wetenskap appointed an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, with Prof. G. H. T. Malan as convener, which reported on 4 May 1951 and in which it was recommended that South Africa should have its own authoritative Office of Heraldry. This standpoint was fully supported at a conference at which the Akademie vir Kuns en Wetenskap and all interested Government Departments and the four Provincial Administrations, as well as the Administration of South West Africa were represented, and which was held under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science at Pretoria on 12 September 1955. Thereafter the then Minister of Education, Arts and Science appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of Prof. A. N. Pelser, to investigate the basis on which the Office of Heraldry should be established. This committee submitted its report to the Minister on 27 December 1956 in which they came to the conclusion that it was inconceivable and untenable that a sovereign independent State like South Africa (including the Territory of South West Africa) should be dependent on foreign channels in regard to heraldic matters, and it recommended that as soon as circumstances allowed of it the Government should establish a Bureau of Heraldry and that the necessary legislation should be passed by Parliament. The present Bill is intended to give effect to the recommendation of this last-mentioned committee. From the very nature of the case, the matter has become even more urgent since we became a Republic on 31 May 1961.</p>

<p>The object of the Bill is to provide for the <span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_707"/>approval, award, registration and protection of coats-of-arms, badges, flags, penants, banners and other matters of an heraldic nature. The provision being made is not only for official purposes, but also for purposes of local Government bodies. For the sake of brevity I shall in future refer to these local Government bodies, jointly or individually, as municipal institutions. The proposed provision is being made also in respect of associations and institutions and includes historical and other family badges.</p>

<p>The Bill further aims at amending the Protection of Names, Uniforms and Badges Act of 1935 in order to fill gaps which were left in that Act and to bring it into line with the provisions of this Bill and with present-day changed circumstances and requirements.</p>

<p>In the final instance this Bill affects the terrain which, until the date of our becoming a Republic, belonged to the prerogative of Her Majesty the Queen. These prerogatives passed over to the State President when we became the Republic of South Africa in terms of the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act, 1961, Sec. 7 (4) (Part III) which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition, the State President as Head of the State has the same powers and functions as the Queen had by way of prerogative immediately before the coming into operation of this Act.</block>

<p>Closely connected to the afore-mentioned prerogative powers, sub-sec. (1) of Sec. 2 of this Bill clothes the Head of State with the higher heraldic powers, viz. the grant or amendment of official coats-of-arms, badges, and other emblems, due consideration being had to the legal provisions in regard to the grant or amendment of such coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems.</p>

<p>In terms of sub-sec. (3) of the same section, similar powers are placed in the hands of the Administrator of any Province, including South West Africa, acting on the advice of the Executive Committee, in respect of the grant or amendment of municipal coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems, all of a local nature.</p>

<p>Sub-sec. (5) of Sec. 2 contains a very important provision, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem shall not be granted or amended in terms of sub-section (1) or (3) and the adoption of a coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem or any amendment thereof in terms of any law shall not be approved before the design or amended design thereof has been approved by the Council (of Heraldry).</block>

<p>I shall revert in a moment to this provision in regard to the Council, to wit, the Council of Heraldry.</p>

<p>In connection with the Bill, I shall first deal with the establishment of the Bureau of Heraldry. Before South Africa became a Republic the prerogative powers in regard to heraldry rested with Her Majesty the Queen, and such powers were exercised by Her Majesty on the advice of her Ministers in the Union through the medium of the College of Arms in London. The last-mentioned royal institution also played an appreciable role in other respects in the history of coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems in South Africa.</p>

<p>In Sections 3 and 6 provision is now being made for the establishment of a Bureau of Heraldry, which will be assisted by a Council of Heraldry, to handle all the matters in respect of heraldry which were formerly handled for South Africa by the College of Arms, and to perform all the other duties entrusted to it in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>I should like to state that it is envisaged that sound relations will be maintained as far as possible with the College of Arms, and the establishment of maintenance of good relations with The Lord Lyon King of Arms of Scotland, the Hoge Raad van Adel of Holland and other heraldic institutions on the Continent of Europe. I want to emphasize that now that we have reached our majority we do not consider that we know everything, but that we would still like to have the closest relations with these world-famous institutions.</p>

<p>The main object of the Bureau of Heraldry, assisted in the way I have mentioned, will or should at all times be not only the faithful observance of the general rules and principles of the heraldic signs when carrying out the various duties and activities entrusted to it in terms of this Bill, but in their application, as far as possible, to develop in a direction of our own which will breathe a genuine South African spirit. For that we need, in the first place, a State Herald.</p>

<p>Section 4 provides for the appointment of a State Herald as Head of the Bureau of Heraldry.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that the candidate must be well acquainted with the general principles of heraldry, particularly as applied in the United Kingdom and on the Continent of Europe, he should also have a sound academic training, and not only will he have to have a sound knowledge of both official languages and in addition he should have a sound knowledge of Nederlands, German, French and Latin. We hope to be able to find such an eminent person. It is essential that he should be an eminent person and a very educated man.</p>

<p>Then we have the Council of Heraldry. Section 6 provides for the institution of a Heraldry Council, consisting of the State Herald and at least six other members.</p>

<p>In terms of the recommendations of an <i>ad hoc</i> committee which was appointed some years ago to report on the desirability of the establishment of a Bureau of Heraldry in South Africa and its composition, it is intended to nominate members of this Bureau on the basis of their particular knowledge and experience <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_708"/>of and their interest in heraldry, whilst at least one of the members should be an experienced historian, one should be an art connoisseur and the other should be a lawyer.</p>

<p>Pargraph (b) of Section 25 provides that such allowances will be paid to members of the Bureau who are not in the service of the State, as may be determined in consultation with the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>As already stated, no coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem shall be granted or amended by the Head of State or by the Administrator concerned, as the case may be, and the adoption of a coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem or an amendment of it in terms of an Act will not be approved before the design or amended design thereof has been approved by the Council of Heraldry. The Bill contains more or less similar provisions for the registration of all coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems, including historical and other family coats-of-arms, but suffice it if I quote Section 6 (2) (b)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The functions of the Council shall be to&#x2014; <br/>(b) approve for the purposes of this Act the design of any coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem and any amendment of the design of any registered coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem.</block>

<p>Here we undoubtedly are dealing with the most important function of the Council. Another function is the giving of advice in connection with heraldic and related matters to the Minister and to the Administrator of any Province or of South West Africa, as provided in paragraph (a) of the above-mentioned sub-section.</p>

<p>The other functions of the Council are clear from the relevant provisions. Mention need only be made of the provisions contained in Sections 9 and 11, in terms of which the Council is authorized to investigate and to decide on any objections lodged against any decision by the State Herald, or which are lodged in connection with the registration of any coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem.</p>

<p>Appeal can be lodged&#x2014;this is important&#x2014; against any such decision with the Minister or, in the case of South West Africa, with the Administrator, and the decision of the Minister of the aforesaid Administrator is final in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 13.</p>

<p>The most important part of the functions of the Heraldic Bureau is undoubtedly the registration of coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems. In the first place it comprises the entries in the register on request, as provided for in Section 5 (a), namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The coat-of-arms of the Republic, the National Flag of the Republic, the coats-of-arms of the Provinces (including the coat-of-arms of South West Africa) and any other coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem instituted, constituted or created by any law, and any amendment thereof effected by any law. In other words, we are absolutely certain that, firstly, these coats-of-arms, badges and emblems which are prescribed by law must be registered. That cannot be omitted under any circumstances.</block>

<p>The coats-of-arms, badges and emblems prescribed by law are entered into the register just like that.</p>

<speech by="#von_moltke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>My question to the hon. the Minister is whether those coats-of-arms, badges or emblems must comply with the heraldic laws?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I say very clearly that when an amendment has to be made, and if the State Herald says that the heraldic laws are contravened by these coats-of-arms, badges and emblems, flags or banners, then they must be amended, but he is compelled to register them as they stand in the laws. To mention one example, take the orange tree of the Free State. The Free State says it is an olive tree; it is nevertheless registered as an orange tree. It may be amended, but until such time as it is amended we accept that it is an orange tree. It is depicted there with oranges on it.</p>

<p>Further, Mr. Speaker, I should mention the registration of all coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems to which the Heraldic Council has given its approval, to wit, the following categories&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) Official coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems granted or amended on request by the Head of State in terms of the legal provisions regarding the granting or amendment of such coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems (Section 2 (1);</li>

<li>(ii) Municipal coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems granted or amended on request by the Administrator of any province or of South West Africa, acting on the advice of the Executive committee concerned, in terms of the legal provisions affecting the granting or acceptance or amendment of such coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems (in terms of Section 2 (3));</li>

<li>(iii) Coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems registered on request in terms of Section 5 (b), (c) and (d), which include also those of associations and institutions, and historical and other family coats-of-arms.</li>

</ol>

<p>We can now pause for a moment to deal with the provisions in regard to the coats-of-arms, badges and emblems of associations and institutions, and then we can deal with historical <span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_709"/>and family coats-of-arms. In regard to associations and institutions, the present Bill in this respect replaces the provisions contained in the Protection of Names, Uniforms and Badges Act, 1935 (Act No. 23 of 1935), and the latter Act is accordingly amended by Section 26, which at the same time provides for any necessary adaptations and additions. The attention of the House is directed particularly to the provision made in terms of paragraph (e) for a transfer under certain circumstances, as is customary, of certain ministerial powers under the old Act to the State Herald. In this way a very serious hiatus, to which Act No. 23 of 1935 was subjected, is now being filled. It was just an impossible task. Nothing happened; there was no person responsible. Departmentally and administratively nothing could be done and consequently the registration or the amendment of any emblem of an association or organization, of schools, for example, and of educational institutions simply was not done.</p>

<p>The second matter concerned historical and other family coats-of-arms. I think this Bill now supplies a need which has long been felt. I hope that we shall now in future be able to put a stop forever to that unhealthy practice of the hawking of family coats-of-arms, just as in years gone by we had the hawking of photographs. Hon. members will remember how in years gone by photographs were sold at high prices on the platteland, photographs which were not always even a good likeness of the relative concerned. In the second place it will serve to preserve the cultural value of our old historic family coats-of-arms&#x2014;those of Dutch, German, French, British and other origins&#x2014;for the present and for future generations by providing that they can be registered and duly protected, for which this Bill makes proper provision.</p>

<p>The Bill refers, in para, (c) of sub-sec. (1) of Section 8, and in para, (b) of Section 14 to &#x201C;an historical or other family coat-of-arms&#x201D;. Now, by &#x201C;other family coats-of-arms&#x201D; we understand a family coat-of-arms of more recent or modern origin. The requirements of modern society make such a provision necessary. Without it the Bill would be incomplete in this respect. In determining the tariffs of fees for the rendering of services, which is provided for by Section 25 (f), care will be taken as far as possible. This provision is not abused.</p>

<p>I also want to draw attention to another aspect, namely the inheritance of family coats-of-arms. After mature consideration it has been decided that in view of the heterogeneous nature of historical and other family coats-of-arms in our country, the system of inheritance, as practised on the Continent of Europe, should be regarded as the most acceptable to South Africa, including South West Africa. Consequently Section 14 (b) provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A registered historical or other family coat-of-arms shall be the inalienable property of a person in whose name it has been registered and of his family and may lawfully be used during his lifetime or after his death as a family coat-of-arms by any person who is able to produce proof that he is a member of the said person&#x2019;s family by lawful blood relationship, descent, marriage or adoption and that he bears the same family name.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister? Many of our Afrikaans surnames are to-day spelt differently from the original spelling. Will a person who can prove that he belongs to a certain family, despite the fact that he spells his surname differently, still be entitled to use the family coat-of-arms of that family?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is quite clear. If he can prove that he is related by lawful blood relationship, descent, marriage or adoption and that he bears the same family name, he can use the family coat-of-arms. The spelling does not matter so much; of course, we have simplified everything.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have already mentioned the fees which will be payable for purposes of registration. Complete tariffs of fees to be levied by the Bureau of Heldry for the rendering of various services are in the course of preparation. The drafting of the necessary regulations is also receiving the attention of my Department, and these regulations, including the tariffs of fees to be levied, will be tabled in due course.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to draw attention to the fact that all coats-of-arms, badges and other emblems registered with the proposed Bureau of Heraldry in terms of the provisions of this Bill will be thoroughly protected by way of civil as well as criminal legal procedure. Section 21 provides for civil cases and anybody who makes misuse of any coat-of-arms, badge or other emblem which is registered in the name of an official or municipal authority, association, institution or person can be sued in a court of law for a maximum amount of R50, or for damages or an interdict, or for both damages and an interdict. Section 22 provides for a penalty in respect of the misuse of an official or municipal coat-of-arms, and on conviction such a person is punishable by a maximum fine of R400, while Section 23 provides that anyone who deliberately makes himself guilty of fraud in respect of any registration with the Bureau of Heraldry can be punished on conviction by the imposition of a maximum fine of R200, or on default of payment by imprisonment to a maximum of one year. I think we have all had experience of this. I am thinking, for example, of my student years, when I regarded my property as my own and it could not be touched by anybody else. Here we now have an attempt to deal with those who contravene the law. I am convinced that the passing of this Bill will be rendering a great service to our country in the sphere of <span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_710"/>heraldry, and that thereby we shall also give further proof of our independence, and that we are not shouting &#x201C;Bravo!&#x201D; and in our inexperience trying to do everything ourselves, but that we will make use of the good services of the heraldic institutions of the United Kingdom and of the Continent of Europe which always assisted us in the days when we did not as yet have our own institution.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say right at the outset that we on this side of the House welcome this legislation. To South Africa this is an entirely new subject. It is a subject of very wide scope but also one of very great importance. In my opinion it will have a great influence on our national life and on our awareness of nationhood. I am pleased therefore that the hon. the Minister has devoted his attention more particularly to the South African circumstances; that he has viewed and approached this matter in its broad outlines in so far as it affects our country. Since this is the first time that a Bill such as this is placed before the House and before the people of South Africa, I think we should consider it both from the National and international angle. With your approval therefore, Mr. Speaker, I propose to approach this matter from a somewhat wider angle than the Minister did.</p>

<p>There are many people in this country who say that this Bill and its aims smack of snobbery. They say that we are trying to prove that we are the descendants of great figures of the past or of prominent leaders of the past. As one scoffer put it, &#x201C;this kind of snobbery has kept heraldry alive&#x201D;. Here we might also refer to Grey&#x2019;s Elegy where he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,<br/>And all that beauty, all that wealth e&#x2019;er gave <br/>Awaits alike the inevitable hour:<br/>The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</block>

<p>While that is how some people feel, I must say at once that I do not agree with them. It is said that we are tending more and more to demonstrate our own dignity, our own importance. The mocker also likes to point out that while we have abandoned the titles of &#x201C;Sir&#x201D;, &#x201C;Lord&#x201D; and &#x201C;Baron&#x201D; in our country, the number of people with the title of &#x201C;honourable&#x201D;, &#x201C;right honourable&#x201D;, &#x201C;advocate &#x201D;, and &#x201C;doctor&#x201D; is steadily growing. That reminds me of the story which the late Mr. Langenhoven told of the occasion when he was walking up Adderley Street and spotted a friend across the road. When he called out &#x201C;doctor&#x201D;, half the people in the street looked around! It is said that we are not satisfied with this either and that we now feel that we must again introduce something else to prove precisely who and what we really are. That is alleged to be the reason why we are introducing heraldry! It may be interesting, Mr. Speaker, to tell you the story about a typist, just to show how little our people know about heraldry. When something was dictated to her recently about &#x201C;heraldry&#x201D; she wrote &#x201C;Harold&#x201D; and then &#x201C;dick&#x201D;. She thought that some person was being discussed.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has so clearly explained to us, associated with heraldry there is all the machinery of it, namely the herald, the Heraldry Council and the granting and refusal of coat-of-arms, badges, etc.; but whatever the position may be, in South Africa heraldry is a limited science. It is practically an unknown science, and in my opinion the Minister will have difficulty in appointing even his council of &#x201C;at least seven members&#x201D; from the ranks of qualified people with sufficient knowledge. I personally know of only half a dozen of our people who are acquainted with heraldry, who know the science, but at the same time I want to add, as he himself also indicated, that he will have no difficulty in appointing his Director or Chief Herald. He has sufficient experts from whose ranks he will be able to make his choice.</p>

<p>I have no great knowledge of the science itself but I have some knowledge of its history. Coats-of-arms, badges and emblems originated in the early years as practical symbols or signs in the struggle or battle, and it was only as from the seventeenth century that we began to fit in and to adapt heraldry to modern life and brought it under control. Heraldry formed part of the civilization of the Middle Ages and the pre-Middle Ages, in Western Europe and in England and particularly after the fall of the Roman Empire, and was, and still is, known particularly in countries like England, France, Holland, Ireland, Scotland. It also spread to the East, as the hon. the Minister probably knows, to India and recently even to Japan.</p>

<p>As far as its aims are concerned, it is interesting, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;and you will permit me to refer to it&#x2014;to hear what the old writers said in connection with this matter, and here I should like to quote from Sir William Dug-dale&#x2019;s book, &#x201C;The Ancient Usage in Bearing of Arms&#x201D;. In this book which was published in 1681 he says the following, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That these Ensignes of Honour, as are commonly called Arms, which of later time have been chiefly used for distinctions of families, had the original from the practice of treat commanders in war, is not unknown to the learned; for certain it is that the faces of all great military officers being obscured by such Hoods and Helmets as were anciently worn in times of Battle; it was expedient, that by some other means their persons should be notified to their friends and followers. Necessity, therefore, requiring it, they depicted upon their shields (which were borne for the defence of their bodies), as also upon their Surcoates of Silke, Banners, Penons, etc. certain Badges, that might make them known at a distance from each other &#x2026; In bearing <span class="col_1389-1390" refersTo="page_711"/>whereof (as appeareth by divers old Rolls of Armes) such order was observed that none might assume another&#x2019;s marks; but that there should be a plain and apparent difference in each man&#x2019;s Shield, Surcoat, Banner, Penon, etc. to the end that upon any disorder the common souldier might know his leader, and the better repair to his succour in case of danger &#x2026; But these later times having devised other sorts of armour and weapons both for offence and defence than of old were used; those marks and badges of Shields, Surcoates etc., have been for divers past ages, as to any such military purpose, totally layed aside; and since merely retained as honourary Ensignes by the Nobility and Gentry, especially to difference themselves and their families from the vulgar and from one another; as also to distinguish the collateralls from those of the principal stock, for if they do not so, what do they signify; or of what use are they? In all of which the Kings of Arms in their respective provinces were to see due order observed.</block>

<p>There we have the basis for the origin of coats-of-arms. Another writer poses this question &#x201C;Why were coats-of-arms conceived or discovered?&#x201D; He then replies to the question himself: &#x201C;It is to be able to distinguish one man from another&#x201D;. That was practically the basis of what we have here to-day.</p>

<p>A word or two now about granting coats-of-arms. The Minister has pointed out that, because we are in such close touch with England, Holland and other countries, but particularly with England, and because such a large section of our population still has close cultural links with England and also originates from England, it is necessary for us to see how the control over the acquisition of coats-of-arms originated, particularly in England. On that point historians are not clear at all. The Minister has correctly said that the ruler or the King could award coats-of-arms, and that he alone could do so, but then we also read in other historical works&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every Knyghte Chefteyn in the feldt may make a cotearmure Knyghte.</block>

<p>It is clear therefore that arms could also be granted under other circumstances then we also read the following in other old writings&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A crysten man overcomying a crysten man fyghtynge in the lyste shalle bere a cote-armure of hym that is overcomn.</block>

<p>A person who defeated another in battle could take over his coat-of-arms and appropriate it for himself.</p>

<p>I am not dealing with &#x201C;Kaffirs&#x201D; now.</p>

<p>Then we come to a fourth possibility&#x2014;and these are all things with which the Minister and his Council will have to deal&#x2014;and that is that there was also a fourth category as far as coats-of-arms are concerned, that is to say, those who simply awarded themselves a coat-of-arms. At that time it was recognized by law because they said that if one could choose a name for oneself, why not also a coat-of-arms which goes with that name? What I am trying to prove, however, is that there were different ways in which coats-of-arms could be granted, and in the main it amounted to this that it was done for practical purposes, but not only for practical purposes. It was also done to obtain booty or status, and it was only later on that the whole procedure in awarding arms was placed under strict supervision. That is why it is necessary to refer to the College of Arms of London, which was established as far back as 1484. But in France there was a College of Arms as far back as 1407 and that is why so many of the names, to which I want to come back later on, to be found in heraldry are French names. I should like to urge upon the Minister at this early stage that he should change those terms and words and that we should use present-day English or Afrikaans terms.</p>

<p>It was only in the fifteenth century that the heralds were converted into a college, the College of Arms of London and others, and that the necessary control could be exercised over coats-of-arms. And here I come back once again to England. Although there had been confusion previously, as I have already shown, the system which the Minister has set out here gradually developed; in other words, the control was transferred entirely into the hands of the ruler or King. This is what James Frere of the London College of Arms wrote in 1954 in a letter&#x2014;and this is important because I think the Minister has to some extent followed what he says in our legislation, but not entirely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The important thing for everyone to realize is that the matter of arms is not a Government or national one, but a personal matter for the Queen, who does it either by the direct method of a royal licence, or by delegated authority to household servants&#x2014; never through government channels.</block>

<p>In England the State is entirely divorced from heraldry, and so is politics, and that is why I want to congratulate the Minister on the fact that in Clause 2 particularly, as well as in other clauses, he is placing the control in the hands of the President, who has now taken the place of the King in South Africa.</p>

<p>But there is another thing I have noticed. In Clause 13 this Bill gives the right of appeal against a decision of the Council to the &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;. Here the hon. the Minister is introducing the &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;, and it is precisely in this respect that he is departing from the system as we know it and from the system from which he has borrowed so much.</p>

<p><span class="col_1391-1392" refersTo="page_712"/>Heraldry no longer has the practical value to-day that it had formerly and to-day the main duty, the main function, as the Minister put it, of the herald or of the Council or, in this case, of the President&#x2014;I hope that the Minister is going to delete this provision for an appeal to the Minister and I shall not mention his name therefore&#x2014;is not so much the granting of coats-of-arms really but rather, firstly, to ensure that one person does not take another person&#x2019;s coat-of-arms, that he does not appropriate another person&#x2019;s coat-of-arms for himself; secondly, to ensure that coats-of-arms are correctly designed and, thirdly, that coats-of-arms which are wrongly designed are put right, and then there will be a fourth function in this country and that is to ensure that coats-of-arms which have not yet been granted may be awarded to individuals or families.</p>

<p>Together with the herald, there came into being the family tree, particularly in Ireland. Since the Minister is now introducing this Heraldry Bill, an excellent Bill, I am very sorry that he has not made use of this opportunity to make provision also for the institution of a family register or a family tree.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am thinking more of a family tree of families, of individuals, such as the genealogical register of the Vosters. Why should the Vosters have a coat-of-arms only? Together with the coat-of-arms there should also be this family register. I went through one the other day, the family register of one of our Members of Parliament dating back to the fifth century and giving the history of each of his forefathers. That is what we want here. That should be accompanied not only by the person&#x2019;s coat-of-arms, but also the history of his forefathers. It is that sort of thing that will make us proud of our forebears and of our past. And the Minister must not ask the question that I can see he wants to ask! Leave it alone! [Laughter.]</p>

<p>Heraldry, as the Minister has also said, only began to be valued in Europe and in our country with the growing awareness of nationhood, and it is because we in the Republic are also beginning to realize the value of what is our own and developing the idea of honouring and retaining as a treasure everything that is our own, that this legislation is so very necessary.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with something entirely different now, and you, Sir, would rule me out of order if I replied to that question.</p>

<p>A coat-of-arms is a symbol of which the individual and the family, the business undertaking, the city or town and particularly the nation can be proud, and it is a symbol that will form part of its sense of nationhood.</p>

<p>In connection with this matter it is interesting to read what the practice was even in the eighteenth century. Now that the Minister of Justice has interrupted me he will forgive me, if I may use an anglicism, if I pull his leg for a moment (&#x201C;sy been effens trek &#x201D;)! It was laid down even in the eighteenth century that no attorneys or lawyers could wear arms, or that arms could not be granted to them, because they were regarded as &#x201C;rascally&#x201D;. [Laughter.] But here the Minister of Education can make an exception so that in the future we can honour even attorneys!</p>

<p>In my opinion this Bill is defective in a few respects that I should like to deal with, but before doing so there is something else that I want to say. I have said that under this Bill coats-of-arms will have to be given to people who have no coats-of-arms at present, and it is a good thing that we should give them coats-of-arms so that their descendants in 100 or 200 years&#x2019; time can have coats-of-arms of which they will be proud, particularly when it is accompanied by the family tree. I should like to discuss a few other aspects with the Minister. I should like to deal firstly with coats-of-arms which already exist and which are wrong heraldically. The Minister mentioned one such coat-of-arms, that of the Orange Free State. Everybody has accepted that it is an orange tree, but it should be an olive tree. What are we going to do about it? In my opinion, we would be doing the wrong thing if we changed it. By prescription it has acquired the right to exist. Heraldically it remains wrong, but historically it is acknowledged as the coat-of-arms of the Free State. Similarly, you will find hundreds if not thousands of coats-of-arms which pedlars sold to families and which are wrong heraldically.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>If we want to correct the design, very well, but it will take years before we shall be able to correct the designs of all of them.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the names which are used in heraldry. The Minister knows that in the English heraldry, for example, &#x201C;sable&#x201D; means black. In Netherlands it is &#x201C;sabel&#x201D;. &#x201C;Ore&#x201D; or &#x201C;yellow&#x201D; means gold. &#x201C;Argent &#x201D; or &#x201C;white&#x201D; means silver. &#x201C;Azure&#x201D; means blue, and &#x201C;Vert&#x201D; means green, etc. I repeat that I trust that the Minister will replace those names with typical English or Afrikaans names so that we will all be able to understand them.</p>

<p>Then another matter. I think we in South Africa are not sufficiently proud of the deeds or the positions of our great men. We do not give sufficient recognition in South Africa to the rank of our prominent men, men who have played some role in South Africa. I am thinking of our President, for example. He occupies a very important position and he <span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_713"/>should receive recognition for it, and his family or his descendants ought to receive recognition for the exalted position occupied by this forefather of theirs. We shall have to think of something that can be inscribed on the arms of our President or of a prominent person like the Prime Minister so as to indicate that he occupies a certain position in society. This is a matter which will have to receive our serious attention. Another matter for which the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Bill does not make provision is a combination of coats-of-arms. As you know, Sir, a man&#x2019;s coat-of-arms is on a shield, but a woman&#x2019;s coat-of-arms is depicted in the shape of a diamond. There are cases where families desire combinations of coats-of-arms, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will make provision for such a combination of coats-of-arms where a husband and wife would perhaps like to leave their family and their descendants a combined coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>Before I come to the final point that I want to deal with I want to refer to the seat for the Bureau. The Bill does not provide where this seat of this body, this College of Heraldry, will be. Cape Town is our oldest city, but I realize that it may prove to be impracticable to have the seat of the Bureau in Cape Town. I would also suggest that in a vast country like South Africa there should not be one herald only but that we should also institute provincial heralds who can deal with all the cases in a province before they go to the Central Bureau.</p>

<p>Another thing that is lacking in South Africa is that the granting of arms is accompanied by too little ceremonial. When arms are granted to a city or to a person I should like to see that it is accompanied by due ceremony and not only a registered document. I should like to refer here to what happened in Cape Town on the occasion of the granting of the first coat-of-arms to a local authority in South Africa. This happened in 1804. Mr. Speaker, you will forgive me if I first read out the description that was given in English in 1900 and then the original description in 1804. This document is to be found in the Archives and in the library and there is also one in the archives of the City Council. In the year 1900 the then mayor has this to say about it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As you are aware, a grant of arms was made by the Commissioner-General, J. A. de Mist, on 12 June 1804 just 96 years ago, upon the request of the Burgher Council. The original grant has been carefully preserved and is now before you, and I also have here extracts from the <i>Kaapsche Courant</i> of 7 and 14 July 1804 giving a most interesting description of the manner in which the City Council of the time celebrated the day upon which the newly-acquired coat-of-arms was displayed in public. The presentation of arms was made in the Council Chamber with due ceremony shortly after 9 o&#x2019;clock in the morning of Tuesday, 3 July 1804 by the Commissioner-General, J. A. de Mist, in the presence of Gen. Janssens, Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and other notables, and it is mentioned that their arms were displayed within the Council Chamber and outside the Town House &#x201C;to the sound of trumpets and other music&#x201D;. We are also told that in the afternoon of the same day the City Council gave a splendid banquet at which the Commissioner-General, the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, the members of the Council of Polity, with their secretaries, as also all the presidents of the various constituted powers, the Commander of the Troops, many chiefs of Corps and heads of administration, the clergy of the City and many officials were present &#x2026; While in the evening the Town House was brilliantly illuminated&#x2014;the immense crowd of spectators assembled in the market square&#x2014;adding not a little to the effect of this impressive day which went off, we learn, to everyone&#x2019;s satisfaction.</block>

<p>What is interesting is the description at that time of the handing over of our first coat-of-arms to our capital. I now quote from the<i>Kaapsche Courant</i> of 7 July 1804&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">De dag van Dinsdag den 3 dezer was een plegtige dag voor deze Stad en haare Inwoonders&#x2014;tot nog toe had ze geen bepaald Wapen gehad&#x2014;het was voor de Commissaris Generaal Mr. J.

<speech by="#von_moltke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steen-kamp) whole-heartily on the excellent speech he has made on this subject, because when I rose in this House years ago and pleaded that such a Bureau of Heraldry should be established for our fatherland, I was ridiculed throughout the country; and now we have the Bill before us and I am grateful for the manner in which the Minister has explained the Bill and for the manner in which the Opposition has taken part in the debate.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words but I should like to have them on record. The position is not, as some writers maintain, that heraldry is a form of snobbishness; that is not so. When you buy a race horse you want to know its pedigree; when you buy a merino ram or a karakul ram you want to know its pedigree. When you buy a Friesland bull from the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) you want to know its pedigree. It is not snobbishness therefore. The truth of the matter is that the Afrikaner nation&#x2014;and I am talking about the Afrikaans-speaking Afrikaner in particular&#x2014;place great value on their family, on their descent, on their land or origin. You can enter practically any humble home in the bushveld to-day, it makes no difference whether the man&#x2019;s surname is Koekemoer or Van der Bijl or Van der Merwe or Vermeulen, and you will find that he has a coat-of-arms; and that is the product of hawking. Those products do not even conform to the most elementary rules of heraldry. Our people have paid pounds to the hawkers, for those, and yet those coats-of-arms are absolutely worthless because history teaches us that very few of our forefathers who came to this country were entitled to have a coat-of-arms. Some were entitled to it, but very few. But practically every Afrikaner has a coat-of-arms in his home to-day, and that is why I welcome the Bill as much as I do, particularly Clause 14 (b) so that we can have finality on the matter, and I shall be grateful if the greatest possible publicity could be given to this matter so that the people will know and realize it, because the word &#x201C;heraldry&#x201D; is more or less foreign to the Afrikaner. If we publicize the fact that a law has now been passed entitling every father of a family in South Africa to register a coat-of-arms at the Bureau of Heraldry, say for instance after all the nephews of a family have met and agreed upon it, it will then be a coat-of-arms of their own creation and they will be proud of it because they themselves have created it and every subsequent generation will be proud of it; the further that generation is removed from the date of its creation, the prouder will that generation be of that coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>There is one point on which I do not agree with the hon. member for Hillbrow. He says that we should just accept the old coat-of-arms which are in many cases completely wrong from a heraldic point of view; we should just accept that orange tree of the United Party instead of the olive tree; the olive tree has now become an orange tree and we should just accept it as such because that has been their coat-of-arms and has become traditional. Mr. Speaker, talking cannot right anything that is wrong. Talking won&#x2019;t make a coat-of-arms right if it is incorrect from a heraldic point of view, neither on the basis of history nor on the basis of logic, nor on the basis of heraldic, and I say that once this Bill is on the Statute Book we should draw a line through everything that is wrong from a heraldic point of view and we should give coats-of-arms to this young Republic of ours, to the coming generations, to our descendants, because our families are proud of them, coats-of-arms which are absolutely right from a heraldic point of view, and we can do so if we get the right people. I want to make this suggestion to the hon. the Minister that he should ask the Government for permission to subject the flags and emblems and coats-of-arm which are to-day used in the Republic of South Africa, to the test of the heraldic rules. I wonder whether our National Flag will stand the test, because it does not conform to those rules. In carrying out this law I should like to see the Government set the example to municipalities and other bodies who also wish to have emblems of flags or anything else registered; it should set the example, and before it goes any further it should subject those emblems that it itself uses to the test of heraldric rules.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>This is a family Bill and we must keep it a domestic one. We welcome this Bill to because through heraldry we have an outward expression of a country&#x2019;s dignity provided that it is not tied up with legal technicalities which only restrict natural human reactions. Now that we are a Republic this Heraldry Bill is necessary too, and if carefully <span class="col_1397-1398" refersTo="page_715"/>drafted and administered it must add to our prestige. This is only possible if we keep it outside Government control or interference. We have an analogy in the administration of this House which frames its own regulations and in which you, Mr. Speaker, are in supreme control without interference from any outside authority. As regards the administration of heraldry we must rather narrow down the authority and not extend it to those who are not qualified. In Great Britain, over hundreds of years, no one has questioned the decision of the heraldry authority there, and so it should be here. No responsibility should devolve on the State and no money should therefore be wasted on appeals. As this House of Parliament is wrapped up in ceremonial procedure and control, outside legal interference, so should all ceremonial regulations be the responsibility of the Heraldry Council in keeping with the tradition of heraldry. The State herald should be allotted a place at all ceremonial functions attended by the State President, so that he will be in evidence before the public, otherwise he may become of no importance whatsoever. Naturally the State President will be the supreme authority; it cannot be otherwise, and I feel that all appointments should be gazetted only through his office, outside the control of Government departments or of the Public Service Commission, in the same way as the administration of this House. The Heraldry Council must be the final authority, and if its decisions become flexible, it is all to the good. It should not be subject to appeal to other unqualified authorities. The Heraldry Council should exercise all authority on all matters of ceremony, and I think it would be of very great benefit in this country to have an authority here that lays down everything that applies to ceremony, to procedure, at functions. This Council should be the authority in that regard. Regional representation in heraldry has been the procedure over the years in other countries, so if we have provincial representation on the Heraldry Council, that will be all to the good, quite regardless, of course, of whether the representatives are domiciled in that particular province, because all applications for heraldry are made in writing. That is the practice in all other countries of the world, so it is not really necessary that a member appointed to represent one of the provinces should actually be domiciled in that particular province. But I think it is all to the good to have provincial representatives on the Council.</p>

<p>Sir, I have not very much more to say. The field has been covered widely by the Minister and other speakers. I feel that perhaps the Minister may reconsider the regulations in this Bill which apply to appeals and give the matter a little more consideration, because the administration of heraldry is, as I have said, almost a domestic affair, and I have no doubt that given the authority, we will have the same dignity associated with our Heraldry Bureau as is associated with this House of Parliament. I myself have always been an admirer of the ceremonial in this House under your control, Mr. Speaker, and I feel that the principal heraldry officer should be the great authority under the control of the State President. I think in developing heraldry in this country we should take advantage of what has been experienced in other countries of the world. I think that we should follow in their tradition and that we should develop something peculair to South Africa and something of which we will always be proud. I think through this particular Bill we will develop a national tradition for heraldry in this country. I very much welcome the Bill. I think it will mean a great deal to us and I appreciate the fact that the Minister has introduced it early in the history of our Republic.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow the arguments and questions of the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker); the hon. the Minister will probably deal with them.</p>

<p>I notice that this Bill has two predecessors. The first is the Patents, Designs, Trade-marks and Copyright Act of 1916 and Act No. 23 of 1935 to which the hon. the Minister referred in his introductory speech. The 1935 Act deals with the registration of names, coats-of-arms, uniforms and emblems of certain institutions and societies. &#x201C;Institutions&#x201D;, of course, means schools, technical colleges, universities, university colleges, training colleges, old-students unions etc. Except that it offered protection to those badges, there was no provision at all to indicate that those badges had to be heraldically correct; there was no provision that they should conform to the heraldic rules. As a matter of fact, in the definition clause of Act 23 of 1935 a &#x201C;badge&#x201D; means&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;any design, applicable to any article whether for the pattern, for the shape or configuration, or for the ornament thereof, or for any two or more of such purposes, and by printing, painting, embroidering, weaving, sewing, modelling, casting, embossing, engraving, staining, or any other means whatever, manual, mechanical, or chemical, separate or combined, not being a design for sculpture.</block>

<p>Not the slightest attempt was made, therefore, to apply the science of heraldry. In the new Bill preference is given to and emphasis placed on the heraldically correctness of a coat-of-arms against registration.</p>

<p>According to the Bill &#x201C;coat-of-arms&#x201D; means&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any object or figure, being a symbolic representation displayed in colours on a shield in conformity with the principles and rules of heraldry, with or without a crown, helmet, mantling, supporters, motto or other accessories.</block>

<p><span class="col_1399-1400" refersTo="page_716"/>The fact that before such a coat-of-arms may be registered it must be correct according to the rules of heraldry, is a tremendous step forward. It can be generally accepted that few coats-of-arms that were registered in terms of the 1935 Act are heraldically correct. As a matter of fact, how many people with a knowledge of heraldry were there who could be approached? Where could you find such people? They simply did not exist. In most cases when a coat-of-arms was designed the people who were approached were those with a taste or a sense of a feeling for art, and as long as the symbolic representation on the coat-of-arms was correct, as long as the form and the arrangement of the colour was correct, they did not worry about anything else.</p>

<p>I am pleased that those coats-of-arms that have already been registered under the Badges Act of 1935 and which have been used for years and which have not only been designed on material but engraved in metal, will be protected although they are not heraldically correct. There I cannot agree with the hon. member for Karas unfortunately. As I interpret the Bill those coats-of-arms are protected under Clause 26 which inserts <i>9bis</i> into the 1935 Act as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All matters bearing on registration in terms of the Protection of Names, Uniforms and Badges Act, 1935, as carried out by any Department prior to the passing of the Heraldry Act 1962, shall be deemed to have been lawfully carried out.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased about that protection and I want to thank the hon. the Minister for it. If any institution or body realizes subsequently that the badge is heraldically incorrect and wishes to change it, I take it that such an institution will be at liberty to do so. It is a well known fact that there are numbers of institutions, particularly primary and secondary schools and probably also training colleges of which the existing badges have never been registered. Those badges have been used for may years, although they are heraldically incorrect. How will this measure affect them? According to Clause 26, which inserts Section 11<i>bis</i> into the 1935 Act, it appears to me that those badges are not covered. It says that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any badge not entered in the register on or before the date of commencement of the Heraldry Act, 1962. Is it possible to meet such institutions in some way or other, even though their badges may not conform to the heraldic rules? I, of course, also regard the position to be that if an institution applies to the Bureau of Heraldry for the registration of a badge which it has used for a long time and which is heraldically incorrect, and that badge is turned down, it means in any case that no other institution can register that badge or the same type of badge, and hence that badge receives protection in any case.</p>

<p>I consequently want to thank the hon. the Minister for the protection that this Bill affords badges and I think in particular of the hundreds of school badges. Sections 6 (1) (2) and (3) of Act 1935 only provided that a person who is or was not a member of a specific institution or association was not entitled to use the name, uniform or badge of such institution without the consent and authority of such specific institution or association. And in the event of a person using such uniform or badge unlawfully, such a person may be sued in the magistrate&#x2019;s court for an amount not exceeding &#x00A3;10 and in addition be ordered to pay the costs of the action. To my mind that fine was too low. It is being increased under this clause. This Bill lays down the damage that may be demanded in case of the misuse of badges and emblems. Any person who wears, misuses, sells, barters or trades with such a badge, may be sued in a court of law for an amount not exceeding R50, and such a court may in addition to the costs of the action, award an amount not exceeding R50 to the complainant. In other words, the amount of the damages to be awarded to the complainant is being increased from &#x00A3;10 as it was in the past to R50, which to my mind affords greater protection to those institutions which have officially registered badges. Institutions such as schools and universities will heartily welcome this protective measure.</p>

<p>Clause 22 also affords additional protection. Apart from the increase in the amount of damages, Clause 22 lays down penalties, as the hon. the Minister has called them, for the misuse of official and municipal coats-of-arms, badges or other emblems. Anybody who, without written permission, sells, barters or uses for gain or trades in such articles shall be guilty of an offence and be punishable. To my mind this Bill embraces this new principle, which does not appear in the old Act, that persons who sell such badges may also get into trouble. Those were the people who could not be brought to book in the past. We had the position, for example, where certain firms sold university colours or school colours, firms which did not have the right to do so, or where a person sold an old blazer to a person who was not entitled to wear it. It lowers the standard of that institution to which that person belongs. In future any person who barters that article, albeit a firm which sells it or a person who sells a uniform with a badge on it to another person or hands it over to another person who is not entitled to wear such uniform or blazer, will be prosecuted. I want to thank the hon. the Minister very much for these measures that are now being taken and which were not included in the old Act.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by giving as an example the numerous cases where Bantu wear the blazers of certain institutions. Those Bantu really do not always know that they are guilty of an offence. The people who sold those badges to those Bantu are really the people who should be punished. We know how <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_717"/>scholars very often mob such a Bantu where he is often innocent, and we are grateful for the protection which is afforded in that persons who sell those uniforms or blazers may in future be prosecuted.</p>

<p>I just want to raise this one small point with the hon. the Minister. The registration fee has not yet been laid down in the Bill. Provision is made that the amount will be prescribed by way of regulation as well as the annual amount payable in order to retain such registration. Formerly the amount payable against registration was &#x00A3;5 and the annual amount payable 10s., to revert to our old monetary system. I want to put forward a plea on behalf of schools and similar institutions that these amounts should not be made too high.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I just want to refer to Clause 24 in connection with annual reports. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State herald shall report annually to the Minister on the activities of the bureau and the council.</block>

<p>I want to make this friendly request that the report should also be laid upon the Table of the House so that persons who are interested may read it, particularly in view of the fact that it is something quite new and everybody would like to see what progress is being made as far as our heraldry is concerned.</p>

I do not know which copy of the Bill he has, but the copy I have is the one which has been amended in the Other Place in accordance with his request, namely, that within 14 days of the date of commencement of a parliamentary sitting the report should be tabled. That amendment has already been made in the Other Place.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation and my gratitude to hon. members for having taken part in a debate on such a highly technical subject, a subject which is foreign to us in the Republic of South Africa and I want to mention the name of the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) and express my appreciation to him for the great trouble he has gone to. He has probably done a great deal of research and put in a great amount of study, which, if it means anything, means that he is interested and I think all of us appreciate that very much. I also think that the House has approached this question which is on innovation correctly, both the Opposition via one of our older members, the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker), <i>inter alia,</i> and the two speakers who spoke from this side of the House. Nothing destructive has been said and I want to place my appreciation on record. I must admit that one is loathe to raise a subject which is indeed foreign. For example, recently I had the privilege, that is to say yesterday, of receiving a book from Mr. C. Pama, an author&#x2019;s copy, in which the whole heraldry of one Rietstop, a Dutchman, has practically been re-written as a standardized work. He did us the great service of taking it very far and he has actually brought to fruition the idea of the hon. member for Hillbrow that we should not only get the French names but that we should get the French, English and Dutch equivalents. I do not think the book is on the market as yet. But I do want to say that although we are a young country in the field of heraldry and are making a start with legislation, we have at our disposal the able services of a few very capable men. The hon. member for Hillbrow has already referred to that and he has mentioned about six of them, but I want to mention the names of Mr. Pama and Dr. Coen-raad Beyers in particular. They are dealing with this matter at the moment. As I have said I want to thank hon. members most heartily and I do not think there is really anything to which I have to reply. I would, however, like to record a few things very briefly. Firstly, I want to deal with the ideas expressed by the hon. member for Hillbrow, ideas which I support fully, namely, that when anything has gone wrong heraldically with a flag or an emblem or badge which makes it heraldically incorrect, it has eventually obtained a heraldic right to exist. I personally do not agree with the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) who wants those defects to be put right. When I served on the Select Committee which dealt with the Constitution under the chairmanship of the Minister of Lands we were given a description, a heraldic description, of our flag. The chief legal adviser read it out to us. It would be worth anybody&#x2019;s while, if he wishes to treat somebody to a good joke, to memorize that and to try to recite it. It was simply incomprehensible and unintelligible. But it is there and if it is incorrect, we have to accept it. Historically it has the right to exist. I am in favour of that and we also provide that it should remain as it is. Once you start tampering and say: &#x201C;The one stripe should be a quarter of an inch shorter than the other one, or a little more blue should be added to the colour or a little less blue, I do not know where we shall end. You will really be on a witch hunt, and surely that is not the intention. The intention is that when something has been accepted, and it is sufficiently pure, it should be left as it is, if there is nothing to prevent that. We do not want to become legal; we merely want to pass legislation to prevent chaos.</p>

<p>The second opinion that has been expressed here is perhaps something that I could put right. The hon. member for Hillbrow, who was supported to a certain extent by the hon. member for Albany, said that heraldry was a matter of prerogative and that politics do not come into it at all. We should remember that prerogatives are in respect of undefined things, rights that have existed throughout the centuries. Most countries do not have heraldic rules either. Those things have simply <span class="col_1403-1404" refersTo="page_718"/>developed, but in a young country such as ours, with all the difficulties that we have here, we throught it advisable to draft legislation on the subject, and where we make provision for appeal to the Minister it is only as far as design is concerned and not in respect of the granting thereof. There may be rules governing the design which make it impossible for the board to approve of it and in that case the right of appeal is provided for in Clause 13.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany has once again asked that the State President should should have sole say. That would make the position somewhat difficult. Nowhere else in the Constitution is there provision for anything like that. The hon. member even wants to exclude the Public Service Commission when it comes to appointments. The State President has to do everything and the Public Service Commission etc. must not be taken into account at all. I want to say this: Certain machinery exists to do these things and I really do not think that it will be the wish of any Minister or anybody else to try to intervene in a highly technical matter such as this. I think we should accept it as it is and I want to assure hon. members that the authorities which we do have (they are not public servants, because I think my officials and I know about equally much about this matter and it is too dangerous for us to try to speak on it with any authority) are of the most capable people available. We have had their services and what is more, a great deal has been said: many designs were submitted and every bit of criticism we had and every idea that was expressed was referred to the Heraldic Societies in England, in Scotland and in Holland, and where corrections were made they were made in consultation with them, because we want to start with the right foot forward, in the right way, without trying to drag in politics or anything else. We want to give real service and I want to say this in regard to the ideas expressed by the hon. member for Hillbrow: Where it may perhaps be impossible to incorporate some of his ideas in the Bill let us rather control the matter by way of regulations and where we notice anything that is not right, legislation can at a later stage be introduced in this House. Then we can say: Look, that is what we have learned under our own steam, and these are the defects that should be put right. I agree with him on many points. I am one of those who will really struggle and plead for it, even if it is by way of regulation for example, that when a grant is made it should be accompanied by some sort of ceremony. We delved into a beautiful piece of our history when Cape Town was granted its coat-of-arms and there will be similar instances. We are far too cold, I agree, and to-day it is being done by way of letter, officially, and I suppose a clerk sometimes writes the letter. We should really make it more of a function and a ceremony. There have been many more wonderful suggestions by hon. members which I can accept, but I am afraid we should not at this stage pin ourselves down by legislation. We as novices who are interested in this, I am one of the novices, should allow ourselves to be guided by those persons who have more knowledge of the subject, let us develop and when we are more mature, when we have become of age, let us then be as proud as that old College of Arms and others are of what we have brought into existence in the year 1962. Once again I thank hon. members for their suggestions. I am tempted to say that we should regard their suggestions as suggestions are regarded in the budget debate where the promise is made that every suggestion will receive attention. I do not discard one of them except that one suggestion of the hon. member for Karas. All suggestions will receive attention and we shall introduce whatever may appear to be necessary by way of regulation.</p>
